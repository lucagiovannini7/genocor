MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings have resumed.  

Are the appearances as before?  Prosecution?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution appearance has not changed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Good morning, Madam President, good morning Your Honours.  The composition of the Defence is the same as yesterday 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Witness, the Trial Chamber reminds you that you made an oath to tell the truth and you should continue bearing that oath in mind.

Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS CNAK,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday when we left we were trying to sort out the matter of the hour at which the alleged meeting at Marianne's occurred.  And we saw that in your first statement of 18th January 2000 you stated that it had started at six and finished at ten at night, and that while you testified in 2004, on 4th and 5th March, in the Bizimungu, et al. case, you dare stated that it happened between -- before midday up to 3:30 when you left for prayers.  

And what I want to ask you now is:  Did you provide an explanation as to why your statement was recording that the meeting had happened between six and ten? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Where, Counsel?  Where would he have made the explanation?  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	In the Bicam -- during your testimony in Bicamumpaka did you provide an explanation as to why your statement was recording that the meeting happened between six and ten? 
A.	Are you asking me to answer the question?  Is it me you're putting the question?  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Your question is very long, Counsel.  You asked me why there is a disparity or inconsistency between the various times that I gave.  Could you please repeat your question?  
Q.	I will try to refresh -- 
A.	In a more concise manner. 
Q.	I will try to refresh your memory.  And I will refer to the transcript of 5th March 2004, on page 18, lines 21 and following.  

Question:  "In the statement" -- we are referring here to your statement of 2000.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, I'm sorry to interrupt.  We are in open session.  Is that okay with you?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Absolutely, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Witness, we are in open session and be careful not to mention -- to give information that may identify you.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So the question was:  In the statement -- or rather, in your testimony, or in part of this statement before you, you spoke of a meeting that began at 6 p.m. and was completed by 10 p.m. 

Answer:  "Here, it's possible that the person who recorded was -- recorded this was mistaken because I'm not a confused person to say that the meeting started at 6 p.m. and then I went for prayers later on.  I said it started at twelve and later on I went for my prayers and came back.  

"I think the person got mistaken because I stated that after 6 p.m. there was entertainment at that house.  But in actual fact, the meeting started around midday.  It's not me who said that the meeting started at 6 p.m. and finished at 10 p.m.  This is a lie against me, either from you or from this record."

Question:  "You have stated that the muezzin made the call for prayer.  At what time did this call for prayer take place?  You are a Muslim, you should know."

Answer:  "I am a Muslim.  We pray -- we Muslims pray five times per day.  The first time is at 5 a.m., that is the first prayer.  The second one is at midday, half past midday.  I'm talking about Rwanda time.  The third one, which is the one I mentioned, is at 3:30, that is in late afternoon.  The fourth one is at 6 p.m.  The fifth one is at 7:30 at night."

So it if it is written in the statement of 2000 that the meeting occurred between six and ten, it is solely on the fault of the person who recorded your statement.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	I thank you.  What you have just read out is correct.  During my testimony I corrected the mistake that had been made by the person who had recorded my statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, before you pose your next question, we wanted to remind you that you gave us some copies of these transcripts yesterday, but we gave them away to facilitate the work of the interpreters.  We need fresh copies for the French-speaking Judge, as well as the English-speaking Judges.  

We also need for you to refer to the pages which you are reading so that we can follow the proceedings properly.  So could you kindly provide us with copies of these transcripts.  And in future, if you are to refer to transcripts, we would appreciate it if you could give us copies in advance, both in French and English.

And that goes for the Prosecution as well.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
This is just a procedural matter.  We would like to advise WVSS as to the time when they should bring the next witness.  Should it be, probably, after lunch?  Or before lunch?  I would like to know.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, unfortunately the witness is in court.  

Counsel, how much longer do you think you need to go on?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I think it will be safe to have the witness for after lunch.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  We'll discuss this matter further before the 11 o'clock break.  For now we will go with that.

Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Unfortunately, Your Honour, I came earlier this morning to try to print those extra copies of transcripts, but due to technical problems, I was not able to do so.  Therefore, we will have to -- there should be seven copies spread out in this courtroom.  I hope we can manage with this.  I will read from it very slowly for the rest.  Again, there was a misunderstanding yesterday because I tried to have these copies ready, actually during the morning session, and it seems that it was not possible to do that.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
If you have copies, our Chamber staff could assist us with copies.  We need one English copy and one French copy for each of the transcripts.  We already have one copy of two transcripts in English, but we don't have any French transcripts, and one of us doesn't have both English transcripts.

So if you could give a copy to our staff, they could facilitate us with a copy -- with copies before; otherwise, 11 o'clock is far away.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I have one -- I've given everything I had.  And what is in my possession right now is a heavily marked copy of the English version.  I don't -- if we can take a short break, I can go print that immediately, if that is absolutely necessary.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We will proceed, but make sure that that is in place before we resume the proceedings after the break.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I will, Your Honour.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May I assist my learned friend?  We have one copy, an extra copy in English of the transcript of the 4th of March 2004 and that of the 5th of March 2004.  We would like to submit this.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecution.  And French, any copies, Prosecution?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
We don't have French, Your Honour.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Your Honour, I just remembered that I also have a French copy for the 5th of March and an extra English copy for the 4th of March which I had printed earlier and that I am no longer using.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, both counsel.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the French booth does not have a French copy and they are re-interpreting what is already on record.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I just want to tell the Trial Chamber that at the Defence we have a photocopier that 50 people use and that photocopier hardly ever works.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Defence counsel. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Interpreters, yesterday we gave a copy of our French transcripts for your use.  Unless it is misplaced or unless we are mistaken, you should have that copy.  Actually two copies.

Interpreters?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French interpreters do not have the French copies, they have English copies. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Arrangements will be made by the Defence to facilitate the interpreters to acquire a copy at the morning break.  In the meantime, counsel will read very slowly so that the interpreters and the recorders can follow.  

Yes, proceed, Counsel. 

Yes, Defence Counsel, we note that this delay is attributable to you.  So when you are organising your work, you take that into account.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Please accept my apologies, Madam President.  It will not happen again, I can assure you.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, so in your testimony in Bicamumpaka you provided -- well, you put the blame on the person who had recorded your statement.  And immediately after that testimony, you gave a statement on 10th March 2004 and in that statement you corrected things and you said this -- I'm in the second paragraph of the statement of 11th March 2004.  

"The meeting started before noon, around 1100 hours, and ended around 0400 hours, p.m.  I personally attended this meeting right from the beginning, but left 20 or 30 minutes before its end."  Do you adopt that statement today?  
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  Yes, I confirm that.  But let me add that when I went for prayers, it is Colonel Aloys Simba who was speaking.  I am trying to say that when I went for prayers, the meeting was continuing.  Furthermore after Simba spoke, other persons, like the director of ELECTROGAZ and the new sous-préfet, also spoke.  So when I went for prayers, the meeting had not yet ended.  The meeting was going on and the speakers were addressing the crowd.
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, could you draw that curtain properly on this side of the witness so that the witness is not seen from the public.

Yes, Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, on the date of the statement, if my learned friend can look closely once more -- unless he has another statement that we don't have -- we have the 10th of March and the LiveNote is showing 11 March.  For the purposes of the record, if you can correct that, Your Honours.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I beg to differ.  On the English version I have, just above the signature of the witness the date is the 11th of March 2004.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Maybe, Counsel, you could clarify that the date of the interview was 10th, but that the witness signed the statement on the 11th.  That would put matters in perspective.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember having an interview with Mr. Didace Nyirinkwaya on 10th March 2004 where you provided the hours where the meeting at Marianne's occurred, and signing that statement the day after, on 11th March 2004?  Can you confirm that?  
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  I did not give a statement when I was in Nyanza, and I do not know this person called Didace. 
Q.	The statement we are talking about was given here in Arusha five days after you had testified in Bicamumpaka, in a safe house.  There was never mention of Nyanza or other places like that.  It was here in Arusha.  You met that person on 10th March 2004 and you signed your statement on 11th March 2004.  Yes or no?  
A.	I thank you.  You asked me a question concerning the Bicamumpaka case.  When I came to Arusha, I came to testify in the matter of Aloys Simba. 
Q.	Are you telling this Court that after you testified in Bicamumpaka, you also testified in this Tribunal against Aloys Simba?  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	Yes.  I gave a statement in the matter of Bicamumpaka for joint criminal enterprise.  And subsequently, I also talked about Aloys Simba. 
Q.	So the question is simple.  The Court is just asking you to confirm that you gave an interview on 10th March 2004, a few days after you testified in Bicamumpaka, here in a safe house in Arusha, and that following that interview, the following day, you signed that statements.  This is a very simple question.  I'm not talking about your testimony in Bicamumpaka or your prior statement.  Just focus on the statement of 11th March 2004.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreter would like to request the President to tell Defence counsel to proceed slowly.  They are having difficulty interpreting to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Defence Counsel, you are rather fast for the interpreters.  If you could slow down a bit so that they can properly interpret your questions to the witness.  
And this question is actually put by the Defence and not by the Court, as you have stated in your question.

Witness, have you understood the question?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Could you give an answer, please?  Did you make a statement on the 10th of March 2004 and sign it the following day, on the 11th of March 2004, to the investigators of this Tribunal?  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, Madam President.  In 2004 I was indeed in Arusha to give testimony, and I also signed a statement while I was in Arusha.  I do not recall if I signed the statement the day after.  But I confirm that while I was in Arusha I gave a statement to the investigators of this Tribunal. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	And do you remember that in that statement you said that the meeting started before noon, at eleven, and ended around four?  Yes or no.  Simple question.  
A.	I thank you.  With regard to my testimony in the Simba case, there was a slight difference between my two testimonies.  What I was -- what I said in the Simba case was not that he had prepared a meeting, I said that he had taken part in military training.  You should, therefore, see that there is a difference between chairing a meeting and preparing a meeting.  I did not say he chaired a meeting.  I said he took part in military training.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, listen carefully to the questions which are put to you by counsel and try to answer them as best as you can.  If you have not understood a question put to you, you can ask for it to be repeated.  That will make the trial progress with your testimony.  The question put to you by counsel was different.  

Counsel, could you put back your question to the witness?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, I am reading from your statement.  Just say if you remember saying that.  I quote --
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
And, Counsel, you should state which statement.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The statement of 11th March 2004, second paragraph, second line.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	"The meeting started before noon, around 1100 hours, and ended around 1600 hours.  I personally attended this meeting right from the beginning, but left 20 or 30 minutes before its end."  Just yes or no.  Do you remember saying that to the investigator? 
A.	Yes, I said that. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, in 2008, on 12th November 2008, at motel ********************, before investigators Djibo Moumouni and André Delvaux, you stated the following:  "With regard" -- I'm in the second paragraph.  "With regard to my initial statement, I would like to make some corrections and add some information which I have remembered.  In fact, I have made two statements to the investigators of the ICTR.  I also testified in the case of Jérôme Bicamumpaka.  As to my statement regarding the meeting that was held at Marianne's house, I would like to point out that I cannot remember the time that meeting was held."  

Do you remember saying that to the investigators of the Prosecutor approximately one year ago, in November 2008? 
A.	I remember that.  Indeed, I gave a statement when I was in the ******* located in ***********.  I confirm it.  Do you want me to make comments on what you have just said?  
Q.	It will not be necessary.  Yesterday you testified, and your fading memory of 2008 came back.  At precisely ten after three you fell back on your prior statements and you mentioned that, indeed, the meeting occurred between 11 and 3:30.  So is it your testimony today that this meeting happened between 11 and 3:30?  Yes or no.  
A.	Yes, I confirm that the meeting took place during the time lapse that you just mentioned. 
Q.	Now I want to talk about the persons who attended that meeting.  You said yesterday -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, we are in open session, so be careful.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I will, Your Honour.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	You said yesterday -- and so did you in your 2008 statement -- that there were about 15 people in Marianne's living room.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	In fact, in your statement of 2008, November 2008, page 4, sixth line, you said the following:  "We were about 15 people in the living room.  I was standing in the living room."  You confirm that?  Yes or no.  
A.	I confirm it. 
Q.	And you stood there for the whole meeting?  Yes or no.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Madam President, there was some interruption and the French booth didn't hear fully what counsel said. 
THE WITNESS: 
No. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, could you repeat your question?
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	For the whole time where you were present at that meeting, you were standing in the living room?  Yes or no.  
A.	Yes, I was standing.  
Q.	Now I will list the persons present and you can confirm to me whether they were there or not.  There was Marianne, which you stated was presiding of the MRND for Ruhango sub-préfecture.  Yes or no, she was present? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Nathan Mugaga, M-U-G-A-G-A, the bourgmestre of Tambwe.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	***********, a deputy? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Grégoire, a judge? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	The new sub-préfet of Ruhango?  I said sub-préfet, the new sub-préfet for Ruhango, not the préfet.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the French booth requests counsel to slow down because they are not following everything he's saying. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, the French booth is complaining that you are racing away and he can't catch up with you.  So please slow down.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I will try to adopt a rhythm which will allow the French booth to catch up with me, Your Honour.  And I apologise again.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, Kinyarwanda booth has the same problems, I've been asked to tell you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  The Kinyarwanda booth has a similar problem.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
So the same comments can be adopted.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	You stated also that the new sub-préfet of Ruhango was present.  Yes or no.  
A.	Yes, he was there. 
Q.	And for the first time in your statement of 2008 you stated that the director of the ELECTROGAZ station in Ruhango was present.  You confirm that? 
A.	I confirm it.  The director of ELECTROGAZ in Ruhango was present. 
Q.	Do you confirm that you mention that that man was present for the first time in your statement of 2008?  Do you confirm that as well? 
A.	I do not quite remember. 
Q.	So let's go through your statements then.  In 2000, in the second paragraph, here are the people you list as being present on that meeting:  Callixte Nzabonimana, first line; ******* ***********, second line; Colonel Simba, second line; Nathan Mugaga, third line; Marianne, fourth line.

And you stop there.  You said they were surrounded by members of the JDR.  So no mention of the director of the ELECTROGAZ station in Ruhango.  Is it a mistake from the person who took your statement?  Did you actually tell him that the director of the ELECTROGAZ station was there? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  I am saying that those persons met in the courtyard of the hotel called Umuco plaza and that later on they headed for the ELECTROGAZ station, and that it was at that location that Simba met them.  I confirm that the director of ELECTROGAZ and Aloys Simba were not there at the beginning.  

It is, therefore, clear that the director of ELECTROGAZ participated in the meeting which took place in Marianne's home.  In all my statements I said that the director of ELECTROGAZ and the sous-préfet took the floor, even though I was not there.  I thank you. 
Q.	Things are not as clear as you seem to think, Mr. Witness.  The question was simply:  Why didn't you mention in your 2000 statement that the director of ELECTROGAZ station was there?  This was the question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, from our reading of the statement, that list which you have read appears to refer to the meeting at the ***** *******.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
So let me continue in the statement.  Still in the second paragraph.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	"These people I just listed, they had gone to Marianne's house and held a meeting which started around 6 p.m. and ended around 10 p.m."  Nowhere in your 2000 statement, Mr. Witness, do you mention the director of ELECTROGAZ.  Nowhere.  

Let me take now your 2004 statement where you also endeavoured to list the people who were present.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, My Lords, since Counsel is going strictly by the -- by the record, may I request him to be candid with the witness and read the first line where it says, "among others".  That should not be omitted if he's trying to get to the truth.  It's very clear that before the list of people, the witness has said he had come to Ruhango together with, "among others".  

So please, so that we do not flog a dead horse, if counsel can be more candid about that, I think we'll get to the truth faster.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Defence Counsel, we had also taken note of this matter and were about to comment about it.  So maybe you can take that into account as you phrase the questions that follow.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Let's go to your 2004 statement, Witness.  You list people there and say the following persons were present.  I'm at the second paragraph.  And you stated, "The local leaders were:  Marianne, Nathan Mugaga, ***********, and Grégoire."  Again, you do not state there that the director of ELECTROGAZ is present.  Can you explain that to the Court? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  The people you have just mentioned are those who received the dignitaries who came from Kigali.  They welcomed them in the courtroom of Hôtel Umuco plaza.  They left that hotel to go to the ELECTROGAZ station in Ruhango.  That means that the director of ELECTROGAZ in Ruhango waited for them at the station.  After welcoming them at the station the group headed for Marianne's home.  

It is, therefore, clear that the director of ELECTROGAZ could not be at Hôtel Umuco plaza, given that he was waiting for them at the ELECTROGAZ station in Ruhango. 
Q.	In fact, if we refer to your 2008 statement, on 12th November 2008, and I'm at the eighth line.  Here's what you stated:  "When the meeting started, if I'm not mistaken, the speeches were made in the following order:  First Marianne, then Bicamumpaka, Callixte Nzabonimana, ******* ***********, Nathan Mugaga, the bourgmestre, Aloys Simba, and the director of the ELECTROGAZ station in Ruhango."

So in 2008 you actually state that this man made a speech during Marianne's meeting; for the first time, I repeat.  So why did you mention the director of ELECTROGAZ making a speech for the first time in 2008?  Why did you add that man to those you are accusing? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  If I added the director of ELECTROGAZ to the -- those who spoke, it is because the person who informed me of what happened after my departure, that is, when I left for prayers, told me that that person spoke.  As you know, as concerns crimes of genocide, once you have information, additional information, you are compelled to give it.  That is the reason I said that the director of ELECTROGAZ also took the floor. 
Q.	So we have now six persons, and you mentioned, also, the seventh person would be Mr. Nzabonimana.  You mentioned Jérôme Bicamumpaka, you mentioned Dominic Makeri, you mentioned Colonel Simba.  Those are the national leaders which you referred to, those four persons; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, can I ask you to repeat the names of the people you said I stated were national officials or authorities at national level?  
Q.	Nzabonimana, Bicamumpaka, Makeri, Simba.  
A.	I thank you.  You should also add the member of parliament, ***********.  These officials came from Kigali and they were authorities at national level.  But I do not know whether Dominic Makeri had or held any position at national level.  
Q.	So we have now ten persons; yourself, that's 11; your room-mate -- don't mention his name here -- that's 12.  You also mention one Sumayire Kagenza being present.  Was he inside the living room with you?  
A.	No, I did not see him inside the room. 
Q.	Did you see him there at all? 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	And you also mention a certain Aphodis.  Was he inside the living room with you?  
A.	I also saw Aphodis there.  But do I not remember whether he was with us in the room or whether he was outside.  However, I confirm that on that day I saw Sumayire and Aphodis. 
Q.	So we have so far identified 12 people that were in the living room with you on that date.  Do you remember the names of the three others we are missing? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  When I gave the figure of 15 people, that was an estimate.  
Q.	I would now like to ask you a few questions about who spoke.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, the recorders appear to have a problem with the spelling of the name of Aphodis.  If you could assist us with the spelling.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
What I have is A-P-H-O-D-I-S. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  And you may continue.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Let's now talk about the speakers during that meeting.  I will start with your statement of 18th January 2000.  You said the following, at third paragraph:  "Marianne introduced the visitors.  About 15 of them had come for the meeting.  She said she had called in the higher authorities so that they could advise on the issues of the day."
How long did Marianne speak for? 
A.	I thank you.  I have already told you I was not wearing a watch.  What I know, however, is -- what I am sure of is that he (sic) welcomed the visitors and she made a short statement. 
Q.	Five minutes, ten minutes? 
A.	Excuse me.  I'm sorry, Counsel.  I crave your indulgence.  I was not wearing a watch.  I would not like to venture into giving an approximate time.  That may cause me to say something which is not true. 
Q.	We would not want that to happen, Mr. Witness.  So anyway, you said that she made a short introduction and then, in your January 2000 statement, you said this:  "She then gave the floor to Bicamumpaka who said," brackets, "'The war we are going through concerns all Hutus wherever they come from.  If a Hutu does not join hands with the other Hutus to fight the Tutsis, then he is like those fighting us.  He is not different from those Inyenzi attacking us from Uganda.  By "Inyenzi" we mean the Rwandan Patriotic Front Inkotanyi soldiers fighting the government.'  He said he was going to give the floor to others."  How long did he speak for? 
A.	My answer remains the same.  I do not know how long she spoke.  I didn't know that some day I would be asked a question on how long the speech lasted.  I told you that I was not wearing a watch and that I would not like to take the risk of giving an approximate time.  I do not want to run the risk of saying something which is not true. 
Q.	Ten minutes, 15 minutes, half an hour? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	I continue in the third paragraph of your statement of January 2000.  "Then Callixte Nzabonimana addressed the audience, saying, basically, that the raging war was not of the MRND, nor of the MDR, nor of any other party in particular, but was generally a Hutu war and so those who were going to take part in the attacks should not wear their own party colours, but, rather, banana leaves or other leaves, especially Umucaca leaves."  U-M-U-C-A-C-A.  How long did Nzabonimana speak for? 
A.	My answer remains the same.  I do not know how long the speech lasted.   
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, in light of the answer of the witness in this regard, we suggest that you take into account his evidence and formulate your questions accordingly.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Then in your 2000 statement you mentioned the fourth speaker was Parliamentarian ***********, which you said in your statement is the following:  "He said" -- I'm at the fourth paragraph.  "He said, 'Ruhango people were complaining that the Ruhango sous-préfet was an RPF accomplice, shielding the Tutsis from the killers.'  Adding, 'That is why we found you a sous-préfet who is going to work along the same ideological lines as ours and yours, and who is going to do everything you ask him to do.'  He introduced the new sous-préfet to the audience and said he would be introduced later to the rest of the population, adding that the incumbent sous-préfet had been relieved of his duties.  His name was Placide Koloni.  He was killed much later.  When he heard about this dismissal he fled from Ruhango."  
Again, you don't know how long he spoke for?  
A.	No. 
Q.	The following speaker, in your 2000 statement, that is, is Bourgmestre Nathan Mugaga.  According to you he said -- he thanked the visitors for their commitment and for addressing the complaints of the Ruhango people, adding, "As bourgmestre, as early as tomorrow morning, I will go and tell the Hutu youths and their able-bodied older peers that our sole objective is to fight the Tutsi, wherever they are.  We should fight the enemy who is not only the Tutsi, but also any Hutu opposing our government.

"I will also tell the people that Placide Koloni has been relieved of his duties, and that spells victory for us."

Again, you don't know how long he spoke for? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, move on because you're likely to get the same answer all over again.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	These people, what we've summarised here, this is in essence what they said.  Do you have anything to add about what they said during their speeches? 
A.	Counsel, you have been very kind with me and what you have read out corresponds to the speech which they made -- the speeches which they made. 
Q.	I note that we took five minutes to go through these speeches.

And then you stated in your 2000 statement, you said the following:  "Then the audience applauded.  At that point the muezzin made the prayer call and I had to leave while the bourgmestre was still making his speech."  Do you maintain that, Mr. Witness? 
A.	You are mistaken.  When I left it was not the bourgmestre who was speaking. 
Q.	I'm reading from your statement of 2000, Mr. Witness.  Quote, "Then the audience applauded.  At that point the muezzin made the prayer call and I had to leave while the bourgmestre was still making his speech."  That is not correct?  
A.	No.  I made a correction to that statement.  When I went for prayers it is Colonel Simba who was speaking. 
Q.	Yes, you made that correction in your 2004 statement.  I will not go through the list of speakers.  In 2000 you stopped at Mugaga.  In 2004 you go one step further.  And I will just read this paragraph.  Page 4, second page of the statement, first paragraph, "Colonel Simba spoke later.  He supported what the others had said by promising that he would be nearby and would help with materials and military forces when needed.  I left the meeting before Simba completed his speech to pray in the mosque.  I returned around 30 minutes later but the meeting was finished."  So that is your statement now? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreters would remind counsel -- would like you to remind counsel to slow down because the interpreters do not have that statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, the interpreters are complaining about your speed again.  They don't have that statement, so read slowly, please.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	"Colonel Simba spoke later.  He supported what the others had said by promising that he would be nearby and would help with materials and military forces when needed.  

"I left the meeting before Simba completed his speech to pray in the mosque.  I returned around 30 minutes later but the meeting was finished."  

That bit about Simba, you added it in 2004; is that correct? 
A.	Did you ask me a question?  
Q.	Before your statement of March 2004 you never stated that you left while Simba was speaking.  In fact, you didn't even mention that he spoke.  
A.	I lengthily explained that amongst the authorities present in Ruhango there was Simba, and that when I went for prayers, Simba was the one speaking.  

Let me explain to you how meetings are conducted in our place.  When a meeting is about to end, miscellaneous matters are discussed and people can drink and eat.  So the meeting is only over when the people leave the meeting venue.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, the witness has explained that when he left it was when the bourgmestre was speaking and that he made a correction and that when he went for prayers it was Colonel Simba who was speaking.  And the Chamber has taken note of this.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	In 2008, in your third statement, you go one little step further and here's what you say:  "When the meeting started" -- I'm on the seventh line.  "If I'm not mistaken, the speeches were made in the following order:  First, Marianne, then Bicamumpaka, Callixte Nzabonimana, ******* ***********, Nathan Mugaga, the bourgmestre, Aloys Simba."  And now you're adding the director of the ELECTROGAZ station in Ruhango.  You mentioned him, as we just saw, for the first time in your 2008 statement.  How do you explain that? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, this has been asked and answered.  Could you move on please.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I'm not satisfied with the explanations of the witness, Your Honour, but I can move on nevertheless.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  If you are not satisfied, there's nothing we can do about that.  You can comment on this at a later stage.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So if we summarise your testimony about this meeting at Marianne -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
This is the second summary, if I'm not wrong, about that meeting, so I don't know --
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Can I conclude without interruption?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No, no, I'm just saying that this summary about the meeting has already been dealt with.  He has already given him the summary of the meeting.  And the witness said, "I thank you very much."  That is what was said.  So I do not see how helpful this will be, if he repeats it for the fourth time.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Can I ask the question, Your Honour, before we get objections? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, taking into account the previous answers of the witness, Counsel.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Somewhere in April you ended up in a living room at Marianne's place with, more or less, 15 persons with, coincidentally, three accused from this Tribunal, Bicamumpaka, Nzabonimana, and Simba.  And just a few statements about all of these people.  Marianne, do you know her family name, that Marianne you keep speaking about?  
A.	I do not remember her other name. 
Q.	About Marianne, you stated in your 2000 statement that she was the sister of the then prime minister of Rwanda, Mr. Pierre Céleste Rwigema.  You maintain that? 
A.	I thank you.  I said she was not his sister.  Pierre Céleste Rwigema grew up in Marianne's house.  But someone told me that in French somebody who has grown up in a family can be considered a child of the family, but that is not the case in Rwanda.  Even if you grew up in a family, you are not a family member.  I explained that already. 
Q.	There was a member of parliament, ***********.  Do you know his first name?  
A.	I know he has two names.  I am Muslim.  I know he is Christian, but I know he was called ******* ***********.  I do not know which one is the Christian name and which one is his family name.  I don't know.
Q.	It's ***********, ******************** (sic), for the spelling.

You mentioned Grégoire, the judge.  Do you know what his family name is? 
A.	No.  He was called president of the canton tribunal. 
Q.	You mentioned Bicamumpaka.  Do you know what his occupation was at the time? 
A.	I knew him as the chairperson of the MDR party.  But I did not know whether he was a minister or not.  But I knew he was the chairperson of the MDR. 
Q.	A national chairperson, a préfectoral chairperson?  What was he the chairman of?  
A.	If I am not mistaken, he was the chairperson of that party at national level. 
Q.	If I were to tell you that he was the minister of foreign affairs, would that surprise you? 
A.	Thank you for that information.  I knew that he was a minister, but I do not know what ministry he was minister of. 
Q.	Nzabonimana, did you know what his occupation was at the time? 
A.	I knew Nzabonimana in his capacity as minister of youth affairs under Habyarimana.  But I do not know whether he continued occupying the same functions or duties in the interim government. 
Q.	The new sub-préfet of Ruhango, do you know his name? 
A.	I do not remember his name. 
Q.	Is the name ***************************  *****************************, familiar? 
A.	That name reminds me of my 2004 testimony in the Bicamumpaka -- of the case of Jérôme Bicamumpaka. 
Q.	Could you state again what the -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Microphone, Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I apologise. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Can you state again what the actual functions of Marianne in the MRND party were? 
A.	She was MRND chairperson in the Ruhango sub-préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, Ruhango sub-préfecture is merely an administrative position under the préfet of Gitarama.  There was absolutely no MRND cell at the level of the sub-préfecture.  What do you have to say to that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, could you please repeat your question. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	The Ruhango sub-préfecture, or sub-préfet, was merely an administrative position under the préfet of Gitarama.  There was absolutely no MRND cell or organisation at the level of the sub-préfecture.  What do you have to say to that?  
A.	I know that Marianne occupied a position in the MRND hierarchy.  Since I belonged to no political party, I was not a politician, maybe I did not have that information.  But I believe that your client, who was a politician, who was a minister, has more information than myself on that matter. 
Q.	And the poor director of ELECTROGAZ station which you added in 2008, do you know what his name is? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, what do you mean "poor director"?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Well, he had escaped up to 2008 being mentioned and he appeared for the first time in 2008.  So that's why I added the qualificator of "the poor director of ELECTROGAZ station".
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, this is not the time for comments.  You can have your say when the time comes.  But right now you should put questions to the witness without any embellishments.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	The director of ELECTROGAZ station, what was his name? 
A.	I did not know his name.  All I can say is that he was the director of ELECTROGAZ.  And I can also say that these authorities went to the ELECTROGAZ station.  And I think that if I indicate his position, that should be sufficient.  He was the service head of ELECTROGAZ. 
Q.	But, Witness, it is you who stated that Marianne introduced everyone, yet you don't know neither their names nor their functions?  How is it so? 
A.	Marianne introduced the guests who had come from elsewhere.  She did not introduce members of the audience who lived there. 
Q.	That's what I'm saying.  You don't know what Bicamumpaka was doing, you don't know if Nzabonimana was a minister, you don't know the name of the new sub-préfet who everybody introduced, according to your testimony; you don't know the name of the director of ELECTROGAZ, a man from ***********.  How could you have forgotten all these names and occupations if Marianne indeed introduced them? 
A.	I thank you.  Counsel, you seem to forget that when those meetings were being held, this was a time of war.  We paid attention when the ministers would be coming together to talk about the development of the country.  But these authorities were preparing for killings.  So, Counsel, forgive me if I am not in a position to give you the names of these other persons.  
Q.	Dominic Makeri, do you know this man?  
A.	I know Dominic Makeri. 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Janice Dickman)

1030H 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you know what his job was? 
A.	I have said that I know that Makeri was a journalist.  That is all I know about Dominique Makeri. 
Q.	Do you know an organisation called Amnesty International? 
A.  	Counsel, I only understand Kinyarwanda and Kiswahili.  What does Amnesty International stand for in Kinyarwanda or Kiswahili or how is it said in Kinyarwanda or Kiswahili? 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I am afraid I am not in a position to say it in Kinyarwanda.  There is no equivalent in Kinyarwanda.  I am surprised.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, put your question to the witness.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
So I asked him if he knew what Amnesty International was.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you can answer by yes or no. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Madam President.  I have heard of that organisation called Amnesty International, but I do not know what it does. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	And have you heard of another organisation called Reporter sans Frontières? 
A.	All these organisations are being talked about, but I do not know what they do. 
Q.	In the case of Makeri, Mr. Witness, what they did is, starting from 2004, and repeatedly, thereafter, they called on the Rwandan government to release Dominique Makeri because he had been held for more than 12 years without trial.  Have you ever heard that? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  
Q.	You participated in Gacaca in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you accuse Makeri there? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are in open session. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Mr. Makeri doesn't mind his name being mentioned at all.  I can assure you about that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, can we go into a short closed session.  We regret, members of the public, you have to leave at this point in time because the matters we are going to address may involve the identity of the witness who is a protected witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 21 to 22] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)   
(Pages 19 to 20 by Sheriffo Jammeh)



































MR. MATEMANGA:
We are in open session now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are back in open session.  The public may come into this session to listen to the proceedings, so you need to be careful about giving information that may identify your identity.

Counsel, you need to be equally careful.  

Yes, continue, Counsel.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, the meeting at Marianne's, which you alleged, it's denied by Bicamumpaka, by Makeri, who testified in Bicamumpaka in open court and explained that it never happened, by ************, by ***********.  All these individuals are saying this meeting never happened.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  The testimony I am giving before this Court emanates from me.  I am testifying to events I witnessed.  The people you have just mentioned testified to events concerning them.  What they said concerns only them and does not in any way concern me. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, it does concern you because you are the one making that allegation in which they are all involved and they all deny -- they all say that this is pure fabrication.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  If the persons in question say that the meeting did not take place it is because they are co-perpetrators.  If I, myself, had participated in a joint criminal enterprise together with them, I will deny the holding of that -- I will deny the fact that that meeting took place. 
Q.	And I may add that to their denials that it is actually impossible to have in the same room in April 1994, ************, who was appointed as the sous-préfet on 20th April 1994, and Bicamumpaka, 
the foreign affairs minister, who left the country on 21st April 1994, and that is confirmed by his diplomatic passport.  So how do you explain that you maintain your allegation in the face of these impossibilities? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  I have the impression that you want to insinuate that I have the same objective as that of the national officials or authorities.  I am simply confirming that they are responsible for the genocide of the Tutsis in Ruhango. 
Q.	During your testimony on 5th March 2004, you stated this, page 10 --  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In which case, Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I am referring to the transcripts of Bicamumpaka, of 5th March 2004.  

Question:  "On that occasion, at that meeting, did you have an opportunity to meet with the new sous-préfet?  You have stated that you did not know his name.  He was the one who had replaced the former sous-préfet, Placide Koloni."  

Answer:  "I was nobody to meet the new sous-préfet.  I was not representing any authority or any -- at any level in order for me to meet the new sous-préfet.  We should agree on this."
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you remember saying this? 
A.	I agree with you, Counsel.  I did not have the opportunity and I could not meet the new sous-préfet. 
Q.	Yet you maintain before this Tribunal that you are standing for four-hours-and-half with two ministers, the youth minister, the foreign affairs minister, one deputy, one judge, one sous-préfet, 
one bourgmestre, one colonel, and you leave during a speech.  That's your testimony. 
A.	That is, indeed, my testimony.  When I left the meeting, it was Aloys Simba who was on the floor speaking. 
Q.	Did they ask you what time -- at what time you would return?
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No.  Wrongly translated. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	The question was:  Did they ask you, one of these 15 people in that small living room, at what time you would return? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  They could not ask me at what time I would return to the meeting, especially as they did not ask me the time when I arrived.  I left the meeting in the same circumstances as those when I came in.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honours, I am through with the Marianne's meeting and I have to prepare copies during the pause for the transcripts.  With your leave, I would request that we take the morning break now and maybe that we extend by five or 10 minutes to allow me to prepare these copies and make sure that I find a functioning printer.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are taking the morning break and you may leave now after the curtains have been drawn.  

Counsel, after the witness has left, we would like to discuss a small matter with you.  

Registry, kindly draw the curtains to enable the witness to leave.  
(Witness exited courtroom)   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we would like to receive indications from you as to how far you have gone with this cross-examination.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We have vacated the topic of the meeting at Marianne's.  There are now two more meetings, but I can reassure you that they will not take as much time to cover.  

I will not -- I will definitely need more time than the morning session.  I can undertake not to go beyond the afternoon break, but in all honesty, I would be very surprised to be needing much time after lunch.  But, again, the witness is sometimes difficult to get answers from and I cannot expect what his answers will be with regards to certain areas.  So, therefore, I would request maybe to be provided with one hour after the lunch break.  That I can certainly commit not to exceed that limit.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we are of the view if you re-examine your questions and avoid being repetitive, there is no reason you shouldn't finish by lunch hour.  And we urge you strongly to take into account of the witness's answers before you pose your next questions because that will save us a lot of time.  If a witness has already answered the question, you could avoid repeating the same question.  

We will now adjourn these proceedings to 11:30 to enable you to reorganise yourself -- 11:30 this morning.
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1135H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, sorry, that we are slightly late.  We had a matter to resolve.  The proceedings are resumed and we are in open session.  

Counsel, is that okay? 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we continuing in open session, so be careful about the evidence you give.  The public is allowed to attend this session. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Before we continue I have copies here -- more copies of the French and English.  If the registry could assist.  I have prepared copies of the 4th March 2004 in French.  I have prepared an extra French copy of the 4th March 2004, which was missing.  I think, and at the request of the translation booth, 
I prepared two copies of both the French and English transcripts to be distributed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Counsel.  

BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, just two short questions on the meeting at Marianne's.  I would like to know from you, the mosque where you went to pray -- where you left the meeting to go to pray, how far is it from the house of Marianne? 
A.	The mosque is not far from Marianne's house, but as I have already said, I would not venture into giving you the distance in metres.  In any case, the mosque is not far from Marianne's house. 
Q.	Can you confirm that it is actually possible from the mosque to see what is happening in 
Marianne's house? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, in your 18th January 2000 statement, you stated that following the meeting at Marianne's, you stated as follows -- I will read from your statement and it is on page 4, the second page of your statement, the one before the last paragraph.  

"Several people were killed in Ruhango.  They had been assembled and led to specific places, including the commune office.  Others were killed in their houses or elsewhere, with the exception of a Hutu, Mutabazi, chairman of the Parti Social Démocrate, who was handed over to the killers by ***********, to serve as an example because he was considered a bad Hutu.  I think all the victims were Tutsis.  Among them were men and women, old and young, and infants."  

During your testimony yesterday you gave more precisions on the killing of Mutabazi and you stated as follows:  

"Are you able to inform the Trial Chamber of any particular or specific instance of people who were killed at the roadblocks, Witness?"   

"I can cite one case, the case of a Hutu who was killed at the ERP roadblock, because this person had not wanted to collaborate with the other Hutus in the massacres of Tutsis.  This person was called Mutabazi, nicknamed, Rwamudanga, R-W-A-M-U-D-A-N-G-A, and he was a member of the PSD party."  

Further question:  "Witness, how did you come to know of the death of Mutabazi?"  

Answer:  "I am a native of ***********.  It was easy to know about someone's death.  Furthermore, the killers themselves talked about it without anyone having asked them."  

So I would like to know who was it that reported the death of Mutabazi to you?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  As I already stated yesterday, after killing people, the killers did not hide what they did.  In fact, they were even boasting about it.  It is, therefore, in those circumstances that I learnt of the circumstances of Mutabazi's death and the reasons for which he was killed.  I was even able to find out who had handed him over to the killers. 
Q.	So they told you after the fact -- after it had happened? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How long after did they tell you? 
A.	That was a long time ago, Counsel.  Yesterday you asked me a question on the holding of a meeting and I told you that I heard about it when I was in my bedroom.  I, therefore, would like to tell you that as concerns the death of Mutabazi, Rwamudanga, I learnt of the death -- or, rather, I was informed of the death by some of the people who had killed him, but I cannot specify who exactly -- or, exactly, the period when I heard of his death.  

You are asking me difficult questions.  In fact, questions which are like a trap regarding ours.  You did the same thing  yesterday.  You asked me yesterday when a certain meeting took place.  And I told you that I heard about the meeting in the bedroom, together with my colleague.  Rwamudanga was killed.  He is not the only one who was killed.  Many people were killed during the genocide of the Tutsis in Ruhango. 
Q.	So, is it your room-mate who told you that this man had been killed? 
A.	Counsel, I have told you that it is the killers themselves who gave that information.  My friend was living with me.  He was a killer.  I must point out that, but he was nevertheless my friend and we lived in the same house. 
Q.	But your testimony is that you, yourself, were not present when he was killed.  
A.	I was not present. 
Q.	I will now read what you said in Bicamumpaka about that killing.  On the 5th March 2004, at page 3, and I am starting at line 25.  The question was --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the French booth would like to have the reference in French, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, could you give the reference in French for their -- and assist the French booth.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I gave away everything I printed out.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You don't have a copy of the French transcript with you?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Not at hand with me, but it would be at the beginning because if I am at page 3 in the English transcript, then it should be easy to locate.  It starts with:  "Do you remember of any Tutsi -- Hutu member of the public being killed during that period?"  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
French booth, have you found your way to the transcript?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
And then, "I remember we took out Mutabazi, who was nicknamed Rwamudanga."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, apparently, the French booth has located the passage referred to.  Thank you.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Q.	So your answer:  

"I remember a Hutu called Mutabazi, who was nicknamed Rwamudanga, and he was a member of the PSD party and he did not support the ideology of those other parties and he was given as an example.  He was pointed out and he was killed and he was brought by Deputy ***********.  He was killed in a public place in a field."  

Question:  "At which field -- where was Mutabazi killed?"  

Answer:  "This is a field between the ERP petrol station, towards the commune of" -- "former" -- "towards the commune of the office of commune Tambwe.  He was shot publicly here by Interahamwe and the police."  

Question:  "Did you witness this killing of Mutabazi yourself?"  

Answer:  "Yes, indeed, I saw this with my own eyes."  

"Was it done in the morning or afternoon hours, the killing of Mutabazi?"  

"It was early in the morning.  This was around 9 a.m. towards 10 a.m., that's the time he was killed."  

"When was Mutabazi buried?"  

"I did not follow about his burial because sometimes they would gather many corpses and then they would go and throw them away."  

And if I could go further down that page to the question:  

"Do you know the names of the persons who killed Mutabazi?"  

"A few of them because there were many people, but I can remember about two, three, four, five of them among those who killed him."  

"Please, name them."  

"The first -- the most prominent is the one who brought Mutabazi, who is ***********, *******.  He was a member of parliament.  He brought him to the communal police -- the communal Tambwe policeman (sic) and these were standing in front of Bourgmestre Mugaga.  There was a policeman called Karara.  He was the head of the communal police and there was another policeman called Rurangwe.  There was another one called Kadhafi.  There was an Interahamwe called Michelin, and many other members of the population that I do not recall.  But these are the most important ones, the ones that 	were more involved in his killing.  But it should be understood that he was shot by this one person, but all these were standing there looking on." 

"Who was the person who shot him?"  

"He was shot by one policeman called Rurangwa."  

	So how you do you explain, Witness, that you've just stated that you were not a witness and that this killing was reported to you by others and that you could not provide the names of the killers, but that in 2004, in Bicamumpaka, you provided the Court with lengthy details about how this killing had happened? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Yesterday I said that all said and done, I am a human being, and that if my statement of 2004 was read back to me and if I notice errors in it, I will request that they be corrected.  You have the fortune of reading my statement in English.  Now that you have just read to me what I said in 2004, I must confirm that what you just read is what I said and it corresponds to the reality. 
Q.	I wasn't there, Mr. Witness.  You are providing two contradicting statements as to the event.  It's you who must provide your connection; not me.  So what is it? 
A.	I asked you to forgive me.  That was a long time ago and I didn't have a record of my statement.  That is why I told you that before asking me a question on what I said -- first of all, read to me the statement so that if there are errors, the errors can be corrected. 
Q.	I am asking the question for the last time.  I read to you the statement of yesterday and the statement of 2004.  Why do they differ?  Why do you state in one instance that you see it with your own eyes and why yesterday you were saying you were no longer on the scene and it was reported to you by others?  Simple question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you understand the question?  
THE WITNESS:
Could you please kindly repeat the question?  

Before answering, the Prosecutor stood up and I stopped.  I didn't want to answer while the Prosecutor was on his feet.  So, Counsel for the Defence, can you kindly repeat your question?  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	In 2004, you state that you are on the scene when Mutabazi was killed and you provide vivid details about how it happened.  Yesterday you say you are not there and you cannot provide precise details because the few information you have was reported to you by others.  

I am asking you to explain how you can make two starkingly (sic) different statements about the same incident.  
A.	I did not receive the Kinyarwanda translation.  I will request the Kinyarwanda booth interpreter to please repeat the question -- to repeat Defence Counsel's question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Kinyarwanda booth, do you recall the question?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Can you confirm that it was not put to the witness?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently, no, the interpreter says he is not very sure he remembers the question exactly.  He doesn't know whether his microphone was on or not. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, just repeat the question so that we can gain time.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you.  

Interpreter, can you please repeat the Defence counsel's question?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Do I have to state the question again?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, the interpreter's can't recall the question exactly. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Your headset is working, the Prosecutor is seated -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you please put the question. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you explain to the Court how it is that in 2004 when you testified in Bicamumpaka you stated that you were present at the scene where Mutabazi was killed and you provided vivid details about how it happened, and that yesterday and today when you talked about that event you say that it was reported to you, that the little information you have, was reported to you by others?  Can you explain that? 
A.	Since yesterday, Counsel, I requested that my statements -- my previous statements be read to me.  I'm not a computer.  I cannot remember all that I said.  Today I had forgotten that I have information on Mutabazi's death.  The Court had asked me to be brief always.  

Now, when you asked me questions, you rely on my previous statements which I have not read, but which you have before you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, move on.  We have noted the witness's answer.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you know a man called Ali Munyanziza, the son of Papias Nqamije and Concessa Nyirabagirishya? 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I will spell that.  P-A-P-I-A-S.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel take the spelling slowly, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I know the person in question. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Ali Munyanziza, A-L -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, slow down.  The interpreters need to catch up with you.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Ali Munyanziza, A-L-I, M-U-N-Y-A-N-Z-I-Z-A; Papias, P-A-P-I-A-S; Nqamije, N-Q-A-M-I-J-E; Concessa, C-O-N -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Once more, the French booth would like counsel to slow down.  Counsel is looking at the spelling before him and the interpreters do not have this.  So they don't have the same advantage.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you've heard the comments of the interpreters.  Slow down.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Papias, P-A-P-I-A-S; Nqamije, N-Q-A-M-I-J-E; Concessa, C-O-N-C-E-S-S-A; Nyirabagirishya, N-Y-I-R-A-B-G-E-R -- sorry, I-R-I-S-H-Y-A. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So you know that man? 
A.	Yes, I know Ali Munyanziza. 
Q.	And you will agree with me that that man was responsible for handling the funerals of Muslims in ***********; correct? 
A.	Madam President, before giving any answer concerning Ali Munyanziza, I would kindly request you to order a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we will request the public to leave at this stage of the proceedings as the matters we are going to discuss may identify the witness, who is a protected witness.  We regret, please.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 33 to 35] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 23 to 32 by Sheriffo Jammeh)

























MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will deal with that matter shortly.  

Interpreters, we didn't get the interpretation of the response to our greeting to the witness.  At least, it wasn't interpreted in English.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we didn't get the answer in the English booth, either.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Kinyarwanda interpreters.  

Is there a problem of communication?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth: 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, thank you.  We are in closed session.  

Witness -- 

We are in open session.  

Witness, we would like to give you -- maybe he should be sworn first before we can give him the information.  

Registry, can you swear the witness, please.  
(Declaration made by Witness CNAI in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we would like to remind you to switch off your microphone when you have finished speaking, because if you leave it on and there is another microphone open, it interrupts the reception of the Court proceedings.  

We would now like to give you information on how these proceedings will be conducted.  Questions to elicit your evidence will be put to you by the Prosecution, which is seated on your right hand.  The Defence will ask you questions as well, when the Prosecution has finished asking you questions, and they are seated on your left hand.  The Judges may also pose questions to you to clarify a few matters.  Listen carefully to the question and answer it as briefly as you can.  And if you have not understood the question, you can ask for it to be repeated.  

We are confident that if you follow these simple instructions, we will quickly come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you.  And if you have any questions or any problem, don't hesitate to ask the Trial Chamber to intervene.  

Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA:
If registry can assist to put the PIS before the witness, Your Honours.  And I would request for a Kinyarwanda interpreter to go through the PIS with the witness, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, could a Kinyarwanda interpreter come down to the witness booth to assist the witness with his personal identification sheet.  Thank you.  

Prosecution, we don't appear to have any document yet.  
MS. MAPOSA:
What document, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The documents relating to the witness.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Your Honours, I have the spelling list.  And if the registry can, in the meantime, assist to distribute the spelling list, Your Honours.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness confirms that all the information on his personal identification sheet is accurate.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, and registry, please assist in drawing back the curtains so that the witness is -- yes, thank you.  

Thank you, Interpreter.  
Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, there is an alteration that we made to the PIS, and we are requesting that if the witness can kindly countersign that alteration on the PIS.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But it has already been put to him?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  

Witness, could you kindly countersign the alteration on the -- where you see it.  Can you read your protected information sheet?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can read.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Kindly put -- sorry.  Kindly countersign that area where you see the alteration.  
THE WITNESS:
I would need a pen.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, we would request that the PIS of the witness be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit P. 10.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No objection, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The PIS is admitted as Prosecution Exhibit number 10, under seal, because it contains the personal particulars of this witness.  
(Exhibit No. P. 10 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  

We are in open session, Counsel.  

WITNESS CNAI,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are in open session.  Is that okay?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Madam President.  It's okay.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are in open session and the public is in attendance, so be careful not to mention particulars that may identify you. 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, have you understood?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood well, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, then.  

Prosecution, you may proceed.  Sorry to interrupt, but we had to be sure.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, did you know a man called Callixte Nzabonimana before 1994?  
A.	I knew him. 
Q.	How did you know Callixte Nzabonimana, Witness?  
A.	I knew Callixte Nzabonimana as someone who was born in my region or area.  That is where he went to primary school.  And after primary school he went to secondary school.  Later on he was appointed minister.  I also knew him because I was a member of the MRND party and he was the person at the head of our party in our area.  I was also a member of the ****** of the ************* commune.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  After the death of the president in 1994, Witness, did you ever see Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana?  
A.	I saw him. 
Q.	Where did you see Mr. Nzabonimana, Witness?  
A.	I saw him at Cyayi, in Cyayi cellule, near the ***************** communal office.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Cyayi is number 24, Your Honours, on the spelling list.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, when the president died in 1994, did you stay at your home until the end of the genocide?  
A.	On the 13th of April 1994 we were attacked, our house was destroyed, and we were forced to go to seek refuge at the communal office. 
Q.	Who was in your company?  
A.	I left my house alone.  My brother -- my brothers and my wife hid in the bushes and I arrived at the communal office alone.  
Q.	So when you saw Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana at Cyayi, where were you staying?  
A.	I was in a drinking spot or bar belonging to one *********** ***********.  
MS. MAPOSA:
That's number 33, Your Honours, ***********, ***********.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Yes, but, Witness, where were you staying at that moment?  
A.	I left that drinking spot and I was in front of the drinking spot when I saw Callixte near a vehicle in the company of one ***********, ******.  ***********, I******.  May I proceed, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes, Witness -- 
A.	******** ******* knew me and he called for me.  I went towards them to the location where he was having a discussion with Minister Callixte.  He then told me to listen attentively to what the minister was going to say.  So I paid attention to what the minister said.  This is what Callixte said:  "I know that Hutus do not heed instructions.  Do not continue to eat the cows of Tutsi who have sought refuge at the communal office.  What really matters is not the cows; it is, rather, the owners of the cows that matter."  

Then one Vincent Ngarambe arrived in a vehicle.  He stopped his car behind Callixte's vehicle.  He alighted from his vehicle, and I was still standing next to Kamali, Isaac, when Vincent Ngarambe came towards us.  Once again Callixte repeated that we should not eat the cows because what really mattered was for us to kill the Tutsi who were owners of the cows.  One Nyagatare also heard what the minister had said, and then stated that we had felt -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you are rather fast and long.  Break your narration because it is being interpreted in various languages.  Your narration is also being recorded by the recorders as well as all the parties.  So you need to have a pause between the narration to enable interpretation to be done smoothly and for those who want to record your testimony to do so without a problem.  So please break your narration and slow down, and wait for questions from counsel.  
And, Counsel, you should prompt the witness to answer the questions so that it's not one long narration.  
MS. MAPOSA:
I'm obliged, Madam President.  

Kamali is number 22; Ngarambe, Vincent, is number 26; Nyagatare, number 28 on the spelling list. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, and there's also one outstanding matter which we would like to have clarified by the witness.  He said that on 13th April 1994 they were attacked and their house -- their house was destroyed.  Who were attacked?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, I would request that you answer my questions.  You wait for questions first.  
A.	It is the Tutsis who were attacked.  
Q.	Why were you attacked, Witness?  
A.	At that time, all Tutsis were under attack.  And because I was Tutsi, I was also attacked.  
Q.	And after the attack where did you go, Witness?  
A.	After the attack I sought refuge at the communal office.  
Q.	What is the name of that communal office, Witness?  
A.	It was the ************** communal office, the communal office of ************** commune.  
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber, when you arrived at the communal office what date was it?  
A.	I arrived at the communal office on the 13th at about 7 a.m.  I spent the day and the night at that location, until the 14th.  
Q.	Witness, on arrival at the communal office, did you find any people there or you were just by yourself?  
A.	I found other persons there.  Tutsis from my area had begun to leave their homes on the 12th, and they had gone to seek refuge at the communal office.  
Q.	Witness, are you in a position to tell the Trial Chamber approximately how many people were at the communal office when you arrived on the 13th of April?  
A.	I am not able to give you an exact figure of the number of persons who were at the communal office, but my approximation would be that there was between 100 and 150 people. 
Q.	Now, Witness, other than Tutsis from your area, were there any other people from other areas who were at the communal office?  
A.	Yes, there were Tutsis from various secteurs of the commune as well.  
Q.	Are you able to name the secteurs, Witness, to the Trial Chamber?  
A.	I will start with Gitovu secteur, then there were also people from Mugunga secteur, from Kavumu, Kiyumba, and from part of Rukaragata secteur. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Your Honours:  Gitovu, number 38; Mugunga, number 39; Kiyumba, number 20; and Kavumu, number 23; Rukaragata, number 42, Your Honours, on the spelling list.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we are approaching the afternoon break.  You could organise your work to help -- to let us have that break as soon as possible. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Your Honours, I would suggest, if we can break now, I would suggest it is the appropriate stage.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we will take the afternoon break, and we will resume at 20 past 4, 20 past 4 this afternoon.  
(Court recessed at 1600H) 
(Pages 57 to 63 by Kirstin McLean)

























(Court resumed at 1621H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

Prosecution Counsel, you may continue. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, you have told the Court that you met Callixte Nzabonimana at Cyayi.  Can you tell the Court the date you met him at Cyayi? 
A.	It was the 14th of April 1994. 
Q.	And can you explain to the Trial Chamber, what is Cyayi? 
A.	Cyayi was a cellule at that time.  And it is in Cyayi that the commune office of ************** commune was built. 
Q.	And can you also explain the exact place that you met Mr. Nzabonimana on the 14th of April 1994 in Cyayi cellule? 
A.	I saw him in front of the bar -- in front of the bar on the road, the road that goes from the 
	commune office to the Remera shops.  It is on that -- it is that same road that links **************** to Gitarama préfecture, or to the main Gitarama road.  
Q.	Witness, is it your evidence that the place where you met Callixte Nzabonimana, it's a business centre? 
A.	No, it is rather a place where there is a bar very near the commune office. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Who was in the company of Mr. Nzabonimana when you saw him on the 
	14th of April 1994? 
A.	In his vehicle he was accompanied by gendarmes who had the rank of lieutenant.  There was another gendarme who had the rank of corporal.  There was also the driver who drove the vehicle.  So there were four of them in the vehicle. 
Q.	And, Witness, was Mr. Nzabonimana in possession of anything when you saw him on this day in question? 
A.	He was sitting in the vehicle and had -- had on his lap a gun. 
Q.	Yes.  Witness, you've told the Court that one Munyagatare heard what the minister stated.  Do you know the name of this Mugutare (sic)?  
A.	It was thought Mugutare (sic) -- it is rather Munyagatare, Evariste.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Munyagatare spelt as follows: M-U-N-Y-A-G-A-T-A-R-E, Evariste.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Now, when the minister spoke to you and the other people who were there that you should not just eat the cows, but deal with the owners, approximately how many people were around within hearing distance of the minister? 
A.	There was a group of people, whose number I do not know.  In the group there were young people who had come out of curiosity to see the vehicle.  There were also adults, including myself, Kamali, Ngarambe and Munyagatare.  

Moreover, it was at that moment that Munyagatare spoke to Minister Callixte in the following words:  "You are asking people to go and kill Tutsis.  But you should each not shoot at us because I see that you are armed with a gun."  

The lieutenant, whom I referred to previously, almost got out of the vehicle threatening to shoot at the person who had just spoken.  Ngarambe and myself -- rather, we pushed Ngarambe down the slope from the road.  I then followed him and took him to the drinking spot -- took him into 
********** *********** drinking spot. 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Can you just hold on.  

Witness, whom did you push down the slope? 
A.	Munyagatare is one I pushed down the slope.  He had just said to Callixte -- he had just said the following to Callixte:  "You have a firearm.  Why don't you just go on and shoot at us."  Then I noticed that the lieutenant was about to come out of the vehicle and shoot at him.  Ngarambe and myself pushed him down slope -- down the slope away from the road.  But I went on holding his hand and forced him into ********** *********** drinking spot or bar.  

Then the minister called Ngarambe by his name and said the following to him:  "Please, come back.  We must go to Remera together."  The minister told him that they were going to Remera where the shops were located in order to finish off what they had started. 
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness.  Do you know the ethnicity of Munyagatare, Evariste? 
A.	I know that Munyagatare, Evariste was Tutsi.  I know him. 
Q.	And, Witness, can you tell the Court what time was it when all this was happening at Cyayi centre? 
A.	I was not wearing a wristwatch, but I can reckon that it happened between 4 and 5 p.m., late in the afternoon. 
Q.	From Cyayi, Witness, did you see the direction that the minister took? 
A.	He went towards Remera, as Kamali's car was driving in front of his.  Kamali, Ngarambe and Vincent were together in a VW-type vehicle, Volkswagen.  Now, as for Callixte, he left in the company of the gendarmes who were escorting him. 
Q.	Now, Witness, after this incident, what did you do yourself? 
A.	I remained at that location, that is, in the drinking spot or bar.  ********** *********** was standing at a spot not far away from the bar and was looking at us.  He said the following to me:  "Now that the minister has brought us weapons, we are going to attack you at night."  

Upon hearing that, I asked him to host me in his home, but he refused to do so.  I turned towards the communal office, and I told my fellow Tutsis that ********** ***********, had just told me that we were going to be attacked.  I also told them -- and I was speaking particularly to the people who were sleeping on the verandah, I told them to look for a hiding place because our safety and security was no longer guaranteed.  I told them that we were going to be killed.  I don't know if I should proceed. 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Can you wait for my question.

Witness, after informing your Tutsi colleagues at the communal office about the impending attack, did you return to the bar again on that same day? 
A.	Yes.  At around 8 p.m. I returned to the bar.  Then I called for ********** *********** and asked him whether he sold any cigarettes.  His bar -- or, in his bar I found many people.  And that was before he answered my question.  The hall was full of people.  And those people pushed me to the back of the hall attempting to attack me, so I ran back to the communal office.  But I never returned to that bar again. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, Witness, what happened at the communal office on the 14th of April 1994? 
A.	On the 14th of April at 3 a.m. we came under attack, and we were attacked by several assailants.  They used grenades in attacking us.  Some refugees died.  Others were wounded. 
Q.	What time did the attack start, Witness? 
A.	The attack started at 3 a.m. in the morning. 
Q.	And who were the attackers? 
A.	There were very many attackers, and it is not easy for me to provide you with the names.  Furthermore, the attack occurred at night, but there was moonlight, enough for one to recognise somebody at a distance, because it was bright enough.  I was behind other refugees and I'm not able to give you the names of all the attackers.  

However, I was able to recognise some of the attackers who were behind.  And I was able to make my way through that group of attackers as I left my hiding place, so I was able to recognise among that group of attackers one Claver Kanyamibwa.  He was protecting his cows -- his cow.  I also recognised Kayiranga and Ndakaza, Médal .  I saw Mathieu, nicknamed Ndabarasa.  I saw Alexi, Alexi Ndayisaba, and other attackers.  

Further on, I saw Ngarambe who was carrying a machete.  I saw Zihuramye Cyprien.  I saw Thomas Habiyambere.  I saw Kizito, whose family name or whose surname I no longer remember.  
Then I was frightened, and lagging somewhat behind, I was able to hide in a cassava farm belonging to one Vianney, Vianney Kageruke.  
Then in the morning Karuganda came to the communal office and I returned to the communal office. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours.  There are quite a number of names that the witness has mentioned.  Most of them are not on our spelling list.  I would kindly ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist with the spelling of these names. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The following names were jotted by the Kinyarwanda booth:  Kanyamibwa, K-A-N-Y-A-M-I-B-W-A; Kayiranga, K-A-Y-I-R-A-N-G-A; Ndakaza, N-D-A-K-A-Z-A; Ndabarasa, N-D-A-B-A-R-A-S-A; Ndayisaba, N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-A; Ngarambe, N-G-A-R-A-M-B-E; Zihuramye, Z-I-H-U-R-A-M-Y-E; Habiyambere, H-A-B-I-Y-A-M-B-E-R-E; Kizito, K-I-Z-I-T-O; and finally, Kageruke, K-A-G-E-R-U-K-E.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Thank you, Kinyarwanda interpreter. 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, what was the ethnicity of the attackers who attacked the communal office on the day in question? 
A.	They were Hutu. 
Q.	And can you tell the Court where you were hiding during the attack? 
A.	I was hiding in the carpentry workshop belonging to an association known as Agemeki, an association of carpenters.
There were planks in that carpenters' workshop and I used them to hide.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  What is the name of the association which owned the carpentry workshop?  
MS. MAPOSA:
The witness has said Agemeki. 
THE WITNESS:
Agemeki. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is the Kinyarwanda booth in a position to assist with the spelling?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we believe that the spelling is A-G-E-M-E-K-I -- A-J-E-M-E-K-I (sic). 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  You may continue. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, you told the Court that some people died during this attack.  Were you able to identify any of the people who were killed during that attack, Witness? 
A.	I was not able to recognise all those who had died because the dead bodies were scattered here and there, some in the inner court of the -- in the inner courtyard of the commune.  Others had been killed as they attempted to flee through the banana plantation located behind the communal office.  Some also went to the back of the communal office, through those buildings that were in the back, and they too were killed.  Others were killed in the courtyard of the commune itself.  It is that last group that I went by, that is, the group of those who were killed within the courtyard.  

Now when wounded persons were being taken away under the false pretext to treat them, I was able to escape and seek refuge in Kabuye secteur.  But before I left, I was able to recognise one old lady whose first name was Leocadie.  I also recognised one Cansilde -- or, rather -- and another man whose name was Bayibayi.  And among the dead I also recognised one lady whose name was Nyirabahima.  Those were the names of the dead bodies that I saw with my own eyes, and because I noticed that things were getting offhand, I decided to flee.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, thank you, Your Honours.  If the Kinyarwanda translator can assist with the spellings. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The names mentioned by the witness include Kabuye secteur, K-A-B-U-Y-E for Kabuye.  Leocadie, a lady whose name was L-E-O-C-A-D-I-E.  Cansilde, C-A-N-S-I-L-D-E.  Bayibayi, B-A-Y-I-B-A-Y-I.  Nyirabahima, N-Y-I-R-A-B-A-H-I-M-A.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, what weapons did the attackers use to attack the refugees at the communal office? 
A.	The attackers used grenades, machetes and guns, the guns that were used by communal policemen.

1700H 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Do you know where the attackers got these weapons, Witness? 
A.	Going by what ********** *********** told you, that now the minister has come, then they must have been in possession of weapons.  And my conclusions would be that it is the minister who distributed those weapons, particularly when it comes to firearms. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, you have told the Court that you know Callixte Nzabonimana, and that you even knew him before the genocide.  Are you able to tell the Court how Callixte Nzabonimana was regarded by the community of ************** commune? 
A.	Callixte Nsabonimana was considered by the population, including myself, as an influential and respected person.  When a minister comes to a commune, the people respect him and give him all due honour because the people believe that the minister is their representative at higher levels.  And as you know, he held a high office since he was minister and a native of Ndiza.  He was the only minister from that area.  And so we looked up to him as a very influential person. 
Q.	Witness, stemming from what we have said, would you know whether Minister Callixte Nzabonimana did anything to prevent the attack at the commune office? 
A.	He did not do anything rather, he is the one who ordered the attackers to kill the Tutsis who had sought refuge at the communal office.  If the minister had wanted to save the refugees, he would not have made the type of statements he made in public.  He made those statements in full daylight.  And I want to confirm that he did not do anything to stop the attack rather, he said that the Inkotanyi had shot at him.  He actually wanted to show us his wounds but he did not.  And to this day I do not know why he had something against the Tutsi and the Inkotanyi. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, I have some few issues that I want to address in a 
	closed session, and I am therefore requesting for a closed session at this stage, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, registry, can we go into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages70 to 75] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
