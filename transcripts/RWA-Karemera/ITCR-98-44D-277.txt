P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed. 

And could we have the appearances for the parties, for the record, starting with the Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance for the Prosecutor is as before. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
The bench for the Defence is composed of the same persons as yesterday.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, before the witness is brought in, the Trial Chamber has a matter to bring to the attention of the parties.  

It was brought to the attention of the Trial Chamber that yesterday afternoon as the proceedings were being adjourned, lead counsel for the Defence approached the desk of Chambers' legal officers and made remarks that could amount to intimidation.  That happened as a direct consequence of earlier events that prompted the Chamber to caution the Defence about its inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour.  The Chamber regrets that the Defence counsel failed to be appreciative of that word of caution.  

While the Chamber will soon advise the Defence of its further action, it wants to make it clear that improper acts directed at Chambers' legal officers shall be construed as improper acts directed at the Chamber.  That is the observation of the Trial Chamber.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I wish to make a clarification, by your leave.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel, go ahead.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well.  

Yesterday, unilaterally, the Chamber accused me of having made racist utterances.  I do not accept that accusation which was made in public within the framework of allegations made as to statements.  The Chamber has taken it upon itself to relay the same before persons from outside the Tribunal without having taken caution of asking, prior to that, what was the situation of the Defence team.  

I will not accept that I be treated here as a racist.  I am defending an African.  I have already defended another Rwandan official before this Tribunal.  I am in Africa, and I have been here for many years and I have been a lawyer for more than 20 years.  I have defended people of all colours, of all origins and of all religions.  

I, myself, consider that I am guided by the principle of humanity, equality between peoples, races and human beings.  And insofar as the Trial Chamber is attributing to me utterances of racial connotation, let me repeat those words, this would seem to me inadmissible and I cannot accept them.  

This morning, for the second time around, the Chamber, without having, as it ought to have done, listened to me, I am being accused of having intimidated an employee who, I imagine, is, indeed, working for the Chamber, and that he -- or, she seems to be -- being the relay to you and I do not understand why this is so of an attitude which may bring prejudice to the lawyers of the Defence team of Callixte Nzabonimana.  Would there be any difficulty with the Defence counsel or with the 
legal assistants?  

I, therefore, find this procedure unacceptable and I would say very strongly, Madam President, that the Chamber, within the framework of debate or discussion, be responsible for having matters relayed to it systematically of utterances or conduct or even explanations that are frank, as is appropriate for women and men, regarding the conduct or behaviour of others, which are immediately retransmitted, distorted, such that, discontinued what we saw happening this morning the address of a successive series of warnings.  

I am totally unable to accept that, neither for the Accused nor the lawyers who are working with me.  We are extremely alarmed by this situation and I am indicating to the Chamber that I am quite ready to seize with it, the Chamber, in the presence of the Prosecutor and other interested parties to have a discussion, which would enable us all not to remain within the unilateral situation which we are finding ourselves in presently.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Defence Counsel.  

As the Trial Chamber noted yesterday, the Trial Chamber will be actively -- will remain actively seized of this matter and will act on it.  And taking your suggestions into account, it will act in accordance with the rules and applicable regulations of professional conduct.  

May we now have the witness brought in.  

Yes, Registry, before the witness is brought in.  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Madam President, yesterday the Chamber asked the registry to see whether it would be possible to distort the voice of the witness so I am going to read to you the written report, which has been provided by the communications unit of the Tribunal.  

"The audio system in existing courtrooms does not allow us to provide distorted signals to the 
public gallery and not distorted in the Trial Chamber.  The only solution is to simply cut the audio output to the press and the public gallery."  

This is the written report from the communications unit, Madam President.  So it is not possible for the voice of the witness to be distorted.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Registry, for that information.  
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Trial Chamber would like to remind you of the solemn declaration which you made at the beginning of your testimony.  Bear it in mind as you continue to testify.  

Registry, could you now arrange for us to go into closed session for the continuation of the testimony of the witness.  

We would like to request the public to leave at this point.  We regret.  This is a protected witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 45] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 3 by Sheriffo Jammeh)


(Court resumed at 1215H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Trial Chamber would like to remind you of the oath you made to tell the truth -- the truth and you will continue to tell the truth on that oath.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

Defence Counsel.
WITNESS T9,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Good day again to you, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good day, Counsel.  
Q.	We apologise for the interruption in your testimony.

When you left off last time, you testified -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I realise that we are in open session.  I am about to ask questions which may identify the witness, so I would respectfully request for a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, would you arrange for a closed session, please?  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 39 to 45] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 38 by Judith Kapatamoyo)






(Court resumed at 1445H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness.  Good afternoon, everyone.  We apologise for the delay.  

The proceedings are resumed.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I notice that we are in open session.  So may the witness be warned about her identity? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, do you want to proceed in open session?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I think I could. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Witness, we are now in open session, which the public is allowed to attend.  Be careful not to give any names of people or places, which may identify you.  And if you have any difficulty answering the question and you think that your answer might give your identity away, do not hesitate to alert the Chamber.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Now, can you tell the Court, when you fled to Congo you settled at a place called Banda, B-A-N-D-A  That is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Maybe I did not properly pronounce the name of that area, but I know that there was a school there. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, at that school, when did you see Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	We spent over two weeks at that place in the company of Callixte Nzabonimana. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But my question was, after you got there, when did you next see 
	Callixte Nzabonimana, which date? 
A.	He came to meet us at that place a few days after we got there.  But I cannot remember the date on which he came. 
Q.	But, Witness, you had a diary where you wrote everything, why didn't you write it down? 
A.	I could not do it. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court, did you -- had you lost your diary at that time?  Is it because you had lost 
	your diary, that's why you did not write down this important date? 
A.	I still kept my diary, but I did not note that event. 
Q.	Witness, in October 2009, you met with the representatives of the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana, is that not correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you recorded that meeting in your diary, is that correct? 
A.	I did not note it down. 
Q.	So you do not know on what date exactly, madam, when the Defence came to you in October 2009, do you? 
A.	I do not remember the date.  I only remember the month. 
Q.	Now, during that interview, on the 14th day of October 2009, did you tell the Defence that you had a diary that you kept between the 6th of April 1994, up until you were in Congo in July 1994? 
A.	I did not mention it because they didn't ask me any question about the diary. 
Q.	Witness, do you still keep a diary today?  Is this part of your habit?  Is it your habit that you have to keep a diary? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, if you remember, did you or did you not enter into your diary, your arrival in Bukavu? 
A.	I entered it. 
Q.	Is it not the case, Witness, that you stayed in Bukavu for two weeks? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Maybe there should be more precision.  I don't want to say more, but the question should be phrased in a more precise manner and in justice to the witness. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, I want to ignore that interruption.  I do not think it is warranted nor do I think I should respond to it at this point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, and perhaps the parties should avoid having these exchanges in front of the witness.  

Just a moment.  
THE WITNESS:
I got to *********** on the 14th and I went to ************** on the 20th.  So I spent between six and 
seven days in ************  So it was not two weeks. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Counsel, before you continue.  

Defence Counsel, we consider that the question was clear enough.  In any case, the witness understood and answered it.  So we will move on.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, in Bukavu, did you see a lady by the name of Mechtilde Mugiraneza? 
A.	I do not know a lady whose name is Mechtilde Mugiraneza. 
Q.	And do you know ******************************** 
A.	No. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And, Counsel, the recorders are having difficulty with the spelling, if you could kindly assist.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
The spelling of ************************ is M-A -- M-U, sorry *****************************************.  And Mugiraneza, M-U-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, and first name?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
********************************.  ****************************************  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, isn't it not the case that you are hearing of this name for the first time today? 
A.	It is the first time that I am hearing that name.  Unfortunately, I knew other girls or women called ****************** in my native commune. 
Q.	Witness, only in **************** you did not meet such a person, did you? 
A.	I did not see that person there. 
Q.	Witness, when you arrived in ******* did Béata Nzabonimana meet with other ladies, wives of ministers in ************** 
A.	I did not see her meet other wives of ministers in *************** 
Q.	Witness, during your stay in **********, do you remember whether there was any lady who prepared meals with Béata Nzabonimana? 
A.	I do not remember anymore. 
Q.	Witness, do you remember in ******* that one minister by the name of Mbangura -- I will spell it.  I think it's spelt M-B-A-N-G-U-R-A.  Do you remember a certain minister by the name of Mbangura who came to find out about the welfare of the persons who had left the French embassy?  
A.	I do not remember anymore. 
Q.	What about your diary, did you enter in your diary anything about what happened to Béata and her family in Bukavu? 
A.	I did not enter any such thing. 
Q.	About *************, Witness, what did you enter in your diary? 
A.	In my diary, I jotted down our date of arrival in ******** and the day on which I left ******** 
Q.	Witness, when you left ************************ did you note in your diary the other persons who were wives of minister who travelled with you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	How did you leave *****************************
A.	We made that trip in a vehicle. 
Q.	Yes, how many people were in that vehicle? 
A.	I didn't count them. 
Q.	Were there other ladies in that vehicle other than your -- other than Béata Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes, there were. 
Q.	Were they women of the same status and station as Béata Nzabonimana? 
A.	I didn't pay that much mind.  I didn't observe them. 
Q.	Yes, and do you -- did you note in your diary the type of vehicle that conveyed you from ************* to ***************  I bet not, did you? 
A.	No, I didn't take that note in my notebook.
(Pages 46 to 49 by Judith Kapatamoyo)

























1500H 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, the purpose of your notebook is simply to note two dates; isn't it?  The 21st to the 
	24th of April 1994.  That is how you have invented this diary, to remember those two dates; isn't it? 
A.	No, that was not my intention.  
Q.	Of course, I know that your intention is not to mislead this Court but to assist Mr. Nzabonimana; isn't it? 
A.	I didn't quite understand the question.  
Q.	Yes.  I'll ask you another question.  

Witness, when you got to *************** did you note down in your diary the hotel in which you took residence? 
A.	No, I didn't write down the name of the hotel.  
Q.	Again, Witness, the purpose for inventing your diary is to remember or to convince this Court that you remember the dates between 21st and 24th April 1994; isn't that the case? 
A.	No, that is not why I said so. 
Q.	Now, while you were at the ************** in Cyangugu, were other ministers present -- sorry, were other wives of ministers present?
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, has the witness said that she stayed at that hotel? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No, she didn't.  I'm just putting it to her.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Maybe you should have put a preliminary question to find out where she stayed.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I will withdraw that question.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, do you now remember the hotel in which you stayed in **************** 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And my question reminded you the name of that hotel; isn't it? 
A.	It's true that you mentioned the name of the hotel in question.  But if you had asked me the question without mentioning the name of the hotel, I'm sure I would have remembered. 
Q.	Well enough, Witness.  Well, at the ****************, did you see a lady by the name of 
	Mechtilde Mugiraneza, the name I referred to you earlier? 
A.	I didn't see her. 
Q.	If somebody says that that lady was a friend of Béata Nzabonimana, lived with Béata Nzabonimana in the same hotel for two-and-a-half months, it would be surprising that you don't know her; isn't that correct? 
A.	I don't know that woman. 
Q.	I'll tell you why you don't know her, because you went to the house of Callixte Nzabonimana on 
	the 5th of April and left on the 6th of April.  Is that not correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	So, Witness, your whole exercise of coming here today was to say something that you do not know, isn't that the case, to assist Béata and Callixte Nzabonimana?  
A.	Normally, I am a witness and I have come here to speak of the events that I experienced, to say that I came to the Nzabonimana home on the 5th and that I left that family home to go to the 
	Presidential Guard camp and not to join members of my family -- I left the home of that family to go to the Presidential Guard camp and not to go and join my family.  So I'm talking about the truth.  
Q.	Listen, Witness, to what you told the Defence.  In paragraph 2 of your statement you said, and I'll read it very slowly.  

"On the 6th of April 1994, I was at the home of Nzabonimana, Callixte, in Kimihurura.  It was 
Easter holidays.  I arrived there on 5th April from Mugambazi."  Mugambazi is spelt M-U-G-A-M-B-A-Z-I.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, we are in open session.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Be careful.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Absolutely careful.  I am very cautious about this.
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	"I had to leave the following day."  Now, let's stop there.  Is that what -- just a minute.  Is that what you told the investigators up to that point?  Is that correct? 
A.	Please, could you repeat the question.  I didn't quite understand it. 
Q.	The question is:  Did you tell the investigators for Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana that when you arrived at the home of Callixte Nzabonimana on the 5th, you had to leave the next day? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I object.  I will ask for the witness to be taken out.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Witness, a legal matter has arisen which counsel need to argue before the Trial Chamber.  We request you to leave at this moment, after the curtains have been drawn.  

Could you draw the curtains first, please.  
This is standard procedure, Witness.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Defence Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Now, I don't know if this is because of the translation.  But when you read the statement in French, the proposition that the Prosecutor is now putting to the witness that she said in her statement that she left the day after the 5th, this is not what the statement says.  She says that on 6th April she was at the house of Callixte where she had arrived on the 5th.  And then there's the next sentence; she was supposed to leave the day after.  So it obviously refers to the day after the 6th and not the day after 
	the 5th.  

So I think the Prosecutor should put the content of the statement accurately to the witness and not rephrase the information that is contained therein with the intentions that we know he has.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, the difference is the same.  I think the witness knows what she told the Defence.  The content is basically the same.  She went there with an intention of leaving the following day.  So she can answer this question.  I'm not putting anything further.  I'm not trying to concoct something.  This is something she has said.  Whether it means the 7th or whether it means the 6th, I'm sure she can answer.  

So I do not think that this is a valid objection just to point out that one because this is her statement.  

So, My Lords, I implore you to dismiss that objection.  I do not think that it is prejudicial to the witness.  However, if the Defence finds it fit, in re-examination, they can read the statement to him -- to her in French.  But as far as I'm concerned, the context and the content is correct.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, the purpose of re-examination is not to correct the misleading proposition that 
	the Prosecutor is making to witnesses.  We have a statement.  The content of the statement is clear.  The Prosecutor is not allowed to paraphrase the content of a statement and to tell the witness that she had said something to the representative of the Defence, which is not what is contained in the statement.  This is not proper.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel for the Prosecution, you need to read back the content of the statement to the witness and then ask her to clarify on which day she meant to leave, so that we get the answer from the witness.  We think that would be the proper course to follow in this -- in the circumstances.  

MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, My Lords.  I'm reading straight from her -- from, of course, the translated draft copy.  And I'm sure that I'll give her enough space for her to clarify.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Can the witness be brought back in after the curtains have been drawn.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
And the Prosecutor should be careful if he intends to continue reading the paragraph, because there are there identifying information.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The Prosecution has taken note.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, you will continue with your testimony.  

Prosecution Counsel.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, can you clarify or tell the Court when you went to the home of Béata on the 5th, did you tell the Defence when you had intended to leave that home? 
A.	I don't remember that. 
Q.	Witness, you've been thinking about this trial for some time now; isn't it? 
A.	Please repeat your question. 
Q.	Witness, you've had time to think about this trial for some time; is that correct? 
A.	I don't quite see the time to which you're referring. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, I'll be more clear.  After making your statement, did the Defence of 
	Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana read it back to you? 
A.	Yes, the statement was read back to me.  
Q.	And it was correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Yes.  And since you've come to Arusha, have you had opportunity to read your statement again? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you do not recall telling the Defence that when you arrived at the home of Callixte Nzabonimana on the 5th of April you intended to leave the following day; did you? 
A.	That was the situation. 
Q.	Witness, my proposition is that you actually did leave on that following day, the 6th, you left the home and went away.  Not the Presidential Guard barrack, but you went away to your home.  Why is it that now you're saying that you accompanied the family all the way to ******************* 
A.	That is your proposition.  But on the 6th it was necessary for me to remain where I was.  And in the night of the 7th -- or 6th to 7th I was surprised when I was still in the house of Nzabonimana.  It is true that no question was put to me about it, but that was the situation as it occurred.  
Q.	Okay, Witness.  Now, let me clarify another thing for you to tell the Court.  

Béata Mugiraneza was a wife of a minister and she had a baby about the age of 13 or 14 months with her.  Did you see such a lady at the hotel -- sorry, I am corrected.  

Mrs. Mugiraneza's name is Mechtilde.  May I describe her to you.  She was a wife of the minister, Mugiraneza.  And she had a little baby, about 13 to 15 months, with her.  Do you remember such a woman in ************************* in the company of Béata Nzabonimana?  
A.	I do not remember that woman. 
Q.	Witness, the only reason why you do not remember that woman is because you, yourself, was not at ********* with Béata, nor at ********** in Béata -- in ************ with Béata.  The only reason why you've put yourself there is to offer that between 21st and 24th, Callixte Nzabonimana came and stayed with the family in *************.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I went to ******* and **********.  Ask Madam Béata if I was not with her.  If she says no, then you'll be right.  But you put a question to me about somebody I do not know, so I do not see how I can answer you about somebody I do not know.  
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May I request just a minute.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, do you know where Béata Nzabonimana lives today? 
A.	I know where she lives.
Q.	Can you tell us where she lives? 
A.	When members of Mr. Nzabonimana's Defence team came to see me in October, a member of that team informed me that Béata Nzabonimana lived in France.  I tried to get in contact with Béata by mail but she did not respond.  That is how I learnt about the present residence of Madam Béata. 
Q.	The Defence sent to you the regards and greetings of Madam Béata Nzabonimana; is that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, Witness, when did you become aware for the very, very first time that the Defence of 
	Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana wanted to see you? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question. 
Q.	Yes.  When did you become aware that the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana wanted to get in touch with you? 
A.	The first time a group of Rwandans came to ask information from me -- and that group informed me that the Accused person was going to invite me to testify in his defence.  
Q.	Can you kindly give the names of those people to the Chamber.  If -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
In open session, Counsel? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Witness, are you able to write the names of those persons on a list which can be seen by the Judge? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Well, maybe we could go into closed session, because the Accused might need to hear this information.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases.  

Maybe I could delay that for a bit later and go into another matter, so that we end up with this question.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, in your statement to the Defence, you mention two children.  And I will name them for you.  One is Mahoro, M-A-H-O-R-O, and the other is Charlotte, C-H-A-R-L-O-T-T-E, who were students on holiday.  Do you remember that? 
A.	That is not exactly what I told the members of the Defence team.  I simply said that Mahoro was a student and that Charlotte was a domestic servant.  These girls were not children, as it is written in 
	my statement.  
Q.	Now, did Mahoro and Charlotte come to Bukavu? 
A.	No.  
Q.	They remained in the residence of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana; is that correct? 
A.	I don't know.  
Q.	What about a person by the name of Uwamungu, Emmanuel, mentioned in your statement.  Who was that person? 
A.	He was a gardener who worked in Nzabonimana's home.  
Q.	Did you see him in Bukavu? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, Witness, did you see Mahoro, Charlotte and Uwamungu, Emmanuel, at the French embassy? 
A.	No, I did not see them there. 
Q.	Uwamungu, Emmanuel, was left on the night of the 6th at the home of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana; 
	is that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you see him on the night of the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I saw him.  
Q.	And you saw him at the home of Mr. Nzabonimana; is that correct? 
A.	He was with us at the Presidential Guard camp. 
Q.	Did you see him at the French embassy? 
A.	No, I did not see him there. 
Q.	What about André Hakizimana?  This person was a young man, is that not correct? 
A.	Yes, Hakizimana was young. 
Q.	How old was he? 
A.	I don't know, but he was young.  
Q.	He was about 16 years old, is that not correct? 
A.	No.  He had completed his secondary education. 
Q.	And you saw him at the French embassy, is that not correct? 
A.	Yes, I saw him there. 
Q.	He was a young man of about your age, isn't that correct? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question.  
Q.	André Hakizimana was a young man of about your age in 1994? 
A.	No, he was older than me.  
Q.	At the French embassy, did André Hakizimana leave the embassy and come back on the night -- on the evening of the 9th April 1994? 
A.	No, he did not leave the embassy. 
Q.	Did André Hakizimana tell Béata Nzabonimana that there were some people who wanted to see Béata outside the French embassy? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Maybe a time frame, a day.  
THE WITNESS: 
I do not remember any longer.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, if somebody said that Hakizimana left the embassy on the afternoon of 9th April 1994 and subsequently came back, that person would be misleading this Court, is that correct? 
A.	I do not remember the incident you're talking about. 
Q.	Yes.  And, Witness, during the time you were at the embassy, Béata Nzabonimana was a 
	close confidant of yours, is that not correct? 
A.	I do not understand what you mean by being my confidant.  
Q.	Well, Witness, you kept her company and she kept you company during those very hard times, 
	is that not correct?  Constantly.  
A.	Yes, she was always close to me. 
Q.	And you can tell this Court with confidence that Béata Nzabonimana, from the time she entered the French embassy to the time you left on the night of 11th April 1994, she never left the embassy and come back again?  Is that correct? 
A.	I do not remember that anymore. 
Q.	And she did not tell you that there were some relatives who had called for her outside, did she? 
A.	No, she did not tell me. 
Q.	If somebody comes to court and says that at a certain time Béata, and probably yourself, left the embassy, went outside to have fresh air, stayed outside for a while and came back several times during the period 7th to 11th, that person would be misleading this Court, is that correct? 
A.	That would be a lie, because I never left the embassy during the period you mentioned.  
Q.	And that would apply to Béata as well, isn't it? 
A.	As far as Béata is concerned, I cannot remember with any precision. 
Q.	Uh-huh.  Witness, it will also be incorrect and probably even a lie if somebody was to come to this court and say that Béata and Callixte Nzabonimana settled in the corridor in the French embassy and not in a room in the French embassy, is that correct? 
A.	That would be a lie. 
Q.	Now, the corridor on which you slept was next to the room where Callixte Nzabonimana and Béata took residence in a room, is that correct? 
A.	The room in which they settled was in the same house in which the corridor where I slept was located. 
Q.	And there were two entrances to that corridor; one to the left and one to the right, is that correct? 
A.	No, I did not pay attention to that, so I do not remember with any precision.  
Q.	And during the period between 7th evening and 11th April 1994, the men were usually outside the building discussing in small groups, is that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Near where you were settled in the corridor, were there men sleeping next to you or near you? 
A.	I do not remember.  
Q.	This is because you did not note it down in your mysterious diary, did you?  Did you? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, did the witness understand your question? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I'm sure she did but I think she doesn't want to answer, so I will leave it alone.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Why?  No.  I heard the witness speaking.  And again these are -- I'm exhausted in trying to refute these constant allegations of witnesses evading or refusing to answer.  This is completely wrong.  I would request the Prosecutor to treat the witnesses with more sympathy and more kindness.  We're just exhausted of hearing that and hearing these allegations which are completely baseless and groundless.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Move on.  I see my learned friend is very charged this afternoon.  So I will not annoy him at all.  

MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I'm sorry.  I distinctly heard the witness speaking.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Slow down, Counsel.  Slow down. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
No.  Say what you want to say but cool down.  

Yes, Counsel.  Do you want to complete your submissions? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I heard the witness answer.  But could she be asked to repeat the answer instead of being accused of trying to evade the questions.  I think it is completely unfair to her.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Witness, what were you saying? 
THE WITNESS: 
I was asking the Prosecutor to repeat his question because I had not understood him.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
And if you could avoid comments.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I will.  I will avoid comments, My Lord.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Could you repeat the question.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	The question was, Witness:  You did not record in your mysterious diary anything about what happened in the French embassy, did you? 
A.	No, that is not the reason. 
Q.	The reason being that you do not remember whether there were men settled in the corridor because you were not there in the first place, isn't that correct? 
A.	I actually settled down in that corridor.  
Q.	What about André Hakizimana?  Did he settle next to you in the corridor? 
A.	Yes, he also spent nights in the corridor.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, it is my submission, and I will advise this Court that you are an imposter.  You were not at the French embassy.  You left the home of Callixte Nzabonimana on the 6th of April 1994 and you did not see them after that.  What would you say to that? 
A.	You say that I did not spend the night of the 6th in the home of Callixte Nzabonimana.  You also say that I did not go to the French embassy.  What are you relying upon?  Where did you get 
	your information from? 

I am testifying to events that I witnessed -- that I experienced.  
Q.	Witness, your sole purpose coming here is simply to fix Callixte Nzabonimana in Cyangugu between the 21st and 24th of April 1994 and, indeed, that is the only date that you remember or you say you put in your diary, isn't that correct? 
A.	No, you are not correct to say what you've said.  
Q.	Witness, thank you very much for answering my questions.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I am finished with the cross-examination of this witness.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Any re-examination, Counsel? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
If you can give me just one minute with my client.  

No re-examination, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Judge Rajohnson has a question for you, Madam Witness.  

Judge, should we go in closed session or? 

JUDGE RAJOHNSON:  
Yes, preferably in closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Registry, could we go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 61 to 63] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 50 to 60 by Rebecca McCoy)































MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.

Witness, we have now come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you for coming to testify before this Chamber on the events of 1994.  We will have an opportunity to consider your evidence, alongside all the evidence that has been heard and that will be heard in this trial before we give a verdict.  And you may now leave.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Just before the witness does so, Madam President, she has told the Defence that she wishes to greet the Accused before being brought back.  I don't know if that could be done during the break that we are about to take.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, is that the case?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that was my desire.  In fact, I was going to make that request of you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the request is granted and we request the registry to facilitate these greeting in accordance with the obtaining rules and regulations before the witness leaves.  

Witness, you may leave now. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel, your next witness.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, we had requested for Witness T19 to be here.  Maybe we can start after the afternoon break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will take the break now and resume our proceedings at 20 minutes to five, 20 to five when we begin the testimony of T19.  
(Court recessed from 1608H to 1640H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

On the stand is Witness T19; is that so, Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
That is correct. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, could you administer the solemn declaration to the witness.  Thank you. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.
(Declaration made by Witness T19 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  

Witness, good afternoon.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you have just made a solemn declaration to tell the Trial Chamber the truth, and we would like to urge you to stick to that oath throughout your testimony.  We would now like to bring a few points to your attention regarding the procedures which obtain here in the Tribunal  

The Defence team, which is seated on your left-hand, will lead you -- your evidence in-chief, putting questions to you to elicit your evidence.  

When they have finished asking you questions, the Prosecution side, which is in front of the translation booth on your right, will also ask you questions.  

The Judges may pose questions to you at any time during the proceedings, if they deem it fit.  

You are required to answer all questions that are put to you by the parties and by the Bench.  If a question is not proper, the Trial Chamber will indicate to you and you will not be required to answer it.  

When you are giving your evidence, give brief accounts.  Don't make long narrations, as they make the work of understanding, translating and recording your evidence difficult.  Make short sentences, keeping in mind all the time that other players in this courtroom are attending to your evidence by way of recording and translating.  

Do not switch on your microphone if you are not speaking, as if it is left on and there is another microphone switched on at the same time, disruptions will occur in the recording and translating of your testimony.  

You will testify either in open or closed session.  If it is an open session, you are required to be careful, as the public is allowed to attend open sessions.  So if you are not careful and give away identifying information, your identity may be put at risk.  

Closed sessions are those sessions which the public is not allowed to attend and on occasions, we may go into these sessions to protect your identity.  You will be informed either way whenever we are going in or out of a public -- or, open session into a closed session, and vice versa 

Witness, we require courtesy in this courtroom from all the parties, and from everyone in this courtroom, including witnesses.  So we hope that you will be courteous to all the parties and to the officers and the Bench in this courtroom.  And if you step out of line, we will definitely say so.  

So, Witness, if you keep these matters in mind, your testimony should go very smoothly and quickly.  

Could you now let the Trial Chamber know whether you have understood the briefing. 
THE WITNESS:
I've understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel, we are in open session and you may indicate where you want us to begin after the preliminaries. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, I would like us to revert to closed session, as we are going to check the witness's identity.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I would request my learned friend to indicate at this point, whether it is his intention or instruction that this witness testify in total closed session.  As the Court pleases.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe that is a matter that should be discussed elsewhere.  

Witness -- Yes, Learned Counsel, do you have a problem with concluding the preliminaries in the open session?  Because we normally do that in open session, then we get to hear the testimony in closed session, if there is need for it.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
If I have to explain at this time, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, not in the presence of the witness.  

Yes, Witness, there is a matter that we need to sort out between the counsels and the Chamber.  It is standard procedure for us to sort out these matters in the absence of the witness.  It's a pity we didn't know that this issue would arise, we would have asked for you to stay out and come in once.  But now you have to leave and after we have sorted out this matter, you will come back.  So we crave for your understanding, Witness.  So could you leave now for a few moments.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, I disclosed to the Prosecution the signed statements of this witness, who is testifying to a very brief time frame, very brief period on an area, a place that is well known and identifiable, where he also lives with his family members.  

So I believe we find ourselves in a situation where a closed session is actually needed.  I cannot say more because I believe we are now in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel.  And before the Prosecution responds, we had a related question.  Normally we finish with the preliminaries in open session, unless there is a clarification that needs to be made on the PIS, in which case we would need to go into closed session.  So we would require that you do the preliminaries in open session before we go to closed session.  

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, we've had time to look at the statements and our feeling is that unless the witness -- unless the counsel motivates an application now with respect to why we should hear the entire testimony in closed session, there is nothing in this statement which would warrant such session.  

I agree with the finding that at least, first and foremost, the preliminaries and the swearing-in of the witness should be done in open session.  
Secondly, if the statement we have is anything to go by, really there is, in my view, a very good opportunity for this testimony to be heard in open session, save for a very small part.  And I believe that counsel has to really motivate this issue now, so that we understand whether there is anything further than what he has simply said that needs to be known by the Chamber in order to grant this extreme measure.  

My Lords, in our assessment, there is nothing that cannot be said in the open session with good care being taken to guide the witness properly.  This witness also comes from a category such that he is a well educated person and he is a school master, and he would be able to know what it takes to disclose his testimony.  

So I propose that counsel motivates this application specifically for this witness so that we may see whether there is something else we do not understand that needs to be understood, but for now, we object to this witness being heard in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we understand your objection to be -- being heard in closed session entirely, is that the case?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
That is the case, My Lord.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, if I were to give you specific reasons, I would identify the witness.  So I cannot state the reasons under the present conditions of the open court that we are now having. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, we will go into closed session to hear the reasons from Defence Counsel.  

Registry.

(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel. 
WITNESS T19,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  Can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you very well. 
Q.	In front of you, Witness, you should have a document which is your personal identification sheet.  

Yes, that's the one.  
A.	Yes, I have the document here. 
Q.	Can you read it, please?  I believe you are able to read French.  If there's any mistake, please don't say what the nature of the error may be, but we will move immediately into a closed session for that purpose.  Is there any mistake?  Do say if there is, but don't say what kind. 
A.	Yes, there is a small mistake, a small error. 
Q.	Is that error likely to be able to identify you, if you were to say it out loud? 
A.	No, I don't think so.  We can move to having it corrected. 
Q.	Please, go ahead, and, please, tell us what the nature of the error is? 
A.	In respect of my address, it is the name of the cellule that needs to be corrected. 
Q.	Very well.  In that case, we will move into a closed session because that cellule is a very small place and may likely identify you. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, may we move into a closed session? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Registry, could we go back into a closed session, please?
