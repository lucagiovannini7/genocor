MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, before we render our decision on the application for waiver of protection measures for the witness, we have one final question for the witness.  

Witness, do you know the implication of your desire -- your request and desire to waive your 
protective measures in full?  We are in open session, so be careful, the measures have not been waived yet.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am fully aware.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  This is our decision regarding the application made by Defence counsel.  

The Chamber has listened to the submissions of counsel.  It has also listened to the responses of the witness and those of the witness protection unit.  

The Trial Chamber is convinced that the witness understands and confirms that she is waiving her protective measures in full.  She also understands the effect of doing so.  

The witness protection unit has confirmed that there is no problem so far that is envisaged in this regard.  Accordingly, the Trial Chamber lifts the protective measures granted to Witness T6, in full.  

The effect of this order will be that her personal particulars will be unsealed.  She will testify in public and in her own name.  Accommodation arrangements outside the safe house will be worked and agreed between her and the witness protection unit.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

The witness may now leave.  
(Witness exited courtroom)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel, this signals the opening of your Defence case. 

MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, Your Honours, before saying anything ahead of the presentation of our case, I would just like to inform the Chamber that in keeping with its directive submitted before, we resumed a motion to admit witness Fernand Batard and Suzanne Thomson, together with the supporting documents for their appearance to testify as witnesses.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

After the Prosecution has responded to the motion, we would do what -- the needful.  

And in this regard -- and as -- and so as to facilitate the speed of the Defence case, could the Prosecution file its response within -- before close of business tomorrow.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  And if there is any reply, it should be filed before Friday, so that we can issue a decision thereon as soon as possible.  

Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, Madam President, I only hope that for the appearance of witnesses, we would not have to engage in an exchange of motions and all that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, and the ball is in your court.  You are the one who is supposed to facilitate this; not the Trial Chamber. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well, Madam President.  

Your Honours, a few words by way of introduction to our evidence.  And I must confess to the Chamber that we were waiting impatiently this moment ever since the Prosecution started its case in-chief and since it completed its case.  

And in as much as we consider that the time has come for you to know at last the truth, the truth about the man, Callixte Nzabonimana, minister for youth, in 1994, the truth -- or, the facts in relation to that period, the charges brought against this man, and the truth, I may say, which is on our side, is underpinned by a serious investigative work, methodic -- methodical investigation, and given the short timelines we have been allotted, and I may add, this exhaustive work in relation to the enormity of the charges that have been brought against him.  

We consider here, on our side, that Callixte Nzabonimana, who stands accused before this Tribunal unjustly, is, before anything else, the victim of the indigenes of the work of the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal, and, in tandem, that the Prosecutor's office subjectively 
forged -- or, has forged objectively with the ruling regime in Kigali.  

Let us be clear here, the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana and the minister himself do not dispute that there was genocide in Rwanda in 1994; that hundreds of thousands of Tutsis were killed.  That is not our case.  

We -- we are not trying to perpetrate a political struggle against a regime that seized power by force and which without one being partisan or party to anything.  And we realised that it is hanging on to power through electoral fraud, police terror.  That is not our immediate concern.  

Nonetheless, the Defence here is a victim to these two parameters, that is, the Prosecutor's manner of work in this Tribunal.  And I would say, it's passive complicity with the exploitation - or, instrumentalisation of his office by the Kigali regime, which only thrives on the remnants of the genocide, which it uses as its only international policy.  

The work of the Office of the Prosecutor, for legal professionals -- professionals of criminal law that we are, accustomed as we are in our respective countries to defend or sometimes prosecute before courts, we are -- we were really upset by the lack of simple investigations -- police investigation methods in the conduct of investigations by the Office of the Prosecutor.  

You may have observed during the presentation of the Prosecution witnesses that the investigation of the Prosecution almost never visited the sites with the witnesses that they presented to check out the facts for their witnesses.  The basis for any investigative work is never ever to trust one's witness.  
And, as far as possible, to crosscheck, verify and check the statements of the Prosecutor and to see if their statements are borne out or justified.  

You would recall, for instance, the charges against Nzabonimana in Mount Ndiza.  The two witnesses that testified on that incident told you that never that -- that they had never been taken to the site by the investigators to ascertain whether in keeping with their statements what they were saying was true.  

Beyond this complete emptiness and vacuity of the investigation, our own investigation established that the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor did not work with the absolute rectitude that is needed in this profession.  

Most of the witnesses we are going to present as part of our case are former Prosecution witnesses, and some key ones, for that matter, and they will come to explain to the Chamber how things work in Rwandan prisons -- how things are done.  

And as the press in Rwanda - or, in Rwandan radios continue to repeat, so that proper witnesses should be brought before you to help you to deliver proper decisions naturally on convictions.  

Many of the witnesses that will testify here met with Prosecution investigators.  They were cited by Defence witnesses.  Why did the Prosecution never disclose interview records with these persons who, at some former point, told the Prosecution that Nzabonimana was not present?  Why did they not present these to the Chamber?  

Why do Prosecution investigators meet series of witnesses -- of potential witnesses in the prisons and keep only inculpatory or negative material that they do not even care to investigate and ignore or omit to take the testimonies of people who do not share their opinion.  

In any judicial system, we have the investigative phase. There is an investigative file; there is a chronological order that you, the Judges, and us, Defence counsel, can follow the sequence that leads the public prosecutor to take a very serious decision, that is, to issue an indictment, to submit same to you, the Judges, on the basis of an attestation, whereas within the context of the system of the Tribunal, whereas you cannot hear the witnesses before, and on the basis of the indictment, issue a warrant of arrest and on the basis of which a person is detained.  And we know that once a missionary is launched, it is unstoppable and leads to trial. 

The Prosecution is not doing that work and we are going to prove it here.  And if the Prosecution had done this work, this trial would not have taken place.  There would not have been an indictment against Callixte Nzabonimana.  

However, the difficulty here is that, the habit of laziness, indolence in the conduct of investigations, has led the Office of the Prosecutor to rely on two main sources to build its case file, and that is what I consider spasm complicity with the regime, with the Rwandan judicial institutions that are now in place.  

You have associations of survivors that are very powerful today in Rwanda.  I do not deny these survivors, far from it, their pain.  I do not dispute that most of them experienced horrific -- absolutely horrific tragedies.  We do not dispute the fact that witnesses who've testified here lost their families and children under terrible conditions.

The problem is that 15 years after the genocide, this Tribunal has become a major stake in other issues in Rwanda, just simply which is beyond the fair conviction of criminals.  And this is especially true in Nyabikenke commune, which is Nzabonimana's commune of origin.  And it is also true in 
Rutobwe commune, where he stands accused.  And it is especially true for other cases where you could also hear testimonies from witnesses who came to tell you that they were carried off in buses by the Rwandan authorities to go and meet with investigators, or how they are organised in de facto networks with an elder or an intellectual, who is responsible for leading them, helping them to -- helping them in their testimonies before this Tribunal.  

Thanks to the talents of our investigators who worked in very difficult circumstances since the Prosecution finally succeeded in eliminating one of our best investigators by using 
Prosecution witnesses who are notorious in their areas.  Thanks to the work of this very remarkable investigator, we were able to gain firsthand information on firsthand witnesses who were there when the events happened in Nyabikenke commune, and you will hear their testimonies.  

Where we stand today, the way this case is built, it has a major contradiction, and you may have noticed it even before the Defence commences the presentation of its case.  

As you must have observed, Callixte Nzabonimana, in the Prosecution case, has no negative elements prior to 6th April 1994.  Not a speech, not a fiery speech, not an article in the press, not a hateful article in the press, no bias position with persons who today have been convicted by your Tribunal.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  

And even beyond that, you've heard Prosecution witnesses, notably, Tutsi witnesses, testify here that up until 6th April 1994, in his commune, and even in the other communes of Gitarama préfecture, the MRND remained the party of the Tutsi for those who had not moved to join the PL or the other parties.  And especially in Nyabikenke, three witnesses, two of them Tutsis, came to testify that they remained in the MRND, whereas 97 per cent of the commune was MRND -- MDR.  

What is the explanation for this contradiction and mystery, that a man without any record -- 
criminal record or any commune, belongs to a party known as the party of the Tutsis, would virtually overnight decide to eliminate members of his party, and regarding his region, people he knew from when he was a child?  

The Prosecution did not adduce any evidence as to this psychological mystery to explain that through the crash of a -- simple crash of an airplane, in the aftermath of that crash, Callixte Nzabonimana sent vehicles or lorries, that must have been prepared beforehand, to his area to distribute weapons.  
How do we explain since we have been told through this false logic that Nzabonimana, in Gitarama, being a minister from Gitarama, was necessarily a powerful person, whereas you have heard from all Prosecution witnesses with detail that from the moment that multi-party politics was introduced, Nzabonimana, in his region, was a persecuted minister?  He was in the minority.  He had no political power on a region where the préfet -- where the préfet was a member of the MDR, and where 14 of the 17 bourgmestres were MDR militants, a region that was a historic cradle of the MDR, the native commune of Nzabonimana being the starting point of the 1959 revolution to the extent that the MDR was able to rise up again as a single party -- persons from the south or the centre joined the party, and Nzabonimana could no longer go back into his commune.  Militants of the MRND were jeered out.  So you imagine in a country like Rwanda, the fact that the population of a region would dare to attack the personal property of a minister.  Is that the all powerful minister, this ex-minister of the genocide in Gitarama préfecture, as the Prosecution, which could not conduct investigations, which could not -- or, which, because it does not understand the case, could not address -- we have raised that issue, and today it was a different case that was presented to you.  

I am simply saying that the Prosecution has no human logic, no historic logic because the facts that were presented to you were completely artificial, artificial in the context of testimonies because the testimonies were false, deliberately concocted with the clear objective of having this man convicted.  

Your Honours, do you know that last week Radio Rwanda was discussing the treatment of 
Callixte Nzabonimana's case, the proceedings before your Chamber.  I don't know how they were informed, but they were complaining that the Prosecution had not presented enough witnesses.  I am telling you that this case is closely monitored in Rwanda.  

And I can tell you when you accept Fernand Batard's testimony, he would come to explain to you the circumstances under which he carried out our investigations, how the situation grew tense in the region ever since this case commenced.  

So, to conclude, who are the witnesses that will testify before you in the course of the following weeks?  You will hear witnesses, some of whom were refugees at the French Embassy, from the 7th to 
the 11th of April 1994, and even up to the 12th.  

They will explain to you the presence of Callixte Nzabonimana, naturally.  But does one even need to present witnesses on that score, whereas it is a historic fact?  It is a fact that the Rwandan government continues to blame France about -- for the past 15 years -- that it received the ministers who were part of the government, the government that the Kigali regime considers a genocidal government.  

Those witnesses will explain to you under what difficult circumstances they were evacuated from Kigali, and under what difficult and fearful circumstances that those inhabitants of Kigali -- because they were not used to war and they had not experienced war since 1991, when they heard the smell of gunfire and the sound of cannons.  So it was the first -- and sought refuge where they thought they would be saved, so as not to be killed.  

Other witnesses will tell you how they were saved by Callixte Nzabonimana, and how -- I mean, this from Tutsi witnesses -- they sought refuge in Callixte Nzabonimana's residence in Nyabikenke during that week from the 7th to 11th -- or 12th April 1994, hiding between Nzabonimana's family; and that during that period they never saw Callixte Nzabonimana in Nyabikenke, contrary to what the 
Prosecution witnesses have told us here; and that this entire role that is ascribed to him and which makes up almost 50 per cent of the indictment over such a short period, is nothing but a fabrication.  

From the political standpoint, as it were, and from the standpoint of meetings, you have persons who participated in those meetings, especially the meeting of 18th April 1994.  Those witnesses will explain to you how, since 1997, in Rwanda, they have been compelled -- they have been recruited to come and give a particular version of that 18th April 1994 meeting, a meeting that did not take place as 
two Prosecution witnesses came and explained.  

The coming weeks will be long.  I hope for the Tribunal that they will be passionate because people who sometimes -- taking risks, are also persons who were saved, regardless of risks that they may face in future, feel that they have the duty of speaking the truth about what happened.  

You listen to those persons; their words are clear and important.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

Learned Counsel, who is your first witness, and is this witness available to begin testimony?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
The witness is here, Madam President.  Witness T5. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Can the witness be brought in after the curtains have been closed.  
(Pages 1 to 7 by Sheriffo Jammeh)

1645H
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  

Registry, the witness appears to have a problem.  
THE WITNESS: 
It is moving.  

Yes, I can hear you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We just wanted to make sure that you could hear the Trial Chamber before the oath is administered to you.  Kindly, switch off your microphone when you're not speaking and switch it on when you want to speak.  

Registry, could you administer the oath, please.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President. 
(Declaration made by Witness T5 in French) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Witness.  The Trial Chamber would like to give you a briefing before you start your testimony about the procedures obtaining in this Tribunal.  

We'll start with how your evidence will be led.  But before we get to that point, we would like to remind you to switch off your microphone when you have finished speaking and to switch it on when you are speaking.  That will facilitate translation and proper hearing and recording of your evidence.  

Your evidence will be elicited by the Prosecution, which is seated in front of the -- in front of the translation booth on your right.  

Your evidence will first be elicited by the Pros -- Defence -- sorry -- which is seated on your left hand.  After the Defence has elicited your evidence, the Prosecution will, in turn, have an opportunity to -- to question you on your evidence.  And the Prosecution is seated on your right, in front of the 
translation booth.  

When the -- the Judges may interject at any time to seek a clarification of your evidence.  While you are giving your evidence, make short narrations.  Long narrations are difficult to follow, to translate, and to transcribe.  Mind the speed with which you are testifying because your testimony is being translated in three languages simultaneously; therefore, the translators and transcribers need breaks in between to facilitate their work.  If you have not understood a question put to you, you may ask for it to be repeated.  

We require courtesy from all present in this courtroom towards the witnesses.  Likewise, we require witnesses to be courteous to everybody in this courtroom, including counsel who -- who -- who question them.  We believe that if you follow these simple procedures, your testimony will be quickly finished and you may return home to carry on with your work.  

We thank you, Witness.  And if you need to have any clarifications made on this communication to you from the Trial Chamber, please, say so before you begin your testimony.  Thank you, Witness.  

Is everything clear?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I have understood.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
We have an identification sheet.  Can the registry, please -- does the witness have it? 
WITNESS T5,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have before you your personal identification sheet.  Can you please indicate to the Court whether the information contained therein is correct?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, can you switch on your microphone, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
I beg your pardon.  I would like to make a small amendment at the bottom of the page, where we are speaking about my occupation in 1994.  It says -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You're in open session.  You are a protected witness and we don't want you to give -- sorry to interrupt you, but we don't want you to give information that may identify you in a public session.  We're in a public session.  

So what we want to find out is:  The correction you want to make, might it or might it not identify you?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  Yes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes.  In that case, then we need to go into closed session.  

Members of the public, we request you to leave now because the matters we are going to address will identify the witness, who is a protected witness.  We are sorry.  

Registry, could you arrange for us to go into closed session, please.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 11 to 18] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
