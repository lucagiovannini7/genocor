* `sources` contains the transcripts in original (mostly .doc and some .pdf, compressed in .rar archives) and their .txt conversion.

* `plain-texts` contains the full transcripts for each case in two versions: one `pre-cleaning` and the other `post-cleaning` (after heavy manual fixes).

* the `doc2txt` Python script was used to perform .txt transformations.

* the `check_trial_date` Python script was used to check the correct sequence of the transcripts.
