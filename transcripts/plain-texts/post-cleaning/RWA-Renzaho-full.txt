Well, Counsel, pursuant to the law -- Counsel Contier, you have a time limit to file preliminary motions. You have an extra time limit of 30 days, but this shall concern only new counts and allegations included in the indictment. Do you wish me to repeat the new counts in the indictment? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No, it's not necessary; I already know them. Thank you.
@MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
After that we have to set a date for trial. 
Mr. Kiyeyeu -- but we shall take advantage of your presence here to hold a status conference to see where we are at with the process of disclosure of witness statements, and so we are going to adjourn first. 
Very well, we shall have a status conference immediately after this. Just -- we'll have time to take our robes off -- our gowns off. 
Mr. Kiyeyeu, please do not forget to indicate that the Accused plead -- pleaded not guilty on all six counts that were read out to him. 
We shall now adjourn and we shall then resume afterwards in closed session. So we shall resume in five minutes. Is that all right with you?

@MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order. 
Registrar, could you read out the case before the Chamber? 
@MR. KIYEYEU: 
Thank you, Madam President.
Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Arlette Ramaroson, presiding, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, 
the 10th of March 2006, for the pre-trial conference in the matter of the Prosecutor versus 
Tharcisse Renzaho, Case No. ICTR-97-31-T. 
@MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Madam President. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry. 
Could we have the appearances for the parties, beginning with the Prosecutor? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, may it please, Your Honour, counsel's name is Moses, I appear for the Prosecution this morning, together with -- and Ms. Melluish, who is assistant trial attorney and Mr. Margan, our case manager. Thank you, Your Honour. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
The Defence, please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
My respects, I am François Cantier, lead counsel for Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you, Counsel. 
So, this hearing is a pre-trial conference, pursuant to Rule 73 bis, and I would immediately give the floor to the Prosecutor to know how far we have gone with this matter. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. Thank you, Your Honour. 
Your Honour, if one looks at the last time we met together, which was on the 3rd of June last year, there were a number of issues that Your Honour and the Defence raised primarily regarding disclosure -- some disclosure issues, translation issues, and there was also a direction from 
Your Honour asking the Prosecutor to file his pre-trial brief in respect of the matter by the end of October. 
Your Honour, if one looks at those matters that were raised, all translation issues, to the best of my knowledge, have been -- all matters have now been translated. So, there are no outstanding translation issues at present. If there are new documents which come into our hands, obviously, we will disclose those and ask for, where appropriate or necessary, for the documents to be translated, but at the moment, we do not have any translation problems. 
Your Honour, you will be aware that after the last pre-trial conference, there was a motion filed to amend the indictment which was granted by the Trial Chamber earlier this year, and the pre-trial brief which Your Honour had asked us to file was done so and filed on the 31st of October last year. So far as the Prosecution is concerned, Your Honour, we are ready to proceed to trial when there is available court time, and obviously, we will need some -- need some time in order to obtain any order to transfer any detained witnesses, as is the usual situation, Your Honours. But that apart, Your Honours - 
Your Honour, I don't really have any other issues to raise with Your Honour. As far as the Prosecution is concerned, we -- I believe the matter is ready for trial. 
Thank you, Your Honour.
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you. 
The Chamber would like to ask the Defence to speak.
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Madam President. After the hearing of the 3rd of June 2005, with the assistance of 
Mr. Adjovi, we attempted to solve the problem of disclosures, not without problems, but I believe that as of today, that issue has been dealt with. The last disclosures -- or the last disclosure we received the day before yesterday. As far as we are concerned, we would like to file a preliminary motion. And, considering that our time limits started running from the disclosure of the documents by the Prosecutor after asking for the confirmation of the indictment. 
Madam President, your Chamber, in its decision of the 8th April 2005, had decided to leave aside provisionally our first preliminary motion, and I would like to quote from your decision. Since the preliminary motions under Rule 72 had to deal with something that is in force, as the Prosecutor has just said, there is another request for amendment of the indictment and your Chamber accepted that amendment in your decision of the 13th February last and in accordance with your ruling, the indictment was filed on the 16th of February. Your Chamber gave the Prosecutor a deadline which was the 17th of February. So, today, as far as the Defence is concerned, we would like to file -- we have already prepared a motion, the preliminary motion which we are going to file in the days that follow. 
Secondly, as far as the situation of the date of the beginning of the trial is concerned, we have just received the authorisation from the United Nations which will allow us to question witnesses who are from that organisation. So that gives you, I believe, a number of factors which will guide you in your determination of a date for the beginning of the trial. Those are my observations for the time being. 
I thank you. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, what is your response to that proposal? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I don't want to get into a legal debate over what the rules do or do not say. I simply would note for the record, Your Honour, that the direction that was given by the Trial Chamber regarding the 17th of February was for the Prosecutor to file the amended indictment. So far as the time limits are concerned for filing any preliminary motion, Rule 66(A) (i) is the rule which governs time limits -- I am sorry -- time limits for filing disclosure. And then in terms of Rule 72, they are to be in writing no later than 30 days after disclosure of the Prosecution -- Prosecution disclosure of statements given provided under Rule 66(A) (i). 
Your Honour will be aware that at the last -- at the initial appearance of this Accused back in June last year, Your Honour, in fact -- and it is noted in the summary of those proceedings, Your Honour, in fact, noted to the Defence that they had the right to file pre-trial motions because that relates to the time limits run from the initial appearance. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
As I say, Your Honour, I don't want -- if my friend is going to file a motion, we no doubt will respond, but it is certainly the Prosecution's submission that Rule 72 motions are guided by the time and the date on which an initial appearance is made, not by any amendment to an indictment which does not require an initial appearance by an Accused such as is the situation with the most recent amendment to the indictment. That's the only comment I wish to make regarding the issue. But, as I say, I don't know that there is anything to be gained by entering into a lengthy legal discussion at the moment. If my friend is going to file such a motion, we will, in due course, respond to it. 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to ask the Prosecutor a question: Are the supporting documents for the indictment -- have they all been filed and translated -- and translated? Because during the last appearance, the Chamber had, in accordance with the provisions -- 
Mr. Cantier, the Chamber gave to you a deadline for the filing of preliminary motions, so the 30 days. But as far as the new counts and the new charges or the allegations are concerned, that is, rape, there were two new counts and the question, therefore, that I would like to put to the Prosecutor is as follows: Now, are the documents in support of the indictment and that in accordance with Rule 66 of the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence, have those documents been filed and translated? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
Defence Counsel, the Chamber does not prevent you from filing your motion and we will rule accordingly. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Madam President. Those documents were disclosed to us, the last of them in the last few days, and that is why we consider that the deadline provided for in Rule 66 only starts running as from now. 
The second question that I would like to put to your Chamber, it concerns your decision on preliminary motions which we brought to the attention of the Court or that we raised against the first indictment. And in your decision of the 8th of April, you did not rule on it and you stated that preliminary motions which concerned the first indictment had to deal with an indictment that was -- had been accepted. That is what I would like to say. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would like to thank you. There will be no discussions on that. You are going to file your motion and supporting documents and your arguments and the Chamber would rule accordingly. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Madam President. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Now, we are going to go on to something else. I have a number of questions to put to the Prosecution. Now, first of all, last time you said that on account of the fact that there is an amended indictment, you were going to cut down your number of witnesses. Now, the Chamber would like to ask you the question: Did you, indeed, reduce the number of witnesses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
I believe the record shows that I indicated that we were relying on 33 factual witnesses. The last time I appeared, I -- the summary of the status conference has it quoted that Mr. Moses replied that the Prosecutor intends to call approximately 33 witnesses, because there had been 33 witness statements of factual witnesses that had been disclosed in support of that. The pre-trial brief which we have filed, Your Honour, lists 26 factual witnesses and an investigator and an expert. So there is a reduction in terms of the factual witnesses from 33 to 26. And I can also indicate to Your Honour that the Prosecutor would intend, hopefully, to reduce from the 26 factual witnesses by perhaps two or three, maybe more witnesses at trial depending on how the other witnesses who are called to testify perhaps in respect of similar crime scenes how their evidence goes. So the answer -- the short answer is, yes, Your Honour, we have by almost 20 percent and we intend also to reduce it even further where possible.
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. So, in the final analysis, we will have to deal with about 23 witnesses, is that the case; or, rather, you are going to see how things proceed? Very well. 
Now, as far as your pre-trial brief is concerned, there are no changes; is that the case? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That is correct, Your Honour. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence have anything to add, as far as that is concerned? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam President, just one thing: A concern because a while ago, I heard the Prosecutor refer to a decision on a transfer order. I do not know anything about that and that rather bothers me. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe that was a mistranslation. I cannot remember what you said, Prosecutor, but could you please repeat what you said, Prosecutor? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I indicated that all matters were ready for trial. However, once we receive a trial date in accordance with the rules, we need to apply to transfer any detained witnesses, we will need to apply to transfer any detained witnesses as is the case in all trials where there are detained witnesses. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, you are -- you understand better. So, we are expecting your motions and we, therefore, think that taking into account, I believe that is not going to take long since everything has been disclosed and there are no problems, we believe that everything is on schedule. So I believe that you are going to be informed about the situation and we think that this trial can begin in January 2007, but you will be informed in time. 
I thank you. If there are no other matters to raise, you are going to be informed in time. There might be a status conference, but, in any case, you will be informed in time. In the absence of any other matters from the parties, be it from the Prosecution or from Defence, we are going to put an end to these proceedings. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Madam President. 
@MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings stand adjourned.

Court Reporter:
Ms. Jean Baigent
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. This is an informal status conference. You have received a letter from the registry mentioning that the Renzaho trial will start on Monday the 8th of January before Trial Chamber I. 
A new memo of today from the President to the Court Management Section has transferred the pre-trial proceedings in this case from Trial Chamber II to Trial Chamber I. This means that, for instance, the pending motion concerning witness protection is from now on pending before Trial Chamber I. 
The composition of the Bench on the 8th of January is not official. We will come back to that after having clarified some administrative issues. 
The duration of the trial is not mentioned in the memo you received, but let me simply say that the intention is that we will hear the entire Prosecution case in one segment. We will most likely start with a full-day week from the 8th to the 12th of January, and then as it becomes more crowded in the courtrooms, move over to half days. The details will be communicated later. 
This is the scenario and the purpose of this informal status conference is to ensure that there are no unexpected problems. Maybe I could ask the parties to place themselves on record since it's the first time we meet in this case. 
Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. Counsel's name is Moses. I appear together with my friend, Ms. Melluish who's an assistant trial attorney, and Mr. Mangan who is our case manager. Thank you, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, shall we all speak slowly, and now we need the spelling of the two last names, please. 
@MR. MOSES:
Moses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That the was the first name.
@MR. MOSES:
All right, okay, Melluish is M-E-L-L-U-I-S-H. And our case manager, Mr. Mangan is -- M for Mike, -A-N for November G-A-N for November 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Defence, please? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Good day, sir, I'm François Cantier, lead counsel and my co-counsel is Barnabé Nekuie, who is also here and the legal assistant is here, Audrey Sabac. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I ask you too, kindly, to spell the names you referred to: Cantier we know well, C-A-N-T-I-E-R. But the other names please, so that we have them on record from now on. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Very well. My co-counsel, Barnabé, first name, B-A-R-N-A-B-É, Nekuie is N-E-K-U-I-E, Nekuie. Now, with respect to the legal assistant, Ms. Audrey Sabac, it's S-A-B-A-C. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. The trick is to speak slowly and, in particular, when we are reading and when we are spelling. 
I understand that Mr. Renzaho is present and we say good afternoon to you as well. 
Now, the various questions to be addressed -- and may I suggest the following method: This is a status conference but what we are actually doing now is to ensure that the pre-trial conference will be more or less superfluous. So if we now all have Rule 73 bis in front of us we could simply follow the structure in that provision and go point by point. Would that be agreeable to both parties? Rule 73 bis, please. 
If that is agreeable, let me say that I am aware that there has been correspondence between the parties by email and possibly by other means, but since this is the status conference and since it's the first time these matters are raised in court, there may be a need for repetition. With other words, we will go point by point, even if some of these matters have been sorted out informally through correspondence between the parties. 
Why don't we begin with 73 bis (B)(i) a pre-trial brief? Mr. Moses, please place on record, what is the status of the pre-trial brief? 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. The Prosecutor's pre-trial brief was filed on the 31st of October 2005. When we filed that -- and bearing in mind the time delay that we expected prior to trial -- we indicated at the commencement of the pre-trial brief, that it was possibly subject to some form of addendum being filed. 
Now, I can indicate in respect of the substance of the pre-trial brief, we do not intend to file any -- or vary that pre-trial brief which sets out the case. In respect, however, to the witness summaries which is an annex to the pre-trial brief, we have indicated to our friends by the disclosure of a proposed witness list that there -- and by disclosure, prior to the 60 days in terms of Rule 66 disclosure -- that there are some witnesses that we -- who are on that list and we no longer intend to call, and that there are other witnesses who were not on the list that we do intend to call. 
What I was going to advise the Court, subject to anything Your Honour or my friend wishes to say, is that we intend to file by next Friday the 15th of December, a revised summary of witnesses with the summary of their intended evidence, the estimated time that they will take to give their evidence-in-chief, and the paragraphs in which they intend to testify to. As I said, I think there are perhaps three -- maybe four, at most, witnesses who will be included on that and three who will be taken from the list. 
I think that is the -- the other thing that, Your Honour, perhaps, if I could just raise at this stage is in relation to the issue of exhibits. I'm pleased to advise Your Honour that -- I think all counsel involved in the trial have had discussions regarding the issue of exhibits and how we can proceed with the trial in the most efficient manner, and also so that we focus on the real issues and we don't get bogged down with arguments over admissibility when, in effect, all we are going to be arguing is the weight, which is something for Your Honours to decide. 
To that end, we have today an exhibit list -- and, in fact, we have printed out all the exhibits for my learned friend. Whilst, of course, we aren't obliged to, necessarily under the rules, we are doing that for him to look at and we are hopeful that we can -- through our first witness -- introduce these as an agreed -- as an agreed bundle of documents, Your Honour.
It may be -- and I've indicated to my friend and it's up to him that there are other documents which are in our possession and in our evidence database that he has seen. He may wish to add them to that dossier, if he so desires and it's purely a matter for him. He may decide that technically, he doesn't want to. But if he does, I've indicated that we won't object and we are hoping that approach will, as I say, speed matters up in terms of focussing Your Honour's attentions on the real issues that are involved this trial. 
So we do have this draft exhibit list today, which we will also provide to my learned friend. We don't have copies of the photographs for him today, but we will get those to him as soon as we are able. I think that perhaps explains the two issues which may be relevant to the pre-trial brief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The pre-trial brief exists in both official languages, does it? 
@MR. MOSES:
Perhaps my learned friends can -- I believe so, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so it's available both in English and French and that also goes for the summaries in the annex, is that so? So there is no language problem in any part of the pre-trial brief, can I conclude that? If no one raises a problem -- 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, a few comments. First of all, you've heard him -- the pre-trial brief must have been here since -- more than a year now, but it is not updated fully. So, that's my first comment, because there are some testimonies which will not be used. And, if there are new witnesses, clearly with new testimonies which will be added on; that's my first comment. 
The second one: With respect to the disclosures made, we've already discussed these matters with my colleague and there are a number which are on the list, but have not yet been translated into French. And since that's the working language -- in other words, that's the working language of Mr. Renzaho, the Accused, these are not available yet in the French. That's my second comment. 
And my colleague has told me that those translations will be available no later than next week. In other words, on or before the 15th of December, and that would resolve the problem -- if, of course, they keep to their promise. 
Then, one last thing, Mr. President, as you've just been told, I have just received the list now of documents that the Prosecutor intends to use. I cannot make any pronouncement with respect to this document because I haven't had the opportunity to look through the list. But what I've been told is that most of these documents are in French. Some of them are not in French. And if these are easy documents -- easy to peruse, of course, that wouldn't be any problem. But if they're more complex, I think it would be preferable that we receive them in French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, could I have a copy of the exhibit list? 
Thank you for those remarks. 
Now, I have not heard anything which would suggest that the pre-trial brief is not available in both languages, nor have I heard anything that would indicate that the witness summaries aren't available in both languages, so that seems to be settled. 
Then, there will be a need to update the annex to the pre-trial brief. Isn't that the point, Prosecution? You will only be updating the annex with the summaries, not the body of the pre-trial brief? 
@MR. MOSES:
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. And that implies that the pre-trial brief, as such, will be unchanged even though it is true as mentioned by Defence counsel that there is some time since we first received it. 
The other issue raised by Defence counsel was the fact that some witnesses are -- or will be dropped. Now, has Defence counsel been informed of which witnesses you now intend to drop so that there is no need for the Defence to prepare and investigate further in relation to those witnesses? 
@MR. MOSES:
We have provided to the Defence a list of the witnesses we intend to call and the proposed date on which they may testify, Your Honour, subject to their availability. That, I think, was sent by email and copied to the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Defence, the point now is that you know which witnesses will be called from January on, that is the situation. You know which have been deleted and you know which will be added? 
@MR. CANTIER:
$(Microphones overlapping) ... That's correct, we may do some subtraction and addition, so the list that will -- has been disclosed to us. Now, based on that list, we believe that will be the final list -- that is, the list of witnesses who will be brought here by the Office of the Prosecutor. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then, Defence counsel mentioned disclosures and that is something we will have to come to, but do we then agree that everything in connection with the pre-trial brief will be settled? It is actually settled as regards the body of the text, and when it comes to the summary, that will be filed on the 
15th of December, how much translation will there be a need for in the annexes -- or, the annex of the pre-trial brief? Are we talking about more than a page? 
@MR. MOSES:
Perhaps a page, Your Honour, maybe as much as a page and a half, but I would imagine around a page. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask the Defence, we all know the capacities of the translation department -- and sometimes it may be difficult to get documents through -- may I just ask you, even if your preference is obviously French and even if the Accused's language is French, certainly, are Defence counsel operative in English? I'm mentioning this just so that I know a bit which factual reality we are operating within because this is important for practical purposes. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I smile at your question, because let me -- I might reveal the fact that there are some shortcomings. My understanding of English is say average, but to be sure about my work, I would prefer to work with French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is to be respected and that will be our preference. But should the unlikely situation occur, for instance, that we have problems in getting one page through from the 15th of December to the 
8th of January, then you will probably survive if you have that one page in English. If you say no, we will have to take extra measures now. Maybe, the Prosecution could provide an in-house translation, for instance? 
@MR. MOSES:
What I can say, Your Honour, is all it will be is a summary of the witnesses statement, which will have been given in French. So it's not going to be new material that will be in English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it is difficult for me to pre-empt. It will be a matter of one document after another. We will look at it case by case. Of course, we won't raise any unnecessary difficulty on this matter. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You must speak more slowly. Can I ask you to do that? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, please proceed. Your point was that you will take this on a case-by-case basis, and that is absolutely understandable. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Absolutely, and that we won't raise any unnecessary difficulty. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that remark. 
To conclude the pre-trial brief, the only possible problem is that little addition to the annex concerning translation, and since the Defence already has the statements of those witnesses in both languages or, at least, in French, it is my understanding that should there be a delay with the summaries, we will survive. 
Can we conclude on that note? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, of course, subject to what I have stated earlier; namely, that currently we have four testimonies that have not yet been translated. Two of them are very important. For instance, that of the first two witnesses who will be appearing. I think, it's AG -- X, AX and XY. We also have a summary statement by witness ACK, which has not yet been translated. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, whenever we mention pseudonyms, we must slow down. The first witness is which one? What was that pseudonym? 
@MR. CANTIER:
ALG10. The second one, BUO1; the third, BUT3 and the fourth one XXY4. 
Now, on the problem of the declaration of intent, I'm referring to Witness ACK. Now, there's one last problem with ALG18 -- and my colleagues of the Office of the Prosecutor are yet to receive a translation -- even in English, they don't have one, let alone in French, and that document cannot be read. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Defence now referred to four witnesses and we will now go into the issue of disclosure and translation as you have wanted to do for some time now. I take it that the pre-trial brief is now settled. 
Can I ask you, Mr. Moses, what is the most updated order of witnesses appearance? You kindly sent a list to the Trial Chamber previously and that list started with JM, KM -- 
@MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour, that is the initials of those who are going to lead the witness --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay -- 
@MR. MOSES:
But I can indicate -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But let me put it differently, it started with NEUP. 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is different from any of those four pseudonyms -- 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That were now mentioned by Defence counsel, and I was given the impression that some of the problematic documents would be linked to witnesses that would appear early. And I only see witness ALG as number three here. So what is the situation? 
@MR. MOSES:
You're quite correct, Your Honour. If I can indicate, the first witness is the investigator. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that person called Rajesh? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Rajesh is spelt R-A-J-E-S-H; he's mentioned in an email. 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, that's his -- yes, and the next witness, Your Honour, is also an unprotected witness who is a ******************************************************************************** in Kigali. At the moment, I think he's under the pseudonym BUX, but she will simply be producing some photographs, so neither of them are factual witnesses, if I can put it that way. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, but my list mentions DUF --
@MR. MOSES:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- as number two.
@MR. MOSES:
That's the -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the ******************? 
@MR. MOSES:
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so NEUP is the investigator and DUF is ************** and they are unproblematic? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But the first substantial witness is, indeed, as mentioned by Defence counsel, ALG? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And is it then true that we have disclosure or translation problems there? 
@MR. MOSES:
I believe there are some 18 Rule 66 statements from that person. One of those was a handwritten document written by the witness in Kinyarwanda. It has been provided to the registry for translation. And I understand that both in a previous occasion when this witness came to testify at the Tribunal and also recently, the language section has come to us and said: "We are unable to translate this document into English or French because it is illegible."
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A question here, in what Defence counsel said, reference was made first to ALG10, and then afterwards, it was translated in a different sentence that there was a translation problem in relation to ALG18. Is it the same person? 
@MR. MOSES:
It is -- I apologise, Your Honour, there are two -- there are two documents. There's one ALG10, we are waiting for a translation into French. It is one of, I believe, three outstanding translations. There is also another document, ALG18, which is, we have been told, illegible. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. MOSES:
Now, we intend to disclose that document in Kinyarwanda, however, to the Defence on the 
15th of December, and they can use it as they will. But we are unable, through registry, to get a translation of that document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is Witness ALG, is that one of the new witnesses? 
@MR. MOSES:
No. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So it's an old witness, but for a long time there has been a lack of translation in relation to some of the statements of that witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
It was a relatively new -- yes, it was a relatively new statement. It was only taken, I believe, on the 
13th of June of this year. In fact, Your Honour, it might of assistance, I've got a copy of the -- and, I believe if Your Honour looks at page 5 --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES:
-- the second item down, you will see in the left-hand column witness statement of ALG, 13/06/06. The English was disclosed on the 18th of October and we are waiting for the French translation of that particular document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do we place witness ALG early amongst the witnesses, if that witness has many documents that are untranslated? Can he not be pushed back and we have the unproblematic witnesses first? 
@MR. MOSES:
With respect, Your Honour, when you say he has many documents, if you look at the number of documents -- or pages 2, 3, 4 and 5, you will see that perhaps 95-plus or 98 per cent of his documents have been disclosed. He is a witness, Your Honour, by virtue of the position that he held, who will assist, in our opinion, in providing an overall picture of the -- the Accused's position and the situation during the relevant period. 
So, for those reasons, Your Honour, we believe that it's important that he is a witness who is able to give his evidence at the beginning. Can I say, Your Honour, also, that I think I wrote to the 
Trial Chamber indicating there were some 11 documents that needed to be translated into French about a week or two ago. The current situation -- and we are asking for daily updates -- are that of those 11 there are now only three remaining that need to be translated into the working language of the Defence. There are some, I think, 14 documents that need to be translated into English, but those -- there's only three which need to be translated into French, which is the -- as you -- as my friend points out -- is the language of the Defence. 
Can I say, Your Honour, that we are -- whilst the language section won't give us any 100 per cent undertakings, we are confident that we will get that document and we will be able to disclose it unredacted along with all the other unredacted documents in accordance with the order -- the witness protection order which, as Your Honour may be aware, was a rolling 21-day disclosure. We, in fact, are going to give all disclosure. We are not going to do it on a rolling basis. We're going to give -- give it all. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very important. It is clear experience that this role in disclosure very often just causes problems. The policy you are adopting now -- and I think this Chamber would have changed that order had it been necessary -- would be in a short case like this, full disclosure of all documents about 21 days before the trial starts. Is that what you are going to do? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, there is one witness who is the second-to-last witness, who we are still unsure whether we will call. We are continuing to review. And for reasons which I wouldn't want to go in open court, 
Your Honour, in respect of that particular witness -- and, that witness only, we are only wishing to wait to see how the trial proceeds as to whether or not we, in fact, call the witness. And so for that reason we were wanting to hold back in respect of that person. 
The only other issue, if -- if we are talking about disclosure issues is in respect of Dr. Des Forges, who is listed -- I don't know if you want to come to that later. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, later. 
@MR. MOSES:
Okay. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What about this illegible document, ALG18, what do you do with that? That's not a translation problem. That's a question of understanding the document. Is that simply unsolvable? 
@MR. MOSES:
We intend to provide to the Defence unredacted, with all the other statements on the 15th of December. And if they are -- really, I don't know that we can take that much -- much further than providing it to the Defence in its entirety. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. So, all disclosures will be made in an unredacted form by 15th December, except for one witness. All witness statements will be made available in French and, in fact, there are only three lacking for the time being. 
@MR. MOSES:
That's what I've been informed, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's good news. That's good news, isn't it? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Of course, that's a beautiful promise, Your Honour, we're insisting, really. My colleague just said in order to go the importance that he attaches to Witness ALG. We have difficulty with that witness, because ALG's penned statement have not been translated. ALG18 also is illegible; it cannot be read. We would like to obtain those documents based on the time frame set in the order of this Court. And we also would want to have all other unredacted statements disclosed. I'm insisting on this, 
Your Honour, because there was some statements disclosed redacted and the names were all blacked out. Some of the documents are so redacted that they are of no use -- absolutely of no use. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But what we are hearing now is that you will receive all unredacted statements except for one witness. What is the pseudonym of that witness? The one you have not decided whether to call? 
@MR. MOSES:
@WITNESS BKX: 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
He's number? 
@MR. MOSES:
Second-to-last witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, well, we note your commitment and if we hadn't had it, we would have made an order. So that is very appreciated. 
And with that, I think, Defence -- Defence? I think that in view of the fact that there is not now a commitment to disclose everything by the 15th of December and that the Chamber has noted it and said that the Prosecution would be under an order if it had not done it voluntarily, I think your insistence has been listened to. So it's not only a promise, it is going to become a reality. 
When it comes to the document which is illegible, that is a problem and I'm sure everyone will try to see whether there are other versions of that document, but if it is not, well then, that is simply a problem and then we can't use it and it's a non-issue. 
Is there more to be said about the matters we have discussed, so far? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Your Honour, he's an important witness. He has made several statements in connection with this trial and from what we've learnt; he has also made statements in regard to some other trials. And I would want to us to have that document disclosed even if it is illegible so as to know whether we can use it in any manner whatsoever. I have not seen that document, so I can't say any further. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now referring to Witness ALG, and with other words, to document ALG18. Have I understood this correctly? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That is the case, you have understood correctly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this document ALG18, do you have a copy of it? This illegible document? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, and we are intending to disclose it on the 15th of December. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good. All right, nothing prevents you from partial disclosure earlier, of course, should you so wish? 
@MR. MOSES:
Other than material which may identify the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but if the document is illegible -- 
@MR. MOSES:
Translation say it's illegible, Your Honour, my Kinyarwanda is not much better than my French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. Haven't we now covered both disclosure and translation as well as the requirements listed in Rule 73 bis (iv) (a) to (d)? That seems to follow from the documentation available. Would you agree with us there, Defence, we have dealt with the pre-trial brief in Roman (i). Are there any admissions, let me ask that question? That is, little Roman (ii). 
@MR. MOSES:
Those which there are, Your Honour, are included in the pre-trial brief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good and then moving to Roman (iv) (a) to (d), by the 15th, all elements in those four letters will be there. And I understand you have already estimated the length of time required for each witness; the points in the indictment on which each witness will testify, and a summary of the facts on which each witness will testify -- except for the four, and the pseudonym of each witness and from the 15th, Defence will have the names. Do we agree that this is the situation? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Your Honour, just that in the brief that we filed in reply to the Prosecutor's motion regarding the transfer of detainees from Rwanda, in our brief we had sought disclosure of the court records of those witnesses -- witnesses who are either in detention or on trial. For us, it's a very important matter. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are so fast, Maître Cantier, that you are jumping out of Roman (iv) into the next issue. 
Let us deal with your issue now. I understand you then that you agree that everything within 73 bis (B) have been settled. And now we will deal with the judicial documents in Rwanda which certainly represent a problem. Where are we there, Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour, there are five witnesses who are either detained or provisionally released who are on the updated list. We have in relation to witnesses ALG, UB and GLJ copies of -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last one was?
@MR. MOSES:
GLJ, number 9 on the list, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
ALG is detained? 
@MR. MOSES:
Provisionally released. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Yes? 
@MR. MOSES:
All right, we have a large number of documents from the judicial files in relation to those three witnesses that will all be disclosed on the 15th of December. 
In respect of Witness BUO, we have a copy of a judgement involving that witness. We have written to the Rwandan authorities asking for us to be able to inspect their judicial file, and they have agreed to that. We had -- it is apparently a file -- because it involves a file involving many accused, several thousand documents, we are having someone go through that file and to take the documents which 
are -- relate to Witness BUO and we will disclose those when we receive them. We expect that to be done within -- by the 20th of December. 
I don't know how many documents there will be. As I say, we will disclose the judgement relating to this person, which we have in Kinyarwanda and we will disclose that on the 15th of December. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have now mentioned four pseudonyms, and the fifth? 
@MR. MOSES:
The fifth is Witness AWE who is on the list at number 22. Once again, we have written asking to see that person's judicial records and the Rwandan government has agreed. The difficulty that arises in respect of that witness, Your Honour, is that it appears that his file cannot be located. 
I'm aware that this witness is also listed in another trial, and several months ago, a similar enquiry was made and a similar result -- namely, they simply don't appear to have been able to locate his judicial file. It's not through the Rwandan government not being willing or us not being vigilant and not wanting to get hold of it, Your Honour, it's simply that at this stage, it has not been located. So we don't have possession of any documents in relation to his judicial file. Other than one statement which he gave himself in relation to the file which he had a copy of in his own possession which he's given to us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's start with the first three: ALG, UB and GLJ. There, you said, that you had a large number of judicial documents that you are going to disclose on the 15th. You do not know whether you have the complete files in relation to these three, but you have what you know of. How many of these documents are -- or have to be translated into French? 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, most of those documents -- none of them are Rule 66 documents. So, really once we disclose them, I -- I was certainly not of the opinion that it was our responsibility to -- to have them translated. I don't -- some of them -- most of them tend to be statements made by other individuals relating to the witness, if you understand what I'm getting at, Your Honour. They're not -- and so most of those are in Kinyarwanda. They're not -- and we certainly haven't asked for them to be translated. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But when we are in trial from the 8th of January, the Defence will wish to use some of these documents for impeachment purposes, and how do we ensure that the Court and the two parties understand what's going on? And it's not easy for the Defence to select these documents based on the Accused's knowledge of Kinyarwanda. Of course, he's fluent in that language, but the Defence would wish to have a rough idea so as to know which portions to focus on; that is the problem. 
We cannot possibly translate all judicial documents from Rwanda. That is impossible and that has never been done. The task in this trial, as in other trials, will be to ensure that we have translated the relevant portions of those documents that the parties are able to encircle and how do we do that? 
@MR. MOSES:
Well, Your Honour, to be blunt I don't know if any of these documents are at all relevant. And it's really only for the Defence to decide which, if any of them, fall within really -- they're really are potentially 
Rule 68 material. But it's really for the Defence to say these are documents which we consider are important. I don't know. I'm going to disclose them all to them for them to decide which of them are relevant. I don't know which of them -- if any, none of them may be relevant, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
As of yet, you have no intention to use any of them. You are just disclosing them? 
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely, we have no intention to use them at all.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you still have the problem, Defence, that you want to know what this is about. And we are now back to the question you just raised. How do you envisage to tackle this problem? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Your Honour, we would like to know -- well, for each of the witnesses who are in a different situation, some of them have already been tried, if I've understood this clearly. Others are accused, not yet tried. Now, I would like to see the documents which -- on which the Rwandan courts relied in making their decisions. I hear some are on provisional release. Under what circumstances, under what conditions? Subject to what decisions? That decision on provisional release was pronounced on what basis? I would like to see those testimonies (unintelligible) against the said witness. So that's what we want to know. And there again, we haven't seen those documents and it's difficult for me to go any further. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What you just said was absolutely legitimate and understandable. Now, it is clear that you will receive all those documents on the 15th of December. The problem is that you need to understand them. You have the Accused speaking Kinyarwanda. How many investigators do you have in your team, one or two? Do they both speak Kinyarwanda? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Your Honour, for now, I had two investigators and later on, in the very near future, I'll just have one. Yes, he understands Kinyarwanda -- that's in answer to your question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's helpful, because then, I think, what can assist you in this difficult situation is to ask the investigator and the Accused to read those Kinyarwanda documents and then during your consultations with the Accused and the investigators you will be able in a global way to sort out what you think is interesting for your purposes. 
And once you have identified either the documents -- or let me say, rather, the portions of the documents, because in relation to a witness who has been acquitted or convicted together with another 25 accused, you will most likely only be interested in the portions relating to that witness. With other words, you will be able to narrow down what you need to have translated in consultation with the team. And once you have made that identification, you can come to the registry and to the Chamber and say: "We need this translated; we want this translated." 
Let me say that there is no absolute right to have all this translated. One way of solving this is that you will have a working translation within the team, since you master the two languages. And then if you want to use portions of the documents in the court -- and that you will wish to do in connection with your impeachment -- you will then read into the record through the Kinyarwanda interpreter the portions you think are relevant. And in this way, we will be able to reduce the number of documents to be translated to a minimum and in that way, we can make this work, in spite of our common challenges. What do you say? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Your Honour, I understand the method you're suggesting. I think it's a good one. Just that -- and I say this quite sincerely, I am not as -- talking about the time that will be required to perform such a work, you heard there's a whole pile of documents that I have to receive or will be disclosed by the 
15th of December. I'll be fully available but I'm not sure I'll be able to carry out that work -- and I'm thinking out aloud. The first two witnesses, for instance, if I have to raise issues with them. Say, in fact, of the two witnesses, it's only ALG who is still on trial. We can try, but I can't be too specific as to the time that we'd require; namely, to get to what we want. That is obtaining a translation for those portions that are relevant and which we intend to use. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But what I hope will then be the method is that after the identification of the relevant portions within the team, you will have made, by your investigator, or by the Accused, some kind of a not in-house but in-team translation, unofficial. And then you can get an official interpretation -- not a translation, through the court proceedings by asking the witness to read out in Kinyarwanda the portions you are interested in, thereby receiving the Kinyarwanda interpretation or the interpreter's interpretation into English and French. And then you will have on official interpretation of what you need. So the problem is not to obtain an official translation, the problem is for you to have sufficient time to read these documents, I think, practically. That's the main issue. Time, as you said. 
Okay, let' see how it develops. This was actually an additional argument in favour of looking at whether ALG really has to be number 3. It is a question, actually, but you can assess the situation. 
Another method could be to have him in-chief and postpone the cross-examination until you have had sufficient time to read his file. That will require that ALG, as a detained witness can stay in Arusha for some time, and in order for that to happen it will be necessary that the Tribunal as such has sufficient capacity for all the five detained witnesses, plus the other detained witnesses in other trials, in view of the fact that we have limited number of safehouses. But with planning, this can be done. 
@MR. MOSES:
And also, Your Honour, he won't be held in detention because he's provisionally released. I don't believe they hold provisionally released prisoners in prison. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The expert? 
@MR. MOSES:
If I can address, Your Honour, briefly in respect of that. Firstly, we are going, in fact, going to alter the summary at the end of the pre-trial brief as to what she is to testify about. Because I think in the summary there, we had said she was going to testify regarding the history. And bearing in mind the Appeals Court ruling regarding the existence of genocide, we're not going to -- not say "waste" -- we're not going to lead any evidence in respect of that. 
There are two issues that she has been asked to provide a report in respect of. One is in relation to the issue of civilian self defence; it's something which, Your Honour, is probably aware that she has testified about previously. The other issue is she has been asked to provide some analysis of the Radio Rwanda broadcasts involving the Accused that were made during April to June 1994. 
Dr. Des Forges indicated to me that she would be able to provide her report by mid-December. I'm writing again to her today. I thought I'd wait until the end of the status conference, Your Honour, once again, just to confirm that we would need to have, I think, her report. Whilst some of it will be based on previous reports so that in terms of translation issues, I believe we may be able to use what translations there have been previously, it may be that there is some updating of parts of that portion of her report and then there will need to be a translation of the other part of her report mainly regarding the media side of things, Your Honour. 
So, perhaps, if I can also undertake to advise my learned friends and Your Honour as soon as I hear back from Dr. Des Forges as to the progress that she has made on the report and the expected date that it will be filed. And I would undertake to do that, Your Honour, as soon as I hear back from her. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But she is behind the letters ADF on your list --
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Namely, number 28, so she is testifying at the end? 
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the deadline -- 
@MR. MOSES:
-- is 21 days, I think, before her ... however, for practical purposes, Your Honour, I think in terms of translations, I mean, I'm aware of the rule regarding it, but I'm also aware of the practical realities. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, your intention to do this as soon as possible is good in order to ensure translation into French as soon as possible, even if she's testifying very late and I assume that this report will not be too voluminous? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, it won't be, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything to be said about the expert? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Nothing, in particular, Your Honour. We've dearly noted the fact that we'll be getting the French version by the 15th of December. 
@MR. MOSES:
That's not correct, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't have the French CaseView here now, but what was said in English is that Mr. Moses is trying to obtain the original in French by the 15th of December, but he is still struggling to achieve that aim. As for the French, that's a different matter, but he's aim is to get the English as soon as possible so that you can get the French as soon as possible. And at any rate, three weeks before the witness testifies as required by the rules. So this would be unproblematic. 
The number of witnesses for each week. One of the reasons why we really need a high number per week is exactly matters that we went through now. Let us assume that the Defence will stand up and say, "I cannot perform my cross-examination of ALG because I need one to two days to look at the judicial documents." They will argue that they haven't had time enough. Then, we need a couple fallback witnesses for the first week, and this may happen many times. 
For that reason, it is better to have too many than too few, even if we all know that there is a limit for how long you can keep witnesses here. It's a difficult assessment, that one.
@MR. MOSES:
It is, Your Honour, and I must say I don't appear to have had particularly good luck in my previous six years at the Tribunal in having witnesses dealt with speedily. So in my -- in other situations, Your Honour, I've had problems with witnesses because they've, in fact, been kept up to two to three weeks, have had to return, and have been particularly upset, and Your Honour is quite right. It is a balancing exercise. I indicated in my email to your chef de cabinet, which was copied to my friend, the basis on which we had prepared the list; namely, that whilst it's not a precise science, if the witnesses were to take approximately the same length of time in cross-examination as in evidence-in-chief, then it would seem to me that the schedule that we have provided is -- is a fair one subject to what Your Honour says regarding a witness such as ALG. 
I had always thought, Your Honour, that once the detainees were here, if there were any gaps, we could, as it were, use the detainees as filler witnesses. Now, the problem I have with that so far as the first week is concerned is my -- the information which I have received is that the Beechcraft doesn't -- is out of action, being serviced until approximately the 6th. It may not be that we are able get a flight for detained witnesses until sometime during that first week -- full week of trial. 
Once they are here and we have had some time to settle them in and to see them, Your Honour, perhaps from the second week onwards, should there be a problem regarding scheduling and that, for example, there are witnesses (inaudible) available and there is time left free, it would be my intention to move those witnesses up the list as it were, so that there's no court time that is wasted. 
The only problem I foresee is that during that initial week where it may be that the -- I -- I simply don't know when the detained witnesses will be transferred to Arusha. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do they come from the same institution? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
They all come from the Kigali area? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is something one has to take into account when preparing for cross-examination. That we may not always be able to stick to the sequence on the list and what we hear now is that the detained witnesses may be used as tools to fill up time. So when you prepare your working schedule, you may wish to give the detained witnesses a bit more priority, even if they figure further down on the list so as not to be taken by surprise because suddenly they may jump upwards on the list. 
All right, anything else? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Defence would like to say most respectfully, that is, with respect to detained witness, it was agreed that a pile of documents regarding their judicial documents will be disclosed to us. And, in addition, in a language that we will need to translate in order to use them, which means, 
Your Honour, that if we're talking about filling the gaps in the sequence of appearance of witnesses, the Defence will need a lot more time so as to be able to question those witnesses. I think that clarification was required. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I'm sure you also listened to my clarification about 15 minutes ago where I suggested a working method as to how we can solve this together. And the working method is that as soon as you get these documents on the 15th, it's important to individualise through these interpretation techniques what you need, and then when you need more time in order to familiarise yourself with documents, we will hear you. We will hear you and see whether we can accommodate you. I am sure you are going, when you receive this bundle of documents from the detainees, you will start with -- say, ALG, UB and GLJ since they are the three first on the list. I assume that will be practical. 
Are there any other matters we need to deal with today? Let me simply say that for the duration of this Prosecution case -- and we have to finish it in one segment, what is not heard within that segment will not be heard, and we will then move on to a new slot which will be the Defence case, and that slot will be fixed in consultation with both parties. I assume it's too early to do it now, but if you wish to indicate a month for that slot, you can do it already now, because you may be busy and you may know approximately your schedule for 2007. 
But let me first say about the Prosecution case, there can be no need to remain in Arusha for Defence counsel longer than say the 1st of March. By then, the Prosecution case will be over and that is a maximum assessment and it is the expectation of the Chamber that less weeks will be required. I'm saying this in order to facilitate your professional life and family life. 
@MR. CANTIER:
I'm obliged. I don't have any answer. I have no suggestion to make. I don't know where we will be when we shall have heard the Prosecutor's case. It's my very first appearance -- or experience before your Court. And so that restricts my ability to imagine things. 
I would be able to give you a more enlightened and more informed answer when we shall have heard the Prosecutor. What I would ask of you is that we have the time that would be required for us to carry out our work. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly. In a single accused case, I would estimate based on experience from previous single accused cases, that you will wish between four to eight weeks for your investigations. We will not move into the Defence case immediately after the Prosecution case. We will give you a gap. And this would imply that the Defence case could, for instance, start the 30th of April just to indicate a possible scenario. But you can come back to us on that later on, but the expectation of the Chamber will be that you will need no more than two months. And may be you will need less, but that depends on the evidence and this is premature. It's too early for you to say anything now, of course. 
@MR. CANTIER:
I am obliged to you. We will start working on these matters, the issues of rebuttals and other evidence. Of course, I have heard what you've said with respect to the time frame -- 4 to 8 weeks. I'll give you my own view when we shall have finished hearing the Prosecution witnesses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I'm sure you have already carried out investigations in preparation of what is going to happen from the 8th of January and two months would really be, I think, a maximum. So please, when you plan your work take that into account because this is all part of a very, very complicated puzzle to ensure that all trials fit together. It's a very complicated thing to plan all these trials together. So that's why we are hoping to receive your understanding there. 
Is there anything else we have to deal with during this status conference? 
@MR. MOSES:
Nothing other than to say, Your Honour, we are constantly revising -- will revise as we go through. It may be that we drop two or three of those witnesses which will free up some more time. And if we are going to change the order, we're not going to ambush the Defence. I will give as much notice as I possibly can -- bearing in mind when I find out that there are any difficulties that arise. And I do -- I do expect and we have had, I think, a frank and open relationship between the parties and hopefully that will continue and make things go as smoothly as they can. Thank you, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Defence, any closing remarks? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Obliged, Mr. President. Not really. I see no other issue that we need to raise today. My colleague can count on our commitment in the course of these proceedings and to ensure that the trial is fair; that it would be expeditious -- but, above all, fair. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we agree that we will then meet on Monday at 8:45 in a courtroom to be announced? We will meet for the pre-trial conference, because according to the rule, that is obligatory. But based on what we have done now, it is the expectation of the Chamber that that conference will be, more or less, empty. There will be nothing to address because everything will have been sorted out. 
Maybe it will take five minutes and then we will move directly into the opening of the trial with the opening statement of the Prosecution, which will probably not take more than half an hour. And then, we call the first two witnesses, the investigator and ****************, which should be done on the first day? 
@MR. MOSES:
I hope so, Your Honour, yes, subject to cross-examination, if any, in respect of those witnesses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But your intention is not to have the investigator in the box for more than an hour? 
@MR. MOSES:
All I intend to have the investigator do is simply stand there and say, "I took these photographs. These are documents I have obtained from the database. I wish to produce them." That's it in a nutshell. Now, that obviously may take an hour or it may take a little longer, but that's basically it, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And we will see how this develops. But the third witness may need to be in the waiting room then later that day. 
The Court is then adjourned. 
I thank both parties for the very practical and helpful way you have contributed to the proceedings today. And wish you all the best until the 8th of January. 
Thank you very much. 
The Court is adjourned.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Defence. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, Happy New Year to the Tribunal for the year 2007. 
My name is François Cantier, lead counsel for Mr. Renzaho; with me, Mr. Barnabé Nekuie, who is a lawyer and co-counsel; and my team is made up of Julie Veillette, legal assistant, and Maïdou Sicre, legal assistant as well. 
Mr. President, we shall be writing down the names of the persons I have just mentioned so that they may enter the record properly. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very kind of you. Thank you. 
Do we agree that we can now start with the trial, there are no pending issues which need to be disposed of in a pre-trial conference? I noted the revised portions of the pre-trial brief on the 15th of December. Is there anything else? 
What is the view of the Prosecution? Are we trial-ready? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Defence. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. I would like, however, to briefly state the Defence situation and mention up front that, as far as we are concerned, the conditions for commencing the trial are not yet met. And these are the reasons why: In accordance with what was decided at the status conference of 6 December -- on the 18th of December, there was disclosure here of some documents relating to article -- Rule 66, as well as other documents that were forwarded to us under Rule 68. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is a voluminous pile of documentation which is of great importance and add up to about 42 folders. And we have not yet photocopied all the documents that were disclosed to us. Let me say further that this disclosure was done just before Christmas, at which time part of the team, including myself, had already gone home for holidays. So the first problem we face is that of reading through those documents and then, secondly, seeing what use we can make of them in view of the commencement of the trial. 
The second problem we encounter relates to an issue which we have already raised, pertaining to the disclosure of the legal or judicial records of five witnesses. Part of those documents we were expecting to receive in Kinyarwanda following information from the Prosecutor's office. In accordance with our agreement, Mr. President, we did assign one of our investigators to read through those documents, and he did so, along with the Accused. In that exercise, we were able to identify a number of documents which appear to be relevant to cross-examination in particular, but we were not able to translate those documents, given that, as you would understand, the judicial recess was also a constraint for us. That is the situation of the Defence today. 
And, furthermore, Mr. President, Your Honours, let me say that, Saturday afternoon, 
Prosecutor Jonathan Moses told us that the initial scheduling of witnesses had been amended or modified for reasons relating to the health of a witness. So Witness ALG and XXY are experiencing health problems, and, therefore, the -- the proposition from the Prosecution is that we begin with two other witnesses. And you would understand, Mr. President, that we did not have the time even to inform the Accused of this information because the information was only made available to us on Saturday afternoon. And I am sure that the Accused is only finding out about this here and now. I didn't have time to inform him of this information, namely, that two witnesses be -- will be replacing the two initially scheduled witnesses. 
That is the situation of the Defence team today, Mr. President, and all of these have a bearing on the significance, or the importance, of the file, the volume of documents that were disclosed, as well as the transcripts that we need to go through, that is, the transcripts of witnesses who have already been heard before other jurisdictions. And this adds up to hundreds and hundreds of pages, yet these are important documents that we need to read through in order to prepare our Defence -- or, our cross-examination properly. 
Now, in relation to the judicial records which I mentioned, we have sorted through those documents and identified those requiring translation. This will make it easier for the translation services to work more conveniently. And I am referring particularly to three decisions from the judicial -- from the judiciary relating to three witnesses expected to appear here. 
It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that we believe that it may be reasonable to grant the Defence a few days, at the most one week, so that we may prepare adequately to start the proceedings. That will be my humble application. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Prosecution, what are the witnesses for this week, according to your suggestion? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour. We had arranged for six witnesses initially to be brought across from Rwanda for this week. The first is the investigator, Rajesh Neupane. The next witness we had requested was ALG, then XXY, AFB, UL, and DBN. Those were the six that we had initially arranged for. Now, we were advised last week that Witness DBN had typhoid and would not be brought across for another couple of weeks, till he's recovered. All those remaining five witnesses who were all scheduled for this week are all in Arusha. 
In respect -- sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Including Witness ALG? 
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
@MR. MOSES:
On Saturday when -- they arrived on Friday, Your Honours, and on Saturday, when we went to see ALG and XXY, ALG has malaria but is recovering and should be able to testify later this week. XXY is needing to see a doctor. He has some gastric problems which prevented him from being seen yesterday. 
Now, I arrived back from the safe house at midday and immediately -- on Saturday and immediately informed the Defence of those issues and that we were proposing to start with the investigator and to follow the investigator with AFB, UL, and then either ALG or XXY, depending on the health situation of those witnesses. 
So, Your Honours, it is a situation where there is -- certainly all these witnesses were expected to testify this week. In fact, with due respect, that one may testify a day or two earlier is, in our submission, something which shouldn't prevent the cross-examination from commencing. 
Your Honours, can I just briefly also comment on a couple of other matters that were touched on by the Defence? Firstly, we disclosed, in accordance with the material, on the 15th of December with the registry. It wasn't the 18th. 
In respect of the judicial records, all the documents that we are in possession of have been given to the Defence. My friend referred to three judgements. Now, the only detainee, if we could refer to it in that way, is ALG for this week. ALG does not have a judgement, so the issue concerning translation of the judgement doesn't affect any witness for this week. The other detainees are due to arrive later this week. 
It's something which Your Honours may want to comment on. We -- I think we all received Your Honour's memorandum at the end of last year, indicating that we should be prepared to sit a little later than the end of February, perhaps. And I may be second-guessing Your Honour, but that was probably due to the issue of Military I spilling over. And it may be that Your Honour can assist all of us by indicating what the proposal is for next week. Because if it is that we aren't going to be sitting next week, then it's going to be the week after that before any of the detained witnesses for whom there is any issue concerning judicial records would be testifying. That's something to bear in mind. 
I would also remind my learned friend of -- I think Your Honour made a suggestion during the status conference in December that if there were some passages which needed translation, as it were, then they could perhaps be done by way of an in-court translation. And that's certainly, I think, a proposal which has been done successfully in the past. 
So I think those are the matters so far as we are concerned. We have witnesses here. Yes, we have had to change the order, as is often the case, but we aren't bringing witnesses forward from three or four weeks hence. All these witnesses are witnesses who were due to testify this week. So in terms of any prejudice, we've tried to bring the matter to the attention to (sic) the Defence as soon as we were able. 
Unless Your Honour has any questions, those are my submissions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
Defence, any additional comments? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. The change in the order of witnesses does imply that this week we will be hearing Witness UL, who was not scheduled for this week but, according to the order that I was given, was expected to appear next week. 
Witness UL is someone who has already appeared before the Rwandan courts, and there is a judgement in his case. We would like to have that judgement translated. 
Mr. President, what my learned colleague has said relating to our discussions at the hearing of the 6th of December is understood. We had suggested at the time, Mr. President, that we work with our client or with one of our investigators, would -- that we work through all those documents in Kinyarwanda and that, if we found a particular passage to be of importance to us, then it would be translated in court. 
But, Mr. President, that is a difficult exercise, but that can be relevant only when I want to find out whether the document is relevant or not, in which case we just gloss through the document. But if we are going to do any substantive work on that document, then that approach, for all practical reasons, is not workable. We use that system to be able to identify the relevant documents and then set aside those which were not. And that does significantly cut down on the volume of documents that need translation. However, we did not go beyond that stage. 
And, Mr. President, may I say that, as a lawyer, and at the international level, I have already observed and noticed that the profession of translation and interpretation is a genuine profession. But -- you may be dealing with somebody who speaks two languages, but that person would not qualify as a translator, interpreter. The work that we do here in this Tribunal requires the kind of precision and specificity that we cannot acquire working with those types of tools. 
You see, Mr. President, I also have headed a translation team, and I am thinking here of the witness summary statements that were appended to the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief. And you will remember that the document was amended by the Prosecutor's office. It was forwarded to us in English, and we are still awaiting the French copy. And I put up the question, and my learned colleagues gave me a very kind answer, namely, that you have a bilingual person on your team and that this person could translate the document. Well, thank you for that suggestion, but I have headed an interpretation team, and this is not the same thing that I have on this team here. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there was a reference to lack of witness summaries not having been translated; is that correct? My understanding was that, when it comes to the statement of witnesses to ICTR investigators, it had all been translated. 
@MR. MOSES:
You were correct, Your Honour. I think my learned friend was referring to the amended pre-trial brief annex, which had summaries of the witnesses. And that was filed in English. I think that's what my learned friend was referring to, not the actual Rule 66 statements. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It may have been a communication problem. 
Can you confirm that, Defence, that you are only referring to lack of translation of the revised portions of the appendix to the pre-trial brief? That is what you just referred to; is that true? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Correct, Mr. President. That is correct. That's what I'm referring to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
We have considered the submissions of both parties. We note that disclosure has taken place according to the rules. We note that the issue of judicial records of witnesses from Rwanda, with other words, statements or judgements from Rwandan judicial authorities, this issue is something which is not urgent for the time being. 
As for practical problems, we will hear the Defence in connection with individual witnesses, should there be matters that you want to draw our attention to. So you can come back to specific problems in connection with individual witnesses, and we will then see how to tackle them, should there be any inconvenience for the Defence. 
But based on the rules and the factual situation as it has been described so far, there is nothing preventing us from starting the trial this morning with the opening statement and then the investigator taking the stand. 
We will then move from the pre-trial conference to the trial stage.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is, then, the opening of the trial. 
Prosecution, you have the floor for the opening statement 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
May it please Your Honours, the préfecture of Kigali-ville was created in May 1990. This was a new préfecture, the most important préfecture in Rwanda, the heart of the country, the capital city. 
Who was chosen by the president, Juvénal Habyarimana, as the very first préfet of Kigali-ville? Someone with experience in administration at préfecture level? No. It was the Accused, 
Tharcisse Renzaho, who was chosen to take on this new role. And he was a soldier, lieutenant colonel at the time, not an administrator. This was no chance decision. The defendant was chosen because he was a hard man of military background, whom the president could rely on to achieve the aims of the government in the capital. And his appointment was well timed. Renzaho became préfet by presidential decree on 5 October 1990, just as the RPF invasion of Rwanda began. 
From the government's point of view, the appointment of Renzaho proved a shrewd choice. Immediately after he took office, a massive roundup of Tutsi so-called infiltrators took place in the capital. Renzaho oversaw this and their subsequent imprisonment, without charge, for a considerable period before international pressure forced the release of many of them. 
This was just a taste of what was to come, for over the following years, Renzaho assisted in the preparation of the genocide, both as a public official and a private individual. He allowed one of his homes to become a base for the Interahamwe -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you slow down a little bit, please. 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
He allowed one of his own homes to become a base for the Interahamwe to meet prior to training in secret because, with the advent of the multiparty system in 1991, there was a prohibition on party militia. And he, himself, recruited Interahamwe from among youths at the school. Weapons were amassed at the préfecture office, and, just before the 6th of April 1994, Renzaho, in collusion with the minister of defence, drew up a list of civilians for recruitment for what was called the civil defence programme, something which the Prosecution will show was nothing but a ruse for providing training and arms to hardline civilians to assist in a programme of genocide. 
So what was the Accused's role after the 6th of April 1994? As préfet, he was the officer of the authority of the state and the representative of the government in Kigali-ville. One of the key duties of the préfet was to ensure peace and public order and the security of all citizens, as well as their property, within his préfecture. Renzaho did none of these things. Instead, he participated in the massacre of Tutsi citizens and the looting and destruction of their property over the following months. 
There can be no question that a war was going on and that this war was taking place in Kigali, as elsewhere in Rwanda. But this cannot justify the killing or causing of harm to innocent Tutsi in government-occupied areas of the city, which is exactly what happened over the hundred days following the shooting down of the president's plane. 
The Prosecution will show that, in these government-controlled areas, the authority of Renzaho did not diminish after April the 6th. Indeed, after the 12th of April when the interim government moved away from Kigali to Gitarama, Renzaho was left in charge of the capital. He remained there as the most senior government official until early July. 
Rwanda in 1994 had a very well-structured administrative system, which connected the individual citizen to the government by a tightly knit chain of officials, from ten cell leaders up to the préfet and from him to the minister of the interior. After April 6th Renzaho continued to command this structure, dismissing those below him who were either Tutsi or moderates. He did nothing to investigate or punish the murderers of three Tutsi conseillers who were killed on 7 April. Renzaho himself dismissed the conseiller of Kicukiro and replaced him with an extremist. He replaced a conseiller with a notorious Interahamwe. He dismissed another for allegedly protecting Tutsi and providing them with food. 
The préfet of Kigali-ville had at least 200 policemen under his direct control, as well as a network of administrative officials, whose responsibility was to arrest those committing crimes. Renzaho was also able to requisition the gendarmerie at a critical time just such as this. Yet instead of using this power to stop the deliberate targeting of the Tutsi civilian population, Renzaho used these forces under his control as a means to -- Renzaho used these forces under his control as a means to his very end.
The Prosecution will show that when, for example, a notorious killer of Tutsi was brought before him for punishment, Renzaho instead rewarded the killer with petrol coupons. Although not officially under his control, the Prosecution will call evidence to show that the Interahamwe in Kigali-ville answered to Renzaho. Because, like almost everyone else in the city, they viewed the préfet with the greatest respect and as the most senior of authority figures. If Renzaho ordered them to stop killing, they would have done so. 
More than one Prosecution witness will testify that, on seeing the préfet when under attack, they wrongly believed that they were being saved because of the enormous power they knew Renzaho to wield. Yet time and time again, he let them down. By April 1994, Renzaho had been promoted to the rank of colonel in the Rwandan army. By virtue of this rank, as well as his civilian position as préfet, Renzaho also commanded respect and obedience from soldiers and, in particular, from the gendarmes whom he requisitioned. 
The préfecture office of Kigali-ville became one of the centres of the genocidal operations within the city after April 6th. It was from here that many weapons and ammunition were distributed. It was here that senior government, political, and military figures, such as Joseph Nzirorera, Laurent Semanza, and Gratien Kabiligi, as well as Interahamwe leaders such as Robert Kajuga and George Rutaganda, met. It was from the préfecture office that the means of free movement were obtained. Laissez-passers were issued by the préfet and allowed free travel through roadblocks, both inside and outside the capital city. Having requisitioned the city's fuel supplies, petrol coupons were distributed by the préfet too. 
The Prosecution makes specific allegations about the Accused's actions after the 6th of April 1994. The Prosecution will show that the Accused oversaw the construction and manning of roadblocks throughout the city. Ostensibly these roadblocks were to prevent RPF infiltrators entering or moving about the city, but, in practice, they were used to stop, identify, and kill Tutsi. Renzaho was certainly well aware that Tutsi were being targeted and killed at roadblocks throughout Kigali-ville, but he took no steps, or no meaningful steps, to stop these acts of genocide. 
Indeed, Renzaho himself encouraged the people manning roadblocks to kill Tutsi, urging greater vigilance and ordering the killers to work harder. The word "work" was a well-known euphemism for the killing of Tutsi. 
The Accused distributed weapons and ammunition, not to responsible citizens for the defence of the city, but to Interahamwe and civilians manning roadblocks and to those civilians singled out as hardliners who could assist the genocidal cause under the guise of the civil defence programme. 
After 6th April many Tutsis sought refuge at religious centres. The Prosecution specifically accuses Renzaho of ordering the killing of Tutsi at the Centre d'Education de Langues Africaines, known as CELA, C-E-L-A, St. Paul's Centre, and St. Famille church, three such sites in the heart of the city and in proximity to each other. It was at CELA that on about the 22nd of April 1994, after gathering together Interahamwe at their headquarters and providing them with weapons, Renzaho led militia to -- into the centre and oversaw the separation of about 60 Tutsi men. Some of these, who knew him from happier times, begged to be spared. Renzaho would not listen to these pleas, and the men were taken away. One witness will testify to having been amongst those selected. He will describe how the men were lined up on a mound and shot. The bodies of the victims were buried in a notorious mass grave, some of them when still alive. 
Around 1500 people sought refuge at St. Paul's. Interahamwe went there regularly with lists of people they wished to remove. Many people were killed as a result of these visits by Interahamwe. Many times the priests in charge of the centre called the préfecture office for help. None was forthcoming. On one occasion, Renzaho was telephoned and asked to intervene to prevent the killing of the refugees. Renzaho's response was simply, in French, "(French spoken)." 
On about -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which means in English, for the record -- 
@MR. MOSES:
Perhaps we will get the interpreters -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- "I don't care." 
@MR. MOSES:
"I don't care." 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
On about 14 June, a very large number of Interahamwe went to St. Paul's. The priests once again called the préfecture office for help. Renzaho did go to St. Paul's, where he greeted Interahamwe but did nothing to prevent the removing of about 60 Tutsi on the basis of a list of names bearing the stamp of the préfecture office itself. These Tutsi were tied together, led away, and killed. 
During the night of the 16th and 17th of June 1994, a large number of these surviving Tutsi refugees at St. Paul's were rescued by the RPF. It is the Prosecution case that this angered Renzaho so much that he ordered a revenge attack on the Tutsi civilians who were still at St. Famille. At the parish there were perhaps 5,000 refugees. 
On the 17th of June, Renzaho went to St. Famille, whilst Interahamwe and soldiers surrounded the refugees and opened fire on them. Renzaho ordered this attack. And when a very large number of Tutsi had been killed, he ordered the militia to stop. They obeyed him, thus evidencing again the authority of the Accused and his ability to prevent the massacre of Tutsi, had he wanted to. 
Tutsi men were not the only targets of the genocidal campaign in Kigali-ville. The Prosecution will call evidence to show that the rape of women was widespread from after 6th April. The Prosecution accuses Renzaho not only of responsibility for failing to prevent or punish acts of rape but of actively encouraging and supporting them. 
Renzaho described Tutsi woman as food for the soldiers, telling militia to spare them for that purpose. The administrative officials beneath him reported regularly of incidents of rape in their areas, yet he did nothing to investigate, let alone punish, those responsible because the rape of Tutsi women was an inherent part of the genocide against this group. 
During the genocide, Renzaho was clearly aware of the international focus on Kigali-ville, which was the capital. He made several statements to the effect that those taking part in the killings should be careful not to attract the attention of the international community, and the press in particular. He ordered the clearing of bodies from the streets and their burial in mass graves so that they would not be photographed by foreigners. He spoke on the radio regularly, giving mixed messages, but it was clear to those around him that anything Renzaho said which might be interpreted favourably was simply a front put on for the international community. And the actions and inactions of the Accused revealed his true intentions. 
Your Honours, with the office of the préfet, which was granted to the Accused on 5 October 1990, came a great deal of responsibility. Renzaho was given charge of the people of the city of Kigali, both Hutu and Tutsi alike. It was his duty to take care of them, to maintain peace and public order, and to ensure their safety and security. He was given the means to do so, in his network of administrative officials, his police, and the gendarmerie. Had he wished to, after April the 6th, 1994, he could have helped his Tutsi citizens. He could have brought order. He could have made arrest (sic). He could have ensured the security of refugee centres. Instead, he betrayed that part of the people -- his people who were most vulnerable, and he did so with genocidal intent. 
The Accused is now being held to account for his actions and faces six separate counts in the indictment: Genocide, including acts of rape, both for his individual acts and for those as a superior; alternatively, complicity in genocide; murder as a crime against humanity for his individual acts and as a superior; rape as a crime against humanity as a superior; murder as a war crime, both for his individual acts and as a superior; and, finally, rape as a war crime as a superior. 
The Prosecutor has the burden of proving these charges beyond a reasonable doubt. To do so, we will call a range of witnesses to prove the case against the Accused. Some are victims, some are co-perpetrators, some are neither. These witnesses come from a variety of ethnic groups and differing social and educational backgrounds. What they all have in common, however, Your Honours, is their evidence against the Accused, which the Prosecutor says will satisfy Your Honours as to the guilt of Tharcisse Renzaho in respect of the crimes for which he has been charged.
Please, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Unless there is anything else to be said, Defence counsel? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
The Defence would like to say a few words as the trial is beginning. We have a few things to say regarding the trial itself, with your leave. 
Thank you, Mr. President. Yes, the Defence deemed it necessary at this stage to remind all of the importance of international justice, a decisive instrument in the fight against impunity and (unintelligible) of progress -- the rule of law and the (unintelligible). It underscores the essential nature of the decisions which this Tribunal has to render towards fostering the basic values of mankind and for purposes of history. And for us, the players of this justice system, who, Mr. President, Your Honours, come like you all here with our own personal backgrounds and which is usually characterised by militancy in the area of human rights. 
We consider this justice as one which should be exemplary and which has to scrupulously uphold the principles which are the bases and the justification: Firstly, that of a fair trial. If the proceedings before this Tribunal and that is the extraordinary contribution of this new international justice are individual, they concern people involved and implicated in a conflict which pitted them against another camp. The fact that this Tribunal, for the moment, is judging on the -- the suspects of one of the belligerents, whereas it is known that crimes were committed by the other belligerents, with undoubtedly the fair nature of proceedings -- when we look at the Renzaho case, for instance, the Court just heard the significance of the charges against him -- or, rather, the accusations. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, we all know that Mr. Renzaho has pleaded not guilty. In our matter, there were dangerous mistakes, which, if confirmed, would prevent Mr. Renzaho from enjoying a fair trial. It is common knowledge that Mr. Renzaho, for many people who listened to Rwandan and international stations, it is known that Mr. Renzaho has been and remains a strong opponent of the Rwandan regime. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, nobody in this world is unaware of the strict and severe control that the power in Kigali is putting on Rwandan population. And we know that they use such judicial and parajudicial institutions like the Gacaca; major international organisations, like Amnesty International, relay such issues. And in this condition, I am thinking about a report recently prepared by that institution. Accordingly -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Maître. This worked very well. Could I just now ask you to slow down a little bit. 
Thank you.

@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. I am making efforts to speak slowly and distinctly but sometimes I fail, so I will see. 
The Defence is against the peculiar backdrop of Rwanda as it stands now, how the freedom of speech of those living in Rwanda and who come to testify here will be upheld. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this question takes its very importance in this present case. This is the reason why I'm raising it, because I submit that several of the witnesses who we met and who were ready to come and testify before your Court in favor of Mr. Renzaho have now refused to do so. And this goes to the point of refusing any contact, whatsoever, with the Defence teams. Insofar as the witnesses we meet do not believe in the effectiveness of the protective measures taken by the Tribunal, especially by its Kigali branch, which is permanently monitored by the officials of the country who are fully aware of all work is going on and what is being said there. It is the former Prosecutor of the Tribunal publicly acknowledged that when she was at the helm of the Prosecution office our telephone conversations were systematically monitored by Rwandan authorities. The recent developments from France and the threats lingering on the heads of certain Rwandan officials have further worsened the situation of the Defence, two of which members, on account of their nationality, have been declared persona non grata in Rwanda. 
If, as Mr. Cruvelier, someone who knows your Tribunal very well, stated, is justice should (unintelligible) that of the vanquished because for knowledge of the international community, at least, it must preserve its basic principles, which are very valuable for today and tomorrow for purposes of posterity and progress of mankind and, in this connection, I'm referring to the United Nations Security Council, which set up this Tribunal, and which tells you, Mr. President, that the trials have to end at the earliest possibility. Yes, there is an emergency situation, but we have loved that Security Council to make haste at that time when Rwandans were being massacred. 
Now, let me move slowly, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the name you just referred to was spelled C-R-U-V-E-L-I-E-R. Please proceed.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President. I think I was not mistaken when I mentioned Mr. Cruvelier. C-R-U-V-E-L-I-E-R, is the one who authored the book on your Tribunal titled The Tribunal --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I just wanted the spelling correct. Just proceed. Thank you so much.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, sir. I was referring to the pressures which are coming now from the Security Council to this tribunal to end its mandate as soon as possible. We are here to participate in this justice system and you can also count on our cooperation, insofar as we consider that a fair nature of the trial is not fundamentally undermined. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, we are not employees of the justice, let alone mercenaries. We are citizens who exercise our activities and each and every one of us are fully aware of the indispensable nature of this task. But the performance of our mission, particularly here, is limited when we are unable to fully discharge our duties. If we realise that this trial, for the reasons I just mentioned, is undermined in the area of fairness, then the Defence will draw (unintelligible) consequences and we will request the Tribunal to do so. Thank you, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. Before calling the investigator, I noted that there was a reference to a possible judgement pertaining to Witness UL in Defence counsel's observations during the pre-trial conference. Does the Prosecution have any comment on that? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, I do, because UL was not one of the detainees. UL was tried and acquitted, so there is -- I had forgotten there is a judgement in relation to UL, but he was found not guilty. So, in terms of using it to read information to impeach the witness's credibility, it is not quite the same, with due respect, than to those judgements where a witness has been convicted.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But there is such a judgement and it exists in Kinyarwanda only? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, I think it's three or four, maybe six pages.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It is relatively brief. Thank you. And then you implicitly asked about the schedule for next week. The present scenario is that we will have a slot of the Military trial from Monday the 15th, but we will come back to you if there are any changes. So far there is no reason to believe that there will be any changes. In other words, we will proceed with Military I next week. 
Exactly the way how to organise the time will be assessed a bit later this week. 
Are we ready for the investigator? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, we are, sir, if I could have Rajesh Neupane called.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry please? Are there any documents to be distributed in connection with this investigator? 
@MR. MOSES:
There are, Your Honour. I don't know whether you want to do that before or after. I was going to take a few minutes to explain how I intend to proceed, whether we want to do that now in the absence of the investigator.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is up to you, but if we could have the documents in front of us when you explain how to proceed, that would facilitate matters. 
So, if the registry could get in touch with the Prosecution to make sure we get these documents immediately, please, and then these documents could be distributed while we are swearing the witness in.
Is there a personal information sheet for this witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
There is not, Your Honour, because he is not a protected witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But that doesn't matter. Anyhow, the spelling, the date of his birth all these particulars should be on paper. It saves time.
@MR. MOSES:
I didn't realise they had done one, Your Honour. There is one.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Good morning, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are Rajesh Neupane. What is your year of birth, please? Can we have your birth date? It is not marked on the paper.
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
20 October 1950.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And your place of birth? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Nepal, Bsopur district, B-S-O-P-U-R. It's in Nepal.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
B-H-O-P-A-L, that's what you just said.
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
B-S-O-P-U-R, Bsopur.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, we have it. This document will then be with my additional markings distributed to the parties. 
Mr. Witness, you have to tell the truth. The registry will now take your solemn declaration.
$(Declaration made by Rajesh Neupane in English)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The registry will give this to you to sign it and this will be the first document from the Prosecution. 
Is that all right with the Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
It is, Your Honour, and if I can, just before I start the evidence-in-chief, Your Honours, we distributed these documents to the Defence, I think the date of the status conference in December.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The two binders? 
@MR. MOSES:
I think they have been divided in three binders, but they are the same documents we have in front of us as two. Your Honours will see there is a schedule at the commencement of each binder, particular of exhibit folder number 1.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the judges have two binders but the Defence may have received it in three binders? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, but they are the same documents.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honour, we've prepared this to try and save time and also so that everyone is working from the same map, as it were, the same bundle. I've spoken to the Defence. At this stage they haven't indicated if there are any documents which they are opposing, objecting to, but they have requested that we go through them one by one and they will make a decision in respect of each of those documents. I had initially intended to, hopefully by consent, hand them to Your Honours. That was my initial proposal, but that's obviously the Defence prerogative and their right and that being the case, I will go through them one by one. It may be that there is an objection in respect of any particular document and if Your Honour rules in the Defence's favour then it would be my suggestion that Your Honours and -- we will remove the document simply from behind the tab. I can arrange for new Prosecution exhibit numbers, which we have given in the left-hand column as a proposed Prosecution exhibit number. We'll have to do that anyway now that the official information sheet is P. 1 and that I can amend -- we will simply leave the tab empty if the document is not admitted and we will provide Your Honours and the Defence with an updated schedule of documents so that everyone is dealing with exactly the same document.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the booth, Mr. President, the interpreters don't have any documents.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a spare copy for the interpreters? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, we don't, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, then we will make sure that there is no lack of clarity when we approach the individual documents, but if such documentation could be made available when you have that possibility it would be helpful, because these are documents you will come back to during the trial and the interpreters should certainly have it in their files.
@MR. MOSES:
Very well, Your Honour, in respect of that, also, can I distribute -- what we've done is a list of names for Your Honours and the Defence and we have copies for the interpreters.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the court reporters? 
@MR. MOSES:
We may or may not have sufficient copies at this stage, but I can easily -- it will be more relevant when the witness is testifying. I'll arrange at lunchtime.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just hold on for a moment, please.
Have the court reporters received the spelling list? One set has been distributed.
@MR. MOSES:
I'll arrange for extra copies, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You were just about to say something, Mr. Moses.
@MR. MOSES:
I was just going to say I will arrange for additional copies, and I don't believe the list is, in fact, particularly relevant where this witness's testimony is concerned, and should there be additional names that are going to be referred to by witnesses which are not in that master list, we will, at the commencement of those witness's testimony, distribute a copy of such names.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's helpful. We can then update this document which presently has 209 names, as the case moves on, and then you can simply refer to the number when you get to it, when there is a need. 
What's your next point, now, Counsel? 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I intend to proceed, as per the list of exhibits that are in the schedule commencement of the folders and I will now introduce them one by one.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have all these documents been assembled or compiled by this witness? With other words, he is in a position to comment on each and everyone of them? 
@MR. MOSES:
In some way or another, yes, they come from the database, Your Honour. He will not have necessarily personal knowledge, but they are from the OTP database.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How many documents are there where there is really a possibility that there will be an objection, because there is no need, in abstract, to go through two huge binders if, at the end of the day, it's not subject to dispute? Do you have an indication of the Defence position, Prosecution. Then we will hear the Defence afterwards to see if we can gain some time, because we are interested here in the testimony of this witness and not simply a presentation of documents, which is very time consuming.
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely, that was the purpose of putting them in the folders, as we have done it, but I spoke to the Defence yesterday. They indicated that they would know this morning what documents -- I think that was the indication I don't want to misstate it. It was my recollection they would be in a position this morning to indicate which documents they had issue with.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. Defence, could you kindly enlighten us now on the most updated position? Let us start with volume one called "schedule of documents excluding radio transcripts." That is from P. 1 to P. 63.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President, Judges. Mr. President, the Defence position was clearly made known to my learned friend yesterday concerning the documents. I would like to draw the Chamber's attention to the list of documents. There are maps of Kigali town, each body has been disclosed to us, so the Defence finds that the disclosure be made. That aside, Mr. President, Your Honours, we clearly made known to our learned friends that all the exhibits that those documents, though bulky, cannot be the subject of a comprehensive tendering process without the Defence having the opportunity to discuss the documents with the witness here. And the fact that you just put the question to the Prosecutor -- you just put the question to the Prosecutor whether the documents were all compiled by this witness and you got an answer. That was, in fact, the concern of the Defence, Mr. President, Your Honours. And we think that at this stage we cannot say that we admit this or that item of the document disclosed by the Prosecutor. We would like that each of the documents provided by the Prosecutor be discussed and the relevance made known before the document is put in. That is our position, Mr. President, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If there is nothing else to be said, I think we simply have to start and see how this develops. I assume that even if you have this list of P. 1. That can easily be changed, so would you be willing to ask for the present information sheet of this investigator being admitted as P. 1? 
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is, Mr. Mussa, will you please note that.
@MR. MUSSA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No P. 1 admitted)

Let's start.

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, can you please give the Trial Chamber your present occupation? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Sitting or -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
I'm team leader/investigator in ICTR at present. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And amongst the files which you are responsible for, do you have responsibility for the Renzaho case? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes, we have the files, the papers which these folders contain that I have personally required from the different databases and from the Rwandan government offices. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How long have you been working for the ICTR? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
I joined ICTR on 20th October.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if there will be a gap between the question and the answer, Mr. President, that will help interpretation. Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear that? There is a need for a pause between the question and answer to allow for the interpretation and, in addition to that, if you can speak a bit more slowly that will help a bit better for the transcription.
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Thank you, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We noted that you joined ICTR on the 20th of October and now which year, please? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
1995.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And prior to the Tribunal, what was your occupation? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
I was a senior police officer in Nepal police force and I was responsible for the investigation, administration of the Nepal police, where I lived, and sometime I worked under the headquarter of other offices, too. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When did you join the Nepal police, please? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
I joined the Nepal police in -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, once more for the interpreters.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are only two requests. They are very simple, because, one, pause, request two, speed. Could you both try to live up to those expectations? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Thank you, sir, I will do it. 
I joined Nepal police force in 1974.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Very well. And where are you currently residing, in terms of which country, which city? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
At present I am an officer of the Rwandan Tribunal. I am living in Rwanda, Kigali.
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm wondering if the registry could assist by having the first map shown to the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose that --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose it is well and good that the witness sees the huge map but couldn't you place it on some kind of equipment there and then the Court video system could zoom in on the map and then the witness can comment on the map and we can all see it? So could that be done, please? 
Please sit down, Mr. Witness. 
Court video system, on the top there, as always. If necessary, on the cupboard, not that way, up so that we can see it, please. 
Prosecution, can you assist? Exactly. Court video system, Mr. Tredici, can you make sure it doesn't fall down? 
Court system, zoom in, please. 
All right, first question.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness is that a map of Kigali, in fact, a Rwandan military street plan from 1994? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yeah, this is a military street plan prepared in 1994 and we retrieved it from the Rwandan authorities, and we can easily get these maps from the offices.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in other words, the answer to the question was?
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And does the map show the various secteurs of Kigali-ville as of 1994? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes, all the secteurs we can see on this map. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And a general question, in relation to the map, you are able to point out to Their Honours where the city centre, the area of the map which shows the commercial business district? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Sir, I can point out all the -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, perhaps -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In order to do this, if you could kindly leave the place where you are sitting, move over there and point it out to us, please. Make sure that you speak into the microphone which has to be switched on next to the map.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to indicate that we have no objection to the tendering of this map and, therefore, it is not necessary to go into any details about the contents of the map. We would not object to it being tendered into evidence. We will gain time by proceeding in this manner. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. That was a very helpful remark. With that in mind, is there any element that you would wish the Bench to be appraised of on this map before it is being tendered, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES:
Just one, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you point out the general area where St. Famille church is on that map? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes, I can point out. This is the main roundabout in the Kigali city, on the right-hand in this area are all the four religious institutions are (unintelligible).
@MR. MOSES:
Very well, and, for the record, the witness indicated a roundabout on the left-hand side.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's well hidden behind the microphone. You see, the way we usually proceed is that the microphone is placed on the right-hand side of the map and then you can point out standing on the right-hand side of the map instead of blocking the view from the Court video system by standing on the left side. So, Mr. Witness, could you now kindly -- all right, you've arranged it so far. Let's proceed then.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Does the map mark St. Famille church? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Here this is the St. Famille point. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, now, perhaps in release to St. Famille there has been mention of a --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, don't breathe into the microphone. 
The question? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
There has been reference to a place called CELA, are you familiar with that institution in relation to St. Famille? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes, CELA is this one institution compound that is simple centre and then after is CELA.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Without putting words in your mouth, is St. Paul adjacent to St. Famille and is CELA adjacent to St. Paul?
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes.
@MR. MOSES:
I now ask that map be tendered as Prosecution Exhibit 2.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Mussa. 
@MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour, the next exhibit is P. 2.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's noted. That is your P. 1 on the list is now P. 2. Do you need the witness where he is standing now? Is this a new map? 
$(Exhibit No. P. 2 admitted)
@MR. MOSES:
For the next three, I think, Your Honours, I should be able to do that, they are right by where he is standing now.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the next map coming up now, please.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Have a look at the next map. Do you recognise that map, Witness? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you obtain that map? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes, I got the copy of the map from St. Paul centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And briefly, what does the map show? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Here it is Jeunesse Ouvriers Catholic, that is called obrier prip stock (phonetic) and after that there is another one. Here are some schools and other establishments, different.
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you point out --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen, don't switch between languages. You are now saying that here we have a youth centre of some sort. Can you please repeat your answer in English? So what is it that you want to show to us here.
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
First I am going to the main road which approaches CELA and JOC. This is the main road called Boulevard de OAU. And here, in this point from here we enter inside JOC and this road takes us to the CELA.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses -- hold on -- the witness is now referring to a lot of places which are probably not in the spelling list or they may be but you really need to assist us now, otherwise, it is getting too complicated for the record. So, now he referred to something after CELA which we all have and then the name of the road. Can you help us, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES:
Boulevard --
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
@WITNESS OUA: 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Boulevard OUA. In other words the -- 
@MR. MOSES:
O-U-A.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The African Union Boulevard.
@MR. MOSES:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have that O-U-A Boulevard. That was the first point. Then there was a second reference.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
All I want to you to do, Witness, is point out the buildings of CELA? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
These are two buildings of the CELA.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you. 
I now wish to tender that, the Prosecution Exhibit 3, Your Honours, unless there is any objection.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what did you say -- you said, "and here is the point from where we enter the side of something." We didn't get that. What was the word you used, slowly, please.
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
This is the point from where that road it enters into JOC and CELA.
@MR. MOSES:
If I can assist, Your Honours, JOC is J-O-C, it stands for Jeunesse, J-U-N-E-S-S-E, Ouvriers, C-U-V-R-I-E-I-S (sic), Catholic, C-A-T-H-O-L-I-C.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, not on the spelling list. That was helpful. Any objections by the Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Unfortunately, yes, Mr. President. My client has just pointed out to me that it would have been appropriate for us to have that diagram in our possession so that we can talk about it with relation to the various points that have been mentioned by the Prosecution witness. In fact, my client is referring to the fact that the JOC and St. Paul centre are not in the same location. By the way, we have not been given the date on which this diagram was established and, for these reasons, we object to the tendering of that document.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know the date of this document, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
This document was prepared around 2003.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
By whom? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
This was prepared by the St. Paul centre. They have our technicians.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That disposes of that issue. There is still a need for all of us to have working copies of this document, probably in a smaller version. Is it possible to down-size these two maps so that the Defence can have it, not immediately, of course, but later.
@MR. MOSES:
We think so, but we believe we have given copies of this to the Defence. I have certainly seen a map similar to it when I spoke to the Defence yesterday.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It may well be. I cannot find these maps or small versions of them in the binder we have received.
@MR. MOSES:
We can make copies available, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. So there will then be made copies available to all of us, including the Bench, it being understood that it is the versions we have as P. 2 and now requested as P. 3 that are the exhibits of the case.
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, there is P. 2. We tried doing an 8x4 size of it yesterday and it was so -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will give up P. 2 and there was no request to that effect but we will hope that it is easier for P. 3. 
The next exhibit number here with this, I think, we have followed up the objections by the Defence. This is a document with a date and the provenance and when it comes to the need to have it available you can, in addition to inspecting the original version, which is in the registry, it can be handed to the Defence team in connection with any cross-examination they would wish to conduct on this point in relation to this witness, or subsequently, you will also, as a courtesy, if you don't have it already, receive a down-sized version of this map, if it is technically possible. 
Next number, Mr. Mussa.
@MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour it is P. 3.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
$(Exhibit No. P. 3 admitted)
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Witness, if you could please lift up the next map beneath there and is that a map which shows part of CELA, St. Paul, St. Famille and J-O-C, JOC? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
This map, it also always shows the Boulevard OUA and here is the CELA and this area is of the 
St. Paul. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And finally, St. Famille, can you see the church on that map? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Here is the main building of St. Famille and down we come, here again it is (unintelligible) centre, here a supermarket, and we go down here to vehicle premiere (phonetic) of the St. Paul. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, I would ask that that map now be produced, Your Honour, subject to any objection.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any textual annotations on this map showing the buildings which were just referred to by the witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
I can answer that. Yes, there are, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so then the map will speak for itself. Any objections concerning this document? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, and it would be the same objection as previously, namely the dating of the diagram, which is not known to us, we want to formally challenge the relevance of the document in much the same way as the previous document which has been admitted already.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know the date of this document, Mr. Witness, when it was drawn up? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
This also is part of the previous state (phonetic) we produced here, so that they have the same date, 2003, around 2003.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
These two documents having been drawn in 2003, do you know whether the textual situation changed between 1994 and 2003? Do you have any knowledge personally about this? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes, I was told and because I have been here in 1995, is that boundary walls which is now very good, one with the brick wall, they were not present there and some buildings were added.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted. And if there is a wish from any party to pursue that later during the examination, you are free to do so. 
As for the relevance, we can see that these are locations in the indictment, so this is at least allegedly of relevance. 
Next number, Mr. Mussa. 
@MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour is P. 4.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 4 admitted) 
Mr. Moses. 
@MR. MOSES:
On reflection, Your Honour, I wouldn't introduce the next map, which is very similar to that of one of the earlier maps. That will save us some time. Put that one down.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, you can put that map down and if you will lift up the final -- is that also a map of Kigali in front of you? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And there are some numbers handwritten on that map? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yeah, these are the numbers as stated by our witness. They are the point of roadblocks. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And was that Witness ALG who wrote that? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honours -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Avoid that leading element.
@MR. MOSES:
All right, Your Honours, obviously one of the witnesses later this week is ALG, who was going to talk about the map. I had thought if we could front-end some of these documents, it would save time.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly, it was only the form. You could have asked, "Do you know which witness?" 
@MR. MOSES:
Fine. On that basis, Your Honour, I would simply seek to have that admitted.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very well. Any problem with that document? 
Maybe we should have the date, Mr. Witness, and where did you get it from? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
This map was drawn by the Prosecution team in a different case and I got it from the database.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when was this done? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
I'm not sure about it, but it was done probably in 2002 or 3.
@MR. MOSES:
That information has been disclosed in a statement of ALG to the Defence and I can provide 
Your Honour, if there is any dispute about it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, any problem with this document? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Serious problems, Mr. President, Your Honours. In as the Prosecutor told you it is a map on which ALG will be questioned, I do not see why another witness should come and through him that map should be tendered for this Court. It would be appropriate for the Prosecutor to wait until ALG comes to testify to the issues which will be raised. That is why the Defence is of the view that this is not the appropriate witness for that map to be tendered and we object.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But I understood the evidence to be that this document had been drawn up by the Prosecution on the basis of information from the witness and then it is a matter of taste how to do it. I can't see any problem introducing this document now through this witness since they are actually the authors of it. 
Next number, Mr. Mussa.
@MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour, next exhibit is P. 5.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
$(Exhibit No. P. 5 admitted)
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, you can go and take your seat in the witness box. I'll provide you with -- I'm now going to hand out to Your Honours photographs which were taken by this witness. The Defence have copies of them, I have copies for Your Honours, and I have a copy for the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In terms of the schedule, this booklet, in fact, contains photo book one, two, three and four which are 6, 7, 8 and 9 on the draft schedule.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, would you please look at the first photo book. In the course of your duties as an investigator were you asked to take photographs of the CELA institution? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And when did you do that? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
This is what I have done at the end of 2005. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, the photo book one, there is a description in respect of each photograph underneath the photos. Have you looked at those descriptions and do they adequately describe the location that these photographs have been taken from? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes, they have.
@MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honour -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who made these remarks? Who wrote the subtitles under the photos? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
That I have written.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you made the photos and you wrote the subtitles? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes, sir, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you said that the photos were taken in 2005, you refer to all the photos in photo book one? Is that so? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes, Your Honour.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If there could be some pause between questions and answers, Mr. President.
@MR. MOSES:
I'm in my friend's hands here, and Your Honours' hands. I could have the witness go through each individual photo, but as they are described, I think it would save resources, unless my friends wish me to go through one by one. It would save time simply to ask that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But, for your purposes, there is no need now to do so and then we can leave it to the Defence to comment on the photos or individual photos, should they so wish. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And perhaps just to confirm, Witness, photo book 2 under tab 2, those are a series of photographs of the St. Famille church and its surrounds. 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And photo book three, photograph one, two and three, do they show the road and area where 
Hotel Kiyovu used to be? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes on the right-hand side of the photo behind the team (phonetic) printing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the spelling of that hotel is K-I-Y-O-V-U.
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes, Your Honour, Kiyovu.
@MR. MOSES:
That is number 93. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, if you could just briefly describe, if you could, in respect of photograph 5 and 6 the relevance of those photographs? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
On which folder. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In number three.
$(Pages 8 to 25 by R. Lear)

@WITNESS NEUPANE:
This first photograph shows a crossing. And the second one, it shows the location of the house of Iyamuremeye. And on the left-hand side on the secteur office. They are not very far. They are quite close. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you mentioned a name which I think is printed on the photograph. But for the interpreters, if I could spell it. I-Y-A-M-U-R-E-M-E-Y-E. Looking if you could at the next photo, photograph 7, are you aware what, if any, role this building had during the period of the genocide? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
This building which we see here, it has got three pits. Very deep pits. And the people who were taken out from St. Famille Church, brought here and put inside. They had been killed and put inside. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. If I could refer you to photo document number 4. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we move on, if you look at number 7, there you will find an abbreviation in brackets, RHS. What does that mean? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
That's the right-hand side. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that means that LHS on some of the other photographs means left-hand side? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Sure. Yes, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know what the present function of this building is at the moment? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. I learned it was a house, residence of Iyamuremeye during 1994. Then it has been changed to a church. And then now it is a primary school. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Thank you. And looking at photograph -- photo book number 4, do those photos describe and show areas within the St. Paul Centre? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES:
Sorry. My friend's got an objection. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Quite so. Mr. President, Your Honours, I will simply like to know whether it is after we've gone through the entire album that I will object to the admission of such photographs. Because on the third book, I already wanted to object to the admission. So I don't know whether to raise the objection now, or to wait for the Prosecutor to go through the entire album. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't we try to finish this first, and then you can come back to your objections. Because so far we have not ruled on any of these photo books. And, for instance, so far we only know that photo book number 1 contains pictures taken in 2005. But we do not know when the photographs in the other photo books were taken. That could be helpful. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour. I thought you'd asked the witness that question. But I will ask it.
$BY MR. MOSES: 
@MR. MOSES: 
When were the photographs taken in photo books 2, 3 and 4? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
I made a little mistake on the first photograph. Because this was taken at the end of the -- all photographs I took. And that was taken, the first one number, number 1, in 2005. And these other photographs were taken -- were taken in 2005. First one, 2006. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Hold on. Are you now referring to one particular photo book? "Yes" or "no"? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes, Your Honour. That's a photo book 1 CELA. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now we have photo book 1 in front of us -- 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- and you want to correct something you said. Can you now, a bit more slowly said, tell us what was the small mistake made, according to you? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
The date. The date. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And what did you say, and was the correct version? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
I said it was in 2005. I have a -- but it is printed here in 2006. It is 2006. And other photos I took before that period. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But does that mean that all photographs in photo book 1 was taken in 2006? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What about the year in relation to photo books 2, 3, and 4? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
2, 3 -- 2 and 3 I took in 2005. And the fourth I took in 2006. As I remember. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Your Honour, I'm in Your Honour's hands. There are referenced four separate photo books. It's, obviously, in one folder. Whether Your Honour wants it to be -- we'd be asking that they be tendered, whether Your Honour thinks it is preferable they be under one exhibit number, or four, I'm in Your Honours hands in relation to that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Bench prefers one exhibit. But let us now hear any objections there may be in relation to photo books or individual photographs. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is not intention of the Defence to object, but we can see a risk in admitting the documents as has been done now, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
We consider that -- we can not, for instance, regarding photographs 5, 6 and 7 of book 3, that it is acknowledged we're taking now in 2006, and come and show pits which are identified, and which contain skeletons of the people killed in 1994. 
That was eleven years ago exactly. And the investigator appearing before you can not say that the photographs he took were a clear correspondence of what he's coming to say before this Court. So I do not understand how this bench can use the photographs for an objective and fair appraisal of facts in this trial. 
That is why Mr. President, Your Honours, we consider that those photographs can not be as systematically admitted as is being done now. It is necessary to reject this one specifically because it contains some dangerous suggestions regarding the fair determination of the matter. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nekuie, do you have the French CaseView in front of you? The electronic screen? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
No, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any member of the Defence have it in front of you? But don't you want it? So why don't -- have you asked for it? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
We asked for it this morning, and were promised that it would be set up from tomorrow. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. So it's important that you also have that. Because when in the French version you see three dots, that means that you are speaking too fast. And now there were three dots. So that should help you in the future. But I'm sure we have it on the tape, so I think we can proceed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
My apologies, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, we have noted when the photographs in these various photo books were taken. Whether there will have been -- or whether there have been changes compared to 1994 is something which you will enlighten us on. Both parties. But there is no basis for not admitting this document for what it is; namely, photographs from 2005 and 2006 of relevant places. 
And we will then consider this as one exhibit, as it is containing these photographs in one file binder. And that will then be, Mr. Mussa? 
@MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour, to be P. 6. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 6 admitted)

@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
I have exhibit volume 2. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Witness, have you seen these series of photographs before? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know who took them? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
This gentlemen who is seen here, he with Magassouba, another investigator. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Investigator working for who? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
ICTR. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Are you aware if there was any witness present with them? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yeah. They went with some witness. And they took this photograph as on -- the witness pointed out.
@MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honours, once again, Witness UI is going to be one of our Prosecution witnesses. And it -- once again, it seems, I think, preferable -- the relevance of these photographs can be explained by Witness UI. I'll be seeking -- these are photographs -- 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know which date? Looking at the cover, do you know what date these photographs were taken? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
It's written 21st October 2002. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any objections, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Not really an objection, Mr. President. Because I would like to follow the reasoning of the Chamber. But I'm wondering why my learned friend is not putting the document into evidence through the witnesses who are concerned. I really don't understand why. But if the Chamber wants to admit them, no objection from the Defence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine. And it's only a matter of practicality. The reason is that, after all, it was not the witness who made the photographs, it was the Office of the Prosecutor. And that's why we are allowing this in now in connection with the witness representing the Office of the Prosecutor. But we will certainly come back to the photographs in connection with the individual witnesses. 
Any additional questions on this document? That does not seem to be the case. Mr. Mussa? 
@MR. MUSSA:
It's P. 7.
$(Exhibit No. P. 7 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's now 11:00. We will, then, have the 11:00 break, and we'll resume at 11:25. The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1100H to 1128H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. Final set of photographs. Tread gently here, Your Honour. I have these photographs. The Defence already have a copy of these photographs, Your Honour. 
Now, Your Honour, these photographs were taken by Witness BUX who was to be our second witness, but can't come for another month or so. We do intend to possibly show some of those photographs to witnesses who appear prior to her arrival to give evidence as to when they were taken and where. 
In brief -- and the Defence are aware of this. And I had initially been told there wasn't any objection, but it may be that their position has changed. There is a series of photographs taken at a roadblock, and a series of photographs taken at St. Famille Church. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who took these photographs? Any person from the Office of the Prosecutor? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No. It was a photographer who was present in Kigali. It's Witness BUX. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So it has no link to the present witness? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you want to come back to this in connection with BUX, maybe?
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Your Honour, my intention was -- they have all been entered into the database. I don't wish the witness to comment at all on them. Perhaps if they could be marked for -- the difficulty I foresee, Your Honour, is that if, for example, one or two photos are recognized by a witness who testifies from now until BUX testifies, those photographs may go in, but the others won't. And we've got a booklet of photographs. 
Now, I don't -- obviously, their probative value will only become apparent when the witness testifies. But it is my intention -- I would ask they be introduced in some form, Your Honour, so we can deal with them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. But here the Defence objection is valid. So what we will do now is simply to note that you have this compilation of photographs. You are free to refer to them. And you may tender them as an exhibit at any stage when you find it convenient.
It's difficult to see -- unless there is no objection from the Defence. Is there no objection to the tendering of this document, or these photographs, in connection with the present witness? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, you have already pointed out a Defence objection. And I think there is not need for the Defence to make any further comment. We can not ask -- allow for the tendering of photographs taken through a witness who is not here present; whereas, it could be done otherwise.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we note this now. We have it, all of us, in our personal files. There is no need to mark them in any way. But we have them. And as with any other document, you can simply put it to any witness that may appear between now and the appearance of the witness that actually took the photographs. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Very well, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, Witness, if I can ask you to now look at the folder of exhibits, volume 1. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
May I ask you, when we look at this list on your front page of volume 1, Counsel, the document we just decided not to tender for the time being, it bears which code in your draft? 
@MR. MOSES: 
P. 11. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So now, Your Honour, we're moving on to the documents which are under the tabs in the folder. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And what happened to P. 10? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I believe that this was the document which was admitted just before the break. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is the P. 10 document. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Then it's all clear. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:

Witness, can you please look at the document under tab 1 in that folder. Is that the statute creating the gendarmerie nationale in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. I have seen this. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you have, under that tab, the French? And there is also, I think, an English translation. 
All right. And does it at paragraph 29 --

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, please switch on your mike. We are now in the document concerning the gendarmerie which is the next document. And what Counsel is doing is drawing your attention to paragraph 29 of that particular document. Do you have it in front of you? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
That's on P. 12? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Don't worry about the P numbering. Do you have in the folder -- this is under number 2 there. Do you have the gendarmerie nationale document in front of you? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You should be looking at volume 1. You will see -- I think there are 31 tabs. And we're looking at number 1. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, with other words, you are right that this is draft P. 12 in the Prosecution's folder. But that draft P. 12 can be found under tab 1. Have you found it?
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yeah. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, please move on to paragraph 29 of that document. Will you do that? 
$BY MR. MOSES:

And don't interrupt one another, because then it gets very complicated. Only one speaks at a time. So now it is the turn of counsel. What is the question?
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Does that section, section 2, set out the powers to requisition the gendarmerie nationale? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yeah.
@MR. MOSES:
Without further ado, Your Honours, I would seek to tender that document on the basis that it is -- contains relevant evidence which may have probative value. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this document comes from which compilation? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, are you aware where the statute was obtained from? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
This statute we obtained from the CND, Conseil national de développement. That is the Rwandan parliament. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No. No. The question is, is this an official compilation of texts of some sort? Do you know whether it is or not? I mean, it looks official to me. Isn't it? We've seen this in other cases. What do you know of the source of the document? What -- is it taken from, for instance, (French spoken) or something like that?
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
That is from the presidential decree. That all the source of the law. And it also comes from there.

Mr. President, I'm sorry. I was having a consultation with my client, regarding the last document being discussed, I didn't quite follow. I'm sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If you could kindly move to tab 8, which contains the presidential nomination of Colonel Renzaho as prefect of Kigali-ville dated 5 October 1990. Do you have any problem with that document being admitted? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
No problem, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Mussa? 
@MR. MUSSA:
It is P. 15.
$(Exhibit No. P. 15 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then follows six letters. Is this something we should go through one by one? Or is it possible for you, Prosecution, to give a global description of these letters? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, if I can indicate. As Your Honours will have seen, and if I can spend just a minute or two, from the pre-trial brief. At this state in the process, there were very few, by the way -- by way of admissions by the Defence. Which is perfectly their right to do so. There are a number of documents which are now -- we're seeking to produce both from -- in the name of Renzaho. Those that were sent to him, and a number of UNAMIR situation reports which refer to him. And meetings. This is just to give you a global overview, Your Honour. 
Now, it is our submission that in respect of those documents, they are relevant because they refer to places that the Accused may have been during 1994. In respect of this first document under tab 9, it refers to an earlier occasion in 1991 where the Accused requires I.D. cards and permits of residence to be provided. And, therefore, it is of some relevance in respect of the fact that what happened in 1994 wasn't the first occasion. 
So those are the -- I can indicate under tab 10, we don't intend to produce that document any more. So that one can be put to one side. Tab 11 is a letter from Renzaho requesting arms for persons who are allegedly being threatened. There is a request which shows the power of the préfet to make such request for arms. We don't know whether that is something which is in dispute or not, because we have no admissions regarding that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence, we are now at draft P. 20. And if you look at draft P. 20 until draft P. 25, these are letters. Of these letters, draft P. 21 is not being sought to be admitted. So we are left with one, two, three, four, five documents. 
Mr. Witness, these five documents, were they found by OTP investigators? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are there any problems in admitting these five documents, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, unfortunately, there is a problem. Because those letters, which are from draft P. 11 to, I believe, draft P. 20, as the Prosecutor say, tend to show the overwhelming power, seemingly, which my client had at the time. 
And those are documents which are very often referred to both in the indictment and in witness statements of the Prosecution witnesses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I am very sorry. This is just to make sure that we are on the same wavelength. 
What we have done now is, following the latest exchange, to admit until P. 19, which became P. 15. That's where we are. And the question I am asking you now, having done so, is whether you have any comments on draft P. 20 to draft P. 25, which would seem to be letters? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes. And my answer was in the affirmative, Mr. President. Because indeed there are letters which tend to demonstrate the excessive powers which the Accused had. There are letters relating to certain testimonies which the Prosecutor intends to adduce before this Chamber. Those witnesses who will testify, and during which testimony the documents will be admitted, do not have any capacity to demonstrate the relevance of the exhibit. So within that, at a later stage, when the Prosecutor deems it necessary to demonstrate the relevance when each of those witnesses will be called to testify, then he will have to move to tender those letters. But at this stage of the proceedings, they have no relationship with the witness. 
Now allow us to make an appraisal through this witness in light of what happened in 1994. That is why we are objecting to the admission thereof. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Just to make sure that we understand one another. The reason why I needed your clarification was that in your first response you referred to P. 11 onwards. But what you are really doing is responding, as I asked you to do, from draft P. 20 to draft P. 25. 
All right. Any comment by the Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES: 
With the greatest respect to my friend, I would have thought his comments to Your Honour, in fact, provide the basis of themselves for their admission. He's, from his own mouth, said that they show the Accused's power. Therefore, when one looks at the Rule 89, whether a Chamber made admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value, we have documents here, Your Honour, which the Accused's through his counsel accept have extreme relevance and they have probative value, as well, in our submission. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Anything to add, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, it is indeed at the level of the relevance of the documents that the problem arises. One can not assess the relevance during the testimony of this witness. That is the Defence position. 
Now the Defence is in your hands regarding the determination of the relevance and the probable admissibility. But as far as the Defence is concerned, Mr. President, it is inappropriate for your Chamber today to assess the relevance of those documents so as to admit them now. 
That is the Defence position. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, I see that some of these documents are dated before '94. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That is correct, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any comment on the relevance of documents pre-dating April to July '94? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, yes, Your Honour. In respect of the documents such as that under tab 11, which is marked "confidential", signed by the Accused, and is requesting from the minister of Defence a firearm to be provided for named people there. What it establishes, in the Prosecution's submission, Your Honour, it's relevant because our case involves the requesting of firearms during 1994 during the period of the genocide. 
Now, as I indicated to Your Honour earlier, I don't know whether that is something which is admitted by the Defence or not. This is a document which establishes that he had done so in 1993, and may help corroborate any direct testimony that Your Honour hears of arms request from the Minister of Defence during the period of the genocide. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
These documents were obtained by the present witness's organisation during investigations. They are letters from or to the Accused. They may well be dated earlier than '94. But it may be alleged, without the Chamber now taking a position, that this has a bearing on the functions of the Accused in '94, that they are relevant. There is no dispute as to their authenticity. For these reasons, the Chamber can not exclude the tendering of these documents. 
So Mr. Mussa, will you help us now? 
@MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, the next exhibit is P. 16.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So P. 20 becomes P. 16. Then we move to P. 22. Mr. Mussa?

Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. Your Honour, I won't at this stage, introduce the next document which is under tab 15. I will now move on to tab 16. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, are you aware whether if UNAMIR, U-N-A-M-I-R, provided to the investigations department, any documents? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. They provided. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, can you please look under tab 16. At the top of that document there is a stamp "F. Claeys", C-L-A-E-Y-S. Do you know who that person is? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
He is of the UNAMIR. He's a person from UNAMIR. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And is this one of the documents received by the Tribunal from UNAMIR? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yup. 
@MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honour, I'd seek to tender this document as an exhibit. I am prepared to argue its relevance and probative value, if there is an objection to it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when did the Tribunal receive this document from UNAMIR representative, Claeys? 
$(Pages 26 to 40 by Vicki Eastvold)
1200H
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know, Mr. Witness? Or from somewhere else? Some other source? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
That I haven't received, Your Honour. It is registry now, database system. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honour, it would be our wish for the Prosecutor to justify the relevance of this document. Because not only is it that the present witness claims to have culled this document from the database, and on which document it appears that Officer Claeys of UNAMIR is giving an account of events concerning our client, and which were told him by someone else. And this is a chain of hearsay which does not allow for the establishment of the probative value of such a document, let alone relevance. So we object to its admission. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's start with the relevance. You said you were ready to argue that, Counsel. Please do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. In paragraph 2, my friend quite rightly points out that this is the paragraph of this document which is relevant to this case. It is our case that the Accused was involved in the distribution of weapons leading up to the genocide, commencing in April 1994, and my friend quite rightly points out that this is an account of a meeting that Captain Claeys had with an informant who gave him information regarding the Accused allegedly giving -- distributing weapons in January 1994. 
I think the point that my friend made is -- the relevant one, namely, it's not so much a question of relevance, because clearly if the Accused was involved in such arms distribution it's extremely relevant. The question is, is a question of weight that Your Honours should attach to this document in the absence, and it being hearsay. Now, of course, hearsay is not inadmissible, and our submission would be that it may, once Your Honour has heard from direct evidence, it may assist Your Honour in corroborating such evidence. 
Of itself, Your Honours may feel that that in itself, just the production of that document, of itself, would be not of sufficient weight to place much importance on it, but having heard the testimony, Your Honours will be in a better position to assess what, if any, weight should be assigned to this report. And that's, to be blunt, the argument that we make in regards to this document. Thank you, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, from what I observe it is impossible to give a probative value to the document, and that is what the Prosecutor is saying. And I further submit that there is a problem of relevance here. This is a document dating January 1994 and there is an intention to use that to establish the fact that the Accused allegedly distributed weapons from the 6th of April 1994. I can't really see how this can be of use. Accordingly, Mr. President, Your Honours, in order for the Chamber to avoid such problems which may be posed to the Defence, then I think you need to uphold our objection and set aside this document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is a document obtained by the OTP. It bears a K or L number, 0022615. It is dated within the time period mentioned in the mandate of the Tribunal. The Accused's name is mentioned in the second paragraph. For this reason, it may be argued that this is relevant. It is relevant. The question about the weight to be attached to this document is another matter, and we have noted the Defence's submissions in that regard and we will bear that in mind also later on the merits. 
Mr. Mussa? 
@MR. MUSSA:

@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, we do not intend to object, but simply because we are going by the reasoning of the Chamber which entails reserving the issue of the relevance and weight of the document in a timely manner, not during the appearance of this witness. So we do not object to the admission of the document, subject, however, to those two reservations. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to avoid any lack of clarity, we are admitting only documents which appear to be relevant. But as for their weight, we reserve that for later. So there is then the weight we will come back to later. Is that clear?

@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
The -- this only -- only this tape, it was not brought from that. Our investigators, they have got and copied, with the consent of the ministry of rehabilitation. Among that nearly 259 tapes, this was one of that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know when the investigators copied the tape? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
This was done in 1997 and '96. It took a bit -- long time to copy all the tapes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, Your Honours, I'm seeking to admit that -- the audio tape, together with the transcripts that are there, and I'm ready to argue issues of relevance and admissibility if there's any objection. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, we have an objection for the following reasons: First of all, Mr. President, we never received the recording, or the cassette of this tape to be certain that the voice mentioned is indeed our voice. 
Secondly, Mr. President, Your Honours, it has not been established before the Court that these recordings flow from the radio stations which have been mentioned, and that the broadcasts actually took place on the dates that have been mentioned. We therefore do not see how, without establishing that authenticity, your Trial Chamber could admit this into evidence within this trial. 
Third, Mr. President, Your Honours, we have all heard that these are tapes that were purportedly recognised by a witness -- a Prosecution witness who is absent. These are tapes that were not collected and compiled by the witness appearing before the Court at this moment, because he claims that these were obtained in 1996 or '97 by OTP investigators. And that casts doubt and ambiguity as to the authenticity of these tapes, and therefore their admission can only be prejudicial to the Defence. 
And it is for these reasons, Mr. President, that we object to the tendering of this document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This transcript is reflecting, according to the Prosecution, transmissions in which radio channel? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I believe it was in fact an intercept, Your Honour, of a telephone -- of telephone conversations. So they were not on the radio. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That makes the matter more serious, Mr. President. And we therefore insist on our objection. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is Your Honour in a position to hear me, or do you wish to... 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are ready to listen. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours. This piece of evidence there is reference to in the pre-trial brief on page 28, where we address the issue of the Accused's intent, and we look at the evidence which will be adduced to show the Accused's intent. Under paragraph A, we say: "The Accused talked of extermination during an intercepted telephone conversation with the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, Mr. Rugambarara." So it's in that part of -- there's direct reference to it in the pre-trial brief. 
In the annex to the most updated summary of Prosecution witnesses, Your Honours will see in regards to Witness ALG, the last sentence where, "ALG will identify Renzaho as a speaker on the radio intercept exhibited by the Prosecution." 
You will further see, Your Honour, in the summary of witnesses, the second-to-last witness on the final page of those summaries is Witness BKX, who will be saying that BKX knew Renzaho before April 1994 and will give evidence that it is Renzaho's voice on a recording of an intercepted telephone call in which he talks about extermination. 
Your Honours, I have copies -- I've got two copies, Your Honour, of the disclosure that has been made to the Defence regarding the testimony of BKX. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This telephone conversation took place when? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It seems to have been placed on the 26th of April 1994. If you look at the statement from the witness, you will see he clearly says that he's listened to tape AV938, points out the passage -- the relevant passage, which has been, we say -- will submit, wrongly ascribed to Karera. If I can point you to the transcript itself, Your Honour, I think it will highlight the relevance of this piece of evidence. In the English, it's on page 31 and 32. 
Now, it is, in our submission, we believe the only time in the Tribunal's history that there is evidence -- direct evidence of a tape recording where an accused orders the extermination of people. Your Honour will see on page 32, the fifth line down, where we say it has been -- but we've left it as it is. But we are going to call witness testimony, it's going to be a matter of -- for Your Honours to -- to weigh this up. But the passage which is assigned to Karera, which says: "Exterminate them truly." There is then a response, and then there is another response: "You see, exterminate all of them." There could not be any more relevant evidence. It is of the highest degree of relevance, in the Prosecution's submission. 
In respect of the weight to which it is assigned, then clearly that is a matter which Your Honour will -- Your Honours will weigh, having heard ALG and/or BKX and any other witnesses -- and those witnesses regarding it. So, clearly the Defence can cross-examine. They certainly can't say that they haven't been on clear, unequivocal notice as to what we were going to introduce and why. And it is of extreme probative value and of the greatest relevance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There are two pending names now for the transcripts. The first name is Bicumbi, which is written B-I-C-U-M-B-I, and then you referred to one of the interlocutors in the telephone conversation, whose name is spelt R-U-G-A-M-B-A-R-A-R-A. 
Anything to add? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour will -- well, this intercept was not introduced in the Karera trial, for obvious reasons, namely that the Prosecution position is that it is not Karera. The witnesses, when you hear from them, you will have to assess how well they knew both of the persons involved and weigh up what weight, if any, should be given to their evidence of identifying the voices on this telephone intercept. But that's -- that's all I wish to say for -- in regard to this matter at this stage, Your Honour. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, in addition to our previous submissions relating to the inadmissibility of this document, namely, lack of relevance and probative value, I would like to add, Mr. President, that regarding this specific document, Rule 75 (sic) must be taken into account. Let me read Rule 75, Mr. President, which provides as follows -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, if counsel would specifically mention the rule he's referring to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. I think you are about to read from a portion of Rule 75; is that so? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Rather, Mr. President, I was reading from 95, Rule 95. Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Do we all have Rule 95 in front of us? I think you can start reading slowly now. Please do. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. Rule 95 provides as follows: "No evidence shall be admissible if obtained by methods which cast substantial doubt on its reliability, or if its admission is antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of the proceedings." 
That is Rule 95, Mr. President, Your Honours. Now, this document before the Court, Mr. President, is one which Defence submits cannot be tendered before your Trial Chamber simply by stating that telephone conversations have been intercepted on the 26th of April 1994. And the interception purportedly was transcribed in 1996, two years later. 
By the way, Mr. President, we do not know who ordered the interception, who authorised that interception, what were the legal conditions allowing for such telephone conversations to be intercepted. 
Mr. President, in 2006 -- or, should I say, in 2007, this tape is brought before the Court. It does not bear the name of the Accused, but simply purportedly relates to discussions involving Mr. Karera, who is not Mr. Renzaho. And the claim is being made, Mr. President, that such an illegal document could be relevant in Mr. Renzaho's trial. With all those defects, Mr. President, I believe that your Chamber has no choice but to dismiss this document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just heard you say that the document was illegal. What is the basis for that submission? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
$(Microphones overlapping) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's true, as you said, that we do not know who authorised or the conditions. But the illegality, could you help us with that, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours, it is not for the Defence to determine the illegality of the document. We know very well that for telephone conversations to be intercepted, there are strict guidelines and authorisations that must be obtained. We therefore do not understand how these conversations could have taken place in 1994, during the war -- I will slow down. 
In 1996, Mr. President, we do not even know whether this was a telephone interception, or the interception of a conversation that took place, purportedly in 1994. So what is it that allows us to determine whether this document is legal? 1994 was a time of war, and at that time it was only the Rwandan armed forces who may have been possibly in possession of such a document. So, is it the army which is the source of this document? Is it a document from the RPF? And if so, what was the authority of the RPF to make such a determination as to the authorisation for such an interception? 
So, Mr. President, there is a lot of ambiguity around this document. And for these reasons I believe that the illegality is obvious. And by the way, it is not for the Defence to establish the legality of the document, because the onus is on the Prosecutor who has to establish the authenticity and the legality of that document. And that has not yet been demonstrated. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, do you know where this document comes from? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
This document -- document comes from the ministry of rehabilitation of Rwanda. And only our investigators, they got it at the time I have stated in my previous saying, but this was kept in the Rwandan authorities' archive. And still they have the original tape recording there in their possession. So the -- this is an official document, officially kept, in a sovereign and legal government. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And -- this may be a bit repetitive, but just to go step by step: And when did your office receive this from the ministry of rehabilitation? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Your Honour, I haven't received it, but we have the correspondence that our officers who received this tape and the final submission to our database system was on 6 February 1997. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know when the OTP received this document from the ministry? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
That's the -- there was a submission from the Rwandan authority name Vianney Ruyombyana, who has given us a written statement in 30th October 1996 that he has given us the final document that day. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We could have the spelling of the last name, please? Slowly. 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
R-U-Y-O-M-B-Y-A-N-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. And do you know who intercepted this conversation? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Really speaking, I don't have the knowledge. But many tapes are there in their archives that was intercepted at that time in 1994. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, did you try to find out the circumstances under which this document was obtained? Namely, when this interception was carried out? Did you try to find out this in the archives or from any other authorities in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Personally speaking, I didn't try, and I was not involved in the acquisition of these tapes. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know the procedure used in connection with this interception? Do you have any knowledge about the conditions? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
In 1994, the government used to order -- I heard, but I don't have any written document or any statements. They used to take the conversation like that. And normally what we have found, that everything that said in any conversation and interception in a code -- coded language. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have any view as to whether this was recorded by the government or the RPF? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
These documents were recorded by the Rwandan authorities, because the RPF has not control at that time to the telecommunication system. It was under the Rwandan government. That I believe the Rwandan government has intercepted it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, all right. 
Do you have anything to add, Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Only that I think, Your Honours, come the end of the trial, once Your Honours have had the opportunity of hearing witnesses comment regarding this, Your Honours will be in a better position to place -- to decide what, if any, probative value should be placed on it. And that's also, in my submission, following submissions regarding the contents of the tape as a whole, which refer to particular incidents. On page 32 (sic), for example: "Have things got under way in Butare yet?" We will make -- that's at the very top of page 32 in the English version. 
So there are other indicia in there, Your Honour, which I would be submitting we can go through and argue regarding its weight and/or reliability. But it is of the utmost relevance in the Prosecution's submission. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you meant to refer to the top of page 31, and that's all right. 
Defence, any final submissions on this? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. First of all, when reference is made to a document, and given that we are working in French, we would like to have the corresponding page in French. Otherwise we are at a loss. 
Now, as far as this document goes, Mr. President, Your Honours, this is a very important question we are dealing with here. You have heard what the Prosecution's submissions are, and you may want to agree with me that we all know that telephone interceptions are very dangerous matters when it comes to issues of freedom, and that is why the rules governing such interceptions are very strict. That is what we are trying to establish today, in respect of this document before the Court. If we are not able to determine who ordered the interceptions, if we do not know the reasons under which those interceptions took place, and how the transcripts were developed, then there is a question around the integrity of that document, and that raises questions of admissibility in view of Rule 95, which we mentioned a short while ago. 
Once more, I am certain that the Tribunal is aware that this type of document is very likely to be manipulated, and that is why national legislation has always been very strict around these types of issues. That is all I would have to say in relation to the admissibility of this document, Mr. President. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Chamber is not in a position to admit this document at the present stage. The Accused's name is not in this document. Prosecution, you will have to address us, if you so wish, later in the trial. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Meanwhile, could you first assist in finding the equivalent in French of page 32 of the English version, if that could be communicated. And secondly, there was a reference to the recording of this not having been given to the Defence. But that is what you just gave to the Defence this -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I've got a copy here, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So the Defence would wish to -- if they have not already received it, to receive the audio version of this purported piece of evidence in order to assess this further. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just a very brief matter, Your Honour. So, for my learned friends, it's on K0167848 and 7849. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
Your next possible exhibit? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes.

And is that a UNAMIR cable from General Dallaire to Mr. Annan? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes, I see. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is it dated the 25th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And Your Honours, I'm seeking to tender that, and I'm ready to argue its relevance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any problem, Defence?

And is that also another cable from General Dallaire to Mr. Annan, dated the 25th of April? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And does it come with two pages of attachments? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I would seek to admit that, Your Honour, and I'm ready to argue admissibility.

No problems, says the Defence.

@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, now if you could look, please, under tab 25. 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yeah, it's here. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is that a memo from Major -- on page 2, is it a memo from Major MacNeil -- 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yeah . 
@MR. MOSES: 
-- to the FC, which I think you mentioned earlier was force commander; is that correct? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yep. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is that dated the 28th of April 1994. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I would seek to -- I'm sorry, I think there are two dated the 28th of April. There's a second one behind that dated -- from the -- it's addressed to the chief operations officer, a daily humanitarian report, number 4.
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes, we have here. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I seek to tender those documents, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are these two documents, or are they linked? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I believe they are linked. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In what way? What is the link? I can see that we have -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Both are on the same date. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- on the last page here a facsimile -- a fax from Booh-Booh to Annan dated the 29th of April. And that one talks about five pages, and the subject is the daily situation report, 28 to 29 of April. What we have in front of that document are these pages. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Ah, yes. I'm sorry, Your Honours. That page 561 should be the cover sheet to tab 26. I apologise for that. That's -- we've all got the same -- it's K0000561, which should be before the first page of the document under tab 26, which is the following number. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. That clarifies the matter, and we will move that document to the next tab number now. But then to the link between the two documents, can anyone explain that? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour -- I'm sorry, Your Honour. I can't at the moment, and perhaps if we can simply remove the last page, which is the interoffice memorandum from HAC to the chief operations officer. I'm happy that doc -- that page be removed. And we simply tender -- I seek to tender the two-page document from Major MacNeil to the force commander. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
If we proceed according to the Prosecutor's proposal, Mr. President, there will be no objection. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So these two pages, then, Mr. Mussa, will be?

@MR. MOSES: 
I believe it is Mr. MacNeil. I'm just looking for a memo with his name and initials beneath it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
No particular objection, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
Mr. Mussa? 
@MR. MUSSA: 
It's P. 31. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 31 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's one o'clock. We will then have the lunch break until 2:30. It would be helpful if the Defence could indicate, when we meet again, whether there are documents from draft P. 39 onwards, that they can say right away that there are no objections. Because then we will know that maybe we can speed some of the documents up a little bit and concentrate on the problematic ones. 
Is there anything else to be said before we go for lunch? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
No, Mr. President. The next two documents can already be admitted, Mr. President, if the Prosecutor were to produce them, because we do not intend to object to the tabling of those documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But let's do that right away. 
Mr. Mussa? Draft P. 39 is a UNAMIR memo dated 29th of April 1994, becomes then?

@MR. MOSES:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour. I'm pleased to advise you that I had a discussion with the Defence, further to Your Honour's suggestion, and I'll ask if my friend can confirm the situation, but I understand that the remaining documents are to go in by -- without objection. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that is the case. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Quite so, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed. 
Mr. Mussa, are you ready? Is there any document of the remaining numbers, from alleged P. 41 on, which you are not going to tender? 
@MR. MOSES:

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. All right. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, may I? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Just to state that we said we would not object to the admission of the documents, subject to the Prosecution's commitment to disclose to us the electronic format of the radio broadcast, and the Prosecutor had accepted to do so. We agreed that we would need to have the electronic formats of the radio broadcast, so that we will be able to listen to them ourselves. 
@MR. MOSES:
Quite so, Your Honour. It is the position. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good. And it seems to me that, due to the break, you have forgotten to speak slowly. So remember that now. 
We will then start with proposed P. 41 under tab 30, letter of 1st May 1994.

Not at all -- 
@MR. MOSES:
Okay. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- not at all. No, no. That's an administrative matter. 
@MR. MOSES:
Okay. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that could be handed to Mr. Mussa, and he will then ensure that this is being done. And if he could be given the missing Kinyarwanda versions, we will all place them into our own binders. So all we need are the additional copies. 
@MR. MOSES:
Certainly, Your Honour.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when the question was put to you regarding the date of Exhibit P. 3, which is the sketch of CELA and the JOC, you said "the sketch dated 2003"; is that correct? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yeah, but I am not sure the date. It was in April 2003. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, sir. You are not certain of the date, but are you certain about the person or persons who prepared that sketch? Are you in a position to tell us who authored the sketch? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
This has been done by the cartographer of the St. Paul Centre in Kigali. I don't remember, and I have noted the name. It is written on the big sketch. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, sir. During your site trips, did you personally prepare any sketch? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
I haven't presented any sketch, I think, at this level. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So do you agree with me that the two sketches which you produced before this Court today are sketches whose authenticity you cannot positively ascertain before this Court? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Those sketches were obviously obtained from the Centre pastoral St. Paul at Kigali, and we have got it from their archive, so that is the authentic document. And I have presented in one piece. It has been photocopied in many pieces, to give you the different locations. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Let's make sure that we understood your answer now. These sketches were obtained from which centre? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
That is Centre pastoral de St. Paul in Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Now we have that. 
Next question, please. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, as far as you are concerned, are those sketches a fair depiction of the layout of that centre as it was in 1994? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Yeah. It was the things which you see there, those walls. The boundary walls, all the brick boundary walls, they were not present at the time of the events in 1994. Other -- they have put little (unintelligible) -- they did (unintelligible) on there, but they haven't changed anything there of the old structure. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. Let us now move to the photograph which was admitted into evidence through you, Witness. 
On some of those photographs, you highlighted the residence of a person called Iyamuremeye, in which residence you took photographs of pits with skeletons. When, if at all, did you personally take those photographs, and when did you realise there were skeletons in those pits? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
No, that is not our -- many witnesses, they have come from there where the victims they have been thrown after killing them or some were alive. But when we went there, that time I have to take the photographs, those pits were filled up of -- only the houses were there, and the bodies of -- the remaining -- remains are taken to the new mass burial sites. That's all. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. So it is your evidence before this Court that you did not see human remains on the scene of the photographs? Is that correct? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. And, lastly, do you confirm that all those photographs were actually taken in 2006? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
Some of the photographs, they were taken in 2005, at the end of 2005. Some were in 2006. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, when one looks at your album, the date on it is the 5th of June 2006. How do you expect people to make a difference between the photographs taken in 2005 and those taken in 2006? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE: 
No, they have been taken in different time, and in many times we have to take it -- sometime with the photos which we wanted to produce, it was not well done so we have to go and retake it. So the -- one photo in one folder might be the same date or another date. I haven't taken the same date all the photographs. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When we heard your testimony earlier today, we noted that photo book number 1 contained photographs taken in the end of 2-6; number 2 contained 2005 photographs; number 3, 2005 photographs; number 4, 2006 photographs. Now, does this mean that this summary is not necessarily correct because you had to go back in relation to individual photographs and take them again, or is the summary I just gave of your previous testimony still correct? 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Only that that one, the first photographs, which I have said that was incorrect. That was taken in 2005. And it was binded on the -- instead of lastly, it was come to first. So I didn't remember well. But all the photographs were taken in 2005 and 2006. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
I cannot give the precise date when I had taken. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. And that's quite understandable. 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not requiring that, but we just want to understand the testimony. 
Now, you referred to the first photograph, which was incorrect. And that was exactly as you said in your previous testimony. 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
The 2006 that I have corrected later on, maybe I couldn't convey to Your Honour the date. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, in light of the additional questions just put by the Bench to the witness, the Defence has no further questions in cross for this witness. So we end at this stage. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Defence. 
Any re-examination, Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, thank you, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness. Thank you very much for coming to Arusha and contribute to the trial. We wish you a pleasant journey home. Thank you. 
@WITNESS NEUPANE:
Thank you, Mr. President and Honourable Judges and other colleagues. Bye. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The next witness is AFB. 
@MR. MOSES:
That's correct, Your Honour. And that witness's evidence will be led by my friend, Ms. Melluish. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then ask that witness to be brought in. 
Is there a personal information sheet? Could that be distributed in parallel with this witness leaving the courtroom, please. 
$(Witness excused)
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, perhaps I could make it clear that I have just one or two questions to ask, preferably at the beginning, in closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's noted, but we will still, in open session, swear in the witness. 
You have disclosed a lot of witness statements on the 15th of December. Where do we find the statements of this witness, in which folder? 
$(Witness entered courtroom) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness. Just sit down, please. 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS AFP:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness AFB in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness AFB in Kinyarwanda) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, with your signature? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Yes, I do recognise that document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The information in this document is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Yes, the information contained in this document is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that bring us to P. 64, Mr. Mussa? 
@MR. MUSSA:
Yes, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
$(Exhibit No. P. 64 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then start in closed session for approximately five minutes, maybe less, and then we will move into open session again. 
If those in the public gallery could leave us for five minutes, please. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 69 to 70] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
$(Pages 59 to 68 by Ann Burum)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are now in open session in order to hear your testimony, and it's still Witness AFB who is being examined in-chief. 
Prosecution?

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, could you tell the Court, please, your ethnic origin. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I am Hutu. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And could you tell the Court where you were living in April -- early April 1994. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I lived in Biryogo secteur to the east of ************** in Nyarugenge commune; that is in Kigali préfecture -- Kigali town préfecture. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us where you were on the morning -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. The name of the secteur you said was?
MS. MELLUISH:
Oh, I'm sorry. That's at number 14.
@WITNESS AFP:
Biryogo.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat the number, please. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Number 14. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Number 14 on the spelling list. Yes. And now you were just about to ask a question. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Could you tell us, please, where you were on the morning of the 7th of April 1994. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I was at home -- at my home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And that morning did you have reason to leave your home? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I left my home because we were wondering what was happening, given that we heard gunshots from the town. At about 7 in the morning, communal police came at the behest of Conseiller Amri Karekezi, and they had come from the Biryogo secteur office. 
MS. MELLUISH:
The name Karekezi appears at number 80 on the list. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters would like to have a copy of the spelling list as well. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course you must have that. Have you not received it? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We see it's on the way, Mr. President. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And since everyone is so nice to the interpreters, now maybe the Bench could have the copies we gave to everyone in the courtroom. So we miss two copies here. We have Judge Arrey's copies, which we are desperately using now. 
$(Pages 71 to 72 by Ann Burum)
1515H
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, the Defence would like to have a copy as well. I'm sorry, Mr. President, we already have a copy.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good to hear.
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, I'm unclear as to who is lacking at this stage a copy of this list.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you want to know who has no copy, that is Judge Egorov and me, we gave it to the court reporters.
MS. MELLUISH:
If I can ask somebody to go make copies immediately, I'll make five or six and make sure everyone has one. I apologise on behalf of the Prosecution.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine. Make sure it is done. Has Mr. Mussa got a copy or someone else? Now it's done. Let's move on.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, you said that communal policemen came to your house. How many policemen was that? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Two communal policemen. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did they say anything to you?
@WITNESS AFP: 
They told me that Conseiller Amri Karegesi (phonetic) wanted me to go and see him at the secteur office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at that time did you have any idea why you were required at the secteur office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, it is only when I arrived at the secteur office that I found out ************* the vehicle at the secteur office, the previous evening, and when I got there the conseiller told me to go to the préfectural office with that vehicle in the company of two communal policemen. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Just to clarify, Mr. Witness, what vehicle are you talking about? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It was a double cabin Hilux pickup with registration number belonging to the state. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, when the conseiller told you to go to the préfecture office, what did you do? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I went there in compliance with his orders. I had no choice. I went immediately because I did not know why he was dispatching me to the office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you go alone or were you accompanied by anyone? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I went along with the two policemen, those very two policemen who had come to see me at my home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at that stage, Mr. Witness, did you know why you were going to the préfecture office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, but I was afraid. I was afraid because gunshots could be heard in Kigali town. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us how long it took to get from the secteur office to the préfecture office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It was not far away. It took me three to five minutes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And on the way to the préfecture office did you notice anything unusual? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
What I noticed -- what I saw, which was unusual, was soldiers around the mosque and ONATRACOM on the road leading to the military camp in Kigali.
MS. MELLUISH:
ONATRACOM is at 195 of the spelling list.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us what you found at the préfecture office when you arrived? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I found many people at the préfectural office, soldiers, communal policemen, bourgmestres, conseiller of various secteurs in Kigali-Ville préfecture. I also saw a very well-known Interahamwe at the préfectural office whose name is Mugesera, and there was another Interahamwe known as Karim who was present and both of them were from Bucyogo (phonetic).
MS. MELLUISH:
Mugesera appears at 101 on the list. Perhaps the witness could spell the other name that he mentioned.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do, Mr. Witness.
@WITNESS AFP:
Mugesera, M-U-G-E-S-E-R-A, for Mugesera. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, did you mention another name? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I also referred to Karim.
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Is that K-A-R-I-M? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, correct.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
But from the interpreters, Kinyarwanda booth, there is a U at the end of that, Karimu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two persons came from where? 
@WITNESS AFP:
They both were natives of Bucyogo secteur.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, did you see anyone else you recognised at PDK -- at the préfecture office when you arrived? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I recognised Ruberangondo, who was the bourgmestre of Butamwe commune. I was also to recognise André Karekezi, who arrived shortly after me, and I was able to recognise others, as well, including Conseiller Stanis, who was the conseiller of a secteur whose name I don't remember. I was also able to recognise Mbyareyehe, conseiller from Kigali secteur. And I just recall that Stanis, who was conseiller from Gitega, who was a neighbouring secteur to Bijobo (phonetic).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now we have to clarify all these names and all these locations, so Stanis was number 199, I understand.
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you have to help us with the rest.
MS. MELLUISH:
Unfortunately the others don't appear on the list.
MS. MELLUISH:
Ruberangondo, R-U-B-E-R-A-N-G --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if counsel would slow down.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Whenever we spell and whenever we read we go to half speed.
MS. MELLUISH:
Sorry, R-U-B-E-R-A-N-G-O-N-D-O. And the commune, Butamwa, B-U-T-A-M-W-A, and I'm afraid the name I noted as Mbyareyehe will have to be spelled by the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do, Mr. Witness.
@WITNESS AFP:
Mbyareyehe is spelled M-D-Y-A-R-I-Y-H-E (sic), Mbyareyehe.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have we now got both the bourgmestre and the commune? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I believe so. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps, Mr. Witness, could you repeat the bourgmestre Mbyareyehe was bourgmestre of which commune? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, Mbyareyehe was a conseiller, conseiller of one of the secteurs in Kigali town but it is Ruberangondo who was bourgmestre of Butamwa commune. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know which secteur Mdyariyhe was conseiller for? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I do not recall the exact name of the secteur, but it was one of the secteurs in the centre of the city. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. 
You mentioned seeing soldiers at the préfecture office. Did you see any senior military officers there? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, there were senior military officers as well as junior officers, but I was not able to know all their names. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us what you observed the people at the préfecture office to be doing when you arrived? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
When I arrived there, I did not notice anything special happening. People stood in groups of two or three discussing issues among themselves and talking about the war, and most of them were saying that President Habyarimana had died, and they talked about those who purportedly had killed him. In fact, the only topic of conversation was the war. Thereafter people went back to their offices. I didn't go with them because that was not my business. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, what did you do? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I did not do anything. I waited for some time and after a while Colonel Renzaho came out and called for some policemen. He asked them to go to Kimisagara. Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho entered his vehicle and we followed him. When we got to Radio Rwanda he went to his home (sic) and the policeman who was with me said, "we should go on to look for " - 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness doesn't complete his sentence.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps if I can ask you to slow down a bit. You mentioned Colonel Renzaho.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who asked them to go to a location and the name was? 
MS. MELLUISH:
91 on the spelling list.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Kimisagara and where did he come out of? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Renzaho came out of his office. Then he took off and we followed. When we got to Radio Rwanda he went into the premises of the radio station and the policeman who was with me said, "We should go on to Kimisagara to look for Conseiller Rose Karushara, who was the conseiller of Kimisagara secteur.
MS. MELLUISH:
Karushara is at 83.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, I'd like to take you back to the préfecture office. When you first saw Colonel Renzaho, can you tell us how he was dressed? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He was in military gear and usually he would not wear military uniforms but on that day he was wearing his military uniform, but I knew him previously. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us how you knew him previously? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I got to know him during meetings. I had the opportunity of seeing him face to face, even though those meetings have no relationship with this trial. 
I wonder, Mr. President, if I'm allowed to talk about those meetings. If you grant me leave, then I'm going to tell you how I got to know him. It was towards late 1993 during a meeting which he chaired, which meeting had taken place in Nyarungenge office where his office was during the war. Should I move on? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What we want to know now is how you knew Mr. Renzaho. We do not want details about previous incidents at this stage. So when did you first see him, was that in 1983, yes or no? Was that the first time? 
@WITNESS AFP:
I first saw him in 1993 and on the 7th when I arrived at his office I saw him again. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Had you seen him between 1983 and the 7th of April 1994?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is correcting that it was in 1993, not 1983.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So are you saying that it was not in 1983 but in 1993? Is that when you first saw him, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Actually I had known him even before but it was in 1993 that I came into close contact with him because he was just in front of me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to pursue this, Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, no, I was going to move.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well then, when did you first see him ever in your life? 
@WITNESS AFP:
The first time I saw him was during a meeting which he had organised and it was around late 1993. He was the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture. And I saw him for the second time in 1994 on that 7th.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you saw him once in 1993 and the second time you ever saw him was in the 7th of April 1994. Is that how we are going to understand your evidence or is that an incorrect summary? Mr. Witness, don't talk while I'm talking. We are trying to ensure that you and I communicate efficiently now. So what is your evidence. Just listen to the question.
@WITNESS AFP:
Mr. President, what you are saying is correct. I saw him in late 1993, then I saw him again on that 7th of the year 1994, that morning.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when Renzaho came out of his office, did you recognise him? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, I did. You see, on account of his office in that préfecture and given that I was a *******, I could not be unaware of Renzaho, whom I had seen many times. But as I clearly stated, I saw him at close range for the first time during that meeting in 1993. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when Renzaho came out of his office, can you tell us, step-by-step, please, what he did? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
If I have to tell you what he did in chronological order, he came out of his office, then we headed toward the Rwandan radio station. He got on the premises of the radio station, but we continued toward Kimisagara because, as I said, the policeman said we had to go look for the Rose Karushara. So we picked Rose Karushara from her home and went to the préfecture office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, why did you follow Renzaho? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I did not follow him. We simply left the préfecture office almost at the same time and we were driving behind him. So, there were four policemen. **********************. The policeman was with me asked me to continue to Kimisagara, so we went on the Gakinjro road. We passed in front of the prison and we went to Kimisagara at the residence of Conseiller Rose Karushara.
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Let me ask you, do you remember approximately at what time Mr. Renzaho entered the radio station building? 
@WITNESS AFP:
He entered the Radio Rwandan premises around 9:30 because we came back to the préfecture office around 10 a.m.
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The name of the road? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm sorry, I don't think I caught it.
@WITNESS AFP:
I no longer remember the name of that street but I can describe the road leading to Radio Rwanda, and I think that you yourself can consult a map and you are able to locate that street. You will see the various points of access to Radio Rwanda.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you say in a previous answer that you went to a narrow road and that narrow road had a name? 
@WITNESS AFP:
No, it was not a small street. It was a tarmac road. It's a road passing through Gakinjro and goes down to Kigali main prison commonly referred to as the 1930 prison.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, help us with that name, please, someone. Can you spell that name before the 1930 prison? I think that was the one you referred to in your previous answer.
@WITNESS AFP:
I'm mentioned Gakinjro, Mr. President. It is not the official name of that street, it is a neighbourhood which is commonly known as Gakinjro.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's useful to know, but, you see, whenever a name is mentioned in this Court we need to make sure that when we read the transcripts later that we got it correctly spelled. So, if you would kindly help us with that now. Could you please spell this name which you have referred to a few times? Will you do that, please? 
@WITNESS AFP:
So you want me to tell spell it? Well, if I could be handed a pen.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not on the spelling list, is it? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm sorry, Your Honours, it isn't.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We seem to need a revised spelling list for tomorrow morning.
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you read out that spelling? Your handwriting is very clear, but I think you may be in a better position to read it.
@WITNESS AFP:
G-A-K-I-N-J-R-O. Is it correct? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is asking.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we'll leave it at that.
@WITNESS AFP:
So this is Gakinjro.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Keep the paper and pen there. He may need that if other names are referred to. 
What is the next question?
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you said you travelled behind Renzaho's vehicle to Radio Rwanda. Can you tell us what type of vehicle Renzaho was in? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It was a Renault. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was he alone or with somebody else? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He was with his military driver. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you yourself in your vehicle, was there anyone else with you? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I was with four commune policemen. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And if you could just clarify for us, please, who gave the instruction to travel to Rose Karushara's house? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
****************** instruction from the policeman who, himself, had been instructed by Colonel Renzaho. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, please, what happened when you got to Rose Karushara's house? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
When we arrived there, one of the policemen went to see her to tell her that the préfet needed to see her. So she got out of her home and mounted the vehicle and we drove back to the préfecture office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you were at her house, did you notice anything unusual? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
What was unusual was a roadblock which had been erected in front of her house. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was this roadblock manned? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, it was manned by Interahamwe.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This Rose Karushara, is that a man or a lady? 
@WITNESS AFP:
A lady, Mr. President.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know, Mr. Witness, whether Rose Karushara had any political affiliation at that time? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
She was a member of the MRND, just as the others were also members of that same party, but she was a very active member of that party. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what do you mean by "very active member"? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
She was a personality well-known within that party. She was trusted by the préfet. I think I should point out here that the préfet did not trust many of his conseillers, but I should say that he particularly trusted Rose Karushara. Should I move on? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said you collected Rose Karushara from her house and you travelled back to the préfecture. Can you tell us what happened when you got back to the préfecture? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
When we arrived, the conseillers and bourgmestre I mentioned earlier on, went out and we loaded firearms into the vehicle. Then we took Rose Karushara to her home. When we arrived at her home, we sat down for some time and she gave us drinks. Afterwards we went back to the préfecture office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, if we could take this a little more slowly, please. You said first you loaded weapons into the vehicle. From where did these weapons come? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I think I left out something. When we arrived at the préfecture office in the company of Rose, a policeman went and informed the préfet that she had arrived. So Tharcisse Renzaho came out of his office and then we went to the Hotel Diplomate, which was located a few metres from Camp Kigali. When we arrived at Hotel Diplomate she got out of the vehicle. We saw many soldiers at that place. And I should point out that they were officers. I was subsequently told by the policeman that among the people we saw present was Mr. Kabiligi. So they entered the Hotel Diplomate premises, then they came out. Subsequently, they asked the policeman and soldiers present there to accompany them. They took out the weapons which were in the building and loaded them *************.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we need to do this step-by-step. Now, first of all, ************* behind Renzaho's car to Radio Rwanda then you continued to Rose's house. Is that true, yes or no?
@WITNESS AFP:
That is correct. We continued to Rose Karushara's home.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What did Renzaho do when you continued to Rose's house? Where was he when you left 
Radio Rwanda? 
@WITNESS AFP:
When we went back to the préfecture office Renzaho was already there. We found him there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this mean that Renzaho, after having entered the Rwanda radio premises, he did not drive with his car together with you to Rose's house? 
@WITNESS AFP:
That is correct. He did not go with us to Rose's home. He entered the radio premises and we continued away just by ourselves. By the time we returned to the préfecture office he was there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, to the loading of the weapons, you said they were loaded in the car. Were they loaded ************************** 
@WITNESS AFP:
Yes, they were loaded in the car ******************.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you just clarify, please, witness, where you were when you first saw these weapons? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I was seated on the vehicle ****************. It was parked in front of the Hotel Diplomate building. I did not go out **************. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And was Renzaho there at Hotel Diplomate? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, he was personally present at Hotel de Diplomate. He was the one who went into the premises. He saw those soldiers, they greeted one another and, subsequently, entered the building, then the soldiers came out with those weapons, which they loaded on the vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you recognise any of the other soldiers, apart from that? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, apart from the one identified as Kabiligi, and I must say that I did not personally know him, by the way.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is this Kabiligi, Mr. Witness? What was his position in society in 1994? 
@WITNESS AFP:
I was unaware of his position, but he was a senior officer and certainly that was the reason why his name was mentioned. But even if I saw him, I was unaware of his position.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The first time you saw these weapons were when they were loaded ************** at Hotel Diplomate, is that the evidence?
@WITNESS AFP:
Yes.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us what weapons they were? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Kindly repeat your question, please.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if counsel can repeat her question.
@WITNESS AFP:
Actually, I'm not a soldier, but I saw the weapons and among the weapons were Kalashnikov guns. There were other weapons which had already been used and we could see that they were not new.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question the witness seemed to understand was, "can you tell us what weapons they were?" 
And here is the next question.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall how many weapons there were? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
There were many weapons, because they made several rotations, but approximately -- I would say there were about 100, however, personally, I did not count them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And beside the weapons you described, was anything else loaded **************? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, they also loaded cases of ammunition into that vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after the weapons and ammunition were loaded ***************, do you know what Renzaho did? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
After that we went to the préfecture office. The weapons and ammunition were offloaded and taken to the office. The first person I saw carrying some of those weapons and ammunition was 
Conseiller Karushara because the weapons were loaded ******************** and we ferried them to the house. And I imagine that other conseillers also received weapons and ammunitions. I can't think that they left without having received some of the weapons and ammunitions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When did you receive the weapons at the hotel? What time was it? 
@WITNESS AFP:
It was around 10 a.m., because we had just returned from Kimisagara, and I had already said we left the préfecture office a few minutes after nine o'clock heading for Kimisagara.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you arrived at the préfecture office when, after having been at the hotel? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Around ten o'clock or a few minutes after ten o'clock. It is just an approximation when I look at the time it took for us to make the trips from the various points, I think it was around ten o'clock, because I remember I had left my home around seven o'clock, that is early in the morning.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that you took the weapons from the hotel back to the préfecture office and that they were unloaded there, but I think you then said that weapons were loaded back *********************. Is that correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, after the stock destined for Rose Karushara had been set aside, that weapons stock which had to be handed over to Rose Karushara was then loaded *****************. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall how many weapons were part of the stock for Rose Karushara? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, I do remember. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, please? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Not more than ten. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when those weapons were loaded ***************** a second time, where was Rose Karushara? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
She was still inside the office at the préfet's office with the other conseillers. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did she come out? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, she came out and entered the vehicle, but first of all she asked the policeman whether the weapons had been loaded into the vehicle, and the policemen confirmed that. She verified and then we went on the Kimisagara.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
She entered which vehicle? 
@WITNESS AFP:
*************************************. She did not enter the préfet's vehicle. She entered the vehicle ******************.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at that time do you know what the préfet was doing? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, I have no idea. I was not in a position to know. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us what happened when you got to Rose Karushara's house with those weapons? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The weapons were offloaded and placed in Rose's living room, in that very room where she had received us and served us some drinks. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Who offloaded the weapons? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
They were offloaded by the policemen. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know what happened to the weapons after they were offloaded into the living room? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The Interahamwe came at their own behest, entered the living room of the conseiller, who told them that she was going to distribute weapons. In fact, she had already begun distributing them before we left, five weapons had already been handed to Interahamwe who were manning the roadblock. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where were you when this happened? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I was sitting in Rose Karushara's living room. As I have already told you, when we arrived she served some beer and when we finished drinking what she had offered us, then we left and took off. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after you took off, where did you go to? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
We went back to Nyamirambo and then on to the centre of town on our way to the préfectural office. When I arrived at the préfectural office a policeman handed me ************************, which had been signed by Préfet Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho. And then he told me to go home and return the next day in the morning. So I went back ******************, as I usually did.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Renzaho present in the hotel when the weapons were loaded *****************?
@WITNESS AFP:
He was inside with the soldiers, then he came out and entered his vehicle driving in front of us. We followed him straight to the préfectural office without any stops.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you went to Rose's house with weapons in order to offload them in the living room, Renzaho remained in his office or did he accompany you in the direction of Rose's house? 
@WITNESS AFP:
No, the préfet was not with us when we went to Rose's house.
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Who ordered you to go to this Rose's house, not to any other place? 
@WITNESS AFP:
We had been instructed to go fetch Rose from her home and we were under instructions to take her back to her home, as well. So we had taken her to the préfectural office, where she received the weapons, and, of course, some instructions, as well. And thereafter we took her back home. Things couldn't have happened otherwise. The person who gave me orders was the policeman who was in my company.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did the policeman instruct you to go and fetch Rose from her home? Is that where the order came from? 
@WITNESS AFP:
The policeman received instructions from the préfet, who was standing next to him. It is the préfet who told the policeman that we should follow him. I thought that we were going to follow him into the radio house, but then we took another road leading to Kimisagara. So the policemen were receiving orders from the préfet because they could not act on their own behest.

Now, you said that you received a laissez passer and you were told to report to the préfecture office the following day, is that right?

Mr. President, we did not hear the witness mention a laissez passer, the reference in French was made as (French spoken) which is a *******************. Are we talking about the same thing here?

@WITNESS AFP:

@MR. PRESIDENT:
This other authorisation, had that been signed on the same date or the same occasion as the first travel authorisation you referred to or previously? 
@WITNESS AFP:
That first authorisation was issued at the beginning of the war in 1990 because I was a member of the cellule committee, and it was at that time we were issued those authorisations. Other members of the population had been forbidden or prohibited from travelling around. I'm sure the préfet knows what I am talking about because he is the one who issued those authorisations.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you have any difficulty travelling around Kigali, as you did on the 7th of April? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

At any stage.
@WITNESS AFP:
Not at all.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can we move, Mr. Witness, to the following day, the 8th of April, and can you tell us what you did first thing in the morning? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
On the 8th of April I went back to the préfectural office arriving at the office at around 7 a.m., and I remained there till 2 p.m. Obviously I had to have lunch, so I was absent for a while, then I came back at around 2 p.m., and at that time the préfet came out of his office and he talked to some policemen asking them to follow him. We left the préfectural office driving along the same road that goes by 
Radio Rwanda and Gakinjro and the 1930 prison then we went right up to Kimisagara. Can I proceed? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We need the spellings first. Can you help us, Prosecution?
MS. MELLUISH:
I believe all those words have been spelt already.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We take your word for it.
@WITNESS AFP:
May I proceed? Well, we were with the préfet and we arrived at Rose Karushara's house. She was at the roadblock herself, that is Madam Conseiller, herself, was at the roadblock, and she talked to the préfet, who was still in his vehicle. When the Interahamwe saw the préfet they gathered around him. He talked to them, asked them how they were doing and told them to continue to work. Some people were sitting on the ground at that location, people who had been arrested at that roadblock.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Firstly, can you tell the Court what you understood by the préfet telling the Interahamwe to continue to "work"? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The word "work" meant "kill", and that is what it meant. When he said "work", he meant "kill". He wasn't asking them to do any other kind of work. He was asking them to kill. So, when we left that location, you will understand that they continued to work as the préfet had asked them to do. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, you mentioned some people sitting on the ground near this roadblock. Do you know who they were? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, I did not know them, but I believe that they were Tutsi, given that they were the ones who were being looked for. The Hutu had no problem, and it is for that reason that I believe it is Tutsi who were sitting at that location. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, what makes you say that you believe that the Tutsi were the people who were being looked for and that Hutu had no problem? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I say that because generally speaking, it is the Tutsi who were being looked for, or maybe the Hutu were not bothered, so, in a group of 100, if there was one Hutu, you cannot assign much weight to that. So, to my mind, I think that they were looking for Tutsi, because it is the Tutsi that were, indeed, killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, if you are able, how the Interahamwe that gathered around Renzaho behaved towards him? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
They were happy when they saw him, and he was also happy and it is at that point that he told them to work. Renzaho himself made that statement. He used that word, "work". Colonel Renzaho used that term, that word "work" for the first time in Rwanda. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at that time, Mr. Witness, were the Interahamwe that you saw there armed? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, they were armed. You may want to recall that weapons had been distributed to them on the 7th, and it is those weapons that they were carrying, but some had clubs and machetes and knives. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And are you able to estimate how many Interahamwe there were? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Many of them. I could not count, but there might have been 20 or 30 or thereabouts. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you hear any other discussion other than what you told us between Renzaho and those Interahamwe at that time? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I did not hear anything else, except the request for more weapons. And you would understand those who had machetes and clubs also wanted to be given guns. He told them that he would be able to do so. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after telling them that, what did Renzaho do? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
We continued to travel towards the Nyakabanda secteur, which was not far away from there. There was another roadblock at that location manned by Interahamwe. The conseiller was also present and he also stopped at that roadblock. He asked -- or he talked to the conseiller and the Interahamwe. A similar request for guns was also made to the préfet. Interahamwe at the roadblock had some guns and he promised to get more for them. Then we went on toward Nyamirambo near to Josephied Brothers monastery. Some Interahamwe were present at that location and two Josephied Brothers in robes were also present. He didn't spend much time at that location because there was a Red Cross vehicle not far away from that location and people were making some pictures, so he did not spend much time at that location. He did not talk to anybody. We went back to town and when we got near Club Raffiki at the Nyamirambo brigade we stopped there and there was a roadblock manned by Interahamwe and gendarmes. There were some dead bodies at that roadblock. People had just been killed at that roadblock. So we went from Club Raffiki to the mosque near to Red Cross. At that location there was another roadblock and there were many Interahamwe at that roadblock. Then we went on to Gitega and many people had been killed at Gitega as well. He saw Conseiller Estane (phonetic) of Gitega secteur at Gitega.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the name of the conseiller at Nyakabanda? 
@WITNESS AFP:
I did not know the name of the conseiller of Nyakabanda. He had just replaced Kandekwe (phonetic). He was a new official and I did not know his name. So, when we got to Gitega, the Interahamwe asked for a vehicle to enable them to carry away the dead bodies that were strewn around that area. Then we went through Camp Kigali back to the préfecture arriving at the préfecture office at about 3 p.m., and then I went home. That is how the day unfolded, that is thereafter noon from 2 p.m.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the first name of Kandekwe? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Emmanuel Kandekwe. It is not Kanyandekwe, Kandekwe.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
At 78 there is a spelling mistake, K-A-N-D-E-K-W-E, is that the correct spelling? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Correct.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, you've described visiting a number of roadblocks. Could you tell us what the purpose, as you understood it, of your afternoon's travels was? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I did not have any discussion with the préfet, but to my mind he was checking on the use to which those weapons that had been distributed were being put. You would understand that there was no request for guns in Gitega. All they asked for was a vehicle to take away the bodies -- the several bodies that were lying in that area. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, to go back to the beginning of your trip, at the roadblock at Nyakabanda, was there a discussion between Renzaho and anyone else about weapons? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
In Nyakabanda, the Interahamwe requested more guns, because they did not have enough. But I think that some guns had also been distributed to civilians because there were certain people who were killed in their homes, not necessarily at the roadblocks. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were you able to see whether the people manning the roadblock at Nyakabanda actually had weapons when you visited? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
They had guns. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at -- at Nyamirambo, you said that the préfet didn't stop for long. Can you describe in a little more detail what you saw at that roadblock? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
There were dead bodies near a place where a Red Cross vehicle was picking up injured persons as well as bodies. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And were you able to recognise any of the injured or dead? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, I did not make out anybody. I simply saw dead bodies. We did not spend more than one minute at that place; I did not have time to look around. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, the next roadblock that you went to, can you recall who was manning that? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That roadblock was manned by gendarmeries and Interahamwe. It was at the Nyamirambo brigade, close to Rafiki club. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And were the people manning that roadblock armed? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes. At that roadblock, the gendarmes had guns, but the other persons manning the roadblock had machetes and clubs. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you stop at that roadblock? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, we simply slowed down. I think he was afraid of being photographed, because there were whites in the Red Cross vehicle who were taking snapshots. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
At which roadblock are you now, when you are saying this? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I am referring to the Nyamirambo roadblock at the St André college in the St Lwanga parish. It was close to the road leading to the St André college and the Charles Lwanga church. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So your reference to the guns, namely that: "The gendarmes had guns but the other persons had machetes and clubs," that sentence referred to which roadblock? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The roadblock at the Rafiki club, opposite the Petrorwanda petrol station. But currently that petrol station's name has changed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The road the Interahamwe (Microphones overlapping). 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, the préfet simply spoke to the gendarmes. I don't know what he told him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
At the Rafiki club, the Interahamwe had no guns, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
They did not have guns. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Did you see any dead bodies near this roadblock? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, there were dead bodies. Three bodies by the road. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, the next roadblock that you referred to earlier was at ONATRACOM; is that correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, there was a roadblock at ONATRACOM, near the Red Cross building and it was near the road leading to Camp Kigali. But at that time, that road was not being used. We are still in Gitega secteur, so there were two roadblocks in that secteur. There was one roadblock at ONATRACOM near the mosque. There was another one near the Gitega secteur office, and it was at that roadblock that there were many dead bodies. So those who were able to pass through the ONATRACOM roadblock could not at all pass through the Gitega roadblock. I am referring to the Tutsi here. They stood no chance of passing through the Gitega roadblock. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
At the first of those, the ONATRACOM roadblock, did Renzaho stop? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, he stopped and spoke to the people who were there. He repeated the same instructions. He asked them to work. Those people were very happy and Renzaho, too, had changed. He told them to work. He repeated the same thing at that roadblock. And those manning that roadblock had guns. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what kind of people were they, who manned that roadblock? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
On the 7th, there were soldiers there. But subsequently that roadblock was manned by Interahamwe. On the 8th there were Interahamwe there. Even at the second roadblock there were Interahamwe. I am referring to the two roadblocks located in Gitega secteur. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And the second roadblock at Gitega secteur, did Renzaho stop there? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, he stopped there because the people manning that roadblock had asked that he place a vehicle at their disposal to remove the bodies of victims. Because there were lots of bodies there, and those people had to be buried. Following their request, Préfet Renzaho promised to avail them with a vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to estimate how many bodies there were at that roadblock? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Actually, I did not count the bodies. There were lots of them. One could see bodies everywhere; the bodies were visible. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I wonder if a copy of these photographs could be provided to the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, that is a booklet of photographs. I would ask you to look at the first photograph, which is numbered 1 in the bottom corner -- 
MS. MELLUISH: 
But I see my learned friend has risen. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is indeed what the Defence was fearing. Those are photographs which have not yet been authenticated. I do not know whether it is only for illustrative purposes, without any weight whatsoever, that my learned friend is putting them to the witness. But it was made known clearly here that it was a witness who claimed to have taken the photographs in 1994 who would come and testify about that to us. I do not see how through this witness we can start examining those photographs through other witnesses. So we object to the production of that photograph in the course of this witness's testimony. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What we are discussing now is whether a document can be put to a witness as part of examination, and there counsel for both sides have a wide discretion as long as it is relevant. We will follow this and see whether it's relevant. But in order to know the answer, we need to know what this is about. 
Now, this document you are referring to, does it have a K number? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
A K number, yes, that appears at the top. And on the bottom of some of the -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, but are you asking the witness for any particular photo with a particular K number, and if so, which one? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, I found it easier, Your Honour, to refer to the number in the bottom right-hand corner. But if Your Honour prefers I can use the K numbers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, you are referring to the number at the bottom. With other words, the first one which is K0376701. 
What is your question in connection with this photo to this witness? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, do you recognise the contents of this photograph at all? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, have you ever seen this photograph before? Let me ask it that way. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It is the first time I am seeing this picture, Mr. President. It is my first time of seeing this picture here in this courtroom. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you have not been shown it, in connection with your preparatory discussions, by the Prosecution? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, sir. That photograph was not shown me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then the question was, this photograph, which you say you've not seen it before, do you recognise the contents on that photograph? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, that photograph confirms that what I was saying is the truth. The first proof is the loading of dead bodies, as we have in this photograph. I don't know when that photograph was taken. That is the date. But I think it was not before our passage, which I described, and that is the Gitega roadblock. 
Regarding the previous (sic) photograph, it is the roadblock at ONATRACOM. So I have identified the two roadblocks. When a person passes through the roadblock located in front of ONATRACOM, that same person stood no chance of going through the roadblock which was at the Gitega secteur office. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please, Mr. Witness, hold on. Hold on. This is not clear. 
This photograph, what leads you to say that it is linked to any particular roadblock? The first photograph marked 1 at the right-hand bottom. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The reason is that on that photograph I can see people whom I saw at that roadblock. I am unable to give names, but I know at least three people that I saw at that roadblock whose faces I recognise on this photograph. And I am also able to recognise the garbage disposal mechanism which was located there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Monsieur le President -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What do you mean by "that roadblock"? Which one are you referring to? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I said there were two roadblocks. The first roadblock was located in front of ONATRACOM when you are heading in the direction of the Gitega secteur office. And it was at the second roadblock where that garbage disposal mechanism I referred to a while ago was located. But I cannot recognise the other places where the photographs were taken. Otherwise I can recognise the road leading to the Gitega secteur office. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So which roadblock is this? Are you referring to the Gitega roadblock now? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The place on that photograph is of the second roadblock. I mentioned two roadblocks. The first one located in front of the ONATRACOM offices, and the second roadblock, which was located at the secteur office of Gitega. And I am unable (sic) to recognise that second roadblock because of the garbage disposal can, the huge garbage disposal can which was there. Because in the days following my first passage there, I was able to recognise the huge garbage disposal can, and it was located at that roadblock. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, try to answer this more briefly, will you, Mr. Witness? You see, we have heard your testimony and listened very carefully. The last sentence we have now is that you were unable to recognise the garbage, so it couldn't be the second roadblock. What are you saying? Is that the correct translation? Is this the Gitega roadblock, or is it the ONATRACOM roadblock? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
There was a first roadblock located at ONATRACOM. I have already referred to it. Then there was a second roadblock located at the Gitega secteur office. At the first roadblock, there was no garbage disposal can. In fact, there was no dead body, even. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, yes, all right. You see, we have heard you say three times that there were two roadblocks you referred to, and that is exactly the problem. So with other words, what this is referring to, according to you, is then the second roadblock, namely, the one at the Gitega secteur office; is that your evidence? This is not the ONATRACOM roadblock; is that what you are trying to convey to us? Or do we get it wrong? Just tell me the name of this roadblock; which roadblock is this? Don't mention many roadblocks. Only the name of this one, according to you. Please. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The roadblock on the first photograph was located at the Gitega secteur office. And that is where there were many people, and it was at that place that the préfet was requested to place a vehicle at their disposal to carry away dead bodies. That was the roadblock which had been set up at the Gitega secteur office. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this was also where the garbage place was; true? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, quite so. That garbage can was located at the Gitega secteur office. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Prosecution, what is this photograph? What is its provenance? Where does it come from? When was it taken? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, Your Honour, we will be calling Witness BUX to provide detailed information about that. But this photograph was taken by the witness, BUX, who was in Kigali in -- I'm not sure of the precise date, but May 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. And then we will hear what BUX is saying about this. 
What is your next question? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I believe, Mr. Witness, that earlier you said that after visiting the Gitega secteur roadblock, you returned to PVK. Is that a correct recollection? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That's correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you returned to PVK, what did you do? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
When we arrived at the préfecture office, I did not do anything else. Since the person I was addressing myself to was the communal policeman, I asked him if I could return home, and indeed, I left around 3 p.m. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And had you seen Renzaho again after being with him at the roadblock at Gitega secteur office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
We were driving behind him up to the Kigali-ville préfecture office. Mr. Renzaho entered his -- at his office, and I asked the policeman if I could return home. And he said yes, so I left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, during the course of the afternoon when you were with Renzaho, can you tell us, please, whether he had any difficulty travelling around Kigali? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Objection, Mr. President. We consider this question leading. If the witness has to mention the difficulties in the travels made by Renzaho whom he was accompanying, he would have said so spontaneously. I do not think that it is time now to suggest to him any difficulties Mr. Renzaho may have encountered. That is why we object to this question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's open ended, but more specific. Your remark goes to weight. 
Can you answer the question, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, I can answer the question. For the Defence to claim that the question is leading -- I think that if I were to answer before counsel stood up, I would have said that the préfet did not have any difficulty. Mr. Renzaho was the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture; he was an army colonel in the Rwandan army. No one could object to him passing through. Not the policeman could impede the movement of the préfet, who Renzaho was the representative of the entire administration, as well as the ministry of the interior. No one in that préfecture had more authority than him. No one could have impeded Renzaho's free movement. 
Otherwise let me repeat that I will answer only questions put by the Prosecutor without going beyond, and I am of the view that the Prosecutor's question was not at all leading. The Prosecutor is entitled to know whether Préfet Renzaho had any difficulties moving about. And I am saying that he could not encounter such a difficulty because he was a préfet. And even more so, he was an army colonel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Your view on this is noted. 
Next question? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And are you able to comment at all on the attitude, as you saw it, of Renzaho during the course of that afternoon? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He had not changed; he remained Renzaho. He spoke to the Interahamwe and he promised to fulfil their needs. But he wished that they should continue working. He did not prohibit the Interahamwe from killing. All what he told them was to kill. He never prohibited them from killing. Rather, he told them to work, and he himself knew the meaning of that word gukura. He can explain to you whether gukura would have meant to go and work the fields. That is what I know regarding the person who was a préfet of Kigali-ville. I think I have nothing else to say regarding his attitude, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we all agree that gukura is G-U-K-U-R-A; isn't that so? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Where are you in your examination-in-chief now, Prosecution? How much is left, approximately? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I think I am three-quarters of the way through, Your Honour, if that's helpful. I'm not sure how long -- what time is it now? It may be another hour, or an hour-and-a-half. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's 5 o'clock. We will then stop for today. The next witness after the cross-examination of the present witness, can you confirm that that will be UL? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. If you use approximately one hour tomorrow morning, from 8:45 to 9:45, not more, is there an indication by the Defence how long the cross-examination will take? We are simply asking because we need to know whether we should call the next witness before lunch or after the lunch break. That's the purpose of the question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, we think it would be preferable for the Chamber to call the next witness after the lunch break, because we think we have a significant number of questions to put to this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So if we ask that witness to arrive from 2:30 onwards, that would be a reasonable estimate? Then he will not have to wait in the morning, but he will be entering the courtroom sometime in the afternoon. That's how I understand you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Quite so, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. Witness, we will continue your testimony tomorrow morning at 8:45. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. 
Is there anything of an administrative nature we need to deal with now? If not, we will then adjourn until tomorrow. Thank you.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, yesterday you told us about what you did on the 8th of April. Can you now tell us, please, what happened on the 9th of April? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I did not do anything particular on the 9th of April. I spent the day in the office up until the evening when I returned home, but I didn't go anywhere. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What office is that you are talking about? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The préfecture office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you tell us, while you were at the préfecture office, what did you see there? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I was about to notice the movement of staff and the préfet also would go out and come in. There was nothing unusual, apart from the movement of people coming to see the préfet, most of whom were soldiers, but there were also civilians who came to see him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, can you recall on that day what Renzaho was wearing? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
As usual, he was wearing a military uniform. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about the following day, the 10th of April, can you tell us what you did on that day? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Counsel, I would like to remind you that I did so many things on that 10th of April such that I'll not be able to explain to you in detail what I did; however, I remember that we went to the home of Protais Zigiranyirazo. We went there in the morning. When we arrived at Protais` home the préfet entered the house and we stayed within the compound. There were many people at Zigiranyirazo's house. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Okay, first of all, from where did you travel to Zigiranyirazo's house? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
We had left the préfecture office to go to Protais Zigiranyirazo's house. We took the road passing in front of the Banque Nationale de Rwanda and which goes down to what, at the time, was Mr. Zigiranyirazo's home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us who you mean by "we", please? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I was following the préfet's vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And besides the préfet, was there anyone else in his vehicle? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, apart from his military driver, I did not see anyone enter his vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you got to Zigiranyirazo's house, can you tell us, please, slowly, what happened? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
When we arrived at Zigiranyirazo's house we found many people there. I was able to recognise Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Robert Kajuga and George Rutaganda, but there were other people inside I couldn't identify. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us who is Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the President of the MRND. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And Protais Zigiranyirazo, who is he? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I knew Protais Zigiranyirazo at the time when he was the préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture, but I also knew him under other circumstances. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What circumstances are those? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I knew him because I hail from Gitarama region wherein he had a concubine, and since I often went to that place I had seen him there on several occasions at the time that he was still the préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. And can you tell us who is Robert Kajuga? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Robert Kajuga was the national leader of the Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And Georges Rutaganda? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Georges Rutaganda was his deputy at national level within the Interahamwe, but he was also active within Kigali town. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you arrived at this house, what did Renzaho do? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He went and spoke to Zigiranyirazo. They started their chat outside, then they subsequently entered the house, but I was not aware of what they were talking about. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
For how long, if you can recall, was Renzaho at that house? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
They stayed together for about two to three hours. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And during all that time where were you? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
We were within the premises at the place where *****************; however, in the meantime Colonel Renzaho or, rather, Zigiranyirazo had come to ask me to go to the city centre. He sent me along with the soldier and we went to one Mbyareyehe, who was a conseiller. When we arrived there Mbyareyehe was standing in front of his store. So, we loaded the foodstuff that Mr. Zigiranyirazo had asked us to load up, that is rice and cooking oil, at the end of which we went back to Zigiranyirazo's.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you left the préfecture office when on the 10th of April? 
@WITNESS AFP:
We left the préfecture office around ten o'clock.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You arrived at Mr. Zigiranyirazo's house when? 
@WITNESS AFP:
It didn't take us long, at most two to three minutes. It was just close to the préfecture office.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho was with his driver in the car, no one else, that's what you told us, is that so?
@WITNESS AFP:
That's right.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was ************, if any? 
@WITNESS AFP:
I was with four policemen who were also moving around with me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were you back from collecting foodstuffs at Zigiranyirazo's house when Renzaho left? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That's right, I had already dropped off the foodstuffs. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell me, if you know, where Renzaho left when he left Zigiranyirazo's house? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He went to the préfecture office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how do you know that? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
We followed him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you arrived at the préfecture office, do you know what Renzaho did? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, immediately he arrived he went straight to his office. I don't know what he did.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it's very useful if we can take this step-by-step and finish each sequence and we get all the information we need in relation to one step and then we move on. Sometimes that can be a bit challenging, in particular, if the witness wants to move on rapidly, but we try to structure the witness that way. 
Now, you told us, Mr. Witness, that you had to go somewhere to fetch foodstuffs. Was that what you told us? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Yes, that is what I told you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When were you asked to leave Mr. Zigiranyirazo's house in order to do that? 
@WITNESS AFP:
It was around eleven o'clock.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In other words, about one hour after the commencement of the meeting, if we shall call this a meeting. Is that so? 
@WITNESS AFP:
That's right.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time did it take you to go to this place, get the food, and come back again? 
@WITNESS AFP:
It didn't take us long. I would say around 40 minutes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you returned to the préfecture office, what did you do? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Nothing else. I stayed there waiting until around 6 p.m. -- sorry, 5 p.m. and I went home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, the following day was the 11th of April. Can you recall what you did that day? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
On the 11th of April I did not do anything particular. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were you at home or did you go to the préfecture office, as you had previously? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
As usual I went to the office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And before the end of the day did you leave the préfecture office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
On the 11th of April, no, except perhaps for the midday lunch break, and I did not need to request permission for that purpose. It was I took my lunch very close to the préfecture office, so I would go and enjoy my lunch and return to the préfecture office without needing any permission for that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see Renzaho, at all, on the 11th of April? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I saw him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us what he was doing? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He was not doing anything particular. I simply saw him go out of his office, then he would return to his office and he was alone. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were there any other people at the préfecture office that you saw that day? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes. There were some people who came to the préfecture office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What kind of people were these? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Civilians, soldiers and some influential Interahamwe, because, you see, some of the Interahamwe were influential and could directly contact the préfet. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know what these people were doing at the préfectoral office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
There was only one activity, the planning and implementation of the massacre, because at the time the massacre had already started, so it was a question of planning and implementing the massacre. Putting an end to the massacre was out of the question. Everybody has a lone objective of pursuing the massacre, so all those who came to that place, were to receive instructions in that connection. Even though I didn't have discussions with those people, I could, after all, understand what was being said. No one intended to go and rescue people from being massacred. All those who came to that place were there to receive instructions on how to go and further the massacres. There was no other activity. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, the following day, the 12th of April, in the morning, what did you do? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
On the morning of the 12th of April I went to the préfecture office, as usual. When I got there I sat down and stayed there until around twelve o'clock when the policeman came and saw me and asked me to go to the Hotel Diplomate. We went there. When we arrived there one of the policemen entered the building. He then came outside with the soldiers who were there. They took out guns and loaded them in the vehicle. After that operation Kabiligi came and we went to the préfecture office, where the guns were offloaded. But after the offloading, the guns were immediately loaded anew into the vehicle. That was around 2 p.m. They even took out other weapons from the préfectoral building and others yet from Kabiligi's four-wheel drive vehicle which guns were loaded **************. We went with Kabiligi to the roadblock located at Zigiranyirazo's residence where we dropped off some weapons and then we left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. I'd like you to go through that a bit more slowly, please. To start with, you said you were at the préfecture office as usual and some policemen came to you and ************ to the Hotel Diplomate. Now, when you left the préfecture office ****************, were you alone? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I was in the company of the four policemen *******************************. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you left, was ************* the only vehicle which left the préfecture office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No. Kabiligi's four-wheel drive vehicle was in front of us, and when we arrived at the destination he parked his vehicle. ***********************. And when the weapons, which were in ************, were offloaded they were taken inside and then brought outside again and, once again, loaded into *** ************. They even took out some of the weapons which were in Kabiligi's vehicle and loaded them ********************
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you left the préfecture office with Kabiligi's vehicle in front of you, did you know that that was Kabiligi's vehicle? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes. I knew because we could see Kabiligi. We left the office and Kabiligi and Renzaho were driving one behind the other, and we were behind them, so there were three vehicles, the first to Kabiligi, then Renzaho's, and then ours. When we got to the roadblock at Zigiranyirazo's house we offloaded the weapons and Kabiligi ordered us to continue, and when I asked where to, the policeman told me, "we should go to the Kimisagara, Nyakabanda, Nyamirambo and Gitega roadblocks and at each of those roadblocks we would distribute weapons. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry, there might be a little confusion here. When you first left the préfecture office in the morning you said that you went to Hotel Diplomate? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Then you travelled between the préfecture office and the Hotel Diplomate. What other vehicles were with you, if any? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Kabiligi's vehicle had left Hotel de Diplomate headed for the préfectoral office and the préfet was not with us at that time. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But when you first left the préfectoral office in the morning, the very first time, was Renzaho with you? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
When we arrived at Hotel Diplomate he was not with us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, on that day, can you tell us when you first saw Renzaho? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
On that day I saw him at around 2 p.m. when we were headed for Zigiranyirazo's house and he came along with us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And where was it that you first saw him? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I saw him coming out of his office and we went together to Zigiranyirazo's residence, with Kabiligi, and our vehicles drove together, mine being in the third position. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So is it right, if I understood your evidence correctly, that you said that when you went to Hotel Diplomate you were only with Kabiligi? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, there were also some policemen. We met Kabiligi at the Hotel de Diplomate. We did not leave the préfectoral office together. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, when you left -- you did leave the préfectoral office, was it your vehicle alone that left? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That is correct. I was in the company of policemen only. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when was it that you first saw Kabiligi, then? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I saw him at Hotel de Diplomate and when we left the hotel towards the préfectoral office we went with him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you -- how long were you at Hotel Diplomate? Can you recall? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Not too long, just time enough to load the weapons and then to leave. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And were you able to see these weapons yourself? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I saw them with my own eyes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you describe the weapons that you saw? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Well, you know, it is difficult because it was a mixture of various firearms. I am not in a position to tell you whether it was this specific type of gun or this type of weapon, particularly in that I am not versed in distinguishing weapons, so I cannot tell you the type of weapons that they were. All I know is that it was a combination of various types of firearms. I would think that we had those types of guns that could be seen ordinarily in Rwanda. And then we saw some Kalashnikovs, which were not very well known in Rwanda at that time, by the way. And those Kalashnikovs seemed to be brand new. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you estimate how many weapons were loaded *******************? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Many weapons were loaded ******************. It was almost full.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, how many cars were together from Hotel Diplomate to the préfecture office? 
@WITNESS AFP:
*************, Kabiligi's vehicle, that makes two. When we got to the préfectoral office then the préfet's vehicle joined our convoy or group, so to speak.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And that was at what time? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Around 2 p.m. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Okay, so where did the convoy go, the convoy that you were in, when it left the préfecture office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The convoy headed for Zigiranyirazo's residence, and we went to that roadblock which was set up close to that residence on the road leading from Hotel Kiyovu to the centre of the city. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at that roadblock, who was manning the roadblock? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That roadblock was manned by soldiers and Interahamwe, and I'm referring to the roadblock that was not far from Zigiranyirazo's residence. And this is what I was able to notice. I looked into the premises of a compound belonging to some Chinese and I noticed that some people were sitting down or had been asked to sit down within that compound. That was what I was able to observe happening not far away from where I was. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at the roadblock, what happened? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Nothing in particular, except for the offloading of many weapons, leaving about 20 or 30 in the vehicle, and it is those remaining 20 or 30 that were distributed at the other roadblocks I have referred to. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when these weapons were offloaded at the roadblock near Zigiranyirazo's house, can you remember what Renzaho was doing? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He was in Zigiranyirazo's house. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
As far as you can tell, was Renzaho aware that the weapons were being distributed there? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, he knew. He knew because when we left the préfectoral office that was the purpose of our mission. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall, if you know, how long Renzaho was inside Zigiranyirazo's house? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
We went on to the other roadblocks, which I have referred to, beginning with Rose Karushara's roadblock at Kimihurura, then we went to Nyakabanda and we left two or three weapons at those roadblocks and went to Nyamirambo and dropped weapons there. Then at Bijogo we left two weapons, as well, and I believe there were no further weapons in our vehicle. Then we went back to the préfectoral office. That is what I witnessed on that day. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, but my question was, can you recall how long Renzaho was inside Zigiranyirazo's house? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I cannot say, because we spent some time along the road, but by the time we got to the préfectoral office at about 3 p.m. he was already there.
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So when you travelled around the roadblocks you just mentioned, who were you with? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I was with the four policemen I have already referred to. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what did you do at these roadblocks? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
We distributed firearms. What happened was that we would meet some people at the roadblocks, the policemen would ask them who was their chief, and one of them would identify himself as the chief and that person would then collect the firearms. We gave two or three firearms to some of the roadblocks or we distributed two to three firearms at some of the roadblocks. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And why did you do this? Had somebody asked you to? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
You may want to understand that the policemen in my company had a chief and I think it was that person who indicated the locations at which the weapons would be distributed, and I believe they did so with some instructions, and they couldn't have taken that initiative without receiving instructions and orders. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, as far as you know, who was the chief of these policemen? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
One of them, when you look at a group you can identify the chief, but the problem I had was that I was not familiar with those policemen and therefore did not know their names. I hadn't had any discussions with them in order to know their names, but they called themselves names that I am not able to remember. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to tell whether Renzaho was aware that these policemen were distributing weapons? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He knew. He knew. I have already told you that when we left the préfectoral office these people must have necessarily discussed what they were going to do. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. When you returned to the préfectoral office you said that Renzaho was already there. Can you tell us what he was doing? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
He was in his office, and I did not see him doing anything. So, I asked a policeman if I could go home because it was 5 p.m., and the policeman told me to go home and come back the next morning. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And is that what you did? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, that is what I did, I went home immediately. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And the following morning what did you do? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, how many persons were in the car from the préfectoral office to the house of Mr. Zigiranyirazo? 
@WITNESS AFP:
There was Kabiligi and the préfet and then **************, that makes a convoy of three vehicles, which went to Zigiranyirazo's residence.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the route of Mr. Renzaho after having been at the house of Mr. Zigiranyirazo? 
@WITNESS AFP:
When he left Zigiranyirazo's residence, are you asking me how he went back to the office? There was no other itinerary. He went back to the office the same way he had gone to Zigiranyirazo's house. When the other roads were blocked, which went through the president`s residence, he therefore went through the road passing by the national bank and then by President Habyarimana's residence. He couldn't use the other road, which was closed. He, therefore, went by the national bank and then turned towards his office. That is the only possible route he could have used. I don't know whether he went to his residence and, by the way, I don't know his residence. All I am certain of is by the time we got to the préfectoral office he was already there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, he went in his car after having been at that house. Were there any other cars accompanying that car? 
@WITNESS AFP:
I do not know. We left him there with Kabiligi, but Kabiligi didn't enter Zigiranyirazo's house. We went by the road at Hotel Kiyovu and left. Many people have asked me questions about him, and I have already answered telling them exactly what I have said.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, sometimes one has to ask additional questions to be absolutely certain there is no lack of communication, Mr. Witness. Now, who left the house of Mr. Z first, was it any particular car? 
@WITNESS AFP:
It is the vehicle ***************, which had offloaded vehicles at that location, which left first. After I left and before I went too far I noticed that Kabiligi had also left and was going towards Hotel Kiyovu while Renzaho remained and entered Zigiranyirazo's residence.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
On the following morning, the 13th of April, what did you do? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
On the 13th of April I left the préfectoral office, but on that day I had the first opportunity to have a discussion with the préfet. He beckoned me with his hand to come. He said, "Come here". And asked me whether I knew where the Fina filling station was. I said, "Yes." So he asked me to go meet the station attendant at that location and tell him to come and provide some assistance. So I went to that filling station and asked for the manager. That person was very close to the préfet, and I told him that the préfet had sent me to come assist him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall what time it was in the morning when Renzaho came and spoke with you? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
At about 10 a.m. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you went to the Fina station, were you alone or was somebody else with you? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I went there alone, leaving the policemen behind. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you assist the Fina station manager? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I couldn't do anything for him. I wasn't distributing fuel, but all I did was *********** from the filling station to his home at the end of his working day, and then the next morning ************************ from his residence and *************** to his place of work. 
$(Questions and answers were redacted by order of the court)
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Shouldn't that be placed under seal? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, it probably should.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will delete from, ****************************************************************************** Court video system please do not transmit that. 
Next question, please.
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm grateful.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
During that time, did you have reason to visit the préfecture office again? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, I never went back to the préfectoral office again. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see Renzaho again? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, I did not see him again. Well, let's say that I would see him when he would come to fill up his car at the filling station, but I never talked to him and you may want to know that the filling station was used mainly to distribute fuel to the Interahamwe. In fact, it didn't sell to the public, it simply pumped fuel on the basis of vouchers that were signed by the préfet. That is why one can say that it was only every now and then that some people provided money to get fuel from that station. But most often people came with vouchers signed by the préfet to fill up their vehicles at that filling station and most often those vouchers were signed by the préfet. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How do you know that those vouchers were signed by the préfet? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I could see them. The manager asked those who came to collect fuel to show proof of a document signed by the préfet, and I was often nearby and I would hear the conversations that went on between those who came to collect fuel and the manager. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after *************************************, did you see Renzaho again? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, I did not see him again. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, I have one final question for you. During the time that you were frequently visiting the préfecture office, were you aware of anything that Renzaho did to stop the killings that were taking place in Kigali? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I think I mentioned something yesterday. Renzaho never said the word "stop the killings." He never uttered those words prior to 1994. 
I wanted to talk to you about a meeting he organised, but you told me I was not authorised to do so. But all I can say is that he never said that he was going to stop the war. That idea never crossed his mind at all. If he had said those words himself, the killings would have stopped the very day or night, because he was a very powerful man. If he had the courage to go on Radio Rwanda and say, that, "I have decided that the killings should stop," Then the killings would have stopped because he had the authority to do so. All the killings in Kigali would have stopped. I would even go as far as saying that he is responsible for all those who were killed in Kigali town, all the in Kigali town were killed because of him, and I say this without any hesitation whatsoever. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. I have no further questions for you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Defence.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, throughout your examination-in-chief you gave an account of the activities which took up your time from the 7th to the 13th of April 1994, correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That's right. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And those activities are the ones you mentioned to the Prosecutor in the statement which you recorded on the 22nd of December 2003 and the 30th of November 2004, correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Correct, sir. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you remember that on the 25th of January and on the 30th of January 2006 you testified in another trial in this Tribunal giving an account of your activities during that same period? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I don't think your question is relevant. If you saw me on those dates then you have to put questions to me if you are certain that I testified in the Renzaho trial because, as far as I know, I have never come to testify before this Trial Chamber in the Renzaho case. I started my testimony only yesterday. Now, if you want to put questions to me regarding my prior testimonies, then you need to get another opportunity for that. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you didn't answer my question. Did you testify in another case in this Tribunal on the 25th and 30th of January 2006? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, and that is why I told you earlier on that you do not have to put questions to me regarding my prior testimonies because I don't see any relationship between this case and the other case in which I testified, so I don't think you should be allowed to put questions to me regarding my other testimonies. Let me point out that on that occasion I answered questions put to me in that case.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, even if there may be different cases and different testimonies the counsel still is entitled to refer to previous testimony, for instance, in the present trial. So you have to bear that in mind, please, should counsel wish to do so. 
Now, what is the next question? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Mr. President, I would like to react to your intervention. Defence counsel has documents before him. I don't have any documents before me. Besides, he didn't give me time to prepare. He did not hand his questions to the Prosecutor and he did not speak with the Prosecutor for the Prosecutor to prepare me. Nowhere did I note the various dates he has referred to and, to be honest with you, I am not even certain that I gave testimony on the dates mentioned by Defence counsel because I must acknowledge that I am not a computer. And I think that even Defence counsel himself could not give those dates unless he had some document he was referring to. So I think, in all fairness, Defence counsel ought not to put questions to me regarding my testimony in another case for as long as I've not been prepared for such questions and I don't have documents before me as Defence counsel has.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You're quite right, counsel may have such documents and also that he has not mentioned possible questions to the Prosecution, but that's normal in the courtroom. And we also understand that it is difficult to remember everything. No witnesses are computers, so, this is not unusual. 
And here follows the next question.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you told the Court that Prosecution counsel prepared you for you to give testimony in connection with this trial. Is that correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, if you are referring to the Prosecution counsel present in this courtroom. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is, indeed, the person I'm referring to, Witness. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Are you referring to the lady? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, he is. So you can confirm this lady prepared you before your testimony, isn't that so, Mr. Witness? I think that is a yes or no answer. You can confirm that, can you not? 
@WITNESS AFP:
That is correct because she called me and put questions to me and we discussed questions and she asked me the same questions. She asked me questions based on my statement. So those were not questions the Prosecutor imagined. They were questions based on my statement regarding my appearance here. I do not know whether it was at the request of the Prosecutor or whether I am here because I have been called by the Chamber. I was called to testify and here I am.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's good. Now, what we want now is to ask you to continue to answer briefly the questions by Defence counsel. They are very precise and they can be answered quite briefly. Here follows the next question.
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, during your preparation did she remind you of the content of your statements of the 22nd (sic) of December and 30th of November 2004, yes or no? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I'm going to answer you. Earlier on I told you something that you are putting to me that is 30th of November, 20th of December. Well, those dates I didn't note down anywhere, and I don't have any documents before me. So my proposal to you is to put questions to me regarding my testimony. Now, as for questions regarding my statements of 2003 or 2004, I can tell you that I'm not in a position to answer you, and I don't see the relevance of your questions regarding my statements which are two years old already. And I should state further that I don't have any documents before me, but I am ready to answer your questions so long as they are in connection with my testimony yesterday and today.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and these questions are relevant so now we want the next question and a brief answer, please.
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when you gave evidence in the other trial as a witness, did you mention your activities on the 7th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, let me repeat that I gave evidence in another trial, and let me further repeat that I am not in a position to give answers regarding that other testimony. So, if Defence counsel want to put questions to me regarding my evidence in that other trial, he should look for another opportunity, because I am unable to remember entirely the evidence I gave, and I have insisted that Defence counsel put questions to me regarding my testimony in the Renzaho matter. So, I would like to repeat to Defence counsel that I am not ready to give answers to questions regarding my other testimony. I am ready to answer any questions so long as the questions concern my testimony in the Renzaho case. Even though those questions are of relevance to him I consider that questions relating to any other case are not relevant, and I am ready only to answer questions concerning my testimony in this Court in the Renzaho case. And I have no answer to give him regarding what I said in my previous testimonies in another case.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
One matter, Mr. Witness, is what counsel may do. Another thing is what you may remember. Now, what we want to know now is whether you did mention the events on the 7th of April in the other trial. Are you able to remember whether you did that or not? Do you recall? 
@WITNESS AFP:
I do recall.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you recall, did you mention the 7th of April or did you not mention the 7th of April in that other trial?
@WITNESS AFP:
I could not not have spoken about the events of the 7th of April because I remember very well the events of that date, but I state those are two separate cases. And I'm of the view that Defence counsel should not be authorised to extrapolate to go and look for elements of my evidence in another case and to start putting questions to me regarding my evidence. I'm even wondering how he was able to get the documents of that trial because he was not at that trial. How was he able to lay hands on the documents of that trial? That is my question. I have told him that I am not ready to answer questions regarding another testimony in a case different from this one.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Transcripts from trials are publicly accessible in this Tribunal and these questions are normal questions. Now, here follows the next question.
@WITNESS AFP:
Mr. President, if that is the case, then I can entertain questions put to me by different counsel. But in order for me to answer I would like to have access to the transcripts and hand those transcripts to Defence counsel so that he wouldn't need to put questions to me again, since he would already have the transcripts of my testimony of him because, you see, I have the impression that he simply wants to corner me. That is why I'm not ready to cooperate with him along those lines.
$(Pages 1 to 14 by R. Lear)
1015H 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
He will now ask you his next question, Mr. Witness, and I am glad that you are ready to entertain these questions. And whether there will be need for the transcripts, we will come back to that later. But now we want, really, to proceed. So we have noted your position, but now we want to focus on questions and answers, and that will make it possible for you to complete your testimony within a reasonable time. 
Now, next question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, is the account of your activities on the 7th of April 1994 as you gave us here consonant with another account you have given in another case regarding your activities on the 7th of April 1994, or do the two accounts correspond? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, actually, the account I have given before this Court is fully consonant with my activities on the 7th of April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you very much for your cooperation, Witness. So, you told the Court that on that 7th of April 1994, two policemen came to look for you at home, they took you to the secteur office, and from there to the Kigali-ville préfecture office; is that correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you mentioned, further, that from the Kigali-ville préfecture office you went to Kimisagara, and this time around with four policemen; is this correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, it is. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, sir, kindly explain to the Trial Chamber how the two other policemen joined your group, or according to you, were those two policemen who were taking you to the Kigali-ville préfecture office replaced by four other policemen? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
If you remember very well, I told you that the two policemen went back to the Biryogo secteur office. The four policemen who went with me were four policemen different from the other two with whom I had left the secteur office. Because when we arrived at the préfecture office, the two policemen accompanying me showed the vehicle to the secteur office and then -- to the préfecture office, correction, and then went back to the secteur office. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. So, if I understand you properly, there were two policemen who took you to the Kigali-ville préfecture office, and they were subsequently replaced by four other policemen. And that means that on that 7th of April 1994, you saw in all six policemen at the Kigali-ville préfecture office, correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Did you say six policemen? Nowhere did I mention six policemen. I was not charged with making a head count of policemen. Do you think I am in a position to give you the number of soldiers who were at the préfecture office? If you know what the duties *********************************************. You do not make a head count of staff while ***********************************************************. Try and do this, and you will see. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the two police officers who fetched you in the morning, were they the same as some of the police officers that ************************* later on in the day? Or were they not? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, Mr. President. You have the text of my testimony. I said when we arrived at the préfecture office, the two policemen accompanying me immediately went back to the secteur office. So those two policemen did not remain at the préfecture office. They immediately went back to the secteur office. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So then Defence counsel is right, do the addition and saying that, all in all, you saw six police officers on that day; isn't that so? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness's microphone is off, Mr. President. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Mr. President, when we arrived at the préfecture office, the two policemen who were accompanying me, after explaining that they were bringing back the vehicle which had been commandeered, returned to the secteur office. But regarding the four policemen whom I met at the préfecture office, there were not just the four of them, there were many other policemen. This is to state that there were many other policemen at the préfecture office. But with regard particularly to the first two policemen who had come to fetch me from my home to take me to the préfecture office, they immediately returned to the secteur office after dropping off that vehicle in the préfecture office. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, at what specific point in time did the four policemen you are referring to now come and meet you in ****************? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I arrived there around 8:30 a.m., and the four policemen immediately joined me. One of them asked me to *****************************************************, we had a brief chat. So it was around 8 o'clock that we started our brief chat, because I arrived there around a few minutes after 7 o'clock. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Do you remember what you discussed with those policemen? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
But I have already explained that: It was not really a discussion, per se. We were just talking about Habyarimana's death. There was no other topic of discussion. It was being said that Habyarimana had been assassinated by the Inkotanyi, and I think that even if you yourself were there, that would have been the main topical issue. Everything had ground to a halt; there was no activity. People had locked themselves indoors, others were being massacred. There were gunshots here and there in Kigali city. Counsel, I wonder if you understand me: There was no other topical discussion. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I understand you in total, Witness. Since that was the topic of your discussion, were you able to get to know those policemen, since you were discussing with them? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
What do you mean, sir? Do you want to know whether I was able to know their names, or whether I was able to ascertain that they were Rwandans or foreigners? What really do you mean? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What I would like to know, really, Witness, is whether you were able to know their names. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, sir. Those events occurred more than ten years ago, and I must acknowledge that even if the discussion had taken place some ten days ago, I would not have been able to remember their names. I simply identified them as policemen, and I was also able to identify Renzaho because he was an influential personality, different from an ordinary policeman. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. I would like us to clarify this matter regarding the policemen, and also for the Trial Chamber to follow what is going on. Do you confirm that the four policemen are the same policemen who accompanied you on the 7th, on the 8th, on the 10th, and on the 12th, or were some of them replaced by others? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I thought I'd already answered your questions. Do you want us to backtrack? When those two policemen said that they were bringing back the vehicle which had been requisitioned, they trekked back to their base. Regarding the four other policemen, they were the same throughout the trips I made until the 12th of April. None of them was replaced. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I would like you to state whether you carried out your trips the 7th, 8th, 10th, and 12th of April with those very same four policemen. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Counsel, let me repeat this, and I believe for the fifth time: I carried out the trips with those same four policemen up until the 14th of April. None of that group of four policemen was changed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to distribute some documents that have been disclosed by the Prosecutor, transcripts of this witness's testimony in ICTR 2001/P (sic) of 25 January and 30 January. I would therefore like to distribute this document so that the Chamber and the entire Court can follow what I intend to do, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Prosecution knows which documents are now being distributed? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, yes. Although I understood it was just the transcript, but you appear to have a statement. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you been given by the Defence -- you are aware -- 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
There is also a statement, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the letter of 4th September 2006 from Mr. Moses to Maître Cantier, in French translation. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honours, the only difficulty I perhaps foresee is that the only version of the transcript I have with me is in English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. We appreciate, of course, having been given these documents now, Defence. But whenever documents are distributed, exactly the same set must be given to the other party as well, even if that set may originally be in their possession. There is also practice in this Tribunal to distribute these documents to the interpreters and the court reporters, unless they are particularly voluminous. So the number of copies will usually have to be much higher than three, unfortunately. 
But let's see how we can proceed on the basis of what we have now. Just go ahead. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Obliged, Mr. President. I had made provision for copies for all parties, including the interpreters, but we didn't have enough time to make sufficient copies. And I am sorry for that. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, regarding the number of policemen, let me refer to your testimony relating to the number of policemen in *************** on the 7th of April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, this will be on page 8 of the transcript of 26th January 2006, French version. Are we there? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are there in the French version, yes. But since there are several persons in the courtroom who may prefer the other version, the general practice will be that you always give the pagination of both versions. Do you have the English as well? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Unfortunately, no, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then we will find it. But next time, and whenever there is a reference to any document, please refer to both versions. But you may well start with the French, since that is your working language. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the question, please. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, this is your testimony of 26th January 2006. The following question was put to you by the Prosecutor examining you in that case. First of all, Mr. Kapaya puts the following question to you -- that will be the fifth paragraph from below: "What type of vehicle was Renzaho driving?" And your answer: "A Renault 21, except I am mistaken. But I am certain, I believe, that it was a Renault 21. But he was not the one driving. He had a soldier who was his driver." 
Then the Prosecutor puts the following question to you: "Do you remember how many people were in **************?" Your answer is the following: "Two policemen." Do you remember that sequence of questions and answers, Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Even if you continue to compel me to repeat the content of my testimony, I simply can only say that Defence counsel is putting questions to me arising from Prosecutor Kapaya's questions. Now, in that case I made a testimony and I do not even recall who the Accused in that case was. So if the Defence counsel could specify who the Accused in that case was, then I might be in a position to answer his question. He is referring to my testimony in another case, in another trial. Which case and which trial is he referring to? 
As far as I know, the person who was accused in that case is different from the person accused in the matter before us now. I therefore just want to know whether Defence counsel was party to that other case, and is he in a position, or does he have the capacity to put these types of questions to me? What I can state is that today my testimony relates to a specific case, or specific trial, but the other testimony was made in another case, and I would rather not revisit it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we have noted your position, Mr. Witness, and we have told you that you have to accept these questions. Now, the first question is as follows, and please answer my question briefly: Is it your testimony that you do not now remember the name of the Accused in the previous trial? Is that your testimony? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It is possible that I remember the name of the Accused, but I have testified in several cases and I am not sure that I can remember clearly the name of the person who was the Accused in this other case which is being referred to. I know for certain that today I am testifying in Renzaho's case. And maybe when I will be testifying -- or, when I was testifying elsewhere, I answered that there was one or two policemen in ***********. And that is why I want to know from the Defence counsel which specific testimony he is referring to, but that his questions now should relate to this case before us. We -- I believe that Renzaho's name is even mentioned in the other case Defence counsel is alluding to. But let me recognise -- let me admit that I am able to answer questions relating to different cases. 
Once again, Mr. President, I would like to ask -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I have to stop you now, Mr. Witness. I really have to stop you now. Your answers are far too long, and we have understood your position. 
Now, memories fade. That's normal. Do you remember the name of the Accused in January 2006 when you testified? What do you think was the name of that Accused? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It was the Zigiranyirazo case. And the question Defence counsel is putting to me relating to those two policemen, Mr. President, was indeed put to me during that case, and I provided an answer. And -- but I went on, later on, to specify that indeed there were four policemen, and we finally came to an agreement. And the person who was questioning me asked why I had previously said that there were two policemen. I went on, therefore, subsequently to explain that indeed there were four policemen. I do remember that incident, but I had gone on subsequently to explain clearly that it was not only two policemen but, rather, four. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I am happy to note that your memory has been jolted and you can now remember. Now, let us look at what you said about the policemen on page 16. The Presiding Judge at that time put the same question to you, and she put the following question to you: "Were you the only one in the vehicle as well?" And your answer is: "No, I was with the two policemen I have already talked about." Does that ring a bell, Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
My answer is the following: I have already told you that we had a difficulty surrounding this issue of two policemen. I was being asked about two policemen, and I had answered that the two policemen had already returned, and that four policemen had now been given to me. Now, if you had read through my testimony, then you would realise that I went on to talk about four policemen who came after the previous two had left. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you telling this Court that during your previous testimony, you finally agreed that you made those trips with four policemen and not two? Is that your testimony here and now, Witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you hear the question, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I did not understand the question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is: Are you saying that in the previous trial you, at the end, stated that there were in fact four police officers in the car, after having first said that there were two; is that your testimony? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That is what I said. Let me explain: There were four policemen with me, not two policemen. The two policemen had left, that was the two policemen who were initially assigned to me had left, and then I continued with four policemen. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and we have understood this. 
Now, Defence, is it your view that in the previous transcripts we will not find the correction alleged to have been made by this witness? Is that the point? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, that indeed is correct. I simply want to go through his testimony so that the witness can discuss this correction with me. I have the correction here on record, Mr. President. With your leave, can I proceed? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Counsel, what I have said is that you are putting questions to me which I cannot answer. Once again, you are putting questions to me relating to another case, and I would rather answer those questions that relate to this case and not questions relating to Zigiranyirazo's case, Mr. President. I am saying this because that's what I believe. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and your position is abundantly clear, Mr. Witness. And you have to bear with us, because we will now proceed. 
And what is your next reference, Counsel? Which page should we now look at in the transcripts? What is the next portion of the transcript? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Page 8, Mr. President. Transcript of Monday, 30 January 2006. Page 8. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please proceed. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I want to read out a few excerpts for your attention. On that day, this is the question that counsel put to you: "The two policemen -- you said that you had seen two policemen during that day. Aren't you sure that there were four of them?" Your answer, Witness: "I went around with two policemen, but there were two other policemen at the préfectoral office. That makes a total of four. But when I went around, most of the time it was in the company of those two policemen. Otherwise, two policemen were at the préfectoral office." 
Then, Witness, counsel puts another question to you relating to the number of policemen, and reminds you of what you had mentioned in your statement. Then counsel goes on to ask the following question: "Is that indeed what you said to the Prosecutor?" And this is your answer: "On the 7th, when I went to Rose Karushara's residence, I arrived the premises of -- at the level of Radio Rwanda in the company of two policemen. He went into the premises of the radio station and then *********** on to Karushara's residence with two policemen. If reference has been made to four policemen, that must be a mistake. I said two policemen." 
Do you remember that those were your statements and that that was the correction you made? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Counsel, I have a question for you: You say that I said a policeman went into the radio, or was it Renzaho? No, I never said that. I said -- and I have already explained in relation to the two policemen, that the number went from two to four. And I have provided that explanation. I never said that a policeman went to the radio station. He could not have left ************** to enter the premises of the radio station. So I never said any such thing. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, let us go to page 9. On page 9 the witness makes the following comments: "Let me repeat what I have said." And that will be paragraph 26. "It has already been my testimony that there were four policemen at the préfectoral office. That whenever I went around, it was with two out of those four policemen. I never went around with four policemen. However, there were four of them at the préfectoral office. But I always went around in the company of two policemen." 
Then a question -- another question is put to him: "Yes, you seem to remember that very clearly. So you are not mistaken, Witness? Isn't it so?" Answer: "Yes, I do confirm." Conclusion by Counsel: "So, the Prosecutor made a mistake four times; isn't it so?" And the witness answers: "Yes, it is correct. Because I had explained to them that there was a total of four policemen at the préfectoral office, that when ********** around it was only in the company of two of them."

@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, do you remember having had this kind of question/answer session with the counsel, Witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you hear the question, Mr. Witness? It was whether you remember this exchange from the previous trial. That's all. It can be answered with a yes or no. Do you remember? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
What did you say? I no longer understand anything. My equipment is not working. 
I hear you, but very faintly. Not at all. There's a problem. I can't hear. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence counsel, are there other excerpts in connection with this issue, or was that the last part of the transcripts that you wanted to deal with in this area concerning two versus four police officers? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am done with the reference to the number of policemen, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Mr. Witness, we have now noted what was said during the previous trial, where you gave testimony concerning the number of police officers. And it could be argued that there is a contradiction between what you are saying here and what you were saying there. Do you have any final comment as to this apparent contradiction, so that we can move on? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
On that point, Mr. President, regarding the policemen, I have already said it several times; it is true that in that other case -- or, in this case, the question has been put to me about the two policemen who had come from a different secteur. I told the Court already that those two had gone back and other policemen were assigned to work with me, and they were four in number. Four of them worked with me. It is true that in the previous trial, a question -- questions were put to me on the number of police persons, and I noticed that the Defence counsel is using them to claim that I had said that there were only two policemen. But I had provided further explanations to clarify the issue that there were four policemen in total. Because the counsel who put those questions to me in that other case was also claiming that there were two, but at the end of it all, we understood that there were four in number. I could not confuse two for four, whereas those people were with me. This is all I can say, and I thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. On the 7th of April 1994, can you confirm that on that day you went to Rose Karushara's after ********************* Mr. Renzaho to the radio house? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, I agree with you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are very close to the 11 o'clock break. Before we take that break, do we agree that Bucyogo is spelt B-U-C-Y-O-G-O? Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry, I fear I might have missed the reference to that. Could Your Honour assist? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm now trying to clarify some pending issues in the transcripts. Do we agree that the location mentioned by the witness yesterday was Bucyogo, spelt B-U-C-Y-O-G-O? 
Is that the correct spelling, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It is Biryogo. Biryogo. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That will be spelt B-I-R-Y-O-G-O, spelling from the Kinyarwanda booth. B-I-R-Y-O-G-O. Biryogo. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
Then we had a place close to Gitega, a neighbouring secteur, to Bigobo, is that B-I-G-O-B-O? How do you spell that, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Once again it is Biryogo, B-I-R-Y-O-G-O. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Number 14 on the spelling list. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So it's the same. That's noted. 
Would this be a convenient moment for the break, Defence? We will then have the 11 o'clock break and we will resume at 11:25. 
The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1100H to 1132H) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a slight delay because of a technical problem, I understand. 
Now, the next question. Please proceed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, before our morning recess, you confirmed that it was after ************************************* with Mr. Renzaho to the radio station ******************************************* the lady conseiller of Kimisagara secteur. Am I correct? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, kindly remind me of what the exact time was? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It was around 10 o'clock. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. How far away is the home of the lady conseiller de secteur from the radio station; do you remember? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The round trip would be three kilometres. Or perhaps two. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You said three kilometres or two. Can you be more specific than that, Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
The round trip is less than three kilometres. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. When you went to look for her, **************************************************************? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
*****************************************************************************************************************
*************************************** 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. And you did not encounter any form of barrier, any obstacle on the road? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
No, none. I told you I was accompanied by policemen in an official vehicle with official number plates. And on the vehicle it was even written that it was a state-owned vehicle. So no one could stand in our way. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, if I were to put it to you that the distance between Radio Rwanda and Kimisagara, round trip, is eight kilometres, what would you say? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That is not correct, Counsel. That is not correct. ************** for 25 years in Kigali-ville and I know all the roads in Kigali much better than you may. I don't even know the roads you're referring to, and I wonder if you know what you're referring to yourself. Even if you were to call somebody in Kigali today and ask them to give an estimate of the distance between the radio house and Karushara's residence, that person would give you that distance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Listen, are we talking about round trips or one way here? We have used the word "round trips" all the time. If you were now, Mr. Witness, to tell us the distance between these two locations, one way, what is it, in your estimate? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
About one-and-a-half kilometres. At least less than three kilometres, whatever the case may be. One way, one-and-a-half kilometres. I would say even less than that. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, could you describe that route in much more detail, that is, from the Kigali-ville préfecture to the residence of the secteur conseiller? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Do you want me to tell you about the itinerary? Well, this is what I said. You leave the radio, you go to Ndiro (phonetic), then you go past the prison, and then you get to the roundabout, and then you go to Nyabugogo where Karushara's residence was located. That is about 100 kilometres (sic) on foot. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you repeat your estimate, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
It is a rather short distance, Mr. President, to go from the conseiller's residence. It is a rather short distance from downtown. The distance cannot be up to two kilometres. It is less than one-and-a-half kilometres. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you made a reference to a distance to be made on foot. What was your estimate, please? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
From what location to what location? I didn't talk about any distance being covered on foot. I was referring to distances covered in a vehicle, Mr. President. If you left the Nyabugogo traffic lights, then you would get to that distance as I have already mentioned. And the distance, as I have said, is rather quite short to Karushara's house. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So there was a communication error here between the two versions. That's noted. 
Next question, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I would like to clarify issues between the witness and myself, and in so doing I would like to show him this map of Kigali-ville so that he can show us ************************ from the PVK to Kimisagara. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could someone draw the curtains, meanwhile, please? We will have to ask the witness to move. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I am not able to read maps. I have told you the itinerary which I followed, and you who are able to read those maps, please go on and read them and you would understand what I am talking about. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. If that's the case, registry, instead of proceeding with the curtains, could you give the witness the map just to confirm that he cannot read it. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I am not able to read maps, Mr. President. I have just told you. If you can show me the road from the radio house, if you can see the radio house on the map, maybe I can help you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So then we should make an attempt after all. Why don't we then move the map to the area of the projector, and... 
All right. Defence counsel, you want to have this exchange with the witness? We may not get anything out of it, but you want to make an attempt? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the witness said that he is not able to read any maps. I take note of that, and maybe I will move on to something else. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So in spite of his additional remark, you are refraining from pursuing it. That's noted, then we move on.

Obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, how long did it take you to cover that small distance? That is, how long did it take you to do the round trip? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
About ten minutes. Counsel, I believe that there is somebody near you who knows the area very well; that is Mr. Renzaho. Just put the question to him about that distance. He knows it very well. He is sitting close to you, and he has been on that road. And if you put the question to him gently, slowly, he will answer you. If you whisper it to him, he will answer you. 
I have heard you talk about a number of kilometres, Counsel. Please, what -- how many kilometres did you refer to, Counsel? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, I assume that there has been consultation between the Accused and the client, so don't worry about that, Mr. Witness. 
Here follows the next question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Merci bien, Monsieur le President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, after those ten minutes the conseiller and Mr. Renzaho are with you at the PVK, is it with them that you go to the Hotel Diplomat? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
With who? Who are you talking about, going to the Hôtel des Diplomates with the conseiller? No, no, I did not. But I think I have already mentioned this before, and I don't know whether you did not understand. When we got to the préfectoral office, the préfet was already there. And I never said that she went along with the préfet. I don't know what you are seeking to determine in your line of examination, and I don't know what you -- whether you were listening when I was answering. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What did you say, specifically, Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Are you still talking about the movements or trips of roads, the conseiller? Well, what I said was that we took roads to the préfectoral office where we found that the préfet had already arrived at the office. But I never went with the conseiller to the Hôtel des Diplomates. I don't know why you are revisiting this question. I am certain that you understood what I had said previously. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
With whom did you go to the Hôtel des Diplomates, specifically? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I have already answered clearly. I went to the Hôtel des Diplomates with four policemen. And I was *****************. That has already been my testimony. Renzaho was in our convoy, but in his own vehicle. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, it's -- it's inevitable that there is repetition in the course of the testimony. So everyone here is listening very carefully to your testimony, and all we want to achieve is efficient communication, clarity, and precision. So don't worry, we are listening carefully, including Defence counsel. 
Here follows the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Is it correct to say that you left Rose Karushara at the préfectoral office? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, that is correct. She remained at the préfectoral office, along with other figures of authority who were there. She was not alone, almost all the conseillers and bourgmestres of Kigali-ville were there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you describe your activities differently, depending on the case in which you testify, or do you always describe them in the same manner? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
All trials are not the same, and trials do not resemble each other, in much the same way as the accused are different in one case to another. So the proceedings in various cases differ. If I had provided a specific answer to a question in Zigiranyirazo's case, the same question would not be put to me in Renzaho's case, because these are two different trials; Zigiranyirazo was a politician and Renzaho was a préfet, and each one of them acted differently. So I may say the same thing in one case or the other, but the answers that I provide depend on the question. If you are a woman, I cannot go on to say that you were a man. Renzaho did what he did, Zigiranyirazo did what he did, and therefore you cannot ask me whether I just tell the story according to the trial. Counsel, what do you really want me to answer? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well. Very well, Witness. Let me remind you of what you said pertaining to your activities of the 7th, specifically about your trip to Rose's house on the 7th of April 1994, and I'm relating to your testimony in Zigiranyirazo case. And it is for this reason that I observe that your testimony varies from one case to the next. Do you want me to remind you of what you said in that other case? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, let's be precise now. Which page do you want us to look at, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Page 10, Mr. President, of the French version. 
By the way, I have requested for copies of the English version. Unfortunately the copies are not here yet, Mr. President. That is why we must continue to work with the French version only so far. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine. But now the date -- now the date of the transcript. You said page 10, but of the 26th or the 30th? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
26th January, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Which portion? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I simply want to recall paragraphs 22 to 37. It won't be long, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, go ahead. But I hope you don't have to read it all. Let's start. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am not going to read, but I simply want to recall that it is Judge Muthoga who puts questions to -- to the witness as to the return trip. And this is the witness's answer: "We left Hôtel des Diplomates, went through the radio house, and then on to the préfectoral office." Then later on the question is put to him as follows: "From Hôtel des Diplomates, did you go directly to the préfectoral office, or did you go elsewhere?" And the answer is: "No, we stopped nowhere else. We went directly." 
And then the question is put to him: "When you arrived at the préfectoral office -- when you arrived the préfectoral office, can you tell us what happened?" And this is the answer, and it is the answer I would like the Court to pay attention to, that is, the witness's answer: "Once we got to the office, the firearms were offloaded. They were put into an office. I remained on the premises and shortly thereafter he talked to the policemen." And the "he" apparently refers to Mr. Renzaho. "It was past 12. He told them to go and see the conseiller of Kimisagara secteur." 
And then on page 11 he concludes as follows: "We therefore went to fetch her and we brought her back to the préfectoral office." That is what I wanted to draw the witness's attention to. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, do you remember that as being your testimony? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Counsel, I did not quite follow what you read. Please, could you read it again and mention specifically the location to which I went after Hôtel des Diplomates, and before I got to the Hôtel des Diplomates, where was I? Could you please repeat that excerpt, and then I will be in a position to answer your question relating to the fact that I went to fetch Karushara at 2 p.m. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
So I never said any such thing. I would like you to tell me about that point where I went to Hôtel des Diplomates and I went to Kimisagara to look for Rose Karushara. I never said that. I never said that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Counsel, what is the alleged discrepancy between this testimony and the testimony in the present trial? Can you draw the attention of the witness to that, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is what I am trying to bring to the attention of the witness, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, it has been your testimony here that in the morning -- from the morning, ************-- or, followed Mr. Renzaho to the radio house, and then thereafter went directly ****************************** her back to the préfectoral office. But from your testimony of the 26th, it emerges that you went to the Hôtel des Diplomates first of all with Mr. Renzaho, and that weapons were loaded, and then the weapons were brought back to the préfectoral office, and it is at that time that Mr. Renzaho came out, at about 12, and ordered you *************** Madam Rose Karushara. How do you explain that discrepancy of the versions of the same facts? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I have already told you previously that I did not *********** Rose Karushara in the afternoon. In the previous trial, I testified that I had left with Renzaho around 2 p.m. I did not say that I went with Renzaho to Rose's house. You see, I have never said, either, that I went to Rose at 2 p.m. I said, simply, that I went to Rose Kabuye -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Kabuye, the witness says. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
-- I said that I went there at 2 p.m. I have never mentioned any Rose Kabuye. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
In the witness's words. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
You see, I am not the one who drafts the transcripts of this Tribunal. Maybe there was a mistake somewhere. I have never made any such statement. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, I am referring to Rose Karushara. There is no Rose Kabuye. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes, it is Rose Karushara, indeed, not Rose Kabuye. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Is it your testimony that you have never testified that you ******************* her after 12 p.m.? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I never went ******* her in the afternoon of the 7th. I said that I went ********** her before 10 a.m. That has been my testimony consistently. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Therefore, your statement of the 26th January 2006, in that connection -- or, including such a statement will be incorrect; is it so? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Well, what you're saying, Counsel, is not correct. What I said is that I ****************** her before noon. So what you are saying is not correct, and I don't know where you get that from. There may have been a mistake in the transcripts. So I would like you to read those transcripts carefully, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, I will read them carefully, Witness. But for now, let me ask you to tell us how it is that on the 7th of April you paid no attention to the person who was your employer at that time? You had no worries about that person? You'd had no concerns about that person? Can you talk to us about that? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I worried about my employer, and I even tried to make a phone call but couldn't get through. I don't know if you follow. What I am saying, Counsel, is that I tried to contact that person on the phone, but the phone lines were busy. What you should ask me instead is why I did not go to look for that person physically. Counsel, do you know where that person lived, so that you may understand why I was not able to go visit that person physically? Before you question my lack of concern about my employer, maybe you should say what you think about this question, then I will be able to answer you.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When and at what time did you attempt to call that person? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I have asked you a question, Counsel. Maybe you could have asked me why I did not go to see that person physically. And then I went on to ask you whether you knew that person's address. Now, when you will give me that person's address, then I'll be able to answer your question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I am the one putting questions to you here. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. And that's true. 
Now, did you tell us, Mr. Witness, that there may have been a mistake in the transcripts in the previous trial? That was your testimony, wasn't it?
@WITNESS AFP:
No, Mr. President. That is not what I said. I did not say there were mistakes in the transcript. I simply said that maybe it is the counsel who may have made mistakes in transcribing my testimony. Because in my testimony, I said clearly that I went to Rose's house in the morning hours. And it is the Defence counsel, in his interpretation of my statements, who made the mistake. 
Now, regarding the question he asked about why I wasn't concerned about the fate of my employer, I have asked the Defence counsel whether he knows the address of my employer. If he did, then let him say so before going on to ask me why I wasn't concerned about my employer's fate. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. And he may wish to continue the dialogue with you on that point. But now we have an exchange, you and I. And my question to you now, as a follow-up, is: Let us suppose that the transcripts support the version given by counsel. Would that mean that if we were to play the tape in Kinyarwanda of your testimony in the previous trial, we would find the version you are saying you gave in that trial? Is that the correct interpretation of your testimony? 
@WITNESS AFP:
In my previous testimony, I said that I ************* Rose Karushara at 10 a.m. That has been my position today. There is no other version. It is only on the 8th of April that I went to Karushara's house at 2 p.m. Furthermore, I would like to ask Defence counsel -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please stop. Please, Mr. Witness. We don't really need these questions to Defence counsel. But now we would wish to hear Defence counsel's next question to you. So what is that question, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I was seeking an answer from the witness as to when and where he attempted to call his employer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you get that question, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Yes. I understood the question. Defence counsel is asking me to tell him where I called my employer. 
But I think he should rather have asked me whether I notified my employer of the fact that I was using his vehicle. This is the answer I will provide. The last time I saw my employer was on the 6th of April in the day, at about 6 p.m. And I did not have access to his residence, because he lived in Kicukiro. And that is where the fight was taking place. I, therefore, was not in a position to go to Kicukiro. 
When I called, the lines were busy. And I never saw my former boss again from that day until today. That is my answer.
@JUDGE ARREY:
Yes. Counsel, a point of clarification, since you've been asking questions about the dates, the time that he went to Rose's house. 
On page 11 of the same transcript, I see something that supports his version that he did say they went there in the morning. Because look at the last answer, line 36. It says that, after they had collected her, "We arrived her residence at about 13 hours. We left the residence at about 5 p.m. Then she collected arms. And it was that we were discussing about the killings." 
So the witness is right that they did go there the first time in the morning. After she had collected the arms, they took her back and go to her house around 1 p.m., and stayed there until 5 p.m.
The same transcript that you are referring to, so I don't know whether you saw that section. So, Counsel, go to a different line of cross-examination. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Your Honour, for your comments. But I believe that what I said was, also, correct in respect of the witness's testimony relating to his trip to Rose Karushara's residence. 
Your Honour, if you look at page 9 of the transcript in French, you will see that he is referring to the 7th at 10 a.m. From 10 a.m. the first trip of the witness with Mr. Renzaho -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which line are we in now on page 9, so that we can all follow it? It's number 12? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Line 11 and 12. And it's Judge Khan who puts a question to the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
If we look at the witness's itinerary from 10 a.m. that day, it emerges that he first goes to Hotel des Diplomates behind Mr. Renzaho's vehicle where weapons are loaded. After the weapons are loaded -- and that is all contained in page 10 -- then they return to the préfectoral office, the PVK. And it is after offloading the weapons, line 35, page 10, after the weapons are offloaded -- that is, the weapons that had been collected at Hotel des Diplomates -- it is already past 12. And it is at that time that Mr. Renzaho for the first time asks them to go bring Madam Rose Karushara. 
Whereas, in his testimony here, the witness has, rather, testified that they went to collect Mrs. Rose Karushara in the morning while Mr. Renzaho was at the radio house. 
Those are the contradictions, Mr. President. Then it is only when Ms. Rose Karushara is at the PVK that they then go to the préfectoral office, and then bring them back to PVK, giving part of the weapons to Madam Rose Karushara. 
These are the contradictions that arise from his testimonies in the two cases we are referring to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Mr. Witness, you have listened to this exchange. Do you have anything to add before we move on? 
@WITNESS AFP:
All I can say is that Defence counsel himself is altering his own versions. Because a short while ago he said that I went to Karushara's house at 2 p.m. And in this last comment, he says that I went to Karushara after I had gone ********** the weapons. So I think those are two different versions. 
All I can tell him is that I went there at 10 a.m. But he has continued to alter the versions. 
But let me say that between my first testimony and today, given the time that has elapsed, I might have made a mistake. But, Mr. President, even if I were mistaken somewhere, all I know is that within those time frames we had shipped weapons. I can understand if Defence counsel claims something to the effect that we did not transport any weapons. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, one last question for the witness to clarify this point once and for all. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Question: Did you **************** Mrs. Rose before going to Hotel des Diplomates with Mr. Renzaho? Or did you ****************** her after you had been to Hotel des Diplomates? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
This is what I have been telling you. We went to fetch Rose Karushara. We went to fetch Rose Karushara after we had been to Hotel des Diplomates. Or rather, we went to Hotel des Diplomates after we had collected Karushara. Maybe I was mistaken as to the time that I mentioned. But this is what happened at that time on that date. We did not go to Rose Karushara's house at 2 p.m. It was after the meeting at 1 p.m. in the afternoon that we went to Rose Karushara's house.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
On the 7th of April 1994, Witness, when and from what location did you call, or did you attempt to call your employer? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Counsel, do you want me to tell you all the houses where there was a phone? I have told you already that I called him, but his line was busy. I, therefore, do not see the relevance of your question. 
Well, please explain to the Court how relevant this question is. What do you want to bring to the attention of the judges? And what could I have done for him? I, therefore, do not find it relevant that you continue to ask me questions about the fate of my boss. I have already told you that I called him, but his line was busy. And that fight was raging in the neighbourhood where he lived. 
You can put the question to your client. He was in charge of the préfecture, and he knows exactly what was going on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All we are interested in here, Mr. Witness, is to listen to answers to questions. We are not interested in argumentation. Now, what is the next question? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, he did not answer that question. I put a simple question to him to know when and from where he made the attempt to call his former employer. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's microphone's off. 
@WITNESS AFP:
That is a question I've already answered. I told you I placed the phone call when I went home in the evening. Don't think that we did not have phone lines. I had a phone line at home. I placed a call, but I realized that his line was engaged. And I could not physically go to his home because he lived in Kicukiro, and that is where fight was raging. So no one could enter that neighbourhood. 
You can ask your client, and he himself will give you the same answer. That is all I can tell you regarding my former boss. And let me remind you that ever since 6th of April until this day, I have never seen him. I don't even know whether he's still alive, or whether he's dead. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you set up roadblocks in your secteur on the 7th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Who is that question addressed to, counsel? Or it is in reference to who? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That question is addressed to you, Witness. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Do you want to know whether roadblocks were erected? Or whether I erected roadblocks. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am referring to you personally, Witness. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Personally, I set up a roadblock, but it was not really on the road. It was on a path leading to my home. And I acknowledge the existence of that block. I did it on my own initiative. 
And that roadblock was mentioned during the information gathering process in the Gacaca proceedings. It was on that occasion that I acknowledge having set up a barrier ************************. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you kill Tutsis at that roadblock?
@WITNESS AFP:
Mr. President, sir, I think Defence counsel should be prevented from putting such questions to me because I am not standing trial here. I'm here as a witness. If he wants to try me, then he rather go to Rwanda and investigate to ascertain whether there was a Tutsi who died at that roadblock. I'm here as a witness, not as an accused. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
According to Rule 90(E) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Mr. Witness, a witness may refuse to make any statement which might tend to incriminate him. 
The Chamber may, however, compel the witness to answer the question. Testimony compelled in this way shall not be used as evidence in a subsequent Prosecution against the witness for any offense other than perjury. 
This is the legal situation. Having now explained the legal situation for you, do you want to answer that question? Or would you wish not to answer Defence counsel's question? 
@WITNESS AFP:
Mr. President, it seems that question comes from you. And after having explained to me that -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I did not ask you that question. I'm not asking you any question now. What I'm doing is simply to say that we have rules about this. When someone is asking a witness a question which could incriminate the witness, then the Bench will inform the witness of the legal situation. 
What I just said did not imply any inclination on the part of the Bench whether you should answer it or not. That is now your decision. All I did was to inform you of the legal situation. 
Did you understand me now? Just answer "yes" or "no", please. 
@WITNESS AFP:
I have understood you, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Having understood what I just did, the question I'm asking you now is, you were asked a question; you did not answer it. Do you maintain that refusal to answer it? Is that your answer? 
@WITNESS AFP:
My answer to him was that he could not put such a question to me. That such a question can be put to me only in connection with the cases in Rwanda. I simply acknowledged having set up a roadblock. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I am putting it to you that during that period from the 6th of April 1994, you never met Mr. Renzaho. You were never in contact with him. What do you have to say? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Did you say on the 6th of April? How could I have met him on the 6th of April? I hereby confirm that I did not at all meet with him on the 6th of April. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Neither did you meet with him on the 7th, the 8th, the 9th or the 10th, or even the subsequent days in April, 1994. What do you have to say, sir? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I saw him regularly. I did not discuss with him, but I saw him on a daily basis from the 7th to the 13th of April. I did not say that I did not see him. I did see him. But we did not discuss. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You never followed him in his Renault 21 vehicle. That is my proposition to you. What do you have to say? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Do you mean from the 7th of April when I arrived at the préfecture office I never followed him? Well, let me tell you this, Counsel. I'm just explaining one matter to you. 
Look at me, Counsel. I have two eyes, two ears. So I was able to see things and hear. 
When one have eyes and cannot hear, then one is disabled (sic). But with me it is different. I have my eyes, and my ears. Are you suggesting that I was able to see his vehicle and I could not make it out? I think that you should not put such a proposition that I never saw him. I have perfect sight. Perfect hearing. But you, what you are saying, are things which you heard from others. But I was there. You've heard things which you were told about. But did you not go down to there to see for yourself. It is even highly likely that you do not know Kigali. Because if you are familiar with Kigali, you would not have claimed that I did not see Renzaho from the 7th of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So in brief, the witness is maintaining his previous answers. 
Next question? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when did you first see Colonel Kabiligi during that period? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I said I first saw him at Hotel des Diplomates. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
On what date, Witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Read the transcript before you put such a question to me. Refer to the passage where the date is mentioned. I have already stated that it was on the 7th. Now, if you know of a different date, then kindly tell the Court. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you not state that you first saw him at another date than the 7th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Counsel, let us try and refresh our mutual recollection. You see, you are allowed by the rules to put questions. But sometimes you put irrelevant and repetitive questions. I said I first saw him at Hotel des Diplomates. Now, you are asking me if I did not say I had seen him at another date. 
Let me tell you that Kabiligi was a soldier. But the first time I saw him was between the 7th and the 12th. I told you that I saw Kabiligi. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I have duly noted, Witness, that you first saw him on the 7th. Is that your evidence? The 7th of April, 1994? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
But what else do you want to know? You put questions to me regarding something you have closely followed. I first saw him on the 7th of April at the Hotel des Diplomates. What else do you want? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, allow me to read to you an excerpt of your statement of the 30th of November 2004, recorded by the representative of the Office of the Prosecutor on this particular point. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the statement of 30th of November 2004. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, it is the beginning of paragraph 3. It is your supplemental statement concerning Colonel Renzaho and Gratien Kabiligi. That is the heading of your statement. In paragraph 3 this is what you say: 
"I first saw him at Hotel des Diplomates on the 10th of April 1994, but I did not know him." And you added as follows: "After that, I saw him on the 12th of April 1994 around 2 p.m. at the Kigali-ville préfecture office." 
How do you explain the inconsistency between your statement of 2004 and what you are asserting to right now regarding the date when you first saw Colonel Gratien Kabiligi? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I had said this before. Let me repeat it. Various people put questions to me. Those people could have been mistaken regarding the investigations of my conduct. And this is a supplemental statement. What is the meaning of supplemental, Counsel? It means it concerns certain things which are remembered subsequently. Otherwise in all my statements, I said I saw Kabiligi on the 7th. 
Regarding this supplemental statement, you ought to know that I gave it and I hereby acknowledge it. But from the beginning, I had said that I saw Kabiligi at Hotel des Diplomates on the 7th. 
Furthermore, Kabiligi is not standing trial here now in this court. I may have seen him at this other location. Otherwise, I saw him for the first time on the 7th of April in the morning at Hotel des Diplomates. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what should we understand regarding what you are saying about Mr. Kabiligi? Is it what you had said before? Or what you said in your supplemental statement? Or is it what you have said in your testimony today? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
You should retain what I said in my first statement. I don't even understand the supplemental statement. Peruse my first statement, and try and compare the versions. If the versions are identical, then indeed I said all those things. 
Look at my supplemental statement and compare it with the first statement I give. 
Listen, the people recording the statement may be mistaken. Because I did not ask them questions regarding what was recorded. They need to tell you that.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So is it your evidence that those who recorded your supplemental statement were mistaken? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
That is a possibility. To err is human, sir. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Was it a mistake, or not? You should be more specific regarding your supplemental statement. And let me remind you that your signature is on it. 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Yes. I signed the supplemental statement. I'm now telling you that I did not take time to read the various statements I gave. I have referred you to my first statement telling you that if you did not find on that first statement that I said I saw Kabiligi on the 7th of April, then you would say that I am lying. You should consult that first statement. Then you consult the supplemental statement, and you make the comparison. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you a professional witness? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
Counsel, that is funny. I am not a professional witness. That is why I say you are just mocking at me in all what you are saying. But let me ask you this question: Are you fooling around with me? You are not putting questions to me. You are just trying to make me look like a laughing stock. Now you're asking me if I am a professional witness. How about a criminal? Has he made criminal activities a profession? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We would really wish to focus on evidence. Are there any other evidentiary matters the Court should be appraised of? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, that actually was the ultimate question I had for this witness. Now I rest. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have any documents to tender as exhibits in connection with your cross-examination? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may be referring to the transcripts which we now have in both versions; both English and French. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Absolutely, Mr. President. Also, to the witness statements of 22nd of December 2003, and 30th of November 2004. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Shall we start with the transcripts? Do you want all the pages from the Zigiranyirazo trial exhibited? With other words, all the pages that you have provided to the Bench? Or only those pages which you actively used? You want them all for context, is that so? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm going to refer to the relevant pages which should be choosing (sic), Mr. President. They are pages 9 of the court hearing of Thursday, 26th of January 2006. Pages 9, 10, 11 of 26th of January 2006.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And in addition, page 8, which you also used, plus the front page. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Quite so, Mr. President. Mr. President, I am a bit lost in all the papers I have before me, because I was using them during the cross-examination. And in order to avoid wasting the Court's time, I think I am going to request that all the transcripts be entered. And subsequently, I will indicate to you the pages I referred to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. As the next exhibit, we will then enter the relevant parts of the transcripts that we have in front of us. And we will make a final determination after having received the indications by Defence counsel as to which portions he really wants to use. 
Because you are saying that subsequently you want to indicate the pages you referred to. Does that mean you want to be more precise later? Or do you want it in en block now? We may also have the Prosecution's reexamination. 
Are you going to address these pages, Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So come back to us exactly what you want. But the next exhibit number will then be, Mr. Mussa?
@MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, it is D. 1. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the French and B for the English. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 1A and D. 1B, admitted)
Mr. PRESIDENT:
All right. And then next document? You said the 22nd of December. Was that so? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That's correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any objection? No objection. The French version will be 2A as it is the original signed by the witness, and the English version 2B. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 2A and D. 2B admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then -- you may wish to tender also the document of the 30th of November about the Kabiligi portion. Is that also your wish? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That's right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
3A and B. A being the French as signed by the witness. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 3A and D. 3B admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any other document? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is all, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. Re-examination? 
Mr. Mussa and Judge Arrey are very kindly reminding me that you also used the 30th of November transcripts. So don't you want that portion exhibited? Now you have only identified the pages in the 26th January -- I meant January, not November. So you referred to the portions from the 26th of January, but you also proceeded with the second day of the witness testimony in Mr. Zig's case. And you may wish to also enter those portions. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I thought I had already entered all the transcripts of the witness's testimony on the 26th and the 30 of January 2006. All of the transcripts, as Exhibit D. 1. I used excerpts thereof. But in order for me to avoid any mistakes, I decided to tender all the transcripts of the witness's testimony in the Zigiranyirazo case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But perhaps you did that in French and not in English. That is the problem. Because in English we discussed only the 26th, but now we know full well that you proposed to tender the two versions of the transcripts. That is noted. We are referring to the entire transcript. Is that correct? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, Mr. President, what I can propose is that subsequently I will avail the Court with precise information regarding the portions which I used and which I will hand to the registry in the French and the English versions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take it all in. So that you don't have to worry more about it. What you gave us, we take in. And we note that you referred only to some portions of it. And then the matter is settled. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Re-examination. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Your Honour.

$RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, in respect to the period from the 6th of April to the 17th of July, 1994, have you been accused in Rwanda, or elsewhere, of any crime? 
@WITNESS AFP: 
I have never been accused. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you. I have no further questions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, that was the end of your testimony. We would like to thank you for having come the long way to testify in this trial. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. We wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you. 
@WITNESS AFP:
Stay in peace in Arusha, Mr. President. I thank you. 
$(Witness excused) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, the next witness is UL? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What are the page references in the binders? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour. I haven't got them in hand right at the moment. I should say as yesterday the Defence indicated that -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are aware that we cannot begin this witness until after the lunch break, based on the schedule we decided on now. So what we are simply doing now is to sort out some administrative matters in order to use the time efficiently until we adjourn a bit earlier. And then we start again, as always, at 2:30. 
Now the page references, please? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
If Your Honour will give me a moment, I will look them up for you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Then, Defence Counsel, you, yesterday, when you asked for an adjournment of the trial, you referred to three judgements of detained witnesses where you said that translation problems would occur. 
I'm not certain that the Bench have these three judgements. Just in order to ensure that we can foresee already at this stage any practical problems that may arise, and in order to see whether we, the Bench can do anything of an administrative matter to facilitate things, could you make those three judgements available to us? Either you or the Prosecution? If you are going to use them during cross-examination. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I will allow lead counsel to answer you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And let me stress that this is only an attempt to avoid problems. That's the initiative here. You are free to follow this up, or not. It is a question of facilitation if the Bench can do anything. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. Regarding Witness UL, we have one judgement which was disclosed to us as part of the judicial disclosures. That judgement is in Kinyarwanda. We've perused it, and to us it doesn't seem essential for the cross-examination which I am going to handle. That is the first answer regarding Witness UL. 
We have a second witness, UB, about whom there are two judgements in Rwandan courts -- judgement at the first instance on appeal. We received a disclosure only in the Kinyarwanda, and we were interested in the content of those judgements, and we were able to get a French copy thereof. 
Right now, I am thinking about the other documents. Regarding Witness ALG, we received the disclosure of these bulky judicial files. And there is a decision which, for us, is of importance to the Court. And it is the one in which the Prosecutor turned down that witness's confession and guilty plea. 
Mr. President, we're talking about the organic law of 30 August 1996 in Rwanda here. That decision is not in -- it's not yet been translated. It is part of the files, but has not been translated yet. 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. A moment or two for me to consult my assistant. 
Mr. President, I will have to review my notes to ascertain whether there is no other decision regarding another witness. I don't have everything in my mind right now. Yesterday it was fresher. You see I don't have the same memory as witnesses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for that clarification. Now, when it comes to Witness UL, that document seemed unproblematic because, A, it was unlikely to be used for impeachment purposes, as explained by Mr. Moses yesterday. And, B, because it was relatively brief. And you have confirmed that that is not the problem. 
So the three judgements I was referring to were the two judgements, then, I understand, from Witness UB; and one judgement, possibly more, from Witness ALG. These are, then, the three problematic documents, possibly, in terms of translation. That's how I understand you. 
Now, when it comes to the two judgements of Witness UB, are they both first instance judgements? Or is there one first instance and one second instance judgement from Witness UB? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is right, Mr. President. One judgement in the first instance, and a ruling of the appeals court in Kigali regarding UB. 
We have the translations of the two. But only in French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that disposes of the problems in relation to two of the judgements. You, in fact, have a French version of both these two judgement. That's excellent news. This means that what we have to focus on now is the judgement in the ALG file. And if you want to come back to us on that, we will be willing to listen attentively to see whether there are any problems that we should address. But you can do that after the break or at the end of the day. That's -- the timing is yours. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We can discuss it now, Mr. President. Just a clarification. Regarding UL, Mr. President, the judgement is 30 pages thick. I don't know why they talk about five pages, but it's 30 pages. 
The second problem. You see, the Defence is of the view that the document is not indispensable for cross-examination. But a question is the importance of the judgement. And that is even wider. Because here we are talking about a judicial (unintelligible). We are not talking about court judgements which were passed in a context different from the one which is of interest to us. That witness was charged in Rwanda with crimes which fall under the jurisdiction of your Tribunal. That is why we are interested in those decisions, Mr. President. So for the Defence work, that judgement is not indispensable. That is our view. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you referred to the judgement of Witness ALG. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes -- well, in the procedure of the Rwandan law, which your Tribunal knows very well, it is not really a court judgement. In those proceedings the Accused, once he is a suspect, can make confessions to the Prosecutor. And from what we understand, that witness made a confession. But the confessions were rejected. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, I understand that. I used the word "judgement" wrongly. But what you meant was the -- a rejection of the confession. But it's the ALG confession which was the -- or the rejection of it -- which was the document you referred to most recently in your intervention. It's just a matter of ensuring communication. 
So does this mean, then, that the Bench doesn't have to do anything now in order to ensure translation? For the time being, things are under control? That's how I interpret your intervention. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. It is not a problem of translation. The problem is the absence of that document in the judicial file which we received. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So did we now hear you? And we may be able to sort this out now immediately. Is, then, the problem that in the comprehensive file of Witness ALG, there is one document lacking in which you are interested? And that document is the document in which the Prosecution rejected the confession of the witness? Is that the problem? A missing document? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is indeed the case, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, do you have any comment on this now, or later, as to the availability or existence of this document? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I'm not aware of the existence of this document. However, my learned friend may well be right that such a document does exist somewhere. It is not in the possession of the Prosecutor. Every relevant document has been disclosed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. That brings us to the end of this administrative section, and we can then have our lunch break. And we will adjourn to 2:30. 
Is there anything else to be raised? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. Just to clear this matter once and for all. We also have the judgement regarding Witness BUO, which we perused with the assistance of our investigator, and which for us is necessary. The problem is that that judgement is 186 pages long. 
Now, I need to know when that witness is scheduled. And with the modifications in the scheduling sequence, I don't really know exactly what is going to happen. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you discuss this, Prosecution, and come back to us later today about the suggested appearance of that witness? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Absolutely, Your Honour. And just, finally, you asked for page numbers. Page references. UL statements appear at pages 040, so that should be in volume 1. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Pages 040? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
0 to 40. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
240? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour. I'm absent my case manager. And because of having to give our files to the interpreters, I don't think we necessarily have the same set that Your Honour has. But the pagination I've got is -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slowly. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
-- it is page 0 to 40. If that is not correct in Your Honour's bundles, then I'm very sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Thank you. The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed at 1303H)

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS UL:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness UL in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness UL in Kinyarwanda) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, with your signature. Isn't that so? 
@WITNESS UL:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information contained in that document is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS UL:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Mussa. 
@MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, the next Exhibit is P. 65. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
$(Exhibit No. P. 65 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Prosecution, open or closed? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, this is a matter that has just been brought to my attention -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A bit more slowly. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. MELLUISH:
That this witness has requested that his entire testimony be given in closed session because he is of the opinion -- he is of the opinion that what he was doing after 6th of April was something that very few people were doing and that to talk about it at all will reveal his identity. 
Your Honour will probably have noted that UL has given evidence before this Tribunal once before, and on that occasion was granted his request that his entire testimony be held in camera. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You said that the summary of this witness was to be found from page 0 to page 40. Wasn't that so? 
MS. MELLUISH:
That's what I said, yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We note the occupation of the personal information sheet. What is the most relevant summary so that we have an idea as to what he's going to testify to? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Perhaps it would be simplest to look at the amended annex to the pre-trial brief, if Your Honour has it to hand. 
And the relevant part is at page 6 of that -- or, on the sixth page of that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have noted your request concerning closed session. And we do not want you to go into detail because we are now in open session, but let me just inform you that, as you know, having testified before at this Tribunal, the main rule is to testify in open sessions. And the Tribunal has developed techniques in order to achieve openness and transparency, to the extent possible, but at the same time protecting the witnesses against revealing their identity. One way could be to hear your testimony partially in closed session, or only a limited part in open, to put it that way. 
Having looked at your summary now, is it your view that it cannot be the solution to proceed, to some extent, in open before we go into closed? Could I have your comment, please? But don't reveal your profession or identity in your answer, please. 
@WITNESS UL:
Thank you, Mr. President. As you must be aware, there is a problem of security for witnesses in Rwanda. Witnesses have been killed in the country, and others have been persecuted. These witnesses were those who had testified against ordinary citizens, but I am here to testify against someone who was at the helm of Kigali préfecture. If my identity were to be disclosed, I cannot be certain that my security will be ensured subsequently. 
You have asked me to proceed in open session and then in closed session. My reaction is that it is possible that there are some details, some truths, which I cannot omit, and I fear that speaking about such issues could disclose my identity. I, therefore, am not certain that I will enjoy 100 per cent protection today and in the future. 
Day -- the day before yesterday, I heard on the news that a witness had barely escaped by the skin of his teeth, had escaped death. He was almost killed. So my preference would be to testify in closed session. But if you feel that I should testify in open session, well, I believe that the first -- the best thing to do would be to start in closed session, and if you find out that there is no problem, then you can publish my testimony or you can invite me to return and testify in open session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comment by the Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER:
We uphold the principle of public hearings in much the same way as the Tribunal, but the Defence understands the concerns of the witness, even as I said yesterday. So it would be out of place for me to say anything contrary now. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In order to be on the safe side, we will start in closed, follow the testimony closely, and see whether portions of it at a later stage may take place in open session. But your -- the request is granted for at least the beginning of the testimony. 
So we have to ask those in the public gallery kindly to leave us. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 50 to 76] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Your examination-in-chief continues. 
Prosecution. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, just before we continue with the cross-examine -- the cross-examination, I wonder if I could just raise a -- housekeeping matters. 
Last night Your Honour referred to the bringing of witnesses to court and trying to anticipate having some extra witnesses. This brought to mind a possible conflict between what we're anticipating and the Court -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. We are aware of that, and you know that in about three hours we will know that schedule. The moment we know the schedule, we will inform you. It's a matter of hours now. We are struggling. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm grateful.

Thank you.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, could you tell the Court, please, what the situation in Rwanda was in early October 1990? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Thank you, Counsel. In early October 1990, the very first days of that month, there was a communiqué from the Rwandan government forces, making it known that Rwanda had been attacked by the enemy, and, according to that communiqué, the enemy had come from Uganda. 
The communiqué further explained that fighting had started in Mutura and that the Rwandan government forces were tackling the enemy. That was the situation as described in the first communiqué. 
It was mainly the Rwandan army high command which was relaying communiqués via Radio Rwanda, and in those communiqués, the high command and the government was -- were calling on Rwandans to be vigilant and to support their army so that the army could keep on fighting. That same government explained that the enemy which had attacked the country was mainly a group of Tutsi who wanted to restore monarchy and who had refused the republican regime. So the enemy wanted to restore that regime which had oppressed the Hutu before 1959. 
So army officers and préfet were saying such things during meetings, which they organised for members of the public. I remember that in Kigali city where I was living Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho organised a meeting, which I attended, a few days after his appointment as préfet. That meeting took place at Kimihurura. 
Do you want me to spell that name? Kimihurura is spelled K-I -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, thank you. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Very well, Mr. President. 
So it was in Kimihurura secteur. The préfet echoed the words I just repeated to you. He said the enemy which had attacked the country had come from Uganda, and that enemy was mainly Tutsi who were nostalgic of the period of monarchy which had oppressed the Hutu before 1959 and that -- that the enemy wanted to abolish the republican system. 
So after he was appointed préfet, he organised a community work system called Umuganda, during which period he said it was necessary to clear away all bushes so as to eliminate the Inyenzi, who were also known as the Inkotanyi. He said most of those Inkotanyi had infiltrated the country; that is why it was necessary to clear all bushes and shrubbery. 
But there is some important element which I did not mention, if you allow me to backtrack a little bit. In the night of the 4th to the 5th of October of the year 1990, Rwandan armed forces fired shots throughout Kigali city, throughout the night. It was just a stage-managed issue, and during that period they even used heavy weaponry in their propaganda. They said the Inkotanyi had entered the town. 
So it was after that event that the community work system, dubbed "Umuganda," was organised to chase out all Inkotanyi. All woods and shrubbery were cleared. Then meetings were organised for members of the population. One of which meetings was the one I just mentioned, the one organised at Kimihurura by Colonel Renzaho, and other actions were taken to chase the Inkotanyi. 
I remember that around the 10th I went to the Nyamirambo regional stadium, where those considered as accomplices and who had been arrested had been rounded up at that place. There were between eight and ten thousand people who had been rounded up and placed in detention under rather unacceptable conditions because they were not even allowed visitors. They were famished. They were thirsty. They were living in unsanitary conditions. The situation was so deplorable.
But, subsequently, a commission was set up to carry out some form of sorting. The commission had to study the situation of those people being rounded up at the stadium, and the others who were still being arrested, so as to pick out those who were the real accomplices of the Inyenzi and make a difference between them and those who were not accomplices of the Inyenzi. 
At the end of the deliberations of the commission, only members of the population who were not influential were released. But others, such as traders, civil servants, private businessmen, or employees of NGOs and international organisations, were moved to prisons, especially the Kigali men (sic) prison, the Nyabisindu prison in Butare préfecture, and the Gitarama prison, as well as two other prisons. 
During that period in Kigali city -- --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we realise that you may wish to place matters in context and provide background, but this is quite long, and I'm not sure that you are getting exactly what you want. Wouldn't it be better if you asked precise questions in order to get from the witness, in a brief form, what you need for the case? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I'm happy to do that. I just have a slight reluctance to interrupt when -- when I can see that he's still talking, and I don't want the microphones to overlap. But I shall certainly try to do that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me generally say that each counsel in the courtroom, when he or she is conducting an examination of a witness, if counsel thinks that the witness is not responding to the question or we are wasting time, Counsel is certainly authorised to interrupt the witness. It is even encouraged. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm grateful for that indication, Your Honour. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, briefly, please, Mr. Witness, who organised the rounding up of -- of Tutsi that you described. 
@WITNESS ALG: 
It was conducted mainly by soldiers and gendarmes. They were the ones carrying out the arrest, but it was obvious that the drive had been organised by the government. The authorities were aware of that. Let me give you an evidence: In the sorting commission, all security organs were represented. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know whether those rounded up were charged with any crime? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Those rounded up were charged with being either Inyenzi, Inkotanyi, or accomplices of the Inyenzi, Inkotanyi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know how long any of them were held? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Some of them were released after a brief detention, but others stayed long in detention. From November they started releasing them in small waves, up until the month of June 1991. That operation continued because it was around that date that the last were released. In the meantime, some of them died in detention. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know why people were released? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
As the war was on, there were some talks going on between the government in place at the time and the RPF Inkotanyi, but there was also the pressure put to bear by human rights bodies who were criticising the Rwandan government for not respecting human rights. Following such pressure, those who were arrested were being released in a gradual way. 
In the meantime, some of the people arrested were tried and sentenced to death, whereas others were released. That happened in 1991. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know what happened to the property of those who were rounded up? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Counsel, I thank you. During that period, the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture set up a committee charged with seizing and selling the property of people who had fled. And most of those who had fled were rather Tutsi, whereas some of them were Hutu who were opponents of the regime. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how did you know about this committee? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
********************************************************************** regarding those things. I hailed from Kigali city, and I lived in the same city. Subsequently, I was also able to get information from those who were members of that committee. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us who were the members of the committee, briefly? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
The members of the committee charged with seizing and selling the property of those who had fled were the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune. At the time he was the chairman. He was called Jean-Pierre Bakomera. The other members of the committee were the conseiller of Nyarugenge secteur, Mr. Gabriel Mbyareyehe. 
I also remember that there was a representative of the ministry of trade, a ministry of the urban police, a representative -- correction, of the urban police, a representative of the prosecution office, a representative of the economic affairs service of Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Those are the members of that committee that I remember today. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Why was it decided, if you know -- 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Just a moment, excuse me. 
Mr. Witness, if you -- the word "property" was used. What do you mean saying "property"? Does this include the land belonged (sic) to those who fled the country? 
@WITNESS ALG:
Actually, when I talk about property, since we were referring to an urban setting, it was mainly buildings, commercial buildings, as well as the property in those buildings. That is what I mean when I refer to by "property." I am not too sure whether landed property was sold at that time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now some of the names. The first name was Jean-Pierre -- could you spell his last name, please? 
@WITNESS ALG:
Bakomera, spelled as follows: B-A-K-O-M-E-R-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And yesterday we were told that the conseiller for Nyarugenge was Gabriel M-B-Y-A-R-I-Y-B-H-E (sic). 
@WITNESS ALG:
(No interpretation)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness said something. Could we have the interpretation, please? 
Could you repeat your comment or answer after my spelling, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS ALG:
Mr. President, what I said was that it was correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. So these were the two names. 
Now, Counsel, how much do you actually need of this 1990 stuff? It's way out of the time span of the Tribunal. You may way have -- you may well have some legal arguments concerning certain notions, but this is general. It is not really focussed on the Accused. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I've actually come to the end of this material and was going to move on in any event. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. But please bear this in mind so that we only focus on what is strictly necessary. 
Thank you. What is your next question, please? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, if you know, when the Interahamwe was set up? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
If I remember properly, the Interahamwe was set up towards late 1991 or early 1992. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know what the purpose of the setting up of the Interahamwe was? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
The Interahamwe movement was set up by the MRND party. It was that party's youth wing -- 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
$(Microphones overlapping) 
@WITNESS ALG: 
-- which had to take on those who did not share the party ideals. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know whether before April 1994 Renzaho had any involvement with the Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
There is a comment I would like to make in this connection: The proof of his collaboration with the Interahamwe is the military training that those Interahamwe underwent. 
Counsel, do you want me to elaborate on this point? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, please. What training are you referring to? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
In early 1993, Interahamwe received military training in military camps, and it was Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, who at the time was a préfet, who informed us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How did he inform you? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
He summoned some commune and secteur leaders to his office, but it was not an ordinary meeting. He received them in various groups, and on that occasion those convened were members of the MRND. So he gave us that information, telling us that the army high command, in consultation with the chair, or the leadership, of the MRND, had decided that the Interahamwe would receive military training so as to be able to assist the -- the army in fighting the enemy, namely, the Inyenzi, Inkotanyi, if war were to resume. And he said the Interahamwe would participate in operations towards securing Kigali city. 
On that occasion he told us it was confidential information which was not to be divulged to members of the public so that the political parties which were MRND opponents should not know of it and thus undermine the implementation of the programme. He did not give us the specifics of the programme. He simply wanted to inform us so that, if we ever were to see Interahamwes leaving for a certain period of time, we should not be surprised, we would know exactly what was happening. 
That is how we got that information. That was one of the clues, but there could be others. All this shows that Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho was collaborating with the MRND leadership, the military command, and the Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you remember the date that you were informed by Renzaho in this way? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Counsel, that happened a long time ago, so it is not easy to give you a specific date, or month, for that matter. But approximately I would say it was during the first three months of 1993, somewhere between late February and early March 1993. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And were you told where this training was taking place? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
He did not mention the camps where the trainings were to take place. It was only subsequently that we got the information from other sources. He simply told us that the trainings would take place in army camps, without mentioning any particular camp. 
But subsequently, in our individual capacities, we were able to get some information regarding the camps where those Interahamwe were being trained. Now, if you so wish, I can give you some of the names which I got. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Briefly, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And, again, when you do that, one name after the other. Counsel will find out whether we have it on the spelling list. If not, we will ask for your assistance, please. 
Let's start. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The best-known camp where the trainings took place was the Gabiro military camp. At the time Gabiro was in the Mutura region, in Byumba préfecture. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not need the spelling of any of those names. What is the next? 
@WITNESS ALG:
The second camp was Gako in the Bugesera sub-préfecture in Kigali rural préfecture. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's G-A-K-O. Thank you. Yes. 
@WITNESS ALG:
The other camp was Bigogwe in Gisenyi préfecture. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine. Next, please. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Those are the only camps I was aware of. But it was also said that the Interahamwe were being trained even in other military camps, but the Interahamwe who were from Kigali followed those trainings in Gabiro, Gako, and Bigogwe camps. That is the information I was able to gather.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were you aware of how many people were being trained? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
No, I did not know how many of them were being trained. There were many of them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
These three camps, Mr. Witness, belonged to which forces, if any? Gabiro, was that a military camp, a gendarmerie camp, or what kind of camp? Just give us an indication, briefly. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Thank you, Mr. President. All those camps were army camps. They were not gendarmerie camps. They were all Rwandan army camps. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@WITNESS ALG:
(No interpretation)
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know, Mr. Witness, whether it was at that time legal for party -- political parties to train militia? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Actually, the law did not allow that. I have read the law on political parties, and if my memory is not failing me, section 4 of that law forbids political parties from having militia or any other association -- any other affiliated association which would be operating like militia. It is, therefore, obvious that the training of those militia was not authorised by law. 
Furthermore, I believe I told you those training sessions were covert. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, yesterday you told us that, with the advent of the multiparty system, Renzaho ceased to be the MRND chairman for the préfecture. That's correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
That's correct, ma'am. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, after he ceased to be that chairman, was he involved, as far as you were aware, with the MRND in an active way? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Even though as a soldier, he was not supposed to be a member of any political party, the fact remains that he kept on collaborating with MRND leaders. An illustration of this is the trainings which I just mentioned. Besides, certain sources mentioned that amongst the people who had prepared those trainings were officers and MRND leaders, and his name was in that group of people who had prepared the trainings. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you aware of whether Renzaho attended any MRND rallies? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Personally, I did not see him, but I remember a meeting of the party -- a meeting of parties in which the MRND was represented and that which he attended. It was a meeting of the various power factions of the political parties. It was a rally which had been organised after the march of those parties. It took place on the 23rd of September (sic) 1993 at the Nyamirambo regional stadium. Colonel Renzaho was in attendance. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You mentioned the various power factions of the political parties. Can you briefly tell us what you mean by that? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Thank you, Counsel. When I refer to the term "power," I am actually alluding to the rally which I just mentioned, where the factions of the political parties which advocated that power should remain in the hands of the Hutu. At the time those factions were referred to as Hutu Power. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that Renzaho attended that meeting. Was he simply present, or did he participate actively? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Counsel, I have told you that rally was organised after a march, which march aimed at demonstrating against the death of the Burundian president at the time. And if I remember properly, the Burundian president died on the 21st of October. So those people who carried out that march did so in collaboration with Burundian nationals. And I remember that Colonel Renzaho spoke during that march. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, have you now referred to one meeting or two meetings? 
@WITNESS ALG:
Mr. President, I have referred to a meeting, or rally, organised on the 23rd of October 1993. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So with other words, it was on the 23rd of October. It was not on the 23rd of September. Isn't that so? 
@WITNESS ALG:
Mr. President, the rally took place on the 23rd of October 19 -- 1993. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And did you participate during the rally when the power-faction parties were present?
@WITNESS ALG:
Mr. President, I attended that rally. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, previously in the transcripts, we have the statement of you saying that "Personally, I did not see him, but I remember a meeting of the party." Can you explain what you meant by this? 
@WITNESS ALG:
Mr. President, I would like to explain further. This is what I said: I said that I did not see him in the MRND offices. Furthermore, I did not see him during ordinary meetings of MRND organs, but I saw him during that rally. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that clarification. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, at this meeting, rally, of the 23rd of October, you said that Renzaho spoke. Can you recall what he spoke about? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
It is not easy to remember exactly what was said on account of the length of time that has passed. But if I were to try to give you an account of what was said and under what circumstances and the tone of his address, I would say as follows: It was said that the Burundian president had been murdered by Burundian soldiers because he was the first Hutu-elected president of Burundi. That is the reason why he had been killed, because he was a Hutu. 
And all those who spoke during that rally tried to echo the same thing. Each of the speakers said that they supported the Burundian president, that they were against those who wanted to restore monarchy in our country. And it was explained that the monarchy was a Tutsi regime. It was, therefore, obvious that Renzaho was in league with those political parties who were against the return of monarchy in the country. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, between October 1990, when he became préfet, and April 1994, are you aware of whether Renzaho was promoted? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I have told you already that, when Renzaho was appointed préfet, he was a lieutenant colonel by rank. In 1994 he was already a full colonel. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know when that promotion took place? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Madam Prosecutor, that would be asking me too much. I do not remember exactly when he was promoted, but all I know is that he rose to the rank of colonel. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, the préfecture office, you described its location yesterday. Between -- before April 1994, can you tell us who was based at that office? And I don't mean individual names; I'm talking generally, please. 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Madam Prosecutor, would you please kindly repeat that question so that I may understand it properly. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You told us that the head of the préfecture was the préfet. Who else, if anyone, operated from the préfecture office? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Thank you. From my understanding of your question, I would answer as follows, that the préfet and his collaborators administered the préfecture from that location. These included various service heads, who worked with the prefect. They were referred to as heads of services in Kigali préfecture, but in other préfectures they were referred to as sub-prefects. Those were the prefect's collaborators. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How many heads of service were there? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Let me mention the services one after the other, just to make sure that I am not mistaken. There was the political, administrative, and legal affairs service, which was headed by Jean Baptiste Mutura. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have the spelling of this name? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I believe it's number 28 on the list, but perhaps the witness could clarify it begins with a B -- whether it begins with a "B" or an "M." 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, "Butera" or "Mutura"? 
@WITNESS ALG:
Butera, Butera with a B-U, Butera, Jean-Baptiste, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. That was the first one. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Thank you, Mr. President. The other service was the economic and financial affairs service, which was headed by one Fabien Bunane. 
MS. MELLUISH:
It's number 26 on the list. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Then there was another service, the social, cultural, and educational affairs service, headed by one Simpunga, Aloys. 
MS. MELLUISH:
It's a hundred and ninety-eight. 
@WITNESS ALG:
If I'm not mistaken, there was a service in charge of infrastructure, equipment, and urban development. It was headed -- headed by one Munyakazi, Faustin. Yes, I think it was Munyakazi, Faustin, indeed, who was head of that service. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have that name. Thank you. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Those are the services that worked closely with the préfet. There was also an immigration service, headed by one Rubwejanga, Tharcisse. 
MS. MELLUISH:
It's a hundred and sixty-two. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Then there was also a préfectoral intelligence service, headed by Mr. Bigega, whose first name I forget. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Number 10. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Madam Prosecutor, those are the services which worked closely with the préfet from the location, namely, the préfectoral office. 
Let me say that any of these service heads could have signed on behalf of the préfet in his absence. It would appear to me that the rules allowed for one or the other of these heads of services to sign on behalf of the préfet in case of his absence. But most often it is Jean-Baptiste Butera, who was the head of the political, administrative, and legal affairs service, who would sign on behalf of the préfet. 
I'm sorry, Madam Prosecutor. I have just remembered that there was another very important service which escaped my mind and which I didn't mention. There was a service in charge of the urban police, and it was headed by gendarme Major Nyamuhimba. 
MS. MELLUISH:
A hundred and forty-seven. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So can you tell us, these heads of service that you've mentioned, who could sign on behalf of the préfet, were they superior to or of the same rank, as it were, as the bourgmestre? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
As far as the organisation chart goes, I cannot say that they were more important, or at least equal to, the bourgmestre because the text of the law does not allow for that kind of comparison. All I know is that the bourgmestres and other officials would go to the préfectoral office and, upon arrival, would address their concerns to the various service heads. And then it would be the person in charge of political, administrative, and legal affairs who appeared to be the senior head of service and to be in charge of all the other heads of services. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
In March 1994, how many communes were there in the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
There were three communes in Kigali-ville préfecture. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you tell us in March 1994 who were the bourgmestre of those communes? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
In 1994 the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune was Jean Bizimana. The bourgmestre of Kicukiro commune was Pierre Claver Nyilikwaya. 
MS. MELLUISH:
$(Microphones overlapping)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you -- can you repeat that? The mike was not -- your mike was on, but also another mike was on. 
MS. MELLUISH:
One hundred fifty, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@WITNESS ALG:
The bourgmestre of Kicukiro commune in the month of April, that is, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), was called Evariste Gasamagera. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Number 41. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How many secteur were there in the whole of the préfecture? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Relying on my memory, I would say there were 19 secteurs in Kigali-ville préfecture, and I can remember that Nyarugenge commune had ten secteurs, including four -- rather, five secteurs for Kacyiru, and then Kicukiro had four secteurs as well. So I think that is it: Ten for Nyarugenge, Cyangugu five, and Kicukiro four. That adds up to 19. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yesterday you mentioned the names of some conseillers. One of those was Odette Nyirabagenzi, who was, you said, conseiller for Rugenge in March 1994. Can you tell us, if you are aware, whether she, besides the position of conseiller, had any other function or position? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I think that she did not hold any other position, other than being a conseiller. But she was also a member -- or, a leader of the party within Nyarugenge commune and at the level of the préfecture. 
Please, allow me to explain this to you better. She was not holding a very high office, but she was a member of the various governing bodies of the party within the commune and within the préfectoral -- within the préfecture. I will even be more specific: She was a close collaborator of the Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What do you mean by that, by the term "close collaborator"?
@WITNESS ALG: 
This is what I mean: The MRND party had what could be referred to as ordinary members, but there were some members who were more active, more militant, and who visibly, or openly, supported the Interahamwe. So in addition to their ordinary membership in the MRND, they demonstrated their inclination towards the Interahamwe. 
You may want to know that all members of the MRND were not Interahamwe, but she spoke out openly and said that she was Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You also mentioned yesterday a conseiller called Rose Karushara. Can you tell us, was she a member of a political party? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
She was also a member of the MRND party. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did she have any other functional position besides being a conseiller and a member of that party? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
She did not hold any other position, as such, but she was an influential member of her political party. She was in the leadership of the party at the national, préfectoral, and communal levels, and she was very zealous and openly demonstrated her belonging to the Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, in March 1994, what was the relationship -- aside from the employment relationship, what was the relationship between those two conseiller and Renzaho? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Besides the professional relations that may have existed, most of the conseiller had good relations with Renzaho, but not all of them. This is only my observation. What I noticed is that the bourgmestre who replaced Bakomera and the conseiller who had previously held that position had worked for a long time with Renzaho, and they knew themselves very well. So, obviously, he was a member of the MRND, and one could see that Renzaho fully supported that political party. 
Conseillers would go to consult with him in his office, breaking all protocol rules. So these people would see him without any difficulty, and sometimes reports were channeled directly to him without going through the bourgmestre of the concerned areas. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that most conseiller had a good relationship with Renzaho. Who, if anyone, did not have a good relationship with him in March 1994? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
For Nyarugenge commune, the conseiller of Nyakabanda secteur did not have good relations with him, and his name was Emmanuel Kanyandekwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know why they did not have good relations? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Kanyandekwe himself told me in the course of a discussion that he did not have very good relations with the préfet because he was a member of the MDR Twagiramungu faction. So the conseiller told me that that was the bone of contention in his relation with Préfet Renzaho.
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us briefly, please, what were the primary functions of the conseiller? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
In a few words, the duties of the conseiller were to cover activities in the secteurs under his -- under his jurisdiction. Security, social affairs, and development of the various secteurs were his areas of endeavour. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did a conseiller have an office? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Yes, the conseiller had an office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What powers did a conseiller have? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Madam Prosecutor. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What powers did a conseiller have? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
The conseiller had significant powers in his or her secteur, and that could be observed de facto. But the conseiller's powers were diminished with the advent of multiparty politics. Conseillers who belonged to any given political party and who had inhabitants in their secteurs belonging to other political parties saw their authority challenged because the inhabitants would not respect the conseillers. 
The conseiller of Nyakabanda, for example, whom I referred to a short while ago, even if by the text of the law he enjoyed some powers, in practice, his power was diminished because he didn't enjoy the support of the préfet. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You began by answering that the conseiller had significant powers. Please, can you explain what those powers were? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
That is what the law granted him. If we take, for instance, the single-party period, he had sweeping freedoms. He was a -- the head of the communal council. At the same time, he was also the party chairman at secteur level. And, of course, that gave him wide powers. So at the time of the single party, that is, in 1991 before the establishment of multiparty democracy -- 
Do you want me to move on? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
$(Microphones overlapping) 
@WITNESS ALG:
So as I said yesterday -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not sure whether we want you to move on. 
Isn't there other material about this in the case? Is this disputed, the powers of the conseillers? It's well-established information in the Tribunal. We have heard many, many cases about bourgmestres and conseillers. How much do we need to enter into the bulk of evidence in the present case? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Perhaps it would be helpful if the Defence could advise whether it is a matter of contest. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you help us with that, Defence? I would assume that the functions of bourgmestres, conseillers, at least, would be undisputed. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honour, believe you me, I am as surprised and perplexed as the Bench because this is information which is known by everybody in this court. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So didn't this come as a relief? Let's try to -- 
MS. MELLUISH:
Very much so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- focus maybe on what you wanted to get from this witness, namely, what is his -- in the summary of Prosecution witnesses in the pre-trial brief. And -- and we would really prefer to hear individual events instead of general information from this witness. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know how many urban police there were? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I didn't know how many of them there were, Counsel, but, in any case, there were many of them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where were they based, the policemen themselves? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
They had an office at the Kigali-ville préfecture office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, if you know, what was the relationship between the préfecture office and the gendarmerie? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I cannot claim to be very knowledgeable about the relationship between gendarmerie and a préfecture, but what one could see is that in each préfecture was a gendarmerie squad. And the préfet, who was the chief security official within the préfecture under his jurisdiction, worked closely with that squad. He could request the assistance or intervention of the squad in specific cases. Even the commanding officer of this squad was one of the members of the security committee at préfecture, or city, level. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us what the main services of the préfecture office were? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this a question which is different from the services which were headed by the seven persons he already have listed, hence we have identified -- 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- seven services? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes, Your Honour. It is different. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. So it is different. Now, in what way is it different? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, perhaps if the witness could start his answer, and if he's repeating what he's already said, then I'll stop him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you understood the question, Mr. Witness. Let's make an attempt. 
@WITNESS ALG:
Mr. President, that question is not quite clear because I thought I had already given the names of the various services at the préfecture office. Rather, I think that perhaps Prosecution counsel would like to know what the organs of Kigali-ville préfecture were. Am I right? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, please. 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I thank you, ma'am. 
Kigali-ville préfecture had three main organs: the city council, then the préfet, and the préfecture security council. Those are the three organs of Kigali-ville préfecture. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How often did the -- prior to April 1994, how often did the security council meet? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
The city security committee met once a month usually. It could also meet whenever necessary. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, briefly, who were the members before April 1994 of the security council? 
MS. MELLUISH:
If -- if the Defence wishes to make admissions in this regard, I'm happy not to lead this evidence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, one way of doing this could be that there was contact between the Prosecution and the Defence concerning structural, general organisation, persons holding posts, et cetera. And based on that, the parties could together create a paper or a note, and it could be entered as an exhibit and we could avoid all this evidence. 
Now, now we have gone through most of it, it seems to me, but could you now briefly tell the Defence what you think the witness is going to say, and we will then see whether they agree? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, Your Honour, it's actually in one of the Prosecution exhibits. The -- at tab 7. If they're happy to accept -- page 912 at the top. If they're happy to accept that those are the people who attended -- it's P. 14. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the title of tab 7? You remember that there was a change afterwards. You see, it's the 1990 document. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes, legislative act number 35 slash 90 concerning the administrative organisation of the préfecture of Kigali-ville. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. So it's article 17, yes? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yup. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah. There cannot possibly be any dispute about what's in article 17. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, during the presentation of exhibits by the Prosecutor, I believe we clearly stated that we did not challenge the admission of legal instruments because we also intended to use them. So, essentially, don't expect any objections from this side with regard to those legal instruments. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. So that was the second relief. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, can you tell us where you were on the morning of the 7th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I was at home, Counsel. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you go to work that day? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I mean, where my house was located. 
No, I did not go to work. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Why did you not go to work? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Early on the morning of the 7th of April, a communiqué from the defence ministry was broadcast by the radio station, forbidding citizens from leaving their houses. Even civil servants were not authorised to go to work. According to the communiqué, the head of state's plane had been shot down by unknown persons and that the head of state, along with the other passengers, had died in that attack. 
So I also felt concerned by the communiqué. I decided to stay home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How long did you stay at home as a result of that communiqué? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I stayed at home for about one week. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you leave your home at all during that period? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
During that period I did not move about except perhaps on one occasion. That was around the fifth day. We had run out of foodstuff and supplies, so I had gone out to get supplies. I was accompanied by a policeman. I asked him to go to a shop located near my house to find out whether the shop was open. But he noticed that the shop had been shut down, and the shopkeeper had already left. So we continued our way, and about one kilometre away from my home, we saw some people whose shops were open, but we were not able to get supplies. 
So we returned home empty-handed. It was on the following day that I left my neighbourhood to go to the city centre.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't really need the story about the trip to the shop in vain and back again, did you, Counsel? 
MS. MELLUISH:
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Counsel is asking precise questions. Most of them, now, can be answered by a yes or no. We appreciate your wish to provide a full picture, but we would like to try to make some headway now. So, try to be as brief as possible. Will you do that, please? Thank you.
@WITNESS ALG:
Very well, Mr. President.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
During the time that you remained at home, did you hear any news of what was happening in the city? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
No. All what I heard was gunshots from all directions. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you return to work at any time? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Yes, at some point in time I went to my place of work. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you remember when it was that you did that? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
It is difficult to give a specific date but it was about one week afterwards. I would say perhaps around the 12th of April 1994. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And why did you decide to return to work on that day? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I just had a communiqué from the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture calling on functionaries of the préfecture, as well as the communes of that préfecture, to go to their workplaces. That is why I decided to go to my workplace. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how did you get to your workplace? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I had a (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) vehicle.
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And on your way to your workplace, did you notice anything unusual? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
Yes, the situation was different from the other periods.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, just listen carefully to this question. You described the vehicle with which you went to work. Were there many persons having that kind of vehicle or were you more or less the only one or there were only few? Do you understand the question? 
@WITNESS ALG:
In my neighbourhood of residence, I think that that was the only vehicle moving about, but within the city centre there were other vehicles similar to that one.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So we don't have to place it under separate cover then.
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, I'm not sure the answer -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It did. Your view is that it is not necessary. All right, we will not place it under separate cover. That's fine. 
It referred to something.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You answered that the situation was different from other periods on your journey to your office. Can you tell us in what way? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I've already told you that while I was still at home, after the plane crash, ever since that evening, there was constant gunfire. On the morning of the 7th of April it continued and even intensified during the afternoon. So, there was gunfire in the various parts of the city, and further let me state that my home was near a military camp where presidential guard soldiers were based. So, there were roadblocks on the roads, and there were soldiers, gendarmes, and members of the population manning those various roadblocks. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what were they doing at the roadblocks? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
At those roadblocks those people would intercept passers-by, checking their identity cards, wave certain people through, others stayed there for some time, and others who passed through immediately, but there were also people who were killed at those roadblocks. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were these things that you observed during that particular journey? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
I was given a rather general description of what was happening at the roadblocks and when I was going to my place of work I realised that people were being stopped at roadblocks because, personally, I, too, was stopped at those roadblocks. I was not able to see anybody being killed, however. I was able to see dead bodies. So, I thought the bodies were of people who had been killed at those roadblocks. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall what happened when you got to your office? 
@WITNESS ALG: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I wonder whether it might be safer to go into closed session for him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will do that.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution? 
Good morning, Defence. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
Mr. President, simple point: You had mentioned the possibility of us dealing this morning with the issue of the Prosecution disclosure of the CD. I thought we would do so this morning. There are certain comments I would like to make, more so because I have other comments to make regarding will-says which were disclosed to us on the 17th of January, that is, last week, and one of which will-say concerns this same witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I assume that the CD refers to a witness we have already heard, is that so? Or is it a general question? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. It is the issue of admissibility of that evidence, which you have already pointed to, and your Chamber has not yet made a determination on that. So that question is still pending. More so, because with this new witness we have received a will-say and the Prosecutor intends to examine him also on that document. So it is the view of the Defence that now is the time to sort that matter out. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. We will certainly wish to hear you now on this issue of the will-say of the witness in front of us, and then we can postpone other practical issues that are not linked to this witness. In this way, we will make sure that the testimony of the present witness proceeds in an organised way without losing time with other matters which we may postpone to a bit later. What do you want to address us on concerning the will-say? Please proceed. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it all starts with the production by the Prosecutor of the audio cassette or CD during the court session of the 11th of January 2007. And I am making the linkage, because the issue of the will-say concerning that witness also has to do with that cassette or tape. Mr. President, Your Honours, we are seeking to secure that that particular bit of evidence be excluded, as well as exclusion of that will-say regarding that witness, as well as for the other witness concerning whom a will-say has been disclosed to us, also. So Mr. President -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just to make sure that the Bench understands what is going on now. You are referring to a will-say. In other trials, we are usually provided with copies of such will-says so that we know what kind of will-says we are talking about. We have no idea -- I see, we have received a written document. You are referring to the 17th of January 2007. And I note that the Prosecution has indeed conveyed this to everyone, it was just a matter of identifying the document. We have it in front of us. 
Now, this document we have here in written form contains references to six will-say letters; two of them refer to GLJ. They are of the same date and probably, then, the same document. So it's the first one in that document you are referring to? You are referring to the will-say statement of 17th January 2007. 
@MR. CONSTANT: 
That is correct. But I am sorry, Mr. President, since this does not concern the witness directly, could we ask him to take off his headset, because we are dealing with legal issues here. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you speak French? I suppose you do. 
@WITNESS GLJ:
No, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Not at all, being a Rwandan? 
@WITNESS GLJ:
True, I can hear a few words of French, but I don't speak French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it a point for the Defence that this discussion should take place without the witness knowing of the discussion? With other words, not only a matter of this not directly linked to his evidence, but also what he should know of before he starts giving his testimony? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, the discussion concerns this witness, but also other witnesses. So I think that for purposes of sincerity in his statement, it is preferable that he doesn't take part in our discussions by listening to what we are saying. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. Could you just take off your headset a little bit, Mr. Witness, and then we will proceed without asking you to leave the courtroom, then. 
What's the point, Defence, please? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we are talking about the will-say regarding this witness. But the discussions also concern the other will-says which were disclosed to us on the 17th of January referring to two other witnesses, and the discussion also concerns a witness who has already appeared before this Court. And the discussion actually stems from the CD disclosed to us during the hearing of the 11th of January 2007, and which was put to Witness ALG at that time. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, our prayer is that that piece of evidence be excluded for the following reasons which I am going to summarise: Firstly, with regard to form, Mr. President, Your Honours, that document was not disclosed to us within the regular time frames, whereas apparently the Prosecutor and his investigators had been in possession of the document a long time ago, as was disclosed to us by a witness; and Defence (sic) counsel did not give the name or pseudonym of the witness. 
Mr. President, I am sorry, I am having problems with my earphones. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We now heard you say that this document was not disclosed timely. Which exhibit or document are you referring to now? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I am talking about the audio medium which we listened to during the court session of the 11th of January. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you understand the communication problem, because your word "pièce à conviction" was translated as document? That's why we didn't understand it. But, now, we are on the same wavelength. You are referring to the tape, the audio. Yes, please go ahead. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. There are several problems raised by the production of that document. Whereas the Prosecution had that document a long time ago, especially its investigators, as was explained to us by the witness during the court session of the 9th of January, we got that information only when ALG testified on the 11th of January. So we think that the delay in the disclosure should lead to the exclusion of that particular piece of evidence. 
Secondly, Mr. President, that exhibit is, for the Prosecutor, a new charge or allegation -- or accusation against Mr. Renzaho. If you read the entire document, Mr. President, Your Honours, as it was disclosed to us -- because it is essential to know the grounds for my objection -- the Defence received a disclosure only of written material. So we were surprised during the court session of 11th January when that particular tape was played and a witness was requested to recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice. It came as a total surprise to us, Mr. President, Your Honours. We had read the documents disclosed to us and which were entered into evidence, and the terms of which you know. In that document, Mr. Renzaho's name was not mentioned. Actually, the Prosecutor wanted to demonstrate that in that document, where there is no reference to Mr. Renzaho's name, it is possible to recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice. 
But, Mr. President, Your Honours, what is the evidence? It is not the written document any longer, it is actually the CD. Yet, the conversation in that document concerns events or facts which do not appear in the indictment. And if I properly understood it, because it was not clear, it concerns a battle which took place within the territory of Kigali-rural. If I remember properly it was Bicumbi. And in the course of that battle, there was some conversations, and in the conversations some words were used. And now the Prosecutor wants to make use of those words. So, Mr. President, Your Honours, these are not only new accusations, but they actually are new accusations which do not appear in the indictment. 
To be more specific, you see, Mr. President, Your Honours, we were surprised and we tried to make sense out of what was going on. Of course, we had to go and reread the indictment. We had to go and reread the pretrial brief. And on page 21 of the French version of the pretrial brief -- and to be more specific with you, it is point 89 of the pretrial brief. Point 89(a) of the pretrial brief -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So this is not in the indictment, but in the pretrial brief? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Absolutely, Mr. President, the Prosecution brief. And I was not able to locate any mention of those events. And the first reference I discovered is through what is written in the pretrial brief, and I am going to quote. The Accused talked about extermination in a telephone conversation with Mr. Rugambarara, the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, and which was intercepted. 
Now, Mr. President, Your Honours, what is the position of the Defence? The Defence discovers in this document disclosed to it, if my memory serves me correctly, during the session of the 6th of December, and in that document we see clearly that it is a conversation, a telephone conversation. But we are not certain about it, and I am going to come back to this. But we realise that in that conversation Mr. Renzaho does not feature; only the name of Mr. Karera, the préfet of Kigali-rural was mentioned. So, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence earnestly thinks that it was a mistake, and we didn't go further. 
And, Mr. President, I would like to insist on this point, and I will look at the document which, in English, is 21, that is, the much-talked about telephone intercept. You will find out in that intercept, and I highlighted a number of things: Firstly, the person placing the call actually tries to reach Mr. Karera. The person placing the call is Mr. Rugambarara. And, Mr. President, Your Honours, in order to enable you to follow closely, I would like to refer to that intercept; it is K0167847, the beginning of the conversation concerning the préfet. In the French version, K0167847. And in the transcription of the conversation, what you can read is that Mr. Rugambarara, who apparently was the one who placed the call, says as follows: "Now put me through to the préfet". Then, further down, the speaker, Mr. Rugambarara, says, "Mr. Préfet," and the next speaker, Préfet Karera, who says, "Yes, good morning" -- - or "Good day". And throughout that written transcription, Mr. President, Your Honours, it is only Mr. François Karera who features. Accordingly, Mr. President, Your Honours, for the Prosecutor, if he enables us to understand what he wants to do, what actually was of interest to him was not the transcript, it was the audiotape in which he tries to make the witness recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice.
Mr. President, Your Honours, I am going to summarise in a word or two what I just said. Firstly, it is a new accusation, which does not feature in the indictment. Consequently, that new accusation should be excluded pursuant to Article 20 of the Statute, and also of Article 17 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because, so far, it has not been made known to Mr. Renzaho, whereas he has been arrested since 2002. 
Secondly, that piece of evidence, the audio document, must be excluded because it is not there to buttress any charge which is in the indictment; and, furthermore, it was disclosed late. That is my submission, Mr. President, Your Honours, regarding that audio evidence. I wanted to start with that because the will-says which we are talking about are a follow-up to that question. 
Once again, Mr. President, Your Honours, and in order to end regarding this piece of evidence which the Prosecutor is introducing belatedly for us, it is fundamentally intrinsically inadmissible and it cannot be allowed. And that is pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, the trial concerns evidence. And, in the trials in this Tribunal, I can even say more: It is up to the Court to ensure the sincerity and reliability of the evidence adduced before it. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, last week we tried to understand what was the nature of that audio document. Was it a transcription of a radio broadcast? I am saying so because why did we think about it? We thought that was a possibility because one could hear music being played. And I reread what my learned friend Moses told us. He told us, "No, it was a telephone intercept, and you can look at the transcripts, Mr. President, Your Honours, that is what you will find." As far as I know, a radio broadcast is different from a telephone intercept. If it is a telephone intercept, your Court is no doubt aware that it is a manner of proceeding for investigators, who in national laws are strictly regulated. And, in this connection, there is established case law in the European Court of Human Rights. But even closer to us -- closer to you, we have statement of the United Nations human rights committee, a statement dated 1999 in the matter concerning Mr. Antonius Cornelius van Hulst of the Netherlands. And the human rights committee, in its statement, underscored that in order to fulfil the requirements of Article 17 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights a telephone recording must fulfil several criteria: It must be lawful; it must conform with the provisions of the covenant; and it must also relate to the matter at hand. Mr. President, you even put the question to Witness NAB regarding the circumstances under which he obtained that document. I have gone through the transcript again. And he obtained them through the Rwandan ministry of rehabilitation in 1996 or 1997. That is the origin of the document. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, we know nothing concerning the lawful or legal and material conditions under which that telephone intercept was made and in which that tape was subsequently preserved before it was handed to investigators of the ICTR. Your Court knows how easy it is today to doctor such documents. That is something which even a teenager can do. We are not suspecting investigators of the ICTR of having done such a doctoring exercise. But it is essential for us, and for you, to know how the intercept was made. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, we do not even have the telephone number -- the number of the telephone which was intercepted. Consequently, we cannot even know who owned that telephone line. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, there is established case law in this Tribunal about that, that evidence must fulfil several qualities: Legal integrity, moral integrity, physical integrity -- and that is what I am talking about right now regarding that document. 
Lastly, Mr. President, Your Honours, I note, and I would like you also to note that the document is being put to four witnesses for purposes of recognition. And there are two things which are common to the four witnesses, as you will realise when you see the other witnesses: Firstly, they have been charged before Rwandan courts; and, secondly, they were in the administrative unit, which Mr. Renzaho handled. It is for those reasons that I am asking you, not only to exclude that evidence, that is, the audio CD, but also to exclude the testimony of Witness ALG regarding that document, because as we have understood, you have not yet made a determination regarding the document; thirdly, to exclude the will-say regarding this witness and next two witnesses, which, by rote, I believe are BUO and AWE. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître, you referred to the covenant, and I heard you say both in French and also in the English translation, article 17, but you meant article 14, didn't you? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I stand corrected by you. Indeed, that was actually speaking off-the-cuff. It is the article relating to the right to privacy and concerning intercepts, and I believe I also mentioned the covenant regarding the right for each Accused to be aware of all the accusations against him within a reasonable time frames. That one is article 14. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see, so you are actually making a reference, both to article 14 concerning fair trial rights, and article 17 concerning right to privacy. That is noted. Then you kindly drew our attention to either an admissibility decision or views by the human rights committee. Could you give us a copy of that case, please? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, we are having it printed and then we shall forward it to you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So we would wish a copy to the Bench and to the court reporters and the translators, please. Thank you for that. 
Mr. Witness, can you hear me now? 
@WITNESS GLJ:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What's going on now is a procedural discussion about admissibility of documents. This is not necessarily related to your testimony. So we would ask you to bear with us, and we will now hear the Prosecution's submissions on the same matters. So, please, be patient. Take off your headset again and we will soon start your testimony. All right? 
@WITNESS GLJ:
Very well, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. I will try and be relatively brief because I know we have discussed this issue previously and I don't want to repeat things at length. Firstly, can I make it quite clear that I agree with my friend that it is not in the indictment, and therefore we will not be asking for Your Honours to convict the Accused for this alleged incident and anything said therein. The purpose of it was made quite clear in our pretrial brief, which was filed, Your Honours, on the 31st of October 2005, some almost 15 months ago, when we advised the Defence that we intended to lead evidence of the Accused talking of extermination during an intercepted telephone conversation with the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, Mr. Rugambarara, and that the purpose of that was as evidence of intent, which is quite a separate issue to its being an issue contained in the indictment for which we can require or ask for a conviction. It is proof of intent. 
Your Honours, I note my friend hasn't referred to any decisions of this Court or of our Appeals Court. I would briefly refer Your Honour to the Appeals Court decision of Ntahobali and Nyiramasuhuko, decision of the 2nd of July 2004 by -- issued by Judge Shahabuddeen. That was an interlocutory appeal regarding evidence which had been admitted by the Trial Chamber, which had not been contained in the indictment, regarding one of the Accused presence at a speech, which was being led by the Prosecution to be inflammatory. And His Honour said, in paragraph 13 of that decision that:
"As Nyiramasuhuko has not been charged in the indictment for her presence at the installation of the person, there can be no conviction in respect of her attendance at that meeting. However, whilst it may be the case that her presence" -- and I am not reading fully, but I hope -- "it may be the case that the allegation of Witness RV in relation to Nyiramasuhuko's presence at the installation of Ndayambaje in Muganza commune is not specifically pleaded in the indictment, this alone does not render the evidence inadmissible. Indeed, pursuant to Rule 89(C) of the rules, the Trial Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value. It should be recalled that the admissibility of evidence should not be confused with the assessment of the weight to be afforded to that evidence, an issue to be decided by the Trial Chamber after hearing the totality of the evidence." 
Now, I note from my friend's submission I certainly didn't hear that the Accused was denying it was him; and, in fact, it appears that perhaps he may have an explanation this it was in the context of a battle that such words were spoken. But that is a matter which Your Honour may hear from the Accused, if he so chooses to testify. And, at the end of the day, if Your Honour or Your Honours are of the opinion that it is, in fact, the accused who is speaking on that tape, Your Honours, will obviously place such weight in the context to any other evidence that you hear from the Accused or others as to what was going on at the time. So there is not -- there shouldn't be a confusion between its being in the indictment; that's not the purpose for its being led. It's being led, as we advised the Defence 15 months ago, as proof of his intent. Your Honours -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But is it not a material fact? 
@MR. MOSES:
Well, it is relevant, obviously, to the intent we have to prove in the indictment, yes, but in terms of a specific fact of which we are asking for a conviction in relation to an event, no it is not. It is not material in that manner, it is material in the manner of proof of his intent. 
Your Honours, we disclosed the -- I think my friends are also perhaps being confused as to the Prosecution's obligations of disclosure pursuant to Rule 66, which is prior statements of witnesses. There is no, in fact, obligation on the Prosecution to disclose exhibits. We have disclosed, and did disclose, however, the transcript of that video -- of that intercept, on the 6th of December. It was made clear in the pretrial brief, originally, that there was a witness, BKX, who was going to testify regarding the intercept and on the updated pretrial brief, which was filed, I believe, on the 15th of December last year, we advised that ALG would also be testifying to its being the Accused's voice on that intercept. So the Defence have never requested to listen to, or asked to hear the original, which, of course, they are entitled to do under the rules. If they wanted to ask us, they could have done so, and we would have provided it to them. So there is no issue of late disclosure, Your Honours, because, in fact, under the rules there is no obligation to disclose exhibits in any particular time frame, other than the Defence have the right to ask us to inspect any such exhibits; and they have never asked to inspect the original of that. 
In terms -- I don't really, Your Honours, want to get into an argument over the particular content of what is in the total transcript. Clearly, it's our position that where the transcript which has been provided says "Karera", it is not right. That's clearly our position. And the prime piece of evidence is, in fact, the audio, which, of course, does not say it is Karera; it is simply someone's interpretation. We are calling a number of people, and as my friend, I think, pointed out, these aren't just anybody, these were people who knew the Accused and his voice intimately; and we will be leading evidence they knew Karera as well. 
So -- but these are issues of weight, Your Honours. In terms of Rule 89, which is the basis on which we have asked for it to be entered, we say that the evidence is relevant. It's very relevant. Your Honour has -- Your Honours, I think, before hearing ALG indicated that you wanted to hear his testimony in relation to it and hear any cross-examination in relation to his testimony regarding the intercept before determining whether or not to admit the evidence. Now, Your Honour has heard his testimony, Your Honour has heard about his relationship with the Accused and how well he may have known the Accused's voice, and Your Honour has heard the cross-examination in relation to that piece of evidence, which I think consisted of saying -- asking him was he a voice expert, which I think that he replied that he wasn't. So that's the -- that's the evidence. We say under Rule 89 it is admissible. Questions of what weight Your Honours place should be assessed at the end of the trial, and we shouldn't be getting into the argument as to what it really meant until Your Honours have heard all the evidence. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, the Bench is interested to know the source of this CD? Where did you get it? Is the person still available? Can he come to the court or something? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, the -- I think the investigator told Your Honours where he had received it from, which was a Rwandan ministry. We have made some enquiries to try and locate, but to date have not been able to find out for certain the person who originally recorded the document. We only know where we got it from. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We heard you say, Mr. Moses, that you referred to this already in the June 2005 version of the pretrial brief in connection with demonstrating the Accused's intent in relation to extermination. But when I read that document, it is indeed intent in relation to genocide; isn't that so? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's correct, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you said that if we look at the summary of the witness statements in the June 2005 version of the pretrial brief, we will find this under Witness BKX, and then it was in December 2006 added in relation to ALG. These two will-say statements come then, in addition, I understand, namely, Witness UB and Witness AWE. There is no reference in the summary of these two witnesses either, not even in the December version of the pretrial brief about this telephone tape or whatever. 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, it wasn't played to them until last week, Your Honours, which is why, as soon as we did that and received that information, we disclosed it to the Defence in French and English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So notice was given in relation to one witness in June 2005, in relation to a second witness in December 2006; and then came the two will-say statements in relation to witness 3 and 4, and there notice was given on the 17th of January 2007. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In fact, I think in the will-says there were three witnesses, Your Honours. There was GLJ, UB, and AWE. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are right. 
@MR. MOSES: 
One point, Your Honour, the original pretrial brief was filed 31st October 2005, not June. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are quite right. Thank you. 
Defence counsel, please assist us here. Is it the position of the Defence that there was never a conversation between your client and this other person, or is it the position that there was at some stage such a conversation, but that the substance of that conversation has been manipulated? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, as far as Mr. Renzaho is concerned, such a conversation never took place. He has even drawn your attention to -- a while ago to the issues of problems related to telephone and telephone disconnection. And I read what his -- his statement, he said there was a disconnection on the 8th of April 1994. I don't understand exactly what he is saying there, but I believe what he is saying generally is that telephone in Kigali-ville and Kigali-rural at the beginning -- at the outset of the events, suffered several disconnections. So, he is even doubting the existence of such a communication starting from the 8th of April. 
And let me add to the issue of disclosures done by the Prosecutor. The new summaries of witness statements were not disclosed to us in French before the first week of the beginning of trial. There is someone in our team who speaks English, but, once and for all, I want to point it out to my learned friends on the other side that the use of the French language in this Tribunal is not a privilege, it is a right, and I intend to ensure that this is respected. 
I have explained to the Tribunal the conditions under which we worked from the 18th of December. I was not able to add anything in English. The -- it is the wish of the Tribunal that we work expeditiously; I agree with that. And to be able to do so, we need to work in French, which is our language, which is the language of the Accused, and which is the language we chose at the beginning of the trial. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the submissions by both parties on this issue. We will consider the matter and come back to you. What we will do now is to ask you to start the testimony and keep the issue of the tape to the very end of your examination-in-chief. 
Mr. Witness, your headset, please. We will now start your testimony, Mr. Witness, as we have clarified a few floating issues, and the Prosecution will now ask questions. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. Your Honours, for reasons which I think will become clear to you, I am going to need to begin and spend a good deal of time in closed session because of the nature of the evidence that I am going to lead, which I think is likely to identify the Accused -- not the Accused, the witness. And I apologise for that, but I don't see any way around it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's linked to the function of the person in 1994 and you cannot structure this -- at least not in the beginning, in a way to avoid it? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I have looked at the issue quite closely, Your Honour, and I have got a point at which I -- but it's toward the end, where I think we can come into open session, but it's -- I am afraid it's fairly much towards the end of his testimony. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I am afraid we have to say to those in the public gallery that we are now entering into a closed session because of the sensitive matter of the testimony which is about to start. So we would recommend you to find another trial while we are in closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 13 to 36] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
$(Pages 1 to 12 by Judith Baverstock)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness GLJ, we are now in open session and will hear the rest of your examination-in-chief. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
If I can just remind you, Mr. Witness, if you think any answer's going to identify yourself, please tell Their Honours and myself, and we will try and approach it differently. 
You mentioned earlier in your testimony that a man by the name of Jérémie Kaboyi was made conseiller of your secteur. Do you know what political party that person belonged to? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
He was a member of the MRND. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you either see, or were you told of, any activities that he did after he was appointed as conseiller of that secteur? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
He was appointed conseiller from the 2nd of May. He participated in an attack, together with Kigingi and other Interahamwe. And 16 people died in that attack, close to my residence. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How long after he had been appointed as conseiller did that attack near your residence take place? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
He was appointed to that position on the 30th of April, and the attack took place on the 2nd, so that is three days. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know who was the conseiller of that secteur at the end of June? Was it still Mr. Kaboyi, or someone else? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Kaboyi remained conseiller until the town fell. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, Witness, you have told us earlier that, in order to -- to get travel documents, a person had to go to the préfectoral office. And you also told us that to get a fuel voucher you had to go to the préfectoral office. And -- is that correct? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay, good. What I want to ask you is: For a Tutsi who was living in your secteur in -- well, April 1994, what obstacles, if any, were there for that -- those people to travel or obtain food? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
There were obstacles, because it was difficult to move around, given all the roadblocks, and that would make it difficult for him to go all the way to the office to give all the required documents so as to receive the travel documents. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what about obtaining food? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
There were roadblocks all over the place, and such a person would not be able to go to the market. And even if he had money, it would have been impossible for him to go and buy food supplies because he will have to go to town every day. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Why do you say it would be impossible? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
I say it is impossible because of the roadblocks. He would not have been able to go through the roadblocks. 
@MR. MOSES: 
We may have covered this before, but why is that? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
The reason is that those who attacked the country were Tutsis, and their accomplices were the Tutsis within the country. And the Tutsis within the country could therefore not move around without being killed, because they were considered as accomplices of the enemy. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, Witness, I'm wondering if you can please be shown a bundle of photographs. 
@MR. MOSES: 
These are the ones yet to be formally admitted, Your Honours. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, I'd like you, please, to look at photograph number 5. There's a number in the bottom right-hand corner. 
Have you got number -- photograph 5 in front of you? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, do you recognise any of the people who are shown in photograph number 5? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Yes, I recognise one person. I recognise only one person. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And can you please perhaps hold up the photograph and point to the person that you recognise. 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
I am able to recognise this person whose wearing a hat -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is that the hat with -- 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
-- with inscriptions. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is that the hat which has RAP -- I think it's RAP on it? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Where had you -- where have you seen that person before? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
He was at the roadblock erected at Gitega, and he was also in the town centre aboard a vehicle that he was using. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know the person's name, or not? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
No, I do not know his name -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
And was -- 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
-- but since I saw him often, I can recognise him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And was he just an ordinary member of the population, was he a soldier, what -- do you know? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
In the course of the month of April, the Interahamwe wore military uniform. And one could find some of them who were wearing only military beret or military shirts, or military pair of trousers with normal civilian shirts, and they were called Interahamwe. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just to clarify, are you saying that this person was Interahamwe or not? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Yes, he was an Interahamwe. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, if I could please ask you to turn to photograph number 8. Do you have photograph 8? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, do you recognise any of the people who are shown in photograph number 8? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
I recognise one person. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, once again, perhaps if you can just hold up the booklet of photographs and point out the person you recognise. 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
I am able to recognise this person. She is a woman wearing clothes made with kitenge and a military uniform. 
@MR. MOSES: 
But just for the record, Your Honour, the witness identified the person to the extreme right-hand side of the photograph. Is that clear enough? 
Is that sufficient, Your Honour, that description? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is indeed the person with a wool hat and a grey wind jacket. Isn't that so, Mr. Witness? The one on the right-hand side? 
@WITNESS GLJ:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you know the person's name or where they are from? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
I don't know his name, but this woman is from Gitega and I saw her at the roadblock which was erected at Gitega. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Your Honour, I believe we've come to the point in the examination-in-chief where I now wish to play the telephone conversation, and I need some direction from Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that, plus the questions, will take more than five minutes, surely. 
We will adjourn now, resume at 2:40, and we will then be able to provide clarity as to how to proceed. 
The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1258H to 1500H) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, the Court is now sitting under Rule 15 bis because Judge Egorov was not able to join us this afternoon. He will be back tomorrow morning, we think. 
The pending issue just before we adjourned for the lunch break related to a tape which has been transcribed and which has been the subject matter of discussion previously in this courtroom. We are faced with the previous request to tender this document following the testimony of Witness ALG. The Defence then, this morning, made additional submissions on the subject, followed by submissions by the Prosecution. 
Our view is that we will not accept this tape as an exhibit, based on what we have heard in this trial at this stage. The Bench is uncertain about its provenance. We will, however, allow questions relating to this tape and the transcriptions. That's where we are. 
You have the floor, Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
Just to clarify what I now do, am I being permitted to play the tape and ask -- thank you, Your Honours. 
We had some problems last time we tried playing this, you will recall. Those problems seem to have arisen again, except we are able to play the audio without it coming up on your screen with the transcription. And I -- what I want to do, Your Honours, is to -- to play that, I can point to Your Honours and to my learned friend where in the transcriptions -- transcripted documents that Your Honours have, where the portion of the tape begins, if that's going to, hopefully, assist matters. 
In the Kinyarwandan transcript, the tape begins on K0167907 at about two-thirds of the way down. In the French it is -- it commences on the page can the K number K0167847. And in the English version, it begins at the top of page -- there's actually a page number, page 31. And that page 31 has the K number K01167775. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Witness, what I want you to do is to listen to a tape which is going to be played, and I'm then going to ask you some questions in relation to that tape. So if you'd please just listen as we now play the tape. 
$(Audio played) 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Right. Now, Witness, you've listened to that tape. Were you able to recognise any voice or voices on that tape? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Thank you, Counsel. I was able to recognise the voice of the préfet. I wasn't able to recognise the other voices. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you say "the préfet", who do you mean? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
I meant Préfet Renzaho, the préfet for Kigali-ville préfecture. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, do you know a person by the name of François Karera? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Yes, I know him. He was the préfet of Kigali-rural préfecture. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you know what his voice sounds like? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Yes, because he had been our bourgmestre in Nyarugenge urban commune. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you hear his voice on the tape? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
No, I did not hear his voice. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What makes you say it was the voice of Préfet Renzaho? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
I know Préfet Renzaho's voice well. He was talking about what had happened in Kigali city and, as far as I know, he was the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture at the time. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, when you listened to that tape -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I don't know if we have the -- a copy of the transcript which can be provided to the witness in court. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga, do we have a copy of the transcripts available? They have not yet been tendered, of course, but maybe you have a working copy. Or the Prosecution may have. 
@MR. MOSES: 
They were given to the Witness ALG. So they weren't ever tendered, as Your Honour quite rightly says, but they were provided to the -- under tab 21, I think, if that assists the registry. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am going to object because I don't see why that written document will be put to the witness, other than to help him in the answers he will give to the questions which will be put to him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is the purpose here to single out a couple of words? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Exactly, and I don't trust my own pronunciation of the words. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please do that. 
@MR. MOSES:
Okay.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you can trust your Kinyarwandan pronunciation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, when you listened to that tape, did you hear the words "mubakindagure rwoze"? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
Yes, I heard those words. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what do those words mean to you? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
They had just been talking about the accomplices. That is why he made the suggestion, "exterminate them". And when he used those words, my understanding was that he was referring to the Tutsi and those who were the opponents of the regime at the time. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And whose voice did you hear using those words? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
It was Préfet Renzaho's voice. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And then after that, there was -- did you hear the words "urumba" a question, "mubakindagure, mubakinda...gure bose"? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
I heard that, because he said it more than two times. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what does that expression mean to you? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
If I am to refer to what happened in Kigali city, then it was in connection with the killings committed by soldiers, gendarmes, and police officers, killings which targeted Tutsi within Kigali city. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the words that I read out, however, what -- what do you say they mean in Kinyarwandan? 
@WITNESS GLJ: 
It's a language which is not very direct, and for those who are not familiar with the context they will not understand because it was a form of coded language. But it referred to the genocide which was being prepared. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, Your Honours, I think that's the extent of the examination-in-chief, unless Your Honour has any follow-up questions for the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But let us try to be helpful here. Now, the first expression you read out was on page K0167908, and that is the expression in two words; isn't that so? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's correct, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the spelling is M-U-B-A-K-I-N-D-A-G-U-R-E. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
R-W-O-S-E. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then you read out another portion, which is on page 909? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honours, that was, in fact, also on 908, about two lines beneath -- in fact, it is two lines beneath the line which Your Honour has just spelt out. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you start with "urumba"? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, that's correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So this time you actually read out something different from last time you read out something from the transcripts; is that so? Or is it the same portion you read to ALG? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I think something was read out. The first was the same, and then there was a -- I don't know if I was here for that part, perhaps Ms. Melluish -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Be that as it may, the first word being urumba, U-R-U-M-B-A question mark. And then M-U-B-A-K-I-N-D-A-G-U-R-E comma, M-U-B-A-K-I-N-D-A dot dot dot, G-U-R-E and the last word B-O-S-E. 
Have I transcribed it -- or, spelt it correctly now? 
@MR. MOSES: 
You have, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. That was the end of the examination-in-chief. 
Cross-examination, please. Do you want to perform your cross-examination in open or closed session, Defence Counsel? Can we start in open session? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, my preference is always for an open session. But, as a matter of fact, I am going to deal with questions, most of which, of course, pertain to the witness's identity. So there's a risk of their having a negative bearing. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that risk arises immediately, as I understand you, and that means, unfortunately, that we have to close this hearing and go into closed session.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, the Court is in session. 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS GLJ:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your cross-examination continues, and I understand that we are in open session. Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning, Mr. President. 
Actually, Mr. President, it was my understanding that yesterday, by the time we adjourned at the end of the afternoon session, we were in a closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was also my understanding, and that's why I'm raising the issue now while we are in open session. Do we agree that we need to continue in closed now? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I don't think so, Mr. President. 
Indeed, I'm sorry, I would like us to move to closed session because I have some issues of identity which I would like to put to the witness. So my preference would be that we complete the cross-examination in closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, let us do that.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS SAF:
Good morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness SAF in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness SAF in Kinyarwanda) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document there, Mr. Witness, with your signature, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS SAF:
That is so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS SAF:
It is.

@MR. TREDICI: 
Good morning, Your Honour. For the record, I am counsel for the Prosecution, and my name is Ignacio Tredici. I will be leading this witness. The Prosecution would like to apply to go to closed session for two minutes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will do that.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness SAF, we are now in open session and we will hear your examination-in-chief. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, when did you hear of the death of President Habyarimana? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
When President Habyarimana died, let's say on the 7th of April or thereabouts. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Did you hear about his death in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening or in the night of the 7th April 1994? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I had spent the night at home, and the members of the population said the father of the nation is dead. So I went to ************* as usual. I did not know that people would kill one another. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
So, Witness, I invite you again not to make any reference to places or situations that could disclose your identity. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Very well. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
So, what did you do after you heard of the death of Habyarimana? Without mentioning the place where you went, if you went somewhere. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
On the morning, I went to my place of work. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. Who did you find at your working place that morning? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I found some of my colleagues. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
What happened when you got to your working place? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
At some point in time we were told that no one had to move, that we had to remain where we were. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Did you go back home that morning or after that morning? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
At some point when it was said that no one was to move about, roadblocks were set up and everybody remained where they were. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you describe the security situation in that area at that point in time? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The situation became very dangerous. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you kindly describe what was the situation? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The situation changed immediately. When roadblocks were set up, they started killing people. And it was during the night when the father of the nation was murdered that they started assassinating ministers. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you explain to the Chamber who were the target of these killings? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Those marked were the Tutsi, because at that time it was as if their fate had been sealed. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And, then, what did you do after the killings had started? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I couldn't do anything. You see, I, too, was afraid. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And Mr. Witness, did you go somewhere, did you stay where you were? What did you do after the killings had started? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I did not do anything. I tried to hide, so as to survive. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And where did you hide, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I hid in a bush not far from my home. We hid ourselves there because at night one could not move about, given that roadblocks had been set up. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, you just mentioned that you hid in a bush not far from your home. Could you specify where did you hide? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I hid in that place because there was some shrubbery there, and we tried to hide in the shrubbery. No one could move about. We would lie on the ground and cover ourselves with grass, as if it was some sort of a blanket or a sheet. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, could you please mention the name of the place where you were hiding? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
It was within the premises of the former (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover). 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Now, Mr. Witness, were you married in April 1994? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I was married with two kids. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And where was your family at the time of these events? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I never saw them again. We all tried to save our lives - or, rather, I did not see them at the time, but I saw them again at the end of the war. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
You said you were hiding at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover). Did you go back home to check if your family was there? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
No, it was not possible to move about, and it was for that reason that I almost abandoned my family because I thought that my family members had been killed. But it was only after the war that I was able to see members of my family again and that I was able to go back to the area where my family resided. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, how many people -- if there were more people than you -- stayed at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) at the time of these events? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
When the situation became difficult, some of the staff left and did not come back. I believe there were around six of us who were not able to leave (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) because at a given point in time there were some of our colleagues who left and who never came back to (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).
@MR. TREDICI:
Your Honours, there is a risk that the last answer of the witness could disclose his identity. So the Prosecution -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will delete the two references to the workplace and place them under separate cover. 
Just refer to the place you worked as your workplace, Mr. Witness. Will you please remember? 
@WITNESS SAF:
Very well. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
You mentioned that there were six people at one point staying at your working place with you. Do you know the ethnic origin of the people living there with you? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Some of them were Hutu, others were Tutsi. At a given point in time, some Hutus decided to leave the workplace and we remained there in small numbers with people who could not move around because of the situation -- because of the prevailing situation. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, do you remember the names of the Tutsis that were hiding at your working place with you? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
No, I do not remember their names because that was a long time ago, and besides, some of them are deceased. However, I do believe I remember one person's name. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please tell the Judges what's the name of this person? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
There was one Posiani Tuganishuri, who resided at a rural area. I have not seen him for quite a while. Perhaps the other colleagues are still alive, but they live far away in the rural areas. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honours, I am afraid that this name is not in the amended list of common names. 
$BY MR.TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, could you please spell the name of Mr. Posiani Tuganishuri?
@WITNESS SAF: 
Did you say that you did not have that name, Mr. Prosecutor? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
He said that we need your assistance to spell the name, please. Can you do that? 
@WITNESS SAF:
Do you wish me to spell out the name, the Kinyarwanda name? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, both the first name and the last name. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
If I may assist -- 
@WITNESS SAF:
I do not know how the name is spelt out. I do not think I am in a better position to spell out names here compared to those present. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Tredici, please help us. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
I will try to help the Chamber, Your Honour. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Posiani is spelt P-O-S-I-N -- excuse me, I-A-N-I. Tuganishuri is spelt T-U-G-A-N-I-S-H-U-R-I. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, do you remember the names of the Hutus that were living with you at your working place? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Listen, that was a long time ago. I do wish that you would not ask me to give you their names. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
It's not a problem if you don't remember, Mr. Witness. Thank you very much. At least, do you know if these people are still alive? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Those who worked in Kigali went back to their communes. And if I have not seen them, it is difficult for me to know where they are right now and what their whereabouts are. In addition, I am not going to carry out any inquiries to find them, because nobody has made such a request to me. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Thank you. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Do you know who the préfet of Kigali-ville was during that period of time? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Do you wish for me to give you those names? 
@THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Could the Prosecutor please repeat his question? This is a request made by the French booth. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
If the witness could tell the Chamber who the préfet of Kigali-ville was at the time of the events. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
It was Tharcisse Renzaho. He was the préfet of the Kigali town préfecture. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And, Mr. Witness, did you ever see him during the time you stayed at your working place? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I saw him during that period. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please tell the Chamber when did you see him? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Well, I saw him where I was, as I stated previously. May I proceed? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Yes, please. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
When I saw him at my place of work, it was when a meeting was taking place. And, in the meantime, before his arrival, the conseiller had come to announce that a meeting would be held there. And I saw Tharcisse Renzaho during the course of that meeting because he was introduced to us as an official. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Do you remember when this meeting took place? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
This meeting took place in mid-June. The war was about to end because the Inyenzi were fighting in Gikondo and Mburabuturo, and was about to seize the town of Kigali.
@MR. TREDICI:
Your Honour, for the record, Gikondo is number 66 on the list of amended common names. I am afraid I cannot help you with the second name the witness mentioned. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mburabuturo. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is spelt, booth, please? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
M-B-U-R-A-B-U-T-U-R-O. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, will you please tell the Chamber where in particular at your working place did this meeting take place? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The meeting took place in front of the location I referred to, where there was a hotel. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please be more specific? Was it in front of the working place, in the same compound of the working place, by the side of that compound? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
It was not the side of that compound, but in front of the entrance of the building. Since there was fighting going on in Gikondo, people were trying to avoid the bullets that might come from Gikondo. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
I would invite you to be more specific, please, and tell us if "In front" means in front of the entrance or in front of the compound. Was it in the same compound, but in front of the entrance, or it was in front of the compound? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
It was in front of the building, but within the compound in a location where people were sure that nothing could come from behind them, but it was still within the compound of my place of work. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, do you know how Renzaho arrived at your working place that day? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Do you wish to know what he had come there to do? I believe I misunderstood your question. Do you want me to explain to you what he had gone there for? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
I would like you to explain to the Judges how he arrived. Did Renzaho arrive by car, by bus, by walking? How did Renzaho arrive at your working place that day? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
On that day he arrived on board a military camouflage vehicle, and he came along with other individuals. 
$(Pages 29 to 33 by Judith Baverstock)
1215H 
$BY MR. TREDICI: 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you describe more the type of car you just mentioned? And if there was one or two or three or more cars? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
There were two four-by-four vehicles that were painted in camouflage pattern, and there were other vehicles with Interahamwe on board. And he arrived with a number of other people who were accompanying him. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you tell the Trial Chamber who were the other people that arrived at your working place that day with Renzaho? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
It was Renzaho himself, as well as one Setako. There was also Bagosora, as well as Nsengiyumva. 
@MR. TREDICI:
And for the record, Your Honours, Setako is number 260 in the amended list of common names, Bagosora is number 7, and Nsengiyumva -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
These are well-known names to our dear court reporters and everyone in the courtroom. Thank you. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
I apologise. Your Honour -- excuse me. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, do you remember what Renzaho was wearing that day? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
He was wearing a military uniform. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And now kindly tell the Trial Chamber what time did this meeting take place? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The meeting did not last very long, and it was held between noon and 1 p.m. And he made sure that the meeting would not last long because there was this problem of the gunshots coming from Gikondo, and one did not want the participants of the meeting to be reached by any stray bullets coming from the direction of Gikondo. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
How did you get to know about this meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Before the meeting took place, Mr. Mbyariyehe, who was the conseiller for the town, informed us that a meeting would take place at that location, and that an official would talk to the population. And that is why the population came to attend the meeting, because it was a pacification meeting. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, do you know where Mr. Mbyariyehe was conseiller of? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
At the time, he was the conseiller of the secteur in which that area was. And he was the one who introduced Renzaho, and then he gave him the floor after having told us that Renzaho would be the one to chair the meeting and would address the population. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do we have the spelling of this conseiller? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Yes, Your Honour. He's number 136 in the list of common names. I'm in the list of common names. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, you mentioned that he was the conseiller of the secteur where the meeting took place. What was that secteur? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
At the time, there was one secteur which covered the whole city, because we were in the middle of the city. So he came to inform us of this meeting in his capacity as conseiller of that secteur. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please give the Trial Chamber the name of this secteur? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I do not recall the name of that secteur. That was a long time ago. Was it called Rugenge? It might be Rugenge, because from the St. Michel cathedral and going down toward the Kiyovu neighbourhood, it was the town, and the person I referred to was the conseiller for the town. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honours, I seek clarification from the interpreters. I couldn't hear well if they mentioned Rugenge or Nyarugenge as being the name of this secteur. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What was the secteur you mentioned, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS SAF:
I do know that the person who came to us was the conseiller of the secteur for that locality, and he was the one who introduced that person who would come and address the population. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Name of the secteur, Mr. Witness. Was it Rugenge or Nyarugenge? 
@WITNESS SAF:
I stated that the gentleman was the conseiller for the town secteur, and he was the conseiller of the secteur in which we were. And even if you would go to the field to question people, they would tell you that he was the conseiller, whereas the Rugenge secteur you are talking about was further down the road. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Your Honours. 
@WITNESS SAF:
Nyarugenge covered the whole town, and at the time he was the conseiller for the town. So I was not referring to Rugenge, because Rugenge started -- the Rugenge secteur started at the end of the road, and it was that neighbourhood that one called "the Kiyovu for the poor", whereas the location where we were was the other Kiyovu, which was called "the Kiyovu for the wealthy". 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. I don't think we want more information on this regard. 
Mr. Witness, did you attend this meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Yes, I did. I was present. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
In view of your ethnicity, did you have any problems attending this meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
If I was able to participate -- or to attend this meeting until the end, it is not because I had any specific strength, or I looked like anyone in particular, but merely because I had -- I was wearing clothes that did not make me obvious. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please describe in which way you were wearing clothes that didn't make your ethnicity obvious? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I had taken a pullover -- the arm of a pullover. I had put two holes -- the sleeves, sorry, of a pullover. I had put two holes in them, and I had put them over my head with only the two holes for my eyes, and no one could see what I looked like because I had hidden my face. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Were there any Tutsis at this meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Yes. There were Tutsis there. Because it was a pacification meeting, we were told that no one could harm anybody else. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Who told you that no one could harm anybody else? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Those words were uttered by Renzaho, who was the préfet for Kigali-ville. He said he had come to organise a pacification meeting, and that all those in hiding were to leave their hiding places because no one could harm others. That peace would henceforth reign. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, could you please tell the Chamber who spoke first at this meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I've already explained that. What I said was that the first speaker was the conseiller, then Préfet Renzaho spoke to the people in attendance. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And what did the conseiller say? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The conseiller spoke first, announcing that it was a pacification meeting, even though it was a way of misleading members of the public to take them out of their hiding places. Then he introduced Préfet Renzaho to us and requested him to stand up. We all gave Renzaho an acclamation. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And who spoke after the conseiller? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Renzaho, the préfet. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And what did he say? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Renzaho stood up, we gave him an acclamation because the conseiller had just asked us to bid that distinguished guest welcome. So the préfet said we had been attacked, and that the enemy was staying steadfast. Do you want me to continue? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Yes, please. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
He said the enemy was staying steadfast, and he said the enemy was the Inyenzi and the Tutsi. He said the enemy had attacked Rwandans, so we had to defend ourselves. He said that to all those who were present, even those who had been hiding. And most acknowledged that those who had been hiding had gotten out of their hiding places, because they had been told it was a pacification meeting. So after we had welcomed the guests, the préfet told us that it was the Tutsi enemy who had attacked the country. Now, the Interahamwe, who was supposed to be providing security, surrounded everybody because they said they wanted to prevent the Inyenzi from causing problems and infiltrating that place. The Tutsi had even been told that they could return to their workplaces, even to the PVK, but those who went to the PVK were killed and the authority was not able to protect them, whereas some of the Tutsi were even killed right there on the spot. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, who spoke after Renzaho, if anyone spoke after Renzaho? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
After Renzaho's address, Bagosora spoke, followed by Setako. In fact, even Nsengiyumva was introduced to us. We were told he was a guest who had come from Gisenyi. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Now, could you describe the audience at this meeting? How many people were in attendance of this meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
There were not many people in that residential area. I would say there were about 30 people, not including the Interahamwe who were there and who were supposed to be ensuring security. Of course, I'm giving you an estimate because I did not count those who attended the meeting. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And where were you standing or sitting during the meeting? Was it at the front, in the middle, or at the back of the audience? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
During that meeting, I was in the rear. I could not go close to those who were presiding over the meeting. I was near other people. You see, at the time you could not just start a chat with just anybody, because some people had become very wicked, and it was even impossible to speak to them. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you estimate the distance between you and the speakers? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The distance between me and the speakers was short. But as I'd already told you, my dressing made me inconspicuous and there was no reason for me to be afraid. That is why I was able to follow that meeting up until the end. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, were you standing or sitting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Those in the first rows were sitting, but those of us in the rear were standing so as to be able to listen to the speeches. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why do you say that you looked inconspicuous, Mr. Witness, when you had a pullover with two holes in and over your head? You must have looked rather strange. 
@WITNESS SAF:
But that was the dressing of everybody, including the Interahamwe. Those who were indulging in the killings had the same form of dressing. They always covered their faces, even the soldiers were wearing helmets which covered their faces. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, coming back to the speakers, were they standing or sitting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
As I explained to you, whenever someone was speaking, he would stand. When he was introduced, we would give him an acclamation or a round of applause. So whenever a speaker stood up, we would give him a round of applause, then he would start his speech. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
You mentioned Setako and Bagosora were there. Do you remember what Setako said, if he said anything, on that opportunity? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
What he said was in no way different from what was said by the other people who were massacring people. He said the enemy had attacked the country, and it was absolutely necessary to be vigilant, and we had to work together to fight the enemy. Also, we needed to hunt down and eliminate the enemy. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Who do you mean by the other people who were massacring people? Because your answer was "Setako said -- what Setako said was in no way different from what was said by the other people who were massacring people". Who were these other people you refer to? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Do you want to know who was massacring people? Come on, Counsel. When you have an animal at your home, and you give the animal to someone to slaughter it, is it the animal which commits suicide, so to speak, or is it the person who handed the animal over which should be considered as a killer? It was Renzaho who handed people over, because he considered them as enemies who had attacked the country. Then he did not want to ensure their security. So he was the one who handed them over because he was an authority. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, did anything out of the normal happen during this meeting besides the speeches? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Yes, because people were killed. Do you think there is something more serious than killing people? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Where were these people killed during the meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
There was no great distance between the place where those people were killed and the place where the meeting was taking place. I don't know whether it was next to the prosecution department, but at the time there were flowers there. When those people were killed, they did not intervene, whereas they ought to have insisted that those people be spared because they were human beings. But instead of intervening in favour of the people being massacred, they were, rather, laughing. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Who were laughing, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I am referring to the authorities. Renzaho, the other authorities, and the Interahamwe. When the victims were being slaughtered, the Interahamwe were bursting out in laughter, they were whistling. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Yes, Mr. Witness, but you mentioned the authorities. And my question is, who were the authorities, in plural, that were laughing when these people were being killed? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Let me start with Renzaho, then Setako was there, Nsengiyumva was there, and also the conseiller. Actually, I started by mentioning the most important personalities because, you see, the conseiller was an authority, but of lower rank. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And do you know the ethnicity of the people that were killed during that meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
They were Tutsi. Who else would have been killed, according to you? Because those who were handed over were the Tutsi. Only the Tutsi were killed, because the killers could not have attacked people of their own ethnic group. So those handed over were the Tutsi, by Renzaho. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Did you know any of these people that were killed during the meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The names, or the faces? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
The names, or the faces, if you knew any of these people from before. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The people whom I saw who had come to that meeting, dubbed pacification meeting -- you see, the people who were in hiding had been requested to start moving about. So it was when those people had left their hiding places to come to the pacification meeting, that they were slaughtered. 
Now, about knowing whether I knew their faces, I recognised them because I had seen them. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Have you seen them before the day of the meeting? Or before, during, the meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Before that meeting, those being wanted were hiding, and they got out of their hiding places when they were told there was a pacification meeting. Otherwise, even before the pacification meeting was announced, people had remained in their hiding places. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, how many Tutsis were killed during the meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Firstly, there were four gentlemen dragged across the tarmac road separating us where we were from the prosecution building. Those four gentlemen were killed on the spot, and that happened in front of the eyes of those people who didn't want to intervene to save them. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please name these people that you say didn't want to intervene to save them? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
Do you mean those who did not want to intervene to save people? Let me start with Renzaho, then I will mention Bagosora, Setako, and also Nsengiyumva, who were very influential people, even more influential than the conseillers of secteurs. Because the conseillers only obeyed instructions given by those senior authorities. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you describe how were these Tutsis killed? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
The préfet had given orders to the effect that each member of the population had to be armed either with a machete, or with a nail-studded club. So those people killed on that occasion were killed with those weapons. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
How far from where Renzaho and the rest of the authorities were sitting, were these Tutsis killed? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
But it was very close to the place where those authorities were sitting. The only thing separating those two points was the road. When they saw the Interahamwe shouting and hitting the victims, what did they think? What did they think they were witnessing? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Were there any visual obstacles between Renzaho, the authorities, and the location where the Tutsis were killed, according to your recollection? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
No. There was no obstacle. They witnessed the entire scene. And instead of intervening to put an end to that macabre and gory scene, they were, rather, laughing. That is why those people died. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And how far were you away from the killing yourself?
@WITNESS SAF:
But I was very close by. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you give us an estimate? You gave us an estimate about the distance between the meeting and the killing place. But now I want the distance between your position and where people were killed. Can you help us, please? 
@WITNESS SAF:
I told you that those two places were very close to one another. Why could those authorities not have been able to -- not to see what was happening? You see, it was out in the open in broad daylight, and those authorities could see what was going on because I, myself, could witness the scene. The only difference between me and those authorities was that while I was scared, they weren't scared of anything. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The distance, Mr. Witness. Can you give us an estimate? 20 metres, 40 metres, 5 metres, between you and where the killing took place? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
If I may be of assistance, Your Honour, maybe the witness could point -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I've heard what the witness said. I appreciate your attempt to assist, but let's see whether he can help us. 
@WITNESS SAF:
Mr. President, I did not measure the distance, but I would say that it was, at most, 20 metres, because it was just a question of crossing the tarmac road to the other side at the place where flowers were being displayed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, have you ever seen Renzaho before that day? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I had seen him when he was in the office, which was the commune office located near the Saint Michel cathedral, and I must state that on that occasion he was in civilian clothing. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
How far were you on that day from where Mr. Renzaho was sitting or standing? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I was close to him, because he was standing in front of the veranda of the commune office building. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
So how many times in total have you seen Renzaho? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I saw him on that occasion in the commune office building. Then I used to see his picture in newspapers. And I must state that I used to see his picture regularly in newspapers, when I saw him again in military attire in the location I already mentioned. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
How did you get to know that the person that spoke on that meeting was Renzaho? The meeting at your working place. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I've already explained that all the authorities were introduced, so he was introduced as an authority who was coming to direct that meeting, and we applauded him on that occasion. So you can understand that we could not have given an applause to someone without having first known whose identity it was. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, could you describe Tharcisse Renzaho as you saw him that day during the meeting? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
That was a very long time ago. He was a huge gentleman, and he was dressed in military attire. But when I saw him in the commune office, he was wearing a suit, he was sporting eyeglasses, and he was also balding. I don't know whether his physical features has changed from the last time when I saw him and today. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, do you think that you could recognise Renzaho if you saw him today? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
If I were to see him today, I may be able to recognise him if he's still bald. Because if, in the meantime, he has grown hairs, I won't be able to recognise him. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. Could you please stand up, look very carefully around you, and tell us -- around the court, please, look very carefully around the court -- and tell us if Mr. Renzaho is present today. Look very carefully around the court. 
@WITNESS SAF: 
I last saw him a long time ago, but he looks like the person I'm seeing there at the end. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please tell the Judges where is this person you're referring to, where is he sitting and what is he wearing today? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
He's the one sitting at that end, but it is possible that I am mistaken because it happened a long time ago. But I think he's the one. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You're now pointing to the left-hand side of you, Mr. Witness. On which row in that direction is this person sitting? 
@WITNESS SAF:
I'm talking about the person sitting at that end, Mr. President. I don't know if I am mistaken. But even though it has been a long time, I think that person I'm seeing there looks like Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, is it -- can you see there are different rows or benches in the courtroom on that side? There are some sitting behind there, and some are sitting in the front. Where is this person sitting, the one you are interested in?
@WITNESS SAF:
The first row, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Now, then, you said at the end. The end of the first row. On the right-hand side of that row, or on the left-hand side of the row? Is it towards the public gallery or towards the window? That's what you have to help us with now. 
@WITNESS SAF:
Firstly, there are two whites, then there is a black gentleman, and then there is the fourth person and that is the one I am indicating, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. That was the end? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
That was almost the end, Your Honour. So the Prosecution applies for the record to reflect that the person that was identified by the accused -- by the witness, was the Accused. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. That was the purpose of these questions. I thought that was clear. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
But that is not my last question. My last question is to the witness -- 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, have you ever testified about the events of 1994? 
@WITNESS SAF: 
You want to know whether I have testified against him? I didn't quite understand you, so kindly repeat your question. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
I withdraw the question, Your Honour. That was the end of my examination-in-chief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. We will, then, start again at 2:40. The Court is adjourned. The next witness, what is the estimated cross-examination time for this witness? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
(No interpretation)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
With other words, we need the next witness in the courtroom in the afternoon. Thank you. 
$(Court recessed from 1310H to 1445H)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I requested that the document I'm going to rely on for my cross-examination be distributed to you. These are the transcripts of the hearing of 4-5, 6, 7th -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could the interpreter speak louder, please? The one speaking English? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Very well, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's much more forceful. Thank you. Could you repeat what you said please, Maître? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was saying that I have requested the documents that I'm going to rely on partly for my cross-examination, be distributed to you. These are the transcripts of the hearings of the 5th, 6th and 7th November 2003 in Military I trial. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm going to be in my cross-examination, and I will be referring to facts that point to the witness's identity. And it would be more prudent for us to go into closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you are making this request that we do that immediately, to be on the safe side? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. Since I'm going to be dealing with issues relating to him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. We will have to do that. So we will now move into closed session.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning. The Court is in session. 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS BUO:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now start your examination-in-chief in closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 57] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
$(Page 1 by Judith Baverstock)
MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness BUO, we are now in open session, and your examination-in-chief continues. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you mentioned Angeline Mukandituye, and you said the Interahamwe were headquartered at her house. Do you know how long she had been in charge of that group of Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
From 1993 when the person who was in charge of the Interahamwe, that is to say, Scolastique, was shot, the Interahamwe set up the headquarters at Angeline's house. And in 1994, it was common knowledge that their headquarters was at Angeline's -- Angeline Mukandituye's house. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you joined this group of Interahamwe, what happened in general at these headquarters? What were they used for, as headquarters? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
In general, at the headquarters of the Interahamwe at Angeline Mukandituye's house there were a number of activities, and the Interahamwe would be trained to handle firearms. They would also be informed of the reason why it was necessary for them to learn how to handle firearms, and there was also the monitoring of the activities of the Interahamwe. 
$(Page 58 by Kirstin McLean)
1630H
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were you provided with weapons? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, we were. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And where did these weapons come from? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The first batch of weapons I was able to see was provided to us by Tharcisse Renzaho. And when the weapons were delivered to us, Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho was the one who brought them in the company of Munyakaze, Laurent. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Can you tell us when this happened?
@WITNESS BUO: 
This delivery took place on the 20th or on the 21st and it was on that date that we launched our first attack on the CELA centre. So on the 22nd, we launched a second attack against the same centre. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which month, please, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO:
On the 21st we attacked the CELA centre, and on the 22nd of April 1994 we launched a second attack against that same centre, CELA. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, we will come on to that in a moment, please. For the moment, you said those were the first weapons received, those that the préfet brought. Prior to that, had you had any weapons as a group of Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you. When I joined the Interahamwe, they already had weapons, but I am not in a position to tell you where such weapons had come from. I can only refer to those that were delivered when I had already joined the Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Prior to Renzaho's delivery of weapons, what if any weapons did you see at the house of Angeline Mukandutiye? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were G3 guns, a few R4 guns, as well as light automatic weapons, and around five Kalashnikov rifles. And if such is your wish, I could even give you the names of those who were using such weapons. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you joined this group of Interahamwe on the 8th or 9th of April, did you know how to use any of these weapons yourself? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Before answering that question, let me tell you that I did not join the Interahamwe in September, rather it was in April. And before I joined the Interahamwe militia, I had not been trained in weapons handling. It was only when I joined that group that I learned how to handle a weapon, a firearm. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It was just a little mistake. Everyone in the courtroom is aware that you joined on the 8th of April, Mr. Witness. You have told us that, Mr. Witness. But, now, the answer: The question was whether you had been trained previously to use any of these weapons yourself. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, the witness has answered that question. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us how you learnt -- and I mean briefly please -- how you learnt how to handle a firearm once you joined the Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. I was trained in weapons handling by one Fidele Habimana, also nicknamed Castar. He was very instrumental in the killings. He was the one who personally trained me in handling firearms. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Fidele Habimana is number 74 and Castar is number 39 on the list. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Generally speaking, after you joined this group of Interahamwe how often did you go to Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I went to Angeline's on a daily basis. Whenever I wanted to go there, I would go there. Her place was like family. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
At this time, where were you staying yourself, sleeping? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Sometimes I would spend the night at Angeline's, and at other times I could spend the night with my own family. It all depended on me. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how far from Angeline' house was your own home? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Not at all far, it was quite close by. We were neighbours. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Is there any kind of daily routine that occurred at Angeline's Mukandutiye's house that you could describe to the Court, or were your activities quite different on every day?
@WITNESS BUO: 
At Angeline Mukandutiye's we decide on a programme on a daily basis. We would prepare the programme to carry out, and at the end of the day we would brief her. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Generally speaking, what kind programme or programmes did you prepare? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. It was not really wholesome or positive programmes; actually, programmes towards conducting massacres. Since massacres were the order of the day, we did not realise that we were actually indulging in a programme of committing crimes which was punishable. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Whose idea was any particular massacre? Was it something -- was it a collective decision that you would go, as you said, "conduct massacres", or were there orders coming from any particular individuals? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, ma'am. There were people who had to give us orders, tell us what to do, and it was either Angeline or Renzaho. Setting-up operations were even carried out in their presence. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Talking of Renzaho, as at the 8th or 9th of April, how did you know Renzaho, if at all? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you. During that period, we did not realise that the situation was critical. But I got to know her after Habyarimana's death. However, even before that incident, I knew that he was the préfet of Kigali-ville, and it was not the first time I was seeing him. I had seen him, and I knew he was the préfet of Kigali-ville and I used to see him at Angeline Mukandutiye's place, and sometimes I saw him when he was present during the operations we were carrying out. I can give you specifics, if you want. And it was a "he", not a "she". 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall the first time that you saw Renzaho at Angeline's house after the 8th of April 1994?
@WITNESS BUO: 
I remember: It was on the 21st of April when they issued us with the weapons I have already mentioned. It was in 1994. He was accompanied by Major Laurent Munyakaze. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall the time of day that Renzaho and Munyakaze came to Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
In the forenoon. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how did they travel to her house, if you know? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
They came in a Presidential Guard vehicle. It was a pickup truck because I personally saw him. And I even mentioned this during Munyakaze's trial. I think even Renzaho himself can confirm that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall whether there was anyone else in the vehicle with Renzaho and Munyakaze? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I didn't see anyone else other than the driver and the members of escort. They too entered the compound of Angeline Mukandutiye's house. On that occasion, they spoke to us and we even did something. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But after they entered the compound, what did they do? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
They got inside and spoke with Angeline. When they came outside, Angeline asked us to go to the CELA centre. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You mentioned earlier the delivery of weapons, can you explain what you meant by that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The weapons they gave us were firearms, and those firearms were used. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall how many firearms were given to you? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
On that occasion, they gave us firearms, grenades, and ammunitions. They dropped the firearms and ammunitions in that room, which I mentioned. Only 12 firearms were taken from that room, and they were used, but I cannot tell you what happened to the other weapons. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You say that "they spoke to you". Who do you mean by "they"? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Angeline Mukandutiye, who asked us to go to CELA, when she told us that Laurent Munyakaze and Renzaho were present. So we went to that place. So I left last. If you want me to give you details regarding what happened at this place, I am ready to oblige you. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you clarify please whether you saw Renzaho yourself at Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I saw him with my own eyes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And was he present when Angeline Mukandutiye told you to go to CELA? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When Angeline Mukandutiye told us to go to CELA, Renzaho was present, just as he was present when we arrived at CELA. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did she tell you what to do at CELA? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We respected the order we had received to go to CELA. We did not have to argue with the people giving us the order, and I wrote down in writing what happened at CELA. If you wish, I can tell you about it. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Please do. But, first, could you tell us how far CELA was from Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Not far. Angeline Mukandutiye lived along the road passing below the cemetery, and the next road was that of the JOC centre. Angeline's house faced the two roads, so it was close by. The distance between the two was not long. I can even explain to you. If you go down to that area, then you can ascertain for yourself. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did everybody leave Angeline Mukandutiye's house -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the witness is continuing. 
@WITNESS BUO:
The CELA centre has a wall separating it from the JOC centre. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did everybody leave Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Some people had to leave, others had to stay. Those who had to leave, that is, those who had been assigned the work to be done at the CELA centre, left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what did you do? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When I finished distributing the weapons to my comrades, I left and went to CELA, and I'm even ready to tell you here what I did at CELA. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that you found Renzaho when you got to CELA. Where was he? More specifically, I mean. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Renzaho came to CELA twice. The first time he was in the vehicle with Munyakaze. That is where Major Patrice Bivamvagara joined them, and the persons who had refused to open the door were gunned down. ******************************************* a brand new white Toyota Corolla. When Bivamvagara arrived there and greeted them, they left immediately. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, to be entirely clear, can you try to tell this story more slowly. You say that Renzaho was in a vehicle with Munyakaze and that Major Bivamvagara joined them. Now, where were you at that time? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
By then I was already at the CELA centre. That is, I had already left Mukandutiye's house and I was already at CELA. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where within or without the CELA compound was Renzaho? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
You should make a difference between the two attacks, because that centre was attacked twice. During the first attack, he remained by the road. It was only during the second attack that he entered the centre premises. But, for now, I am still talking about the first attack. In due course, I will tell you of the second attack during which he entered the centre premises. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. Please can we focus on the first attack for the time being, Mr. Witness? 
You had said he didn't enter during the first attack. Can you recall how long he was present outside the CELA building? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I left Angeline's residence. I found them at that place. Then Major Bivamvagara arrived there and found them at that place where Renzaho was chatting with Munyakaze. Bivamvagara told us we had to go and take the vehicles which were at that centre. When the two gendarmes guarding the entrance to that centre wanted to put up a resistance, they were gunned down. So we entered, we looted the vehicles and left. During attack number 1, no one else was killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you remember whether Renzaho was present when the gendarmes were gunned down? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When those gendarmes were gunned down, Renzaho, Munyakaze and Bivamvagara, were actually present. The entire scene unravelled before their own eyes, because they were the ones who had just given us the authorisation to go and loot the vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what did you do with the vehicles once they had been taken from CELA? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We used the vehicles during our operations, either to ferry the victims to be killed or for the movement of Interahamwe during our operations. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And as far as you can recall, was it just your group of Interahamwe based at Angeline Mukandutiye's house that used the looted vehicle? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
In Rugenge secteur, there was no other group of Interahamwe apart from us, and we were working together with the gendarmes and the police officers of Kigali-ville préfecture office. There was no other group of Interahamwe operating within Rugenge secteur. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You may not be able to, but can you explain to the Court why the préfet, Renzaho and Munyakaze and Bivamvagara, would have been involved in the looting of these vehicles from CELA? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
In a nutshell, they had their set objective, which was met even after the looting of those vehicles. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what was that set objective? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Their set objective was for those vehicles to be used together with the weapons we had just been issued with in order to carry out the slaughter and extermination of the Tutsi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And why do you say that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I am relying on the fact that the weapons and vehicles were used only within the framework of the massacres. Those vehicles and weapons came in very handy in connection with the massacres.
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I was going to move on to the following incident. I wonder if this is an appropriate time to break? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will do that. 
Anything of a practical nature? Do you already know the witnesses for next week? Do you want to revert to it tomorrow morning? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, I have the list here and I am happy to read it. The order may change slightly, but, in theory, we have DBN, followed by BUX, then ACS, HAD, ATQ and AWE. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
If there is nothing else, we will then begin again tomorrow. 
And continue the proceedings, Mr. Witness, at 8:45. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.
$(Court adjourned at 1700H)

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, you said there was a second attack in which you participated at CELA on the 22nd of April. Now, I'd like you to tell the Court about that, please. But can you do so slowly? Can you start by telling us where you were on the morning of the 22nd of April? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you see the problem, Ms. Melluish? I am giving you the sign. In that speed you will see two checks. It is inevitable, so please learn. Thank you. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you get the question, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I understood the question. I was at Angeline Mukandituye's house. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was there anyone else at Angeline Mukandituye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, there was. There were my colleagues, the Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what were you doing? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
In the morning some were cleaning their weapons and others were undergoing training. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you yourself, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
*************************************************************************************************************
***********************************************************************************************. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And while you were doing this, did anyone else come to Angeline Mukandituye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, some people did come. Odette Nyirabagenzi arrived. The préfet of Kigali town, Tharcisse Renzaho, also arrived. They had come to provide us with new instructions and explain to us what we were to do. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, could you tell us, please, who is this Odette Nyirabagenzi? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Odette Nyirabagenzi was the conseiller for the Rugenge secteur. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And had you seen her before at Angeline Mukandituye's house, or was this the first time? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was not the first time that I would see her there. She was a friend of Angeline's, and they would visit one another. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you said that the préfet arrived, along with Odette Nyirabagenzi. Can you tell us how they travelled to Angeline Mukandituye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
They arrived in a car, in a vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And were they the only people in that vehicle, or were there others with them? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were also those who were in charge of the security of the préfet, as well as the driver. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when they arrived at the house, what did they do? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When they got to the house, they entered the house with Angeline, who was waiting for them on the veranda. They spoke in the house, and a few moments later they came out, and Angeline gave us instructions in the presence of Odette Nyirabagenzi and of Tharcisse Renzaho. She told us that we were to go to the CELA centre and that we would be told exactly what we were to do when we would be there. Mr. Renzaho, Tharcisse, was the one who said that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after you were told to go to CELA, what did these three people do? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The Interahamwe, the president, Claude, and his people went on board a vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about Tharcisse Renzaho, Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye? What did they do after you were given the instructions? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
They left at the same time as the Interahamwe and Claude, since the instructions had just been given. The instructions were to be complied with, because we had respect for our leaders. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what about you? What did you do after you heard those instructions? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I distributed the weapons very rapidly, and then I counted how many people were left at the location to ensure the security of our headquarters. Then I used the back door and I joined the others at the CELA centre. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall what weapons you distributed? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Since some people had received their weapons the previous day, I only distributed 12 firearms: One G3 I gave to Gasigwa, eight Kalashnikov rifles, and three R4s. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This preparatory meeting, Mr. Witness, lasted from when to when? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. The meeting did not last long. Renzaho arrived, he went into the house, and approximately 15 minutes later they came out of the house to give us the instructions. I believe this was planned beforehand. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When did people leave for CELA? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Between 8 and 9, but I must say I did not pay much attention to the time. I was, rather, paying attention to the instructions that were being given to us. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, when you got to CELA, what did you find there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When I arrived, the officials were in the courtyard of the CELA centre. They had come out of the building. I met Tutsi refugees who had sought refuge there and who were being taken out of the buildings. And we started setting aside the young men, women, and children. When I arrived there, I was not inactive. I helped the others sort out the refugees. So there were from 60 to 70 people. We beat them up, and Angeline forced us to make them board vehicles to go and kill them. So we beat them up and forced them into three vehicles in which they were packed, and we took them. I stayed on the site and I was in fact *************************************. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you say that you helped the others to sort out the refugees. Why did you do that? Did somebody instruct you to do it? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When I got there, I noted that that was what was being done, so I didn't want to remain inactive, whereas it was the instruction that had been given by the authorities. Claude, who was my leader, was there, and he was sorting people. And I was not to let him do that alone. I was to provide him with assistance. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And on what basis were you and the others sorting the people? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The criterion was as follows: Odette Nyirabagenzi knew there were people from her secteur. Angeline was a school inspector, and she also knew the inhabitants. The préfet himself knew the Rugenge secteur because he was there often. So they were the people who knew the people who were to be sorted. When the refugees were taken out, we were told to take X, Y, or Z, and we also chose the people who looked like Tutsi. There were no other sorting criteria. Those were the criteria we would use. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And who was it who was telling you to take X, Y, or Z? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were two people in particular who were very active. There was Odette and there was Angeline. They would tell us, in such-and-such's family, you should take X and Y. They were our neighbours, we knew them. When we would be told to take people from family X, Y, or Z, it was not difficult for us because we knew these people well before the events. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And while this was happening, where was Renzaho? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Renzaho was in the courtyard of CELA with the others. He did not remain in his vehicle at that time. And he left when we had already sorted the refugees and we had put a group of them in a vehicle. That was when he left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, do you recall how -- how long this whole process took, between your arriving at CELA and putting those first people into a vehicle? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Not much time elapsed. It took us from 40 to 50 minutes. Because once the -- the two people left, the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, Jean Bizimana, arrived, and somebody told him something. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you must help me to understand what you have just said about the sorting-out process. Did you first tell us that there were 60 to 70 Tutsi refugees there? Was that your evidence? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were more than 100 refugees, but we took a group of 60 to 70 people who were those who were to be killed. Otherwise there were more than 100 refugees, because after the abduction of the 60 or 70 people, there was another group that remained on the site. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you sorted out 60 to 70 persons, selecting them from the more than 100. That's what we have now heard. Is that true? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, these more than 100, were they all Tutsi, or were they not? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
In general, those who would go and seek refuge had a good reason to do so. Most of them were Tutsis who had left their places of residence, and they were our neighbours. We knew them. Why would have a Hutu gone and sought refuge there when nobody was hunting him down, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Exactly. And that's why we need to understand the criteria for the selection. Because here you have more than 100 that, in principle, should seem to fall within the group to be killed, and still only 60 to 70 were sorted out. Why this 60 to 70? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Odette and Mukandituye were the ones who decided that we should act in that manner. There were some people who were more wanted than others, and there were people who we did not find at the CELA centre who were at the Saint Paul centre. I believe I will have ample time to talk about this, because it's going to be a very long story. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you simply followed instructions as to whom to pick? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
That is correct. We were to comply with the instructions that were given to us, and that is what we did. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Of those 60 to 70, can you recall roughly how many were men, women, old, young, children; what sort of make-up did these people have? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Following the instructions given, we did not pay much attention to women and children. We were more interested in men and young men, because they were for -- according to us, the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi who had attacked the country. Most of those we took were men and young boys. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you said that these were 60 to 70 people that were selected to be killed. At what stage did you realise that that was going to be their fate? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was decided on the spot that the people were to be selected and driven somewhere and killed. We were told that we were to take them to the place called CND, and we knew what such letters meant, CND. And it was done; there is evidence to that effect. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And who was it who told you to take them to CND? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was Angeline Mukandituye who told us to do that. This place called CND exists. It is well known. And the people who were killed and buried at that location were -- were later on exhumed and buried in dignity in Gisozi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall where Renzaho was when you were given the instructions to take these people to CND? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When we were instructed to take these people to CND, Angeline Mukandituye was with Renzaho, Tharcisse, when the order was given. So Renzaho was present. Renzaho left after the instructions were given. It was something that had been planned -- rather, that had been discussed beforehand. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when that instruction was given by Angeline, where were you? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I was there. She called Claude. I also came near, and she gave the instruction to myself as well as to Claude, and we went to inform other Interahamwes, such as Castar, Mishimana (phonetic), Michel, and other Interahamwe. If you wish to have the names of all the Interahamwe, I can give them to you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's recapitulate the entire name of Michel. Shall we do that? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I believe the name was Mishimana, or that's what I heard. But I thought we heard Castar, which is on the list, and then the name "Mishimana". Perhaps the witness can confirm the names that he gave. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Let me repeat the names. There are many names I mentioned, but let me give you those of the ones that were considered as being the most important: Gasigwa; Fidèle Habimana, also known as Castar. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, all we want you to do now is to repeat the names you gave in your previous answer. We just need the spelling of those names, or at least clarity. Can you repeat them again, please? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There is Michel Nkeshimana, Gasigwa, and Habimana, Castar. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour was correct. It was Michel. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, how many vehicles did it take for these 60 or 70 people to be taken away from the CELA site? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Well, it was not difficult to take them. We only used three vehicles. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What kind of vehicles were they, if you can remember? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There was one minibus, Hiace, red in colour, and I even remember who was driving the vehicle. His name was Lambert, son of Mucakari. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you give us that last name again, please? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Lambert, son of Léon Mucakari. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, Lambert is probably L-A-M-B-E-R-T. 
Are you good at spelling, Mr. Witness, or shall we ask the Kinyarwandan booth to help us with these names? What's your preference? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Have no fear, I believe I can spell out the name "Mucakari". 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. So let's now hear the second name that was Léon M-U-S-H-A-K-A-L-I; is that true? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, that is not it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So what is the right version, then, please? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
M-U-C-A-K-A-R-I. Mucakari. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then we need help with Gasigwa. He's not on our spelling list and he was not spelt yesterday. Can you help us with him? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Gasigwa is spelt G-A-S-I-G-W-A. Gasigwa. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you so much. And could you kindly now, whenever you introduce a new name which has not been mentioned in the courtroom before, help us with the spelling. And then we will make headway. Here comes the next question. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Besides the minibus, what other vehicles were there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There was a double-cabin Toyota driven by one Rurangwa who hails from Rutongo, and he was our driver. Let me spell out the name Rurangwa. R-U-R-A-N-G-W-A. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, that's very helpful, Mr. Witness, if you do that. 
Now, are you aware whether the people who were loaded on to these vehicles knew, at that time, what was going to happen to them? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Some of them got to know what would happen. If someone starts beating you up and that person has a weapon, and if you know the reason why you went to seek refuge at that location, you can understand. They knew that their Tutsi compatriots had been killed, and I can give you examples. And if the Accused in this trial disagrees with me, I can give a number of examples, all those who say that they knew what would be their fate. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When the vehicles left CELA, did you go with them or did you remain at CELA yourself, or go elsewhere? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, Claude was the one who left with the vehicles. I was supposed to stay on the site to make sure that we had carried out the task that had been entrusted to us. So I stayed at CELA and I left CELA on foot. And I can tell you what occurred there after the vehicles departed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Please do tell us what occurred there after the vehicles departed. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Once the vehicles left and the officials also, such as Renzaho, left, the former bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune, Jean Bizimana, arrived. He had come to see whether what was to be done at that location had been done. He was well aware of what was to be done. The wife of one Charles Rwanga, who had been abducted and whose name is Rose Murorunkwere, put a question to Bizimana: "Where did you take our husbands?" Bizimana did not answer, remained mum, and a few moments later he went -- he left. Rose is still alive, and if you call her to testify, as you did for me, she can vouch for this story. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Those names are on the list, numbers 242 and 167. 
Did anything else happen at CELA before you left? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, nothing in particular. I simply tried to check whether the instruction had been complied with. I went to CND on foot, and if you want to know what I saw on my way to CND, I can tell you what I saw. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why did you say the "former bourgmestre, Jean Bizimana"? Do we agree that he was bourgmestre in April '94? 
@WITNESS BUO:
The one who was bourgmestre from April until the time when we fled the country, that was him. I said the "former bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune" because he no longer is today. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's what you meant by "former". Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Firstly, Mr. Witness, can you tell us how long it took for you to travel from CELA to the place called CND? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Since some people were killed on the way, around 15 people, it took me 15 minutes to cover the distance between CELA and CND. The CELA centre is next to the JOC. If some of you are not familiar with the -- with the location, I can give you some explanations so that you will be able to place the different locations on a map. The CND is not far from the Nyarugenge (sic) secteur office -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Rugenge secteur office, correction. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Why did it take you longer to get to CND because some people were killed? Can you explain what you mean by that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It took me a while because some people were taken out of the vehicles and shot down. I knew some of them. I can give you their names and those of their families. Since I was walking, I had weapons. So I was not worried, and that is the reason for which it took me so long to reach the CND. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you yourself see these people being killed? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, I did not see them die with my own eyes, but I saw the dead bodies of some of them and I knew that they had been put on board the vehicles. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you mentioned that you knew some of these people, or you recognised them. Can you tell us who you recognised? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Let me give you their names. There was Charles Rwanga. There was Déglote Rwanga, son of Rwanga. There was Albert, who was a driver at ORINFOR and who was a karate instructor at the JOC. He even trained me. There were two of Mr. Pierre Sebushishi's children, who was conseiller of the Rugenge secteur, and who was replaced by Odette Nyirabagenzi. As for the others, I did not know them. But since the people I just listed were neighbours of mine, I was able to recognise the bodies. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Numbers 242 and 243 and 256. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know why a gentleman called Charles Rwanga was targeted? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes. Charles Rwanga was a member of the RPF in Rugenge. That was well known. He was killed by Nkeshimana, because the son of Charles Rwanga, called Yacinthe, was also killed in a specific place. This son of Rwanga had problems with Nkeshimana. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Nkeshimana is 183, and the other name mentioned is Yacinthe at 246. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, what about Albert, the driver for ORINFOR? Do you know why he was a target? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Albert was being sought, first of all, because he's a Tutsi. Another reason is that he refused to teach some of my Interahamwe colleagues, and that is why he was killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And the children of Pierre Sebushishi, do you know why they -- or, that family would have been a target? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Very easy. Sebushishi was well known and he was very sought after. At one point in time, they threw a grenade into his house, and the wife lost one leg. At one point in time, Renzaho dismiss (sic) him from his position. So it is not surprising that his children were killed. Even the wife was killed later on. The wife is called Marianne and was killed by one Fidèle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But was there anything particular about him that meant either that he'd been dismissed or that he was sought after? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Sebushishi could not bear injustice. Secondly, he was opposed to members of the MRND, and the préfet could not support him because Odette Nyirabagenzi was a member of the MRND. I know everything that happened because I am also from the Rugenge secteur. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell the Court, please, how these people had been killed? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It is sad, but I will tell you all the same, because what we are interested in is the truth. All those people were killed by bullets. None of them was killed with a machete or a knife. But there are other people who threw themselves into the pit before they were killed, because they did not want to be killed by bullet. And after all of them were put in the pit, they threw a grenade into it because -- so as to ensure that even those alive can be killed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was Marianne killed by Fidèle Habimana or some other Fidèle? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It is Fidèle Habimana, alias Castar. Castar is a nickname he gave himself, but his real name is Fidèle Habimana. And he is the one who shot Marianne, the wife of Sebushishi. He kill her in her house. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I wonder if the witness can be given Exhibit P. 6 -- actually, perhaps, the third book of P. 6, if that could be extracted. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you have that book now, Mr. Witness? Could you please turn to the photo numbered 08. The photographs are numbered underneath them. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
(No interpretation) 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Could you just hold that picture up so we can see whether we're all looking at the same photograph, please. Thank you, yes. 
Mr. Witness, do you recognise what is shown in this photograph at all? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, I do recognise what can be seen on this photograph. This is Straton Iyaremye's house. That was the place that was known as CND, and it is next to the Rugenge secteur office. I can show you the place, because I know it quite well. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
That name, Iyaremye, Straton, is at number 85 on the list. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the first name was S-T-R-A-T-O-N. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Looking at this photograph, has this building changed since April 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I see that there are doors and windows that were added, but otherwise I do recognise the house. I know it well. But I note that doors and windows were added, and I see children who seem to be schoolchildren, but it is indeed the same house. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know why there were no doors and windows in April 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was a house that was being built. It was not inhabited. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you said that this was the place where people were killed. Where were the bodies put? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The bodies were put in a pit which was inside the house, and the others were put in two other pits which were outside. One of the pits was close to the place where you could see the children. But inside the house, there was a bigger pit, and it was into that pit that they put many of the bodies. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know why the house of a gentleman called Straton Iyaremye was used as a place to put bodies? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Straton Iyaremye was not on good terms with Nyirabagenzi and Angeline -- Mukandituye, Angeline. But subsequently, Straton Iyaremye was also killed. His wife was called Régine Kandege, and I know that family very well. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you spell that last name for us, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I think it was, rather, Régine Kandege. Kandege is K-A-N-D-E-G-E. Let me repeat. It's K-A-N-D-E-G-E. Kandege, Régine. I believe you can spell Régine, the first name. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you said that you left CELA sometime after the refugees who were taken in the vehicles. When you arrived at CND, what did you find there, if anything? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When I got to the CND, I saw that some people were being shot and their bodies were being put in the pit. There were some people who were jumping into the pit by themselves so as to avoid being shot. After that, a grenade was thrown into the pit to ensure that everybody was killed. I saw that with my own eyes. I got there at the time they were shooting the last victim. This operation was concluded in the afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Were all 60-70 killed? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
They were all killed. The pit was fairly large; nobody was able to escape. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that some people were shot and then their bodies were thrown into the pit. Where were they being shot, do you know? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was close to that pit at the CND, at Straton's place. And when I got there, they were shooting the last person. And I was able to see that two persons jumped into the pit themselves before they were able to shoot them. I was standing at that place when the attackers were shooting the people. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Which pit was it that the people were thrown into, or jumped into? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
This is in the pit which was within the house. I was able to see that there was a portion of about ten metres which was not occupied by bodies. It was a fairly large pit. Very large pit. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you describe the pit in a little more detail? How big was the opening at the top of the pit, roughly? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I have just explained to you that from where -- from where the bodies, the pile of bodies stopped, there was ten metres on -- above it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is different, Mr. Witness. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Mr. Witness, I'm simply asking that, at the top of the pit, how big was the hole? How -- how wide was it, for example? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I'm sorry, I thought you were referring to the depth of the pit. I would say that the -- the pit was quite large. It was not narrow. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You want precision here? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. I don't think -- I'm not sure that we'll get it easily. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that -- I believe you said that this process of killing people and putting their bodies into a pit took until about 3 p.m.; is that correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, the attackers took all the time they required, and all that was concluded around 1500 hours, which you referred to. I even have some other evidence which I have not given here. If there are people who are challenging what I am saying, I am ready to give other evidence. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you explain why this process took such a long time? Because you went to CELA in the morning, you said, around about 9 o'clock. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
First of all, we sorted out these people. We picked them up and put them on the vehicle. And then finally we killed them. So you'll understand that it took a lot -- a lot of time. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you had finished, how did you and your fellow Interahamwe feel that your work had been done? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We realised that we had accomplished our task because we had killed those people. And then we went to Angeline and Kandege, where our headquarters was located, to tell them that we had accomplished the task that was entrusted to us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, let us backtrack a little bit. I do not know whether this really has any legal significance, but coming back to the pit, the width of the pit. Would you say that it was wider than the distance between you and me? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, the dimension is less than the distance between the President and myself. The width would be about the same distance as -- that same distance as the distance between me and these people who are directly in front of me. But this pit is still there, and if you are interested it can be shown to you at the site. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
According to the courtroom measurements, the distance between the witness to be registry table in front of the witness is 2 metres and 30 centimetres. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, do you know a place called Saint Paul centre? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I know all those places, and I know what happened there. I participated in the things that happened in those places. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were you involved in attacks at Saint Paul centre? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, several attacks were launched against the Saint Paul centre, and I believe in my statement I specifically referred to two attacks -- which Tharcisse Renzaho participated in. If -- well, I referred to the two most important attacks, but if you are interested I can talk to you about the other attacks which are less important. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
For the time being, Mr. Witness, can we focus on the first of those two most important attacks. Can you tell us, if you know, when it took place? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The first attack was carried out in May, and the last one was carried out when the Inkotanyi came to rescue the Tutsi who were at the Sainte Famille parish and the Saint Paul centre. I think it is easy to determine the date of this last attack because this is something that -- an event that is well known. The first attack was carried out using the excuse of communal work. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And could you tell us, please, what happened? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were some Tutsis that we could not find in the houses, and we learnt that they were at the Saint Paul centre. Others were at the CELA centre, and some at the Sainte Famille parish. We therefore launched this attack using the pretext that they were Inkotanyi who were shooting us -- the Inyenzi who were shooting us at night. We just wanted to get the Tutsi who had escaped from us. We went there with some inhabitants. It is well known, and you can -- it is well known in the Nyarugenge secteur. You can investigate on it. People will tell you what happened. 
So we got to the Saint Paul centre and we asked the refugees to get out of the buildings. Some of the persons who were at the Saint Paul centre are still alive. I can give you their names, and I'm sure they will tell you what happened. We got these people out and killed some of them. The others remained there. There were a lot of refugees at that place. Some were natives of Rugenge, and others came from other localities. We therefore selected those who were on our list, those that we wanted to kill. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, you said that Tharcisse Renzaho was involved in this attack. How was that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Angeline and Odette were not in agreement on the number of people to be killed. And because they were not in agreement, Renzaho intervened. He came to the place and Angeline and Odette asked -- went to him and asked him what was to be done. Renzaho had a sheet of paper in his hands which was similar to the one Mukandituye was holding. So they came back and said that only those persons whose names were on the list were to be arrested. So these were Emmanuel Rukundo, Aristarque, and one Mazimpaka. I have just recalled one more person that I did not talk about. His -- that person was called Zorro. Zorro was the brother of Régine. I have just remembered this fourth person. I did not mention him in my statement. 
MS. MELLUISH:
The name "Emmanuel Rukundo" is at 229 on the list, and Mazimpaka at 134. Zorro is not on the list. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I know his name does not appear on the list, because it is only now that I remembered that he, too, was abducted during the first attack. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So maybe you could spell that name, or nickname? Is it Zorro like the person in the books, Z-O-R-R-O? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, I believe that is the correct spelling. That is how we knew him. He had a sister called Régine who lived close to the small market in the Rugenge secteur. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But then you also mentioned a third name, and phonetically it sounded like "Istark". Can you help us? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Aristarque, I believe you should know how to spell that. I also referred to a young man called Mazimpaka. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mazimpaka was easy, Mr. Witness, because we have that on our list. But can you help us with the name I asked you to spell? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I believe you can look for the spelling yourself, and I should think that his name should be on the list. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Aristarque is spelt A-R-I-S-T-A-R-Q-U-E. That's from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much to the booth.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, I would like you again to tell this story a little more slowly, please. Tell us, if you can, what time of day it was when you first were aware that an attack was going to take place at Saint Paul's centre? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I got to know in the morning, but I cannot recall the date nor the exact time. That morning, Angeline told us that those people have escaped from us, and we know that they're at the Saint Paul centre. And the only thing to do was to claim that there are people who fire at us at the roadblock in the night. And then we'll say that there are some Inyenzis wielding weapons and hiding at the Saint Paul centre. That is what we told the people who were there to allow us to go and fetch those people. But we knew what we were doing. We had agreed with Angeline in the morning during our meeting. 
We, therefore, had to call on some inhabitants and told them that there were some bush close to the Saint Paul centre and the CELA centre, and that all the bush had to be cut down and to be wielded off so that the Inyenzi would not hide in there. So that is all we told them -- we told them, but we knew that we were going to fetch these people and kill them. So the communal work took place. 
I have one piece of evidence that I do know to give to you today. I can give you the names of the other authorities who can confirm to you that this communal work did take place. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, I'm not sure that we need that, Mr. Witness. Could you tell us, if you can remember, what time you yourself went to Saint Paul centre that day? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was in the morning, Fidèle went to fetch some members of the population from their residence. Let me give you one piece of evidence. I will keep the rest for other occasions. He is the one who went for the leader called Narcisse Nzamwita. He's in prison in Kigali and he pleaded guilty. I testified against him and he asked to be pardoned. I would not give all the evidence I have, so that the accused cannot make use of them. But I came here to tell the truth and the whole truth. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm afraid you're going to have to help us by spelling the name that you gave please, Mr. Witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Only the last name, please. 
@WITNESS BUO:
Yego, N-Z-A-M-W-I-T-A, Nzamwita. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So in the morning, Fidèle went to get some members of the population. What did you do? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
After having given instructions, we let the others look for members of the population. (By order of the Court, the following portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover) we had approximately 110 Interahamwe. I was to go to Saint Paul to see whether the Interahamwe would arrive in time for us to be able to do our work. We had enough weapons. We had a vehicle and it was not difficult. So it was Fidèle Ngamije who went to get the members of the population to assist us in this operation. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I wonder if the sentence beginning (By order of the Court, the following portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover) could be extracted from the record? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we'll do that. The words from "when" until "we" will be placed under separate cover. Video booth, please do not transmit that. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Having collected together members of the population can you estimate how many people -- Interahamwe and those members of the population went to Saint Paul that morning? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were many people. I would be hard pressed to tell you how many exactly. Some of the acts that were committed at that location -- I can tell you about those who survived the attack and those who were killed. I promised I would provide evidence on what was done. If the Accused accepts what was done -- very well, but if he does not agree, then I'm ready to provide evidence to show that he is not telling the truth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have lack of clarity in connection with Fidèle. Did you refer to one or two persons in connection with Fidèle leaving to get members of the population to assist you? 
@WITNESS BUO:
I talked about Fidèle and of Ngamije. I also mentioned the name of Narcisse Nzamwita because he was in charge of the Bwahirimba cellule. It was Fidèle who went to fetch Nzamwita. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And, you see, we have identified some Fidèles here, and we know Castar, but now the last name of the Fidèle you just referred to, can you spell that, please? 
@WITNESS BUO:
I talked about Ngamije. So there was Fidèle and there was Ngamige. Those are the two different individuals. Ngamige was an Interahamwe and Fidèle Habimana also known as Castar was also an Interahamwe. It was Fidèle who went to get Nzamwita to take him to the Saint Paul centre. I believe that is clear. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you know we receive your testimony through two languages, Mr. Witness, and we have to make sure that there is consistency in the courtroom. So if you would now, and I'm asking you for the third time, kindly spell that name? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Yes, N-D-A-M-I-J-E, Ndamije. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, when you arrived at Saint Paul's, what did you find there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When we arrived at Saint Paul, we had to take the people who were in the Saint Paul building out. I shall give you the name of the person who sorted them, and who plead guilty to such charges and begged for forgiveness. I mentioned him amongst the Interahamwe **************************************, his name was Charles Ntaganda. He is detained at the Kigali central prison and he pled guilty to such charges. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Charles is easy and now the last name, the spelling, please? 
@WITNESS BUO:
N-T-A-G-A-N-D-A, Ntaganda. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you have kindly agreed to assist us with the spelling and we have developed a good routine for that. Now I'm asking you to do something else: Please do not come up with all these names until the Prosecution asks you to do so, we may not need them. 
Next question, please. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Why did you have to take people out of the Saint Paul building? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I gave you the reason for which we were to take them out of the building. It was because there were people we were looking for in order to go and kill them -- and, indeed, we arrested them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Whose idea was it to take them out? Was this an instruction you were given or did it just come instinctively to you? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandutiye who had decided that this should be done while we were at Angeline's place. And the idea had come up because there were people who had escaped us and we were wondering how we could locate them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How did you sort the people out? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Their houses were well known. Most of them were our neighbours. There was no secret in the Rugenge secteur. Besides, we knew where the Tutsis lived, so it was not difficult -- and to confirm what I'm stating, there was one Tutsi who survived this attack. I put him on the side -- he is still alive, and if you wish to hear him, I am sure that he will be able to answer your question just as I did. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you confirm how many people you were specifically sent to look for at Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When we went to Saint Paul, there were 50 of us. The others had remained to man the roadblocks to make sure that the Inyenzis would not infiltrate our secteur. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Sorry, you may not have understood my question. I was trying to ask you how many people -- how many of the refugees at Saint Paul you were sent to find? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were Tutsis who had escaped us, but we were looking more specifically for Emmanuel Rukundo and Aristarque and that because Emmanuel Rukundo had very bad relations with Odette Nyirabagenzi because they belonged to different political parties. Rukundo, Emmanuel was from PSD; Mukandutiye and Nyirabagenzi were members of the MRND. And slightly before the genocide, their relations between these two women and Emmanuel Rukundo were quite tense. And Rukundo, Emmanuel had very good relations with Sebushishi; that was the reason why we were asked to spare no effort to find Emmanuel Rukundo for him to be killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now you mentioned earlier that these two ladies had lists with them, is that correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you yourself see those lists? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I saw one list that Mukandutiye was holding in her hand and I gave you the names of those I was able to recognise on the list. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you remember in total how many names there were on the list? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I looked at that list, but I did not really pay attention to the number of people who were on the list. When we carried out that operation, the leaders were there and they told us, "Now we can leave". 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at that time, when they told you you can leave -- or they can leave, had Renzaho appeared or not yet? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When we were asked to stop and to leave, Renzaho had already settled the conflict between the two women and he had already left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So at what point did you first see Renzaho? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Renzaho arrived around 11; that was when he arrived there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how did he arrive at Saint Paul? How did he travel to Saint Paul, if you know? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When he arrived at Saint Paul, he had parked his car a bit higher up the road and he came on foot. He came and he discussed with the -- these two persons and then he left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And for approximately how long was he present at Saint Paul that day? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He did not remain there long, around ten minutes and then he left. What was important is that he had just made a decision as to what was to be done, and that there was an understanding. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, we'll come on to the conflict that you talked about and you said that he resolved in a moment. But first, can you tell us where you were in relation to Renzaho when he arrived? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Since it was Mukandutiye, who was a very important person, I was next to her. Odette and Renzaho were standing together and I was next to Angeline, ***********************************************************. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you recall any conversation between these people? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The two ladies went next to Renzaho and I stayed with my group. After Renzaho told them what they were to do, they came back towards me and -- towards us and gave us instructions which we were to comply with. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How do you know that there was any conflict between Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandutiye? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I got to know that there was such a conflict because Odette Nyirabagenzi wanted everyone to be -- all of those who were at Saint Paul to be killed and she was angry. Whereas Mukandutiye was saying, "Well, we agreed on what was to be done from the outset." And since there was that conflict, the préfet came and made the two women agree. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what were the instructions that you were then given? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Angeline told us that we were to implement the instructions given to us and that we were to look out -- to look for those who were on the list she had given to us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So is it correct that the conflict was resolved in the favour of Angeline? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
That was the case. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
May I ask, Mr. Witness, do you know how Mr. Renzaho got to know that there was a conflict between those ladies? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Renzaho worked with the -- these women, and on specific occasions, Mukandutiye would call Renzaho on the telephone and would converse with him. And sometimes she would tell us, "Renzaho asked me to tell you to do this or that", and we would not hesitate to implement or comply with whatever was requested from us. So I can tell you without any hesitation that Renzaho was aware of what the two ladies wished to do. 
Your Honours, I shall give you sufficient evidence and I hope you will be satisfied. I shall refer to the relations between all these people, and I will explain to you why we did what we did. And before I leave this courtroom, I am convinced that you will be satisfied. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, if Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandutiye had a conflict at the Saint Paul centre, how can you explain, if at all, how did Renzaho get to know about that so as to be able to come to Saint Paul and sort it out? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We were asked to go to Saint Paul. At Angeline's place, there was a telephone. If when we left, Angeline called Renzaho -- well, that's a possibility. But I'm not aware of that, I was -- I'm not supposed to know what she was doing. She was our superior and she had different ways of contacting the main person in charge -- and that was Renzaho. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. After the dispute between the ladies had been resolved, did Renzaho leave immediately or did he stay for any length of time? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Renzaho left immediately thereafter. He stayed for a long time during the second attack. But on that occasion of the first attack, he left immediately because he had just resolved the conflict. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after he left, what did you do? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
After he left, we implemented a plan that was well known and we all knew what we had to do. All I did was to comply with the instructions that were given to me. I could not not implement such instructions that were given to us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Mr. Witness, it may seem very obvious to you what you then did, but could you please tell the Court? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I told you that some Tutsis were arrested -- among which Emmanuel Rukundo, who was put on board the vehicle of Faustin, who was the owner of the bar called Las Vegas. Some people were killed on the way and the dead bodies were seen by everyone. And the bodies were loaded in a truck belonging to a gentleman who worked at MINITRAP. And there's a piece of evidence that I shall keep for other opportunities regarding the name of that driver. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
In total, how many of the Tutsis were arrested as you've described it? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Since there were many people, I must say that I did not count the people who were there. There were many people. And the person we were the most interested in was Emmanuel Rukundo. As for the others, it was of no importance since the objective was to arrest Emmanuel Rukundo. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How did you take this group of people away from Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I am getting tired. We had firearms, we had vehicles. Renzaho had given us vehicles; we were not to go on foot. We had enough vehicles -- those that had been made available to us by Renzaho, as well as those we had looted. We no longer needed the assistance of anybody because there were many of us and we had equipment. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where did you take the people to? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We killed them on the way from Saint Paul all the way to the toll gate, the small markets, to Las Vegas. There were bodies everywhere. And if you were to interview the survivors or even other people who were not being sought, they will tell you that bodies were all over the place, like sorghum -- like sorghum plants. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you kill them on the way to a specific destination? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I told you that the person we were looking for, we put him on board the vehicle which was driven by Jean-Baptiste Kalimuda. And we went round the Rugenge secteur announcing to everybody that we'd found Emmanuel Rukundo, and we took him to his house. And that is where we killed him, together with Aristarque, and we buried the two bodies at that place. Subsequently, those two bodies were exhumed, but at the time, that is where we buried them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have the last name of Jean-Baptiste in both languages. 
@WITNESS BUO:
You can spell Jean-Baptiste, so I'll give you Kalimuda. K-A-L-I-M-U-D-A. Kalimuda. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where was Angeline at this time when you were killing the people removed from Saint Paul, do you know? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Angeline was very happy because we had arrested Rukundo. She went home because the mission had been accomplished. You've heard about -- you've heard talk about Angeline, but you don't know him -- you don't know her. We considered her as an officer, and we gave her the rank of a major. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You killed Emmanuel Rukundo together with whom? What was the name of the other person that was killed? 
@WITNESS BUO:
It was Aristarque, he is the one that we killed, together with Rukundo, in Rukundo's house.

And that is the same person whose name that we spelt previously, true? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Yes, it is the same person.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Forgive me, Witness, if I've asked you or you've given this evidence before, but can you tell us please what was the profession of Emmanuel Rukundo? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
What I know is that Emmanuel Rukundo had a company called APROMAPRWA. It was a driving school. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to spell the name of that school? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It is a French acronym, A-P-R-O-M-A-P-R-W-A. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. And, do you know why he was so sought after? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I've explained this to you previously. He was not on good terms with those women and they did not belong to the same party. Besides he's a great friend of Sebushishi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Mr. Witness, do you know of a person called André Kameya?

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall when this was? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
That could well be in April or May of 1994. We brought him out of the Sainte Famille church. Let me give you the names of those who abducted him from that place -- if you want? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you need that, Prosecution? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Please don't give us the name at this stage, Mr. Witness, could you simply tell us how many of you there were? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
When we went to fetch him, some of us were already in the Sainte Famille church. And another person came with a vehicle to take Mr. Kameya away. We normally would go to the Sainte Famille church each time we wanted to ...
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You would go to Sainte Famille church each time you wanted to -- what? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Each time we wanted to go and fetch people from the Sainte Famille church and kill them, we did so. At the Sainte Famille church, there were Hutu as well as Tutsi refugees. The Hutu refugees were in the compound of the church and they were carrying weapons. They had firearms, which were given to them by Tharcisse Renzaho. And there were Tutsi refugees who were inside the church building. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, when were you first made aware that Mr. Kameya was being sought? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I got to know when Michel came to the church building with the photograph of Mr. Kameya, and he went all over the place saying that we should look for that person. May I proceed? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asks the witness. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Please wait a moment. Before Michel came to the Sainte Famille church, what were you doing there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We were inside the church building where the Tutsi refugees were. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what were you doing inside the church building where the Tutsis refugees were? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I have told you that sometimes we'll go and select from among the Tutsis who have survived -- who had survived; that is what we were doing at that time. We had not gone to visit them. In a way, it was a reconnaissance visit which we were carrying out at the time. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how many of you were there before Michel arrived? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I was with ten persons -- I went there with a team of ten people. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when Michel arrived, did he arrive on his own or with anyone else? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Michel came with Odette Nyirabagenzi in Odette Nyirabagenzi's vehicle. We came aboard other vehicles. They found us there. And when Michel came, he told us that one André Kameya had to be found. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at that time, did you know André Kameya was? Was it a name that you recognised or not? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, it was Michel who gave me that name and then he showed me the photograph. And I asked him who asked him to look for Mr. Kameya, and he told me that he came with Odette. So, we had to look for Mr. Kameya and when we found him, I wanted to know to whom he was finally entrusted. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where did you find Mr. Kameya? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
In the church building. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was he hiding or was he just amongst the other refugees? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He was among the other refugees. In fact, all the Tutsi refugees were hiding; some were there praying. But it was a hiding place for them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was it easy to find Mr. Kameya once you'd been shown his photograph? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We found him. Sometimes when we could -- we were not able to find someone, we'll get the refugees to -- we'll send the refugees out, beat them until we find the person we are looking for. So finally, Kameya was found. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that when you found him you wanted to find out to whom he would be finally entrusted. Did you find that out? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, we entrusted him to Madam Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you speak to Odette Nyirabagenzi on that occasion? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, I spoke to her. She was in the car. She was holding a sheet of paper and on that sheet of paper there was a signature of Tharcisse Renzaho, the name of -- and the name of Tharcisse Renzaho. Kameya climbed aboard that vehicle and we took him away. Since the objective was to kill people, I immediately understood what was going to be done, and I did not seek to know anymore because I had just seen to whom Mr. Kameya had been entrusted. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You mentioned a sheet of paper. Did Odette Nyirabagenzi show that to you? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
She was holding it and showed it to me. I have just told you that I saw the name of Tharcisse Renzaho written at the bottom of the page, together with his signature. So I'm sure it is Tharcisse Renzaho who gave her that sheet of paper, and that is why she came to look for Mr. Kameya at the church building. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall why she showed you that piece of paper? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I went out to see to whom Mr. Kameya was to be given, and I found her outside with the piece of paper. She was reading it -- and she didn't hide it from me. And that is how I saw the name and signature of Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho. And on that piece of paper, there was Mr. Kameya's name and at the bottom of the page, there was the name of Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho and his signature -- it was clear. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was only Kameya's name on that page, apart from Mr. Renzaho's name, or were there also other names? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Thank you, Mr. President. It was a document on which there was Mr. Kameya's name, and at the bottom of the page, there was Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho's name and signature. I was not able to see other names. I only saw Mr. Kameya's name and some other writings. I was not able to read the content of the document. I just followed the instructions of our leader, Odette Nyirabagenzi, who asked us to give her Mr. Kameya. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was the document handwritten or typed-written? 
@WITNESS BUO:
It was a handwritten document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you have any idea why Mr. Kameya was so important? 
@WITNESS BUO:
I did not ask my chief -- my leader that question, but I assumed that she knew that person. And I assumed that the purpose for looking for him was to kill him. And I did not dare ask my leader why we were looking for Mr. Kameya. I could only hand over to her the person who was being sought. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you ever find out what happened to André Kameya after he was taken from Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I did not see him again. And besides, I could not ask my leader where he was taken. Up until today, I did not see Mr. Kameya again. I don't know if you know where he is, or if the person who signed the document authorising his arrest knows where he is. But I did not see him again. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But when I first asked you whether you knew this gentleman, you said that he was dead. Is that just an assumption you made, or do you know that for a fact? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I have told you what happened to people who were arrested -- Tutsis who were taken from among other Tutsis. We killed them. We don't put them in prison. If that person were put in prison, we would have seen him again. So, that person could not have been hidden. He was killed. And, they were buried at sites which are well known. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you did not see him being killed, is that the evidence? 
@WITNESS BUO:
No, I did not see his killing. But I know that the person who took him away was a killer -- just as my -- myself, because she is the one who instructed me to kill other persons. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I'm about to move on to a new area. I wonder if we could break a little early today? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How much is left? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Probably another hour or 45 minutes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to stop at 1 o'clock today because of a meeting, so we will then adjourn now for about 25 minutes and then continue again until 1 o'clock. 
The Court is adjourned.

$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, -- Mr. Witness you told us earlier that you were involved in a second attack on Saint Paul at which Renzaho was present, and you said that Renzaho was present for a longer time than at the one that you've already described for us. This second incident, could you tell the Court, if you can, when it took place? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you do that, Mr. Witness, I just want to place on record that this break was longer than anticipated. And the reason for that was that there were a few unexpected problems that popped up and had to be solved. 
And now the answer. 
@WITNESS BUO:
I thank you, Mr. President. Regarding the question that was just put to me, I was listening to what the president was saying, and I would like to crave the indulgence of the Prosecutor and ask her to repeat the question to me. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Of course. You mentioned a second attack at Saint Paul in which you were involved, and at which Renzaho was involved or was present. And you said that at the second attack, Renzaho was there for much longer than the previous one you've described to us. This second attack, when did it take place? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you. The second attack -- perhaps you can look at the press at the time to know at what point there was the attack of the Inkotanyi on Saint Paul and Sainte Famille. That was written in the press, and you can see that. I remember that it was in the month of June, but I cannot give you an exact date. As you know, that was a long time ago, and I cannot recall the exact date. I can tell you what happened during the night and the following day of the attack. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's quite normal, Mr. Witness. Do you recall whether it was the beginning, the middle, or the end of that month? 
@WITNESS BUO:
I believe it was the last attack that we launched against the Tutsi, and it was a large-scale attack. I told you that it was in June. Perhaps you can look at the press at the time. I believe I saw a newspaper when I was in prison, but I did not pay attention to it. I did not read it. But I shall refer you to the archives, because I do not remember the date. But if you go to the archives, you'll know exactly when the Inkotanyi launched an attack against Saint Paul and Sainte Famille. And our purpose was to avenge ourselves from the Inkotanyi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We've understood that, Mr. Witness. You see, there is other evidence in this case. Now we only want your explanation. We're making now a last attempt. Can you simply recall whether it was the first half or the second half of June? And if you do not remember, just tell us, and we'll move on. 
@WITNESS BUO:
I believe it was in early June. I do not recall the date. But it was in June. If we want to provide exact dates, we might end up being mistaken. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. Now, you said that there was an attack by the Inkotanyi. Were you involved in this incident before or after that attack took place, or during it? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The attack took place the day after the evacuation of the refugees by the RPF, and I told you that it was a large-scale attack. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you told us before that you could tell us happened that night. Did you first become involved in the night, or in the daytime? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Whether we're talking about the attack during the night and the one on the following day, I participated in the attacks because this was a war front. We were at war, and we were operating as if we were fighting a war. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, please, how you first came to be involved in this incident? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Let me start with the attack during the night. Around 11 p.m., Lieutenant Cadence, an ex-FAR, was posted on the road called "heavy weight" road, which is between the locality of Rugenge, and the one facing it. He left the military position that was at that level, and we would exchange information with these soldiers in order to prevent any infiltration from the Inyenzis. He told us that he had just seen a long line of Inkotanyi who were heading towards Sainte Famille, and that we were not to try to prevent them from advancing because there were many of them, and that they first had to be pushed away by the soldiers so that we would be able to shoot at them subsequently. 
At the roadblock, we had specific instructions to exchange information. We had passwords that we had received from the soldiers. They had taught us how to exchange information using such passwords. So we used our passwords during the night the Inkotanyi entered Sainte Famille and Saint Paul and exfiltrated people. I cannot tell you from where these people were taken, but the objective of the RPF was to he evacuate the people who were at Sainte Famille and Saint Paul. We let them go into the two centres, or establishment, and when they went out we attacked them. Some people who had just come out of the locations were killed and they fell in the pits. Some people were able to escape, thanks to the Inkotanyi, and the Inkotanyi took them to their zone. Two Inkotanyi were killed on that day, and some members of the population who were Tutsi and who were being evacuated by the Inkotanyi were also killed. For example, for those who fell at Serutsinga where we buried them, I already testified on this incident. There is a statement dealing with it, and if required by the Trial Chamber I can provide it with a copy of this very detailed statement on this specific incident. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The lieutenant, was that number 38? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then the road was, I assume, Avenue des poids lourds. 
And then there was a name, Mr. Witness. For those who fell at something. Do we have that, Ms. Melluish? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Sorry. I don't think I caught that. 
@WITNESS BUO:
We buried the people at the Serutsinga mass grave in the Rugenge secteur. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the spelling, please. 
@WITNESS BUO:
S-E-R-U-T-S-I-N-G-A. Serutsinga. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, where were you when Lieutenant Cadence came and spoke to you about the RPF approaching? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I was patrolling around the roadblocks manned by the Interahamwe. During the night on each roadblock of the Interahamwes, we were assisted by one soldier. So while I was moving around those roadblocks, I met Cadence, who gave me this piece of information. Claude was off, and that is the reason Lieutenant Cadence gave me the information. And the following day it was necessary for us to go and seek revenge because of this operation of the Inkotanyi. There were some casualties. I know those who shot the people who died, and I also know the names of those who died. I believe it won't be necessary to give you the names right now, but before I leave Arusha I will indeed have given all those names to you. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. Just sticking for a moment with the attack by the Inkotanyi, or the rescue operation, you were instructed by the lieutenant, I understand, not to get involved in that, is that correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes. It was when the Inkotanyi were coming out that we shot at them. The lieutenant had prevented us from attacking them while they were going into the sites. It was a military tactic I am not fully conversant with. But when the time comes, I shall give you the names of those who shot down the victims. I don't think it's necessary to give them to you now because the Accused might make use of them for his own Defence. Before I leave Arusha, I would like Renzaho to have confessed, and I would be very happy to hear him giving such information, and I have evidence to that effect. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Aside from the couple of Inkotanyi that were killed, were any soldiers or Interahamwe killed whilst this raid, or rescue operation, was taking place? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No. The Inkotanyi had a specific objective. We were informed of that because of the soldiers. The Inkotanyi were surprised by our attack when they were coming out. Because when they arrived, they had arrived without any hindrance. Nobody could have been killed amongst our forces because we were prepared. The Inkotanyi were shooting at us in order to escape, but they didn't know where we were, whereas we knew what path they would use. They did not have many casualties, apart from the two I mentioned, as well as some members of the population. The Inkotanyi were able to save a number of people, you will understand that they were also quite strong. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you speak a bit more slowly, Mr. Witness? Thank you. Thank you.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After the Inkotanyi left the area, what did you do? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
After having chased the Inkotanyi from the sites, we organised a large-scale attack which targeted Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, and that was the second attack that was launched against Saint Paul. There were very many of us, around 180 people, and we launched an attack coming from all sides on the site. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that you organised an attack. Did you meet together and discuss what was going to happen? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, we did not meet. I told you that we had started operating at higher speed. We would operate very rapidly and implement instructions. There were enough of us, and we had enough equipment -- 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you receive any instructions? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
-- so that we encountered no difficulty. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you receive any instructions? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Cadence himself told us that the following morning we were to go to Sainte Famille and Saint Paul in order to try and locate the Inyenzi who might have stayed there, as well as their accomplices. And talking about accomplices, he was referring to the Tutsi. He asked us to look for these people and to kill them all. So that was the objective of our attack. Renzaho was there, Munyakaze was there, Bivamvagara was also there, and Lieutenant Cadence was also there, of course. And we, and our leaders, that is to say Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline, we were all there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What time, do you recall, did you launch this attack? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
During the morning, we did not wait until daybreak. At seven we were already there. We were already at Sainte Famille and Saint Paul around seven. I do not know whether you wish for me to tell you which itinerary we followed. I will give this itinerary to Renzaho when the time comes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Please, I would like you to give your itinerary. Where did you go first? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We destroyed the fence that separated the CELA centre from Saint Paul. It was easy to reach Saint Paul either by the road uphill, or downhill. Everywhere there were paths leading to those locations, we blocked them so as to prevent the Inyenzis from escaping. We circled the locations, and the gendarmes who were led by Bivamvagara went on the side of the exit of -- near the church. They went by Pan Africa and the hall where people were housed, and all this in order to make sure that the Inyenzi would not escape. As for us, we circled the CELA centre, the convent of the sisters, as well as the presbytery. We circled -- or surrounded all of those locations so as to dislodge the Inyenzis who might have stayed there, as well as the Tutsi who were hiding, and we were not sorting anyone at that stage. When we got this, we noted that the Hutu refugees who were at Sainte Famille were already ready to assist us, and there are people to whom Renzaho had distributed weapons. When the time comes, I shall give you the names of such individuals, and if Renzaho so wishes perhaps he can call them as witnesses. You can now continue putting questions to me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes, Mr. Witness. Now, what kind of fence was it? 
@WITNESS BUO:
I heard that the fence was rebuilt, but I can give you a description of what it looked like. I am still quite young, and I do remember all that occurred. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. What did the fence look like in June 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Very well. The fence between Saint Paul and Sainte Famille was made of bricks. It was a brick wall. But elsewhere, there was barbed wire which was used for the fence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So does this mean that there was barbed wire between CELA and Saint Paul? Is that the evidence? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Yes. Between Saint Paul and the CELA centre, there was -- there were metallic posts and barbed wire, but it was later replaced by a brick wall. But on the side of the wood, there was no fence. So we could go in without any problem. And at the location where CELA joins with Saint Paul, there was a small house, and there was a hole through which we could pass. As for Sainte Famille, you see the road that leads to the Saint Paul centre, there was a small entrance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. You have answered the question. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, could you try to speak a little bit more slowly, and perhaps tell the story a little bit more slowly for us? Now, when you went through into Saint Paul from CELA, what did you do at Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We implemented the instructions that were given to us. That is to say, dislodge each and every Tutsi we would find there, or any Inyenzi, in order to kill them. That is all we did. We dislodged them, as was indicated to us. Now, who came to our assistance? Well, there were the Hutu refugees who had come from Kibuye and who had fled from the areas that had been conquered by the RFP, and these refugees helped us. I stated that they had helped us. They had equipment. And some of these people, fortunately, have confessed and are about to testify against Renzaho; which means that even if I had not testified against him, these people would. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall how many refugees you dislodged from Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It is difficult to give you a figure. A lot of people came to assist us who came from Muhima and other secteurs, because they got to know that Inkotanyi had attacked the Sainte Famille church and Saint Paul. Some came from Gikondo, who came to seek refuge in Rugenge. All these people assisted us. I managed to know where they had thrown the bodies of those who were killed, and it was at the CND, at Iyaremye, Straton's, place that these bodies were thrown. Others died on the road. And Renzaho, Tharcisse, himself, who was the préfet, made vehicles available to carry the dead bodies. And I will be giving him the names of those persons he requested to remove the bodies. Laurent Munyakaze himself took some people from the Saint Famille parish. He even carried some bodies. And Munyakaze explained himself on some of these incidents. And if Renzaho wants to know this, I'll give him the evidence, and he can also explain why he made vehicles available for the bodies to be carried. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We really do not need these references to Mr. Renzaho all the time, Mr. Witness. What is the next question? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you were at Saint Paul, did you see Renzaho? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I saw him. If I did not see him, I would have told you. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, can you tell us where you saw him, and what he was doing? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He came to the Saint Paul centre. And after we killed those Tutsis who had taken refuge at that place, Renzaho came to that place when the bodies were still strewn all over the place. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what did he do? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He did nothing. We brought out three bodies in front of him, and he said nothing. It was not something surprising for him, because he knew that we normally killed those people, and he is the one who gave us the instructions. If he did not support our activities, he would have prevented us from doing it. And if you wish, I will go and show you the site. He cannot say anything, because he supported what we were doing. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you sure it was at Saint Paul that you saw Renzaho, and not Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He came to those two places, the Saint Paul centre, as well as the Saint Famille parish. He came all the way into the Sainte Famille church building, and he saw the three bodies that they were taking out. But he also -- there were other bodies at that place. And if you wish, I will give you the names of the persons who were accompanying him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, I just want it to be entirely clear to everyone in this courtroom, the order of events. Now, you went from CELA to Saint Paul, and there you said that you found and killed some refugees. You also said you saw Renzaho at Saint Paul. Did you, then, go to Sainte Famille, or had you already been there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Saint Famille parish and the Saint Paul centre are virtually at the same place, and I was free to move around, go wherever I wished to go. No one could chase -- no one could chase me around. On the contrary, I was chasing people around. I was free to move around and I could go anywhere at any time. And I knew -- I could see what was happening. I got instructions from Angeline Mukandutiye, and during that period Mukandutiye and Nyirabagenzi were supported by the préfet, so I did not have to hide. I could do everything in broad daylight. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Even if those two locations are very close, you must have arrived at one of them first. Which one was that, Sainte Famille or Saint Paul? That's the question. Just give us that answer without any further explanation. Where did you arrive first? 
@WITNESS BUO:
I first went to the Saint Paul centre before going to the Saint Famille parish. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, when you went to the Saint Famille parish, can you estimate how many, if any, refugees there were there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We were no longer counting refugees. We were, rather, killing them. There were many refugees, some of them were inside the church building, others were already dead. I recall Yacinthe, the daughter of Charles Rwanga, had already been killed. She was nicknamed "bébé", and she had been killed. And at that time, they instructed us to shoot into the group of refugees. We no longer had to sort them out. We were afraid that there were Inyenzis who had infiltrated and who were there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Who instructed you to shoot? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was Claude and Cadence who told us to shoot. They were my leaders, and I could not but obey their instructions. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you estimate how many people were killed at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I did not count those who were killed at the Saint Famille parish. It was not for us -- we did not kill these people, but there were some bodies which were taken to the CND and killed there. It was -- it was the lieutenant who supervised the carrying of these bodies and their burial. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you say that Yacinthe was nicknamed "bébé"? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Yes, we nicknamed her "bébé". She was a neighbour. Her first name was Yacinthe, but we normally called her bébé. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Your pronouncement -- answer has been translated, at least, as saying "we did not kill these people". Is it right that you didn't kill -- the Interahamwe did not kill any of the refugees at Sainte Famille, or has that been reported --
@WITNESS BUO: 
That is not what I said. There must have been a problem of interpretation. I said "we killed those people", I did not say that we did not kill them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you tell the Court how many people you killed yourself? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
***************************************************************************************************************
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************. It's the same if you ask me who Renzaho or Odette killed personally. There would be no answer to that. But they are responsible because they were leaders of groups of killers. I'm one of those killers, and that is why I pleaded guilty. So you shouldn't make a distinction between myself and those who actually pulled the trigger and shot at those people. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, how long had you been at Sainte Famille when you saw Renzaho there for the first time? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I had just spent about 30 minutes at the Saint Famille parish when Renzaho came. We were looking at the dead bodies, and that is when I recognised the body of Yacinthe. And when Renzaho came to the church building, he remained there for about an hour. Counsel for the Prosecution, did you ask me another question? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Mr. Witness. Can you tell us, please, where it was in the Sainte Famille complex that you first saw Renzaho there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He was close to the water tank, which was within the premises of the Saint Famille parish. It was very close to the sacristy.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what was he doing? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Renzaho was standing, talking to other persons. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know who those other persons were? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, I know them. I know who these people were. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What kind of people were they? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There was Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, who worked closely with Renzaho, particularly regarding what was happening at the parish. It was Father Munyeshyaka who was giving us information on the number of Tutsi who came to the church building and was giving us their names because he know them -- he knew them. And he was telling Renzaho the same thing. And when he gave us that information, then we would look for the Tutsis. Odette and Angeline, the father -- the parish priest and Father Wenceslas, they were with Renzaho discussing. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know for how long these people were together with Renzaho discussing? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I told you that they spoke for a long time and that Renzaho stayed there for about an hour. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know what he did after that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I wouldn't know what he did. He was with my leaders. I was a respectful person and I was not going to join in their conversation. I was about five metres from where they were. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, is it right that you didn't see him do anything else after that conversation? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, he spoke to those persons. He looked at the three dead bodies. Those who were with him also looked at the bodies, but let me add that those three persons entered into the church building and told him what happened in the church building. There was nothing else he could do. He came after we had killed the people. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know why they were looking at the bodies? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I wouldn't know. I don't know because I was not party to their conversation. My leader, who give me instructions, was with them. So they are the ones who know why they sent us to the church building. I could not join in their conversation or listen to their conversation. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After this incident at Sainte Famille, did you ever see Renzaho again? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No. After this incident at the Sainte Famille parish, I did not see Renzaho again. Up until when I fled, I did not meet -- I did not see Renzaho again. However, I am able to tell you that Renzaho had the authority to prevent us from committing the act that we committed, because he was the highest-ranking person among all those persons. That is what I can tell you. He knew everything that was happening. If he did not know, he would have prevented us from doing so or he could even have killed us. He was the most important person among -- in that whole group.

And what is about them that makes you say they are Interahamwes when you don't recognise any of them individually? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I recognise them from their uniform and other things they are wearing. These are no soldiers because there are no military insignia on the uniform. We Interahamwes sometimes wear military uniform but we had no military insignia. I know what happened during that period. I know -- I can see some who are wearing civilian clothes and others wearing military uniforms, and I believe they are Interahamwes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And could you just look at picture number 5? Have you got number 5 there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are these Interahamwe or soldiers or anyone else? Can you tell from the picture? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
They are Interahamwes -- (no interpretation)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it disputed that these photographs show Interahamwe? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Am I to respond, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I believe the Defence position is known. We believe that this could be -- have been organised by what is referred to as the Interahamwe, so we do not agree with the reasoning which is being demonstrated through these photographs. But at the appropriate time, the Prosecution will indicate its position clearly. For now, we just think it is an illustration of what is referred to as Interahamwe. But we are not very certain that that refers to what was called Interahamwe. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I have no further questions, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are no exhibits to be tendered in connection with this testimony. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honours, no, these photos will be exhibited next week. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, you told the Court that in June you were in the Saint Paul church when Michel came with the photograph look for a certain journalist, and you said that you were in the church for reconnaissance. Can you explain to the church what this means? What were you doing in the church, you the Interahamwes? 
@WITNESS BUO:
The Interahamwe and myself, we were trying to look -- to identify or localise or determine the position of some Tutsi who had fled. So we wanted to find them and report to Angeline that we have found some of them and then take further instructions regarding them, and that is what I referred to as a reconnaissance mission and that is what I was doing there. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good afternoon, Witness. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Good afternoon, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, can the Defence of Tharcisse Renzaho consider that today it is meeting one of the persons who in 1994 may be characterised as a foot soldier of Mr. Renzaho? Can we consider you as being such a person today? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I don't know the -- the specific characterisation that you want to give. I came here for a specific reason. I came here to speak to the acts that I committed, together with my colleagues. I don't know if the characterisation you are giving is the one given to you by your client sitting by you, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Are you able to tell the Chamber how you at that time committed -- how did you consider Mr. Renzaho? Was he your leader? What kind of relationship existed between you and him? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you. Renzaho was the chief of my chief who gave me a specific position. So I had a lot of respect for Renzaho, as well as my immediate chief. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you then from a military standpoint, you said that once committed, you got involved in weapon-handling courses, is that correct?
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, that is correct. Yes, I received training in Angeline's house. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. How long did it take for you -- how long did it take for you to consider that at the end of that training you were able to handle weapons? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I was young and I had an active mind, so it did not take me a long time. They taught us how to disassemble a weapon, how to assemble it and how to fire. They did not teach us immediately to target; it took us some time. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Are you saying, Witness, that it took you one day to learn -- to fire -- to shoot a firearm? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
In the course of one day I have learnt to disassemble, clean and reassemble a firearm. That took me one day. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you finally have to use that weapon without training -- or, let's me put it this way: How long -- how many days did it take you to be able to use it? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Not more than five days. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You must have been very intelligent, Witness. And that probably is the reason why you went up the ladder very quickly in your group. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I told you about the person who appointed me to the position I occupied and I told you about the relationship between us. As far as my intelligence is concerned, genocide was not perpetrated because of intelligence. Anyone who could commit genocide did so. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Now, on account of the personal relationship that existed between you and that person, you get into the group on -- can you remind me of the exact date on which you joined the group again, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Regarding the date on which I joined the militia group, I would say it was between the 8th and the 9th. I am not in charge of recording dates, but I remember those dates. There are other events which occurred, but which do not relate to the trial here which I have been able to explain here -- several events actually. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You have told the Chamber that you were requested by that person to replace your brother. Is that correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you indicated that that brother of yours had been shot down. Am I correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
My brother was not shot down. He went into exile. He fled, and I am ready to provide evidence to you to that effect. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I wonder whether this is a problem. In the transcript -- perhaps he was not shot down, but I thought I heard yesterday that your brother was deceased. Was that not your testimony yesterday? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, with all due respect, my brother who was hit by a stray bullet was my younger brother. But as for my older brother, he fled and I will explain to you how you collaborated with the political parties. But I would be talking about other cases, which I can give you the name of my younger brother who was killed, and I can also give you the name of my older brother who collaborated with Mukandituye, Angeline. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I believe we will require clarifications on this matter, unless you were mistaken yesterday. I wish to read out to you the answer you give -- gave to madam the Prosecutor following a question she put to you. I would like to refer to yesterday's transcript, page 60 French version, line 15 -- lines 15 and 16. Here's a question put to you by the Prosecutor, Witness: "Was there any special reason why you joined the group of Interahamwe?" And this is your answer: "Yes, there was one specific reason. My older brother had just died. The person in charge of the Interahamwe, who was a school inspector in Nyarugenge, and whose name was Angeline Mukandituye asked me to come to her assistance. My elder brother, who had worked with her before the war, before multiparty democracy, had just separated from her, and Angeline was a great friend of the family." 
I am not going any further than that. This is the end of quotation. Do you recall having made such a testimony yesterday? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Truth be told, I agree that my elder brother worked with Angeline and that he collaborated with the CDR party. When he left home, he had not been killed; he went to seek refuge at Gitarama. And I can give you the name of my younger brother, who was shot down. I think we should correct the transcripts. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You stated yesterday, that your older brother had died. Did you make a mistake then? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I did not say that he was dead. Perhaps I didn't express myself correctly, or perhaps you misunderstood me. My older brother left the country and he went to Congo. It is my younger brother who was shot down, and I can give you his name. When would my older brother have died and what would be the cause of his death? I am ready to give you this information, unless you tell me that you killed him. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When was it that your older brother went to Congo, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He first went to Gitarama, and he left Gitarama with the others. So you shouldn't ask me exactly when. Perhaps you should ask me when it was that he left our family home. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, Witness, when was it that he left your home?
@WITNESS BUO: 
He left on the 8th at 3 p.m., and I was the one who gave him his bag in Gitarama. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you go to Gitarama with him? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, I did not go with him, but I joined him there. And I knew exactly where he was in Gitarama. I can tell you where. And if that is your wish, I can tell you why I went there and what reason brought me there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What about your younger brother you are now referring to. When was it that he was shot down? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He was not shot down by the Interahamwe. He was hit by a stray bullet which hit him from we don't know where. We don't know where the bullet came from. I am not accusing of anyone of having shot him down. He died as a result of an accident, and if you wish for me to tell you where he was buried, I can do so. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So when was that, Witness? On what date? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
If you are still referring to my younger brother, I don't know what you wish to know.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, it is indeed your younger brother I am referring to, Witness. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
My younger died in May. I cannot tell you the date with certainly. I was not under the obligation to remember all the dates. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So yesterday when you were referring to one of your brothers who had died, it could not have been your younger brother who died in May and not in April when you joined Mrs. Mukandituye? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I don't have any younger brother who died in April. My younger brother died in May. His friends of the same age are still alive, and so are his parents, and we know where he was buried. You should not put words into my mouth. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when you were testifying before the Trial Chamber yesterday that one of your brothers -- and let us not refer to your older brother, since you do not acknowledge having said so -- had just died, I put the question to you earlier on and you said that this could only have been related to your younger brother. What I am asking you now is whether you were indeed alluding to your younger brother when you were answering the question put to you by the Prosecutor yesterday. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I have a feeling you did not follow what was being said in this courtroom while it was your duty. I told you when my younger brother died, under what conditions, and I don't know what you are driving at. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I take note of your answer on this matter, and I would now like to move on to your knowledge in weapons, since you were able to use such weapons in less than five days. Can you tell us what is the difference between the three types of guns you mentioned yesterday? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Even if you were to mix up the different spare parts of such guns, I can still distinguish them from one another, but I am not ready to use a firearm again. I don't know whether you want to know what different types of weapons there were or whether you have another aim. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I would like to know about the different types of weapons, Witness. Could you tell me more about Kalashnikov rifles, for example? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Let me answer your question regarding the Kalashnikov guns. If you look at the butt of such guns, there is a trigger on which you push in order to take off the latch, security latch, and then you arm the weapon so that the bullet will get out of the chamber and so that you might not shoot yourself. And it is only after having carried out such operations that you can clean your weapon. Then you can take the different parts of your gun, take your reserve bullet, put it in the barrel, and then you can leave with your gun. Before opening fire you should take off the safety latch and then you can shoot, and it is the safety latch that shows you that the Kalashnikov can be used to shoot several bullets. I don't know whether you have followed me or whether you need further explanations. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I followed you, Witness, and I would like to put another question to you. What is the -- how many bullets can one put in the magazine of a Kalashnikov? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thirty. That is child's play. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And what's the difference between the magazine of an F -- R4, G3 and AK47 rifles? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
What is an AK47? I do not believe I referred to any AK47. I referred to the G3, the FAL, the Kalashnikov, and the R4. Do not include other weapons I did not mention. Your client has followed a number of trainings on firearms, but not me. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How can you identify a Kalashnikov? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes. Well, if the Trial Chamber is ready to give me the different types of weapons, perhaps I can show you the difference. I saw a photograph on which such arms are shown, perhaps I can tell you about them. And, besides, your client, who is right beside you, was a colonel, so I believe he can provide you with further explanations. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I wish things to be clear between the two of us. When I am putting questions to you it is in order for you to enlighten the Trial Chamber, and that is why I will ask you to refrain from referring to my client on each and every occasion. Can we follow such a procedure? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I shall not make your task difficult. But I am ill and I would like to be able to get out of the courtroom in order to relieve myself, and then I would be ready to stay in this courtroom until you are able to understand the ins and outs of the genocide. Please grant me some time for me to be able to relieve myself. I am not able to answer your question because I am under pressure. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will draw the curtains first, Mr. Witness. 
$(Witness exited courtroom) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
While the witness is outside the courtroom. Yesterday the Prosecution, listing the witnesses for next week, mentioned that DBN was the first followed by BX. Is that still the case? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any need to ask DBN to come Monday morning or is it sufficient to ask him to come in the afternoon? What is the estimate of the Defence based on projected time for cross-examination? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Well, Mr. President, if I were to give you an estimate it would be between two hours and two hours and 30 minutes.
$(Witness entered courtroom) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. You are not bound by that, of course. But then the witness should be brought around 10:30. 
Mr. Witness, here follows the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, before you left the courtroom, I do not recall whether you had answered my question. I was asking you how you were able to identify a Kalashnikov. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The butt of such guns is wooden. And as for the way the gun looks, in fact, it would be easy if I had guns before me to tell you: This is a Kalashnikov; this is an F4; this is a G3; or this is an FAL gun. I have just spent more than ten years in prison, perhaps I should be shown the photo album I had before me. And if you come next to me, and if the Judges so wish, I can show you the different types of weapons that appear in such photographs. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That will not be necessary, Mr. President, because I am putting questions to the witness regarding the training he received in the handling of weapons. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, may I ask you what was -- what is the first lesson one receives when one receives training in the handling of weapons? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
You should not lead me to talk about military matters. Our objective was merely to know how to shoot a bullet. We were not being trained to become soldiers. We were being trained to kill people. You should not ask us questions that are much too complex. One had to know how to put (sic) a magazine apart, or how to take off the parts of a firearm rapidly, but that was all. There was no other type of combat for us. The objective was just to kill people. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you stated before this Trial Chamber that you were trained in the handling of weapons, and that is why I wish for you to remind the Trial Chamber of the contents of such courses. So, can you answer me in a specific way: What is the first course taken when one is trained to handle weapons? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
First of all, we were told that a gun was something specific -- special, because if we did not handle it with care it could lead to our own death. First of all, you are taught how to hold the weapon and how to maintain it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, in your training, you were not told that the first lesson was to identify the weapon by its number before looking at its specifications? You were never taught such a thing? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
As regards the number on the gun we would receive, there was one location where the weapons would be placed. So we would note down somewhere the name of the person as well as the type of weapon that person received; but we did not pay any attention to the serial number of such weapons. ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And since you were *************************************************, in addition, Witness, while you were making such notes, you only noted down regarding the Kalashnikovs -- 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Kalashnikov? I told you how we were using the equipment. What we were to pay attention to was the different bullets that were to be used with different types of weapons. And there are some bullets that be used in different types of guns. What we were interested in was to know that X or Y had received such-and-such a gun; otherwise, we were not trained in complex military matters. Why would we have been taught such difficult things when there were gendarmes and soldiers who were assisting us? Our work -- our job was merely to kill people, and we would do so without any major problem. It is now that we are paying the consequences of what we had done -- what we did. But, at the time, we had no problem whatsoever. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Who was your instructor, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were many people who would train us. There were people who went for training at Gabiro. For example, Claude, he was a lieutenant and he had been a soldier. Do you think it would have been difficult for a lieutenant to say, "Well, this is how you handle a weapon." I believe this was something quite straightforward for him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you now refer to Gabiro or Ngabire, Mr. Witness? What was the location you just referred to? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Gabiro. There are people who went to undergo military training at Gabiro, and I am ready to provide the names of those who were trained at Gabiro by the ministry of defence, if counsel so wishes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to adjourn for today, and we will continue, Monday, at 8:45. 
May I ask everyone to note that on Monday we will not be sitting in this courtroom, but in courtroom 4 on the ground floor, probably only for one day, possibly two. The reason for the venue change is that the Chamber presently using courtroom 4 need this courtroom because of a video link connection. 
So I wish everyone a good weekend. 
Mr. Witness, you, too. And please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you. 
The Court is adjourned.

Good morning, the Court is in session. 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS BUO:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just two small issues before we start the testimony again. On Friday, you talked about 
Fidèle and Ndamije and you also mentioned another one, Narcisse, because he was in charge of a cellule. 
Can you repeat the name of that cellule, please? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Gahirimba cellule. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that means G-A-H-I-R-I-M-B-A; isn't that so? 
@WITNESS BUO:
No, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is the right spelling, then? 
@WITNESS BUO:
B-W-A-H-I-R-I-M-B-A. 
@THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
"Gahirimba" (phonetic).
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- says the Kinyarwanda interpreter. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So are there two versions now in the courtroom; is the witness wrong? 
@WITNESS BUO:
"Gahirimba" (phonetic). 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth says it is pronounced "Gahirimba" but spelt B-W-A-H-I-R-I-M-B-A; they pronounce it "Gahirimba". 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, well, this was really a trap. And then the next one, Mugamije (phonetic), can you help us with that word, please? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Actually, it is Ngamije. It is spelt N-G-A-M-I-J-E, Ngamije.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Morning, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you remember that by the time we stopped our examination Friday, you answered my question saying that you had been trained by a certain reserve lieutenant called Claude; correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
He was not the only one. When you had already received your training, you could train others. As I told you, the training was not very difficult. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, I was just trying to jog your recollection about how we ended on Friday. You referred to Claude as having been the person who trained you; correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
That's right, Claude was our president and he was the one training us; you're right. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, then, thank you, Witness. 
Do you also remember that a short while before we started talking about Claude, you had objected to the mention I made of the AK47 guns amongst the weapons you mentioned; do you remember that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I'm going to repeat to you the types of firearms which I mentioned. I remember that very well and I'm going to repeat it to you so that we can be at par. I talked about: Kalashnikovs, R4, G3 and FAL -- light-automatic weapon. Is that not what I said, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I noted what you said. I just want you to agree with me that you considered that the AK47 rifle was not amongst the weapons you've mentioned. Do we agree on that or not? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I just reminded you of the types of firearms which we had. Well, perhaps you had that AK47, which you're talking about, but I did not mention it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. While Claude was teaching you weapons handling procedures, he did not tell you that the Kalashnikov was the same as the AK47 gun; he didn't tell you that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The only name I know is Kalashnikov. Nobody told me of that other name you are mentioning. Perhaps you're just fabricating the name now. Was I with you when I was undergoing my training for you to start disputing all what I'm telling you regarding what I was trained on? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, everyone has a task in this courtroom. Counsel wants to ask questions. Your task is to answer them. Your task is not to argue with counsel, all right? Now, just answer the questions. Here comes the next one. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, kindly tell the Chamber what your training curriculum was? The type of training you received from Lieutenant Claude and the other people? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Our curriculum entailed taking out the magazine of the guns to cross-check whether the gun had been properly loaded. Then, we had to place the bullets in the magazine, then put the magazine and attach it to the gun. Then, we also need to check the position of the safety pin and then we'd go and do the work which we had to do for that day; that was all. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, in your training system you were not told about how to use the weapon, that is not necessarily dismantling it and actually mounting it up, but tactical procedures. You were not taught about that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Our training tied in with the activities we had to carry out; we were not supposed to go to the war front. Our lone activity was to kill Tutsi. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, do you remember what you told the Chamber on Friday that you were at the front against the Inkotanyi on the 17th of June 1994. You yourself use the word "front", don't you remember? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Did you say the 17th of June? I did not say that. I explained how we fought the Inkotanyi who had come to release people from the Sainte Famille parish. I did not give you a specific date. I simply mentioned the month. And at that time, we were shooting at the Inkotanyi who had come during the night. We were trying to repel them -- to push them back. It was not fighting in the front. We were Interahamwe, we weren't soldiers. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, so when you used the term "front" in giving an account of that battle, you actually made a mistake in the use of the term, and you told the Chamber that you fought with soldiers under 
Lieutenant Cadence. So you were actually mistaken, is that so? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I was not mistaken, sir. I told you of what I did, the events which I witness -- attend -- participated in. The Interahamwe were fighting the Inkotanyi who had come to release people at the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille. And we shot at them when they were leaving with those Tutsi refugees; that was the front I referred to. We did not fight against the Inkotanyi; we did not attack the Inkotanyi. I don't know how you understand that, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, please explain to the Trial Chamber the difference you make between the light-automatic weapons and the R4 rifles? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Those rifles do not look alike and even when you use them, you don't use them in the same way. Now, if you give me sketches of those two types of guns or rifles, then I'll be able to tell you the difference easily. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, if you had been taught how to make a distinction between them, then you know what their distinctive features are. You do not need a sketch for that; isn't that so? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Well, I'm going to try. The R4 has a butt which is not often wooden. It is a foldable gun with a tripod. The light-automatic weapons do not have any tripods. The end of the R4 has a seeking light whereas that of the light-automatic weapon does not have the same features. Also, the magazines do not have the same size and the same shape. The R4 gun is very different from the light-automatic weapon. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, for a militiaman who claims that he was with Colonel Renzaho, it is quite surprising that you do not know that the difference between those guns is mainly the size of their magazines, because some of them have more bullets in the magazines than the others. You weren't told that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
But, Counsel, even if you seem to be unaware of that, I just gave you that distinction and I insisted when I told you that the R4 rifle was very different from the light-automatic weapon. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you say that the magazine of the R4 was different from the magazine of the light-automatic weapon? I didn't hear you say that, Witness. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I did say that, sir, and I even said that the bullets used by the two guns are very different. The bullets of the R4 rifle are very small. Even if you showed me the two types of bullets, I can know which one is the one used by the R4 rifle. And I'm making a distinction between that and the one used by the light-automatic weapons. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you were rapidly appointed (By order of the Court, the following portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover). Can you explain to us how you went about operating your activities? Start by telling us how many of you there were and then tell us how you organised yourselves. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel, our operations were not complicated. This is something I've been explaining ever since I started giving evidence. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) that is where we had our headquarters. That is where we were assigned the various duties. That is where we were giving details regarding the operations to carry out the people we had to kill. 
Then, we would come and report to her -- be it for the vehicles we used, the uniforms, or the weaponry, those were all at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) when the people participating in those various operations did not keep those equipment with themselves. 
Above all, we participated in operations of massacre. We did not have other operations because actually our organisation had been set up to carry out massacres. So we were responsible for maintaining the equipment placed at our disposal, and we also had to make sure that the equipment was used for the purposes initially earmarked. 
We had positions at the various roadblocks which had been set up within Rugenge secteur. Now, if you're not familiar with Rugenge secteur, I am ready to explain to you how that secteur was laid out 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are in open session. So we will now first delete at 9:17:06 the words in the sentence, "We were based at ... ", then follows a name and we will delete that name and that place. 
And, then, we have to delete the last part of the last sentence in the response at 9:18:30. So that the sentence will end with the words "... was laid out ..." Whereas the last line, "And in my ..." onwards will be placed under separate cover. 
Anything else we need to delete? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, in the question there was reference to the position held. I don't, I'm afraid, have the time code. It was the question preceding that answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, yes, Defence counsel, that was not good. So what we have at 9:16:36 must also be deleted. We will simply say you were rapidly appointed and the rest of the sentence will be placed under separate cover, and then continues the next sentence: "Can you explain to us ..." And this is at 9:16:36. Let's all be cautious. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, I had completely forgotten that we were in open court. My apologies -- and I'll even avoid dwelling on that point so as not to lead to the witness's identity being disclosed. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, let me put to you what may be actually the last question on this point. You told the Chamber that the training sessions took place at Angeline Mukandituye's home; is that correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, you are not mistaken; that's correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. Please tell the Court what was the size of that residence where the training sessions were taking place? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, I thank you. It was not necessary to have huge space. The little space sufficed for us to carry out the necessary exercises and we were able to meet our set objectives -- that is, to massacre people. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, give us an approximate size of that area -- that space, if you remember? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. When I went to the place I wasn't going there to measure the sizes. I was going there to carry out exercises. There was a specific objective. But there was a garden in front of the living room. If you want, you can go there yourself with the tape and take the measurement because I did not have the time to go and carry out a survey -- a topographical survey of that place. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and there we have a new example of how you get into argument with counsel. Can't you stop this? We don't appreciate it. 
So here comes his next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, were those sessions carried out concurrently with the family activities in 
Mrs. Angeline Mukandituye's home? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, we carried out our exercises in front of the house and in the rear courtyard where there were the kitchens and the other ancillary buildings where the family activities went on. You see, that is where the cooking was carried out; that is where we had our meals. So, our exercises went concurrently with the family activities within that family where we carried our exercises out. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. So you received your training under the circumstances you have indicated and about which the Defence has serious reservations. Anyway, let's move on and talk about your campaigns. You said that on that 21st of April 1994, you received your first package of weapons brought by Colonel Renzaho and Major Munyakaze; is that correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, it is, that is what I said. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, when those two people got there, did you see them arrive there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I saw them when they arrived. I knew them before, so I could make them out. I cannot be mistaken regarding those two people. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How were they dressed, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
One of them was in a dark suit -- I'm referring to your client. Munyakaze was in military attire. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You say Mr. Renzaho was in a black suit and Munyakaze was in military attire? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Correct, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Is that how Mr. Renzaho was often dressed, when he had to go down to conduct operations with you, Witness? You didn't understand my question, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
You see, you are speaking in French, that is why I did not answer you, Counsel. I'm speaking Kinyarwanda. You're speaking in French -- or I had the impression I received the interpretation in French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we will repeat the question. 
Will you do that, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, my question to you was whether Mr. Renzaho usually dressed in such an attire, which you just described, to go down to conduct operations with you. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, sir, he changed his attire. He was not always dressed in the same way. On certain occasion, he came in camouflage dress. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So on that day, for the maiden operation with you, he chose to be in a black suit? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What about the pickup vehicle which you talked about, Witness? Can you give us some descriptions of it? How many types of cabin did it have and how many people were in that vehicle when you saw it? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The vehicle which they came in on that first occasion was a Hilux pickup, red in colour. That was the vehicle used by Munyakaze. There were six gendarmes sitting in the rear and in the cabin were Laurent Munyakaze, Renzaho and the driver. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And where were the weapons?
@WITNESS BUO: 
The weapons were at the rear and could not have been placed in the cabin. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How many weapons were there, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
They only took a few weapons out of those that were in the pickup. But other weapons remained in the pickup, and that is the reason for which I'm not in a position to give you the number of weapons that were in the pickup, because they only gave us a few weapons and they left with the remainder of the batch. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, I believe you cannot know -- I'm sure that you do not know how many weapons there were exactly. But can you give us an estimate? How many weapons did you receive on that day and did you also receive ammunition? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, we received bullets in small boxes and we also received grenades. But when they delivered the weapons to us, I should say that we already had weapons and this simply came -- these weapons simply came in addition to the ones we already had. We already had G3 weapons, but we were having problems with such weapons and that is the reason for which they gave us Kalashnikov rifles. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What you're describing us to us, Witness, seems to be unrealistic: Two senior officers of the Rwandan army would be sitting in the cabin of a pickup truck with six gendarmes in -- at the rear. And you are stating that below the feet of such gendarmes, there were the -- there was the ammunition as well as all the weapons that were delivered to you. Is that what your testimony before this Chamber is? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I understand you, Counsel, but you were not there to witness the scene, but the description I gave you is what occurred. On the first occasion, the description I gave you is exactly what happened and I do not understand why you're challenging what I'm telling you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I'm merely trying to understand because, in addition, the weapons which you allegedly received on that day -- that is to say, the G3, the R4s and the light-automatic rifles -- do you know that these are weapons that were no longer in circulation in the defence forces of Rwanda and that as a consequence, no ammunition was being ordered for such weapons. Are you aware of that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel, I was not in charge of the stock of weapons, and I merely told you about the weapons we received. I'm not aware of the information you have just shared with us. I was not in charge of the weapon stocks and as for the weapons we received, we also received the ammunition and there was never any shortage of such ammunition. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So do you believe -- that you agree it was given the priority compared to the other units of the 
Rwandan army in -- in terms of supply of ammunition? So, were you given priority compared to the regular army; is that what you're stating? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, at the roadblock where we were there was also gendarmes and soldiers, and they would use the same ammunition as we did. So, they would certainly have provided us with ammunition since they were aware of the work we were carrying out. But until the day we left our headquarters, we even had to leave some of the ammunition and some of the weapons behind. And I do recall that when I went back to the country, I was shown some of this ammunition. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Finally, Witness, on this issue, did you know that at the time Kalashnikov rifles were not made available to all the units of the army? Were you aware of that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I thank you, Counsel, I was not aware of that since I -- as I told you, I was not working at the general staff of the army or of the gendarmerie. I gave you the different types of weapons we would use and the ones we received. And there was even another delivery of new weapons -- and some members of our group even participated in operations in Mburabuturo, where the operations were led by Bwanakweri. And if you put the question to him, he will be able to confirm such information. We were able to get new weapons during that operation -- and let me say that we never suffered any shortage of ammunition or weapons; we had some in sufficient quantities. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you please help us with the spelling of that location where the operations took place? 
@WITNESS BUO:
The fighting took place in Mburabuturo and the operations were led by 
Captain Isadore (phonetic) Bwanakweri, and the Cyangugu battalion that participated in the fighting had specific weapons and we were able to get weapons from those members of the battalion who fell at the front. So we were able to get new Kalashnikov rifles as well as additional ammunition and grenades. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you for that, Mr. Witness, but my question was only the spelling. Now Mburabuturo is M-B-U-R-A-B-U-T-U-R-O, is that true? 
@WITNESS BUO:
You're right, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But now we really need your assistance with that name which was complicated. Can you help us, please, the spelling? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Are you referring to Bwanakweri? It is B-W-A-N-A-K-W-E-R-I, Bwanakweri. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that was the person who led the operations in Mburabuturo, is that so? 
@WITNESS BUO:
That is correct and he is presently detained at the Kigali central prison. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are we to understand that you had received only cursory training -- was chosen by the two officers in order to give you useful weapons, and this to the detriment of the police, the army and the gendarmerie. Is that what we are to understand? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel, what happened in the Rugenge secteur was carried out by Interahamwe with the cooperation of gendarmes and soldiers. And let me specify, that there the same soldiers were the ones who shot -- who started shooting first after President Habyarimana's death. Let me remind you there was a communiqué which prohibited members of the population from leaving their houses and the soldiers were the ones who started shooting at people. The gendarmerie and the army always cooperated with the Interahamwe and this until the last day when we left the country. So how can you say that such officers would have taken care of the gendarmerie and the army alone and neglect the Interahamwe when the Interahamwe were also an organisation that had been created by these same people? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you know whether Angeline Mukandituye's house was bombarded in April of 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The shells fell lower than Angeline Mukandituye's house. And shells fell at Macumi where the crisis committee meeting was taking place, and which was attended by an envoy of Préfet Renzaho. So the shells fell on the house that was at the bottom of the road. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And, according to you, where were these bombs coming from, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel, our task was to hunt down the Tutsis to kill them. My task was not to identify where shells were coming from. Such a question should be put to those who were handling the support weapons -- and let me specify that we did not receive any such support weapon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You gave a location indicating where the shells were falling. Can you repeat that name? It sounded like "Matuma". The spelling, please? 
@WITNESS BUO:
I talked about Mr. Alphonse Macumi's residence, and that is the only location where I know that bombs fell and it was a residence which was located below that of Angeline Mukandituye's. 
Macumi is spelt M-A-C-U-M-I. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@WITNESS BUO:
And his first name is Alphonse. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, I took note of your concern. What was your concern at the time? And apparently, it seemed to be the same concern as that of the two officers who trained you in April. And is it why they asked to you loot the vehicles on the 21st of April; am I correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Even if you're not Rwandan, I believe you can understand what the objective 
was -- and the objective was reached. You should not shy away from reality. The objective was the killings. And we carried out the killings. We obeyed the orders that were given to us by them, so they should be -- he should be held accountable for what he has done. Truth -- the truth has to be told. Whatever Colonel Renzaho thinks, you have played a role -- or you have played a part in what has been carried out. And you should face the consequences just as we faced the consequences. And you should tell the truth and confess to the crimes that we have committed -- just as I did, and I believe God will forgive us. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us talk about this looting campaign. Could you remind the Trial Chamber of the circumstances under which you found Colonel Renzaho and Major Munyakaze? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Are you referring to the looting at Technoserve or the looting of the private residences, because we looted private residences as well as the Technoserve facilities?
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you referred to the looting of vehicles in CELA on the 21st of April 1994. I'm only referring to what you yourself mentioned here in this courtroom. Could you please tell the Trial Chamber under which circumstances you found Mr. Renzaho and Major Munyakaze on the site? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. When these two people arrived at CELA for the looting, the operation was the first one. It was followed by another one -- an operation where we killed around 60 people. I told you that the attack left from Angeline's place and I also told you that I went there on foot, whereas the two individuals had gone on board their vehicle and I also specified that on that occasion we killed two watchmen. I believe I went into the details of this operation. I do not know what additional information you wish to get. I believe even the President was satisfied with the explanations I had provided. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and I'm satisfied to note that Technoserve is number 273 on the spelling list. 
Shall we ask next question? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when was it exactly that you saw Commander Bivamvagara join Mr. Renzaho and Major Munyakaze? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel, when I reached CELA and when the two gentlemen arrived, Major Bivamvagara was not -- had not arrived yet. And when he arrived, it was Lieutenant Claude who knew 
Major Bivamvagara, who told me that that man who was coming was Major Patrice Bivamvagara. Subsequently I met him on several occasions because he would come and visit us in our headquarters, and he would come from time to time on our different positions. And it is under such circumstances that I met Bivamvagara. But I knew Renzaho before the war, whereas for -- regarding Major Munyakaze, I had never met him before the war. It was during the war that I'd met him. 
Let me add that there is one other official who would come to Angeline's house -- even before the war and whom I met on that occasion. But I would not wish to disclose his identity here for -- in view of my personal security, because he is one of the leaders of the country today. But I promise you that I will take -- I will make your task easier and provide you with the explanations you require in order for you to understand how the Rwanda -- the genocide in Rwanda was perpetrated in the Rugenge secteur. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when Major Bivamvagara arrived had you already killed the two watchmen -- and could you tell us whether they were, indeed, gendarmes? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. When Bivamvagara arrived, the gendarmes had not yet been shot down. They were shot when we were ordered to enter the centre to get the vehicles, and when they tried to oppose us -- and that was when they were shot. There was no other solution. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you testified that Mr. Renzaho and Major Munyakaze were escorted by six gendarmes, am I correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I believe I was right when I gave you this number. I had already referred to it and I notice that you are backtracking. But, Counsel, did I not mention it in my statements? Those were the explanations I had promised to give you. I had promised that I would provide explanations as I went along in my 
testimony -- and if you refer to my previous statements, you will not find this information anywhere. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I would like us to understand one another. You are describing an event to us which starts at Mrs. Mukandituye's house where Renzaho and Munyakaze arrived with an escort of six gendarmes. They leave that place and go to CELA. And then you joined them there and once you joined them, the six gendarmes are no longer with them? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel -- but Counsel, if you were a soldier, do you believe you would be able to abandon your chief without being punished? This is a childish question, Counsel. You should understand that obviously the gendarmes were still there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, perhaps you should be more polite because I believe there is no need for such sarcasm. 
Do we agree? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, I believe I'm answering your questions. And this -- and taking into account the suggestion made by the President, and I'm doing so for us to be able to make progress. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and the best progress is made if we all observe a minimum level of decorum and politeness. 
May I ask you, the word "Bivamvagara". He's on the spelling list in the English version spelt with an M, just like Mike. But sometimes it's written with N, just like Nelson. What shall we adopt in this courtroom? There are two versions. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I didn't know, Your Honour, that there was another version. So I will just promote the M. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are in favour of the M. 
Your recollection, Mr. Witness, is that Bivamvagara is written with an M, is that so? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Bivamvagara is spelt with an M as in Mike. It is spelt B-I -- let me repeat so that you can better take note of the spelling of his name -- even if I do not really understand the question that was put to me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you have now very kindly assisted us -- and, with other words, in the French version, we have to change to Bivamvagara, not Bivanvagara. Thank you. 
Now, the next question, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I'm obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, according to you to which corp did Major Munyakaze belong in the army? Was he a gendarme, or was he an officer of the Rwandan armed forces -- if this is to your recollection? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I believe Munyakaze would sometimes come without a beret, so it was not possible to know whether he was an officer of the army or of the gendarmerie. Because the gendarmes would wear red berets whereas the officers of the army would wear black berets, and they could also wear some that were in camouflage material that was also worn by the officers of the gendarmerie. 
So it was very difficult to determine whether he belonged to the army or to the gendarmerie. And, on some occasions, he would even be wearing civilian clothes, so it was very difficult to be able to make a distinction between the officers of the army and that of the gendarmerie. It was much easier to know who was who with the rank and file. I don't know whether you have any suggestion to put to me regarding the unit to which this officer belonged. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine, try to speak a bit more slowly, Mr. Witness. 
Next question? 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Yes, but what colour of beret was he wearing? Was it red or a dark colour?
@WITNESS BUO:
I saw him with a red beret. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Red is worn by gendarmes, isn't it? Just like in my country. 
@WITNESS BUO:
Yes, the gendarmes would wear red berets. On some occasions I saw him with a red beret and on others with a camouflage beret. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The microphone of Your Honour.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, Witness, you knew that Major Munyakaze was a gendarme officer, and on that 21st of April 1994, as it was observed, he was escorted by six gendarmes. Do you think it was impossible for him to order those two watchmen to open the gate and then they will not comply immediately? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. They remained in the vehicle and told us to go and loot the vehicles at CELA. And when the gendarmes -- who wanted to oppose us, the Interahamwe shot at them. So after they observed that situation, the officers did not tell us anything. We were the ones who shot at those people, not the gendarmes. They did not want to open the gate, so we shot at them. We wanted to appropriate those vehicles. We had never possessed any vehicles, so it was a windfall for us. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But Witness, I believed -- I understood that you were ordered to shoot at those people. Who gave you that order when you arrived there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was Claude who ordered us to shoot at those people; he was our leader. We could not disobey that order. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So Claude, who was a reserve officer, deemed it not necessary to go and see the leader of the gendarmes who was nearby and to request him to order those two gendarmes, who seemed to be putting up a resistance, to comply with the orders which you had been given? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I'm not Claude, we simply obeyed the order he gave us. I don't know what his reasoning was. I think the answer is easy. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And according to you, Witness, what can be proven that in the presence of those two officers, who were the leaders of the gendarmes, Claude gave you the order to shoot the other gendarmes. What do you think can enable the Trial Chamber to be convinced about what you're saying? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, those were not the only gendarmes or soldiers who were shot down by Interahamwe. Even a soldier who resembled a Tutsi was killed. There were others whom we shot down throughout that war period. I can give you another example of a gendarme we killed. And we did not face any consequences during that period and we fulfilled our set objectives. I think the answer is very clear. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, you were able to kill lots of gendarmes, but the problem here is that you do so under the orders and authorities of two officers who were the leaders of those gendarmes. How can you explain that? How do you think that can be possible? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. It was Claude who ordered us to shoot and it is true that we shot the gendarmes in the presence of those officers and they did not tell us anything. But the order had come from Claude. I wonder whether your understanding what I'm saying. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And for you, the sole purpose of eliminating those gendarmes was to loot the vehicles. By the way, how many vehicles did you loot at CELA on that day, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We looted all the vehicles which were there. I did not count the number of vehicles. Personally, **********************************. And apart from those two gendarmes, we did not kill anyone else. 
*************************************************************************************. All the vehicles at CELA were looted. I don't know how many vehicles there were. We were told to take all the vehicles at CELA. So we would get in, take the vehicle and leave. Perhaps, those responsible for managing CELA would be able to give you a figure since they knew the number of vehicles which were at their parking lot. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you see the problem here, Mr. Witness? What we need to understand is how Claude could order the killing of gendarmes in the presence of gendarme officers, who would then be assumed to protect their rank-and-file gendarmes? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to answer your question. Those officers had remained on the tarmac road with -- inside their vehicle. Now, if you see the distance between the tarmac road and the CELA gate, you understand that Claude did not have to go and seek decisions -- authorisation from those officers before he ordered us to go and shoot at those gendarmes. They told us to go and get those vehicles. When we got to the gate, the gendarmes prevented us from entering and Claude asked us to shoot. After that, the officers simply observed that the gendarmes were dead; they didn't tell us anything.
Now, Mr. President, you understand that during the war we were blindly obeying orders without asking questions. When we're asked to shoot, we shot -- without thinking otherwise. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And remember the speed, all of us. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I'll do that, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, from what I understand from your evidence-in-chief, you were ***************************************. And now you say you are unable to count the number of vehicles which were looted on that day, whereas *********************************************************** such an exercise. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I'm going to give you the list of vehicles which we took from that place to Angeline's home. There were four vehicles at Angeline's place which we had looted at CELA. So, there were four vehicles: There was the red Hiace driven by Lambert, son of Leon Mucakari -- that was one of the vehicles looted at CELA. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At last, Witness, your memory is coming back to you, but how can you explain to the Chamber how you looted the vehicles? Did you have the keys of the various vehicles? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. We did not need any keys to start the vehicles; we simply connected the cables in order for them to start. There were other vehicles which we appropriated from the owners -- for those we had the contact keys. But for the other vehicles, we simply cut and connected cables. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you think that at that time Préfet Renzaho had vehicles at his disposal at the PVK? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I don't know whether there were vehicles at his disposal, but I'm telling you all the vehicles he placed at our disposal. I did not go and see what were the préfet's working conditions at the préfecture office; I'm talking about the operations we carried out -- not what happened at the préfecture office. I'm giving you an account of what happened at the CELA centre. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Honestly, Witness, do you think that it was difficult -- not only for the préfet, but for the gendarmerie boss to get four vehicles and place them at your disposal, rather than go away to loot at CELA? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, I thank you. That was not difficult. Do you think it was more difficult for those people to give us the vehicles -- or it was more difficult to give us Tutsi? They said we owned everything. We even looted some vehicles owned by Tutsi and we occupied the houses of those Tutsi; that was not difficult at all. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So it -- if it was not difficult for them to get vehicles for you without you having to go to CELA, how do you explain that they took you to CELA and authorised you to kill two gendarmes without any reaction from the FAR? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, all those operations were conducted hand in hand -- both the killings and the lootings. In fact, they were conducted almost simultaneously. You see, some of us were poor. We were young people without resources. So, it was very easy for us to kill people and take their property -- given that we would not suffer any consequences. We took over certain homes of Tutsi. We set their houses on fire and we destroyed some of their houses -- we even drove vehicles belonging to Tutsi. So, there is nothing surprising that we would go and loot vehicles at CELA. Besides, there are other buildings which were plundered. For instance, La Rwandaise was looted. We even looted and used UNAMIR vehicles. We had been given the right to appropriate all types of property -- vehicles and even foodstuff. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are speaking too fast. You see, when you speak so fast, it will be a challenge to interpret what you are saying and transcribe what you're saying and we want it all down on paper. So, please slow down. All right? 
@WITNESS BUO:
Mr. President, I am sorry. I'm going to speak very, very slowly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Counsel?
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, if you want, we can move to what you did the following day -- that is, the 
22nd of April 1994. Witness, kindly refresh our recollection regarding the exact time when you started off that campaign of the 22nd of April 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. We started that campaign in the morning. In my testimony I did not give a specific time. I told you it was around 8 o'clock that the operation kicked off. So it all started in the morning and went on until the afternoon. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you said that the one leading your detachment that day, once again, was Mr. Renzaho; correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, would you remember whether that day Renzaho was also accompanied by Mr. Munyakaze? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, no mistake about that -- they were, indeed, together. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I didn't quite hear you, Witness. Do you say they were together on that 22nd of April 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
They were together during the attack against CELA on the 22nd of April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, you seemed to have omitted to mention that fact in chief. Is that what we should understand? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, I did not forget to mention that. I know that it appears even on my written statement. So I did not forget that point of detail, I actually mentioned it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Is it your assertion that you mentioned it in chief? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, I've told you I cannot be mistaken because, you see, I was one of the players of what happened that day and I remember that it is in my written statement. By the way, when I gave that written statement I did not know that one day I would personally testify before the Trial Chamber. And I decided to be very detailed in my account of all the operations we conducted and I was relying on the confessions I have made. And I did so voluntarily. No one promised me anything for me to say all that. So I am simply repeating what I had said before. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, kindly give me a simpler answer to my questions. During your evidence-in-chief here, did you mention that Colonel Renzaho was accompanied by Mr. Laurent Munyakaze on the 22nd of April 1994? That is a question you can answer with a yes or with a no. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, I mentioned that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And we have the transcripts. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, actually I just wanted him to confirm that and the transcripts will tell us who is mistaken and who is not.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, start by telling the Chamber how those two people were dressed when they arrived there, and in which vehicle they were.
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, on that day they came with three vehicles, one of which was a military vehicle, and the two others were pickup trucks. So, there were three vehicles. There were also those who got there in their own vehicles. Personally, I trekked to CELA because it was not very far from Angeline's home. So those were the vehicles which were there at CELA. And after we had picked out the people to be killed, they left. I believe I'd already mentioned this. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm sorry, Witness, that the Defence would want you to speak at greater length about this. When you say they came in one military vehicle and two pickup trucks, can you be more specific? What type of military vehicle are you referring to, sir? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
It was an -- it was a military jeep. It was a military jeep. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That military jeep you are referring to, is it the type of vehicle you would consider as armoured? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
What I know is that it was a military vehicle, a jeep. I don't quite understand what you mean by "armoured". 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Who was -- or, were in that jeep? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Your client, sir. I mean Tharcisse Renzaho. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How many people were with him in that vehicle? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
There were two other people sitting at the rear, and he was sitting in front with the driver. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And who were those in the pickup trucks? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Major Munyakaze was in one of those pickups. They came to Angeline's, they got into the compound, and the jeep was very near the gate. That is how I was able to know those inside the jeep. So they entered into Angeline's home and held a meeting. After the meeting, we were ordered to go and attack CELA. Tharcisse Renzaho underscored that we had to go with our weapons. He knew what would happen, and we usually obeyed orders. I don't know how many vehicles left Angeline's place because I was distributing weapons. It was after the operation that I was able to know who had actually taken part in that operation. It was after the operation that I was able to know the number of Interahamwe who had been to CELA. I was not charged with supervising soldiers, I was supervising the Interahamwe. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, as you are saying, Colonel Renzaho came in his jeep and he was with a driver beside him, and there were two soldiers in the rear. Correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, that is what I said. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when -- on Friday, in answer to the question put to you by Prosecution counsel, you gave the answer I am going to read out to you, and I would like you to tell me after reading that portion whether there is an inconsistency between what you said then and what you are saying now. 
You -- this is what Prosecution counsel said: "You said Mr. Renzaho came with Odette Nyirabagenzi. So tell us in which vehicle they went to Angeline Mukandituye's place?" 
And this was your answer: "They left in one vehicle".
But Witness, this morning you have forgotten about Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, you had asked me to tell you about those people who had come in those vehicles. You did not ask me who had gone to Angeline's place. If you had put that question to me, I would have mentioned Odette. I am doing what the President has asked me to do, that is, to answer your question. 
If you had asked me who had attended that meeting pre the CELA attack, I would have answered you. But I answered the question you put to me, Counsel. You did not ask me whether Odette was there for me to tell you yes or no. You did not ask me who had attended that meeting. I am ready to give you the names of all the people who attended that meeting. So there is no inconsistency between the answer I gave Prosecution counsel and what I am telling you. I did not tell you that Odette did not attend that meeting. Neither did I tell you that she did not participate at that attack. You asked me that question regarding those two officers only. Is that not so, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, my problem is elsewhere. You described the arrival of Mr. Renzaho on board a jeep, and you indicated who were -- who were the people who were with him, and I fail to understand why this does not tally with the description you provided on Friday and when you were placing Odette in the same vehicle as Mr. Renzaho. What do you say to that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I said that Odette was with Renzaho. So Odette left with Renzaho when they were going to CELA. Tharcisse Renzaho, the PVK préfet, left with Mrs. Odette Nyirabagenzi. And when they arrived at the meeting, they left on board the vehicles I referred to. And I told you that on some occasions, Odette would come with her own car. But at the time they were leaving for CELA, they left together. So there was -- there's no inconsistency compared to what I said to the Prosecutor. What I'm doing is that I'm providing further explanations on what I already testified. I promised that I would provide all the explanations necessary for things to be crystal clear. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, to conclude on this matter: How did Odette Nyirabagenzi arrive at Angeline Mukandituye's house? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. We did not check how Nyirabagenzi arrived, and it was not our task to check Angeline Mukandituye's comings and goings. But regarding Odette Nyirabagenzi, she could arrive at Angeline Mukandituye's house at any time, and we were not to check how she would arrive there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, since you are referring to Major Munyakaze, could you tell the Trial Chamber what he was doing when you were all in CELA on this 22nd of April 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. You are asking me what Major Laurent Munyakaze was doing, but I thought I explained to you previously that I was not the one to give orders to these officers. The orders would come from above, and would then be obeyed by the lower rungs, so I was not to pay attention to what the officers were doing. Perhaps you should ask me what orders they gave us. And I stated previously that if you were to ask me whether Renzaho had taken a firearm and shot down a person in my presence, I would tell you that I had never seen him do such a thing, but that, rather, he would give orders to our superiors, who in turn would give those orders to us. 
But let me say that Angeline Mukandituye, Odette Nyirabagenzi, Laurent Munyakaze, Renzaho, and Bivamvagara were always mentioned in my trial. They were part of the same plan and they had the same objective, and the objective was reached. Whether we were talking about the leaders of our secteur or the other people who collaborated with us, among which Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, they all participated in this plan to kill the Tutsis, and I am ready to explain how they participated in this plan and what was their part. I was not the one to give orders, and I was not the one to entrust tasks to them. That was not my role at all. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, it is indeed what the Defence would like you to do, describe this role. On Friday you told us more or less what Mr. Renzaho was doing. Now I'm asking you where Major Munyakaze was and what he was doing while you were busy doing what you described to us on Friday. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Renzaho would -- was doing the same thing as Major Munyakaze, as well as what Angeline Mukandituye and Odette Nyirabagenzi were doing. Because their task was to supervise us in this operation of the killing of the Tutsis, like they had planned. But please do not put questions to me on their intentions or on the other actions of these people. I simply concentrated on the operation we were conducting, and we reached our objective. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you are saying that they were doing as the others were doing, what do you mean, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Well, that is no secret. We were killers, and we would receive orders from these people. They were killers just as we were. They were the ones who would give us orders, they were the ones who sensitised us to commit killings. You should not try to take them out of our group. They were killers, just as we were, because they led us to kill innocent Tutsis. I told you before what our objective was, but they had a plan which had been set up beforehand. They were leaders, but I could not be aware of their true objectives. I was not the one to give orders to them. They were the ones who would give orders to us. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, these people, that is to say Mr. Renzaho and Mr. Munyakaze, what was their position when they would give you orders? And did they also address the refugees? Could you be more specific in your description of the events? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I already provided explanations on this event in my statement. They were standing in the courtyard of CELA and they did not speak to the refugees since they had come animated with ill-intentions. They had arrived there with the objective of committing killings. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And do you know whether the refugees you were selecting were able to address them? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you. But how could the refugees have talked to them when we were beating them up and when we were leading them to their deaths? The refugees could not even have approached them. We were the ones who were beside them, and we were the ones to sort out those refugees that were to be killed. And let me specify that they had not come there to talk to the refugees. They had come there, rather, to supervise the selection of those among the refugees who were to be put to death. And it was not out of pity that they were there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you testified on Friday that there were more than 100 refugees, which means that when you sorted out 70 out of the 100 refugees, there were not that many refugees left. Am I correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I did not pay attention to the number of refugees who remained there, but I was rather paying attention to the number of refugees we abducted and we killed subsequently. Whether there were few or many who remained there, that was not my concern. My concern was what we were doing in order for me to be able to report to those who were giving orders to us. There are people who survived this operation, just as there were survivors from other attacks we carried out. 
So I tried to give an estimation of the number of people we abducted, and the figure I gave you was of around 60 to 70 people. And I also specified that at the outset there were approximately 100 of them. But I also said that I had not counted them and that what I was providing was merely an estimate. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, do you recall whether among the people you abducted on that day, there was one Vincent Mugiraneza? Which is spelt M-U-G-I-N-A-N-E-Z-A (sic), Mugiraneza. Do you recall whether Vincent was amongst them? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. When we abducted these people, we did not note down their names in any record book for me to be able to tell you today whether he was indeed one of those we abducted. So my answer is quite simple: I can give you the names of the people I was able to identify amongst those we abducted. But as far as I know, I never made mention of Mugiraneza's name among the names of those people who were abducted on that day. It might be that this Mugiraneza was among those we abducted, but I never made such a statement, and I believe I never referred to this name in my statement. Would you, by any chance, have read that name in one of my statements? 
Counsel, I believe I'm still young and I believe I can still remember what I stated in my previous testimonies. I confess that I perpetrated punishable acts, but I do recall the names of the people I referred to in my previous statements. And as far as I know, this name was not mentioned by me. However, I did give another name, that is to say, that of Zorro, and I would like to say once again that I'm here to speak the truth. I am repeating what I said during my previous statements. I requested that the Tribunal add the name of Zorro to the list I had provided previously. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have Zorro from Friday. But now we must ensure that we do not simply repeat what we have heard before, but that we get the additional elements that we need. So you must be briefer with your answers, Mr. Witness, and Defence counsel will focus on what he thinks is the essential. 
Here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you, however, have the opportunity to talk about Vincent Mugiraneza in your own trial? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Did you say Vincent Mugiraneza? Many questions were put to me, and I provided a lot of information which was useful to those who were affected by the genocide. I believe the minutes of my trial could be covered in hundreds and hundreds of pages. It is not only on Renzaho that I provided information. But I am not ready to provide information contained in my trial statements, and I would not like such information to be disclosed today and be used against me in my own trial. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, on that 22nd of April of 1994, were you able to see Father Munyeshyaka at CELA? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No, I did not see him. I did specify where I saw Munyeshyaka, but I did not see him at CELA on that date. I already gave you the list of those who were present and whom I saw. Let me say, simply, that I saw Jean Bizimana, who was the bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune. So it was not Wenceslas Munyeshyaka. And there are other people who have been charged with crimes -- or, who are being prosecuted, amongst which Gatsinzi and Bajinya, as well as Wenceslas Munyeshyaka himself, but I would not wish to mention the names here. Perhaps I should focus on those facts for which his collaboration with Renzaho has been proven. And I believe I shall limit myself to that, that is to say those events where Renzaho -- or, the events Renzaho has been charged with, and I would not like to talk about Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, because his trial has not commenced. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, once again, please try to focus in your answers. Don't give these additional lengthy explanations. Now, did you just refer to Mr. Gatsinzi? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, I did mention his name, and I would ask you to put that name under seal because I did not wish to provide such information. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then there was another name you mentioned just after that name. Can you repeat that name, please? This is in the context of people who are being prosecuted. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, I referred to Vincent Bajinya, and I also talked about Jean Bizimana, whose trials have not started. So I gave three names. I talked about Gatsinzi, about Bizimana and Bajinya. But I would humbly ask that the names be put under seal, because their trials have not yet started. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have the spelling of that name? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you help us with that last name, please, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Bajinya is spelt B-A-J-I-N-Y-A. Bajinya. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when you state having seen Mr. Jean Bizimana, the former bourgmestre, let us call him that way, do you remember exactly when you saw him? Did he arrive while Mr. Renzaho was still on the site, or not? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. It is clear, even in my statement, Bizimana arrived once Renzaho had left. And in my statement I also referred to questions that were put to him upon his arrival, as well as to the answers he provided. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And when Mr. Renzaho was leaving, did he leave with Major Munyakaze, and had the refugees you had sorted out already been taken away? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. There were three successive phases to our operation. First we had the refugees come out, then we selected them, then we beat them. And after that we put them on board vehicles and went off to kill them. We took the refugees out in the presence of Renzaho. We selected them and we started beating them, and it is at that point that Angeline ordered that we take them to CND to kill them. And the order was given in the presence of Renzaho. We were strong enough, we had weapons, and it was obvious that the refugees would not oppose us. So Renzaho had no reason to go with us -- or, stay with us until the end of the operation. So that was what happened. Unless you are disputing the existence of such an operation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you are stating that you were the last one to remain on the site, and you are not in a position to tell the Trial Chamber what came of the refugees who had stayed there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you. The refugees who remained after we took the group I already mentioned away, those who remained were not worried, because no one attacked the refugees who remained there. But let me say that it was a real ordeal for the refugees who remained there. Some tried to take refuge at the Saint Paul centre, and the others disbursed. I was even able to see some of the refugees at the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille site, because they disbursed after that operation was conducted. 
And I recall that one of these refugees went to Bourgmestre Jean Bizimana, and the name of that person was Rose Murorunkwere, and she was the wife of Charles Rwanga who had been selected to be abducted. And on that occasion the lady asked Bizimana, "Where did you take our family members?" Bizimana did not answer, and sometime later Bizimana left. So this is what I stated previously. That lady's husband had been selected amongst those who were abducted to be killed. 
***************************************, passing -- or, rather, using the tarmac road at the location called Péage, and I even saw dead bodies at that location. It took me 15 minutes to go to the area where the killings were taking place and which had been nicknamed CND. I shall stop here in order not to repeat myself. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have had Rose in the courtroom previously, but could you kindly repeat the spelling of that name, Mr. Witness? Her last name. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Her surname is Murorunkwere, which is spelt M-U-R-O-R-U-N-K-W-E-R-E. Murorunkwere. And her first name was Rose. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I have two further questions to conclude on this matter, and I believe it would be better to deal with it now so that we can deal with a separate matter when we resume. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you know whether on this 22nd of April 1994 there were gendarmes guarding CELA when you arrived? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. When I arrived there, I did not see any gendarmes. I only saw the Interahamwe who were participating in the operation. I did not see any gendarmes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, on the 21st of April, CELA was guarded by gendarmes, but not on the 22nd; is that your testimony? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I do not know whether there were gendarmes watching over the centre. I told you about the gendarmes who were at the gate and who did not want to open to us, and -- open the gates to us and who were subsequently shot down. But I did not try to ascertain whether the centre was guarded by gendarmes or not. And on the 22nd of April, I did not see any. Let me say that even on the 21st, I only saw the two gendarmes who had been -- who were shot down. I do not know whether the commanders of the gendarmerie had sent other gendarmes to protect the centre. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I believe perhaps this time would be fitting to deal -- to break, because I shall deal with other matters once we resume. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
Now, you gave a list, Prosecution, of the witnesses for this week a couple of days ago. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You mentioned six pseudonyms. Did they all arrive? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm afraid I don't have the list that I gave. I think it -- as I explained to my learned friend, Mr. Cantier, this morning, there may be one person who's going to be brought forward from next week, and that is GLE, who has in fact arrived earlier than expected. So we are now looking at, after this witness, DBN, followed by BUX, who is not in fact a protected witness. Her name is Corinne Dufka, and the Defence are aware of that. Followed by ACS. And then it's possibly GLE, if that witness is ready. If not, AWE. Then ATQ and HAD are also lined up for this week. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. And the last name of BUX, can you spell that, please? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
D-U-F-K-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. So, our next witness is then DBN. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the estimated duration for the rest of this cross-examination now? The witness is probably waiting in the waiting room? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, he's been here since 8:30. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I believe I will have one hour more at the maximum.

Most obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us now look at your first major attack at the Saint Paul centre. And in order for us to discuss this issue such that there would be no misunderstanding between us, I would like you to confirm to the Chamber the date of the attack. As far as you remember, was that first major attack at Saint Paul centre in the month of May or the month of June 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The last major attack which we launched against the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church was after the Inkotanyi had released or freed the refugees who were at those places. I think the Inkotanyi came to that place in June, not in May. That was the last attack we launched against those two places, the last major attack. In fact, the most significant attack. And it was during that last attack that many refugees were killed. We do not have the exact number because some of them were killed during the night, and the others the following day in the month of June. I believe I explained this last time. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness. You are talking about the last attack, but my question to you was about the first attack against the Saint Paul centre. As far as you remember, was it in May or in June 1994? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
The first attack took place in May. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. And was it during that attack that you came with a list of people wanted at the Saint Paul centre? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. It was during that attack that we used the list bearing, amongst others, Rukundo's name. In fact, you are right. That was the first attack against the Saint Paul centre during which we took away Rukundo and the others. There were two attacks; the first one during which there was community work done, and another attack launched after the RPF had attacked the Saint Paul centre. I don't quite understand which attack you are referring to, Counsel, the first or the second. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am referring to the first, Witness, and you have answered. I simply want you now to confirm a last point. Was it indeed that list that was signed by Mr. Jean Bizimana? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, I did not mention Mr. Jean Bizimana's signature, if you remember properly. I, rather, talked about Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho's signature in relation to the murder of Kameya. I think you are mixing up things here, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, that list which you had with you that day was not signed by any of those people? Not by Tharcisse Renzaho, not by Jean Bizimana? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I explained to you how Angeline and Odette were not able to agree on the people to be killed. One of them said it was necessary to kill everybody, and the other person said, no, only those whose names were on the list were to be killed. When Renzaho came they showed him their list, and it was on that occasion that the decision was taken to go by Angeline's list. That was Renzaho's decision. You see, Odette and Angeline could not agree, so it was Renzaho who solved that problem. I explained to you how they went close to him. I wonder if you did not construe me properly. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, now, please tell this Court whether there was any signature at the bottom of that list. That is a new question I am putting to you. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I really don't know why you are focussing on this signature. Let us, rather, talk about the operations which were carried out. Let us talk about the people who were killed. I wonder whether you are challenging the fact that Renzaho was there? Were you there? I don't know. Let us not talk about the signature. The list was there, and I saw it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you are coming back to your bad habits. We don't want argumentation; we want answers to the question. The question he is asking is very relevant. Now, the question is: "Did you see that list yourself, and if so, was there a signature on the bottom of that document?" 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I actually saw the list which was in the hands of Madam Mukandituye, but there was no signature on that list. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, when you spoke in your evidence-in-chief about a document signed by Bizimana, you were referring to the arrest of the journalist, isn't it? The arrest of a certain Michel, who you said was a journalist, when you go inside for reconnaissance. Is that the document you are referring to? I think we are all mixed up about this signature. At least to my recollection, that's the only document you said was signed by Bizimana for Prefect Renzaho. Am I right or wrong? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Your Honour, in my evidence I talked about a document signed by Renzaho, and which was in the hands of Odette Nyirabagenzi when we were going to look for André Kameya at the Sainte Famille church. That was not a list which had been given to Michel. Michel, rather, had a picture of Kameya. 
And, Your Honour, I think Defence counsel's question concerned the attack against the Saint Paul centre. We were not yet at the level of the incident concerning Mr. Kameya. So that document was in connection with what had happened concerning Kameya.

Thank you, Counsel. Angeline was our leader. I cannot know who had given the list to her. We were simply following instructions we had been given. She showed us the list without explaining who had given the list to her. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I'm going to read to you a portion of your statement of 12th of September 2006, given to investigators of the Prosecutor, in which statement I believe you are referring to that first attack against Saint Paul centre, after which you will tell me what you think about it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
The K number of that statement -- actually, I'm on page 8 of the French version of that statement, Your Honour, with the K reference K0378075. K0378075 for the French version. And the portion I want to refer to is the first and sixth lines of paragraph 3 on that page. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are now referring to a previous witness statement of this witness, which apparently is dated the 12th of September 2006. Was that what we just heard you say? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Quite so, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If you look on page 7 of the summary in the Prosecution's bundle, there are two witness statements of this witness -- or, one dated the 9th of August 2006. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, actually, I think he signed just one statement, though he was interviewed several times, and the date he signed the document was 12th of September 2006. I think -- as far as I am concerned, that was the only document disclosed to the Defence concerning this witness. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, it's a mistake in the summary. The date is the 12th of September; it is the only statement of this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. And now the pagination number, not the K reference. Can you help us with that? What is the page number? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, unless this is a mistake as well, it should be 1968 for the English, and 1980 for the French, which is what my learned friend is referring to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, now we have it. Page 8 of the French version. 
There is only an English copy in my bundle. Has anyone got the French version? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I have the French, but I don't have a copy of it. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we could try page 8 of the English version, the bottom of page 8. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I think the French version comes in after the English version. The pagination number, Mr. President, is PG001975. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It would have been nice to find the French version there; it is not. Now I have page 8 of the English version as suggested by the interpreter, thank you. 
And what is the first sentence of that paragraph, just to find it in the English version. Can you help me? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the first sentence is "Sometime in June 1994", in the English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Very good, thank you. Let's start now. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, I am going to read out to you a small excerpt of that statement, starting as follows: "Sometime in June 1994, I was involved in an attack on Saint Paul centre at which Renzaho was present." I am going to skip what follows, because it is of no interest to me, and I will move to the next sentence. 
Well, let me read everything. "...at which Renzaho was present." And you continue as follows: "I am not sure of the precise date. Myself and about 50 other Interahamwe and many local people arrived at the Saint Paul at about 7 a.m. on the orders of Angeline Mukandituye, who had given us a list of Tutsi people to find and kill. When we arrived at the Saint Paul, we could not find Father Munyeshyaka, whom we needed to help us to locate our victims." 
Let me stop the reading and put two questions to you, Witness. Question number one: Was it in June or in May 1994 that the attack took place, or are you referring to another attack? 
Question number two: Was it not Father Munyeshyaka who drew up that list and subsequently gave it to you? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church site were attacked many times. But regarding the Saint Paul centre, I mentioned two attacks. The first one was launched under the guise of the community development work called umuganda, and the second one was the one following the raid launched by RPF troops. 
Concerning the list, it was not Munyeshyaka who drew it up. It is true that Munyeshyaka was working together with us, but he was not the one who prepared that list. Rather, as I told you, it was Munyeshyaka who had the key of the room where Emmanuel Rukundo was. And in order to take Rukundo out of his hiding place, Yusuf (phonetic) Mazimpaka had to put on the cassock of a priest so as to mislead Emmanuel Rukundo. So, there were two attacks, the first of which took place in May, and the second in June. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That attack which, in your statement, you place in June 1994, and which concerned a list in the presence of Renzaho, according to you, would that one be during the first attack or the second attack? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
That list was used during the first attack. During the second attack, there was no list. I don't know how what I said was recorded, but I am giving you an account of the operation like someone who was present in and participated in the attack, or the operation. I am saying this to you because I was a player, but you should understand that I was not the one who recorded my statement. 
So I am explaining to you how the two operations were conducted. We launched the first attack in May, and there was a second attack in June at that same centre, as well as the Sainte Famille church. And each of those attacks had a specific objective. That, however, does not rule out the fact that there were other attacks launched by small groups with their own objectives. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Am I to consider that the Prosecutor has included a wrong statement in your statement dated 12th of September 2006? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I do not know whether it was the Prosecutor who took note of my statement. I told you under what circumstances my statement was given, and I do not know how this statement was processed. But you should not concentrate on the amendments or possible manipulations on this statement, but you should, rather, focus on the testimony I am giving today. Because I am speaking as a person who was present on the site and who acted. I provided sufficient explanations to you. I do know that sometimes there might be problems which arise from the translation, but I am present in this courtroom today and I would like you to take into account the version of the events -- the account of the events I am giving to you today. 
The operations took place, and I am not the only person who is in a position to tell you what happened. I was not the only attacker. And on the side of the survivors, there were a number of people who survived. There are other persons who are in a position to confirm what I am stating. Perhaps you should focus on the explanations I am providing. I am present before you today, and I am willing to give you all the explanations you might require because I was there when the operations took place. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I must again appeal to you, Mr. Witness, not to give these long answers. Just answer the questions without the comments, and then your testimony will soon be over. All right? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Very well, Mr. President. But if I give long answers, it is because the questions given to me by Defence counsel require that such long explanations be given, because he was not present and he needs to understand what occurred during the operations. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
Next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, were you aware, on that date, of who -- of which priest was in charge of the Saint Paul centre? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, we knew who we were working with, it was Munyeshyaka. Don't put questions to me on the responsibilities of the other priests; I am not aware of them. We would collaborate with Father Munyeshyaka, and he was ready to grant us all that we requested from him. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And on that day you did not see any other priest on the site? Since Father Munyeshyaka was not there, did you find another priest? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I told you about the people we would collaborate with during that time, but that does not mean that Munyeshyaka was not present on the site and that we did not see him. This does not, either, mean that we had problems in the conduct of our operation. We decided to have the people we were looking for come out, and we were able to reach our objective. But I did not see any other priest. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when you went to the Saint Paul centre on that day, you did not find any gendarmes or leaders there, and you immediately entered the premises with your list; is that what we are to understand? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I explained how we entered the Saint Paul centre for that first attack, with the pretext of carrying out umuganda. We were with the Interahamwe, as well as the members of the population, and I already explained to you what our objective was. So we did not need anyone. We entered the centre and we started to seek -- or, to hunt down the Inyenzi, the pretext being that they would shoot at us all night long. And if you wish for me to repeat my explanation, I shall do so, just as I did on the previous occasion when the question was put to me. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us now move on to the case of journalist André Kameya. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, may I ask you for clarification. You said that: "Father Munyeshyaka was ready to grant us all that we requested from him". What did you mean by that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka is one of the people who assisted us in our operations, in the killings we would perpetrate in the religious centres. And as I stated previously, the information on the Tutsis who were at the Saint Paul centre, or at Sainte Famille, or CELA, were provided by Munyeshyaka to Angeline. And that would enable us to prepare our operations. Furthermore, Munyeshyaka is one of the people we would go to in order to locate the people we were looking for. He would provide information to us, and the information he provided would be reliable and would enable us to locate the Tutsis we were looking for, and then we would go and kill them. 
So Wenceslas Munyeshyaka is one of those who provided assistance to us, and he also delivered foodstuffs to us. During that period, Munyeshyaka would deliver some foodstuffs to us, and the foodstuffs were kept in containers located at the Saint Paul centre. And there was porridge, for example, that he would deliver to us. Munyeshyaka was a great friend of Angeline's and he always assisted us because he was quite active. And when we were trying to enter the site of Sainte Famille church, he did not oppose that because he was collaborating with us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I also thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, since you are referring to Father Munyeshyaka, did you know that at the time he supplied the refugees who were in the area, under the control of the RPF, with goods, foodstuffs? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I was not aware of that. All that I can tell you on this matter is that the refugees who were given food were the Hutu refugees who were in the courtyard. And I can give you the name of the individual who would provide the foodstuffs to these refugees. He made a number of statements on Munyeshyaka, on Renzaho, as well as on the person who was in charge of the store at the time. And you can also interview Augustin Rutabana, who was responsible for the feeding of the Hutu refugees. 
You are referring to the food -- the assistance in terms of food provided to the Tutsi refugees, but that was no concern of mine. My task was to kill them. And when I arrived on the location, I do not believe I even saw -- I do not believe they even had water to drink. So this is my answer to your question, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the witness has referred to a name and I do not know whether the Trial Chamber would like it to be spelt out before I continue. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It may not be available in both languages. Can you help us to identify the name, please? Are you referring to the name starting with Augustin? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do we agree, Mr. Witness, that that is spelt R-U-T-A-B-A-N-A? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, to conclude on this aside on Father Munyeshyaka. As far as you know, were there refugees in Sainte Famille who died of hunger? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I would go to that centre to abduct the refugees we would subsequently kill. Perhaps some of them died of hunger or of thirst, because all those refugees were Tutsis, and Munyeshyaka did not like them and did not want to see them at that location, and they were in a centre that was led by him. I already told you about the group of refugees who were given assistance and the other group who were not. My mission was to kill the Tutsis, it was not to determine whether the Tutsis had received food or drink. Under such circumstances, there might have been some of them who died of hunger, and there are even Tutsis who died of hunger in their very own houses because they could not supply themselves with food. So I cannot deny that there might have been refugees who died of hunger on those sites where refugees were harboured. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us come back to the issue of journalist André Kameya. You testified before this Trial Chamber that a photograph of this journalist had been provided -- brought to you while you were on your reconnaissance mission. Am I correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Counsel, me and the people who were with me from **************************, were conducting a reconnaissance mission that was -- that we were ordered to carry out by Angeline. So we were looking for those Tutsis who had escaped from us, so we did not go with Michel on this reconnaissance mission. He found us there, and that is why I paid attention to the reason for which he was coming there. And he arrived with a photograph of André Kameya. This is what I testified to. I have just explained to you why I was there and under what circumstances Michel joined us on the site. I asked him what was happening, and he gave me explanations, and then we went to the vehicle in which Angeline was. We had André Kameya aboard the vehicle, and the vehicle went back. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So what you called "reconnaissance mission" at the time was, in fact, looking for those Tutsis who had escaped. Am I correct? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, that is correct, because our mission was to hunt them down and kill them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You stated that Angeline would read out the contents of the document where André Kameya's name was and which also bore Mr. Renzaho's signature. Were you able to hear what Odette Nyirabagenzi was reading out on that day? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. You are mistaken. There is a confusion between Odette Nyirabagenzi's name and Angeline. It was Odette Nyirabagenzi who brought Kameya and not Angeline. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, I meant Odette. Please answer my question. 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please remember the speed, Mr. Witness. Not too fast. And now the question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, I was asking whether you had heard Odette Nyirabagenzi reading out the document where the name of Mr. Kameya and Mr. Renzaho's signature appeared? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. This will be my answer. Apart from the fact that I did see André Kameya's name and that I saw Renzaho's name at the bottom of the document, as I stated, I did not pay attention -- or, rather, I did not read the whole document. And that was the explanation I gave you, because it was not my responsibility to supervise those who were, in fact, my superiors. Odette was one of my superiors, and it is for that reason that I stated having seen that a document was given to Odette and that I saw her reading the document when she was in the cabin of the vehicle. And on that document there was André Kameya's name and at the bottom of the document there was Renzaho's name. And it is for that reason that I stated in no uncertain terms that it was Renzaho who had handed over André Kameya to Odette. So this was what I was an eyewitness to, and the operation was carried out by myself and those who were with me. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, was Odette reading that document out loud for those who were around her or in silence, and in what language was the document written? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. There was no one else following what she was reading because her mission was to locate André Kameya. She located him and she took him elsewhere. So she would not have been reading out the document to me. She was reading the document to herself, and when I took a look at the document, I saw the two names. If anyone were to give you a different version of the facts, you should consider it a lie, because I am testifying on events I participated in and events I eyewitnessed. I would not wish to mislead the Trial Chamber. These are the events I witnessed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you referred to Laetitia Kameya when you -- when questions were put to you on André Kameya. When was it that you got to know Laetitia Kameya? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I met Laetitia Kameya after the war. And when we asked what was the relationship between that Laetitia and André Kameya, those who were with me told me that there was indeed -- that they were indeed related. But let me say that the person who was killed was André Kameya. And when I heard Laetitia Kameya's name subsequently, I was just curious and wished to know whether there was any relationship between that Laetitia and the André Kameya who had been killed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you also come to learn that André Kameya had a son whose name was Olivier? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I did not carry out any investigations on the family members of André Kameya, but we were asked to say what we had done and to also mention the incidents we had witnessed. I had no other reason to take interest in the family members of Kameya. I therefore don't know whether he has a son or not. I do not know him. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I have in my possession a document which I will have circulated in the courtroom. It is an article dated 28th of August to -- 28th of August 1995 from Reporters sans Frontières in which Mr. Kameya's death or the circumstances thereof are described. I shall first have the document distributed and then I shall put questions to you on the events that are contained in the said article. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Page and paragraph, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I shall focus on a small part of page 20 and a brief part of page 21, and I shall not go any further. This is what I would like to bring to the attention of the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And on page 20, we start with which paragraph? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
We shall start with the last-but-one paragraph, where it is said, "At the time, an officer in the Rwandan patriotic army". On the fourth line of the last-but-one paragraph, 
"At the time, an officer in the Rwanda patriotic army Olivier Kameya." 
Fourth line, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, we found it. We just want you to continue to read. Just go ahead. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I will read out what Reporters sans Frontieres had to say about the assassination of André Kameya, and I quote: 
"At the time, an officer in the patriotic Rwandan army, Olivier Kameya, elder son of journalist André Kameya, director of Rwanda Rushya, assassinated on the 15th of June 1994 by the Interahamwe, accuses him of having told the militia members where his father was hiding. He accuses Athanasie, and Olivier Kameya is quoted, "Athanasie came to Sainte Famille under the pretext that her brothers' Interahamwe wished to kill her. Even though she was a Tutsi, Athanasie had brothers who were Interahamwe."
I shall not read out the next two lines, and go on to the last three lines of this quotation. 
"It was only when he came back to our neighbourhood that Kinyamateka, where André Kameya had sought refuge, started being attacked regularly by the same brothers of Athanasie. 'Tell us where Kameya is, since we know that he is here. We are well informed.' Would they tell the watch man." 
I shall not read out the testimony of the watchman, but will go to the last line, Mr. President, Your Honours, where we are told it has not been proven -- and this brings us to the next page -- that the latter was killed by the Interahamwe who looted Kinyamateka. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I think that misrepresents what the document says. It actually says "it isn't established". It is no more established that this last person was killed by the Interahamwe that looted Kinyamateka. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Where we are told that, "It has not been proven" (French spoken). Just as he said in French, we have it in English. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I am sorry, I didn't hear that said in French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. No, he has spoken quite correctly. But do we have it correctly on the record now? 
Why don't we do that again so there is no ambiguity? Will you do that please? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I am obliged to take the time to read the entire last paragraph for the purposes of consistency. So I am going to read that last paragraph, which says as follows: 
"The watchman, Vincent Murefu" -- spelt M-U-R-E-F-U -- "partly confirms this observation of the account, especially the information to the effect that one of the militiamen who regularly attacked the head office of the Kinyamateka was most likely a brother to Athanasie, but does not explicitly accuse Athanasie, who herself never went to Kinyamateka. In fact, I wanted to end at this stage, because page 21 is just a comment from Reporters sans Frontieres and is of no interest to me. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So I would like to stop at this stage here, and to tell you, Witness, André Kameya's own son states that his father was flushed out from Kinyamateka and subsequently killed. But you are stating that it was at Saint Paul that you saw him and handed him over to Odette. What do you have to say to the proposition I am putting to you? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I mentioned the Sainte Famille site and I maintain my evidence. We saw her at -- saw him at the Sainte Famille church, not at the Saint Paul centre. And, as you just read in this document, the person or persons talking are not categorical, but I am telling you of an incident which I witnessed. I will understand you if you put it to me that André Kameya was not abducted. But I am describing to you the beginning of the operation, how it unraveled, and what the objective was. I gave you information regarding the circumstances under which the refugees were abducted from the CELA centre, the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church. But you are telling me that those persons may not have been at the Sainte Famille church. But I am really at a loss here because whenever I want -- or whenever I have to repeat my testimony, it pains me. You see, the version I am giving you is what I had already given you because I was there. I participated in the operation. I was a member of Interahamwe, and I was the one participating at that operation. Who else is better placed to tell you of the attacks than me? I know the people who attacked the Kinyamateka building. One of the attackers is called André Mugisha, and I can even give you the contents of his confession. I can give you a copy of the confessions made regarding the massacres perpetrated in Rugenge secteur. Rugenge is where I was born, where I grew up. I know that area very well. And some of the people committing those killings were people of the same age as me, people with whom I grew up. Counsel, kindly take my version because it is the one which corresponds with the reality. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What happened a few minutes ago was that we read out something where there was an objection because of lack of clarity. Then we recapitulated this, but by reading out the first part of the section, not the lines on which there was an objection. Now, in order to dispel any doubt, even if it is true, as Defence counsel said, that the following two lines are comments by Reporters san Frontiers and not quotes from witnesses, I still think you should read those two lines so that we have this in context, otherwise the record will be unclear. Can you read, kindly, from (no interpretation). 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am going to read it, Mr. President. 
"So there is no witness, nor is there evidence that Athanasie allegedly told the Interahamwe where Kameya was hiding. Neither has it been proven that the latter was killed by the Interahamwe who looted Kinyamateka." 
The Defence is not disturbed by this portion, Mr. President, given that it will have the opportunity to establish that it was indeed at Kinyamateka where Mr. André Kameya was found and subsequently killed.
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, it would be my wish for your answers to be shorter, but I am not going to interrupt you. Just move on as you want. 
Do you remember, Witness, that during your own trial, the André Kameya matter was referred to and people were tried and judged regarding that matter? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I was not charged in connection with Mr. Kameya's murder. And I explained what happened regarding the accusations brought against me. So, Mr. Kameya's case does not concern me. I was not asked to give explanations regarding that incident. I simply gave explanations regarding my own case, regarding specific questions put to me -- (Microphones overlapping). 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
In order for us to move on, let me tell you what answer I am expecting from you. Perhaps I misput my question. During your own trial, were there certain people tried on account of the events at the CELA and the Sainte Famille? Were there 56 co-accused with you or not? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. You are right. There were other accused persons -- co-accused at my trial. But some of them were not tried, either because they were not in the country or because they are dead. But look at the document containing my confession, especially the top of the last page, and you will see the answer to your question. It is true that there were people who were found guilty regarding those crimes. I can give you their names. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the answer to that question, was "yes", simply. Here is the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, on that occasion, did you hear any mention of the case of the one Ntambara, Daniel -- N-D-A-M-B-A-R-A (sic), first name Daniel. Did you hear any mention of his case or did you follow his trial in one way or the other? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I did not follow Daniel Ntambara's trial and I did not hear of him. I don't know Ntambara. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So if I were to put it to you that Daniel Ntambara is the one who admitted to have abducted Mr. André Kameya from Kinyamateka and killed him on the orders of Odette Nyirabagenzi, what would you say to that? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Now, you acknowledge that Kameya was abducted by Odette. I know nothing about Ntambara. I have told you the truth, and I notice that you have started understanding the truth. I am not changing anything to my evidence because I was there. I know nothing of the other people you are talking to me about. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, my proposition to you is that Daniel Ntambara acknowledged having abducted André Kameya from Kinyamateka, not from the Sainte Famille site as you are saying. What do you have to say to that? Whether Odette was at the centre of those two operations does not change anything. What is your reaction when Ntambara confesses to the crime, whereas you keep on saying what you think? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I am not telling you what I think, I am giving you an account of what happened. I know nothing about what you are saying. I am giving you an account of things I witnessed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you ever heard of Daniel Ntambara, Mr. Witness? Yes or no. 
@WITNESS BUO:
No, never. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us now move to the ultimate face of your war campaign, that is, that much talked about attack of the Inkotanyi of the night of the 16th to the 17th, and on that occasion you were indeed at the front. Isn't that so? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
I have explained to you where I was. I believe my explanations were quite limpid. How could I have gone to the front, whereas I was an Interahamwe? The soldiers, gendarmes and Interahamwe worked together to prevent Inyenzi infiltrations. I told you of the person who moved from one roadblock to the other explaining to us the operations which we had to carry out. And I told you that on that day ******************* Interahamwe activities at the roadblocks. On that day, Claude did not work, and I remember mentioning Lieutenant Cadence's name. Our duty was to stop Tutsi or other people who did not have identity cards during the day and kill them. And during the night we were to stay at the roadblocks. And the other people assisted us in making sure no Inyenzi could escape from us. I was not at the front. I was not a soldier. I don't know whether that is what you mean by "being at the front", Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, during that night, what tactical arrangement did you make, together with the soldiers who you were with. And before answering you (sic), I would like to tell you that on page 28 of your transcript -- of the transcript of the trial of Friday, on lines 3 and 4, this is what you say: "Whether it was a night attack or the attack the following day, I participated in those two attacks because it was a front, it was a war, and we operated as if it was a war." So I am simply reading back to you your utterances, Witness. And now I am asking you, since it was a war, what tactical arrangements did you employ? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I will not change anything in my testimony, rather, I will buttress it with more details. The Inkotanyis attacked the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church. I told you that they prevented us from shooting at them when they entered, and to wait until they went out of that centre. That is the information you were seeking, Counsel. I told you the location where we buried the people who were killed. We buried them at the mass grave at Serutsinga's place. We shot at those Inkotanyi on their return after the attack. And you understand that they fired back. They also shot at us. They took some refugees along with them. Other refugees remained at the centre, and we killed them and buried their bodies in a mass grave which was at Mr. Serutsinga's place. Another thing, when Cadence told us to gear up for that attack, he told us to be careful not to go to the Inkotanyi zone so as to avoid being killed. So we had a discussion together on how to properly conduct the operation, given that the Inkotanyi had come to our zone. 
I explained to you how we shot at those Inkotanyi, and how the following morning we went and launched an attack against the Tutsi refugees who were in those centres. I believe I have been elaborate enough. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And at the end of that entire battle, there were only two persons killed amongst the Inkotanyi, and none of you were killed? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
We were firing at the Inkotanyi, who were running and who were taking some refugees with them. None of us died. And the Inkotanyi were not dressed in their usual uniforms. Subsequently, we realised that they were in RPA trousers. That is how we were able to recognise those two Inkotanyi who had been killed -- by their uniforms. We also killed two of the refugees who were going with the Inkotanyi. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to complete the last ten minutes in a closed session with the witness, because there were certain issues of identity which I would like to raise with him. With your leave, of course. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will do that. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 40 to 44] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera).
$(Pages 32 to 39 by Judith Baverstock)
$(Court resumed at 1450H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. 
Re-examination, please. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I wonder if the registry or somebody can move the curtain back a little so I can see the witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, before you start, I would like to request the Chamber to allow me time to handle my disclosure duties to the Prosecutor. I was saying that the document I had was from the Prosecutor -- a disclosure from the Prosecutor. And that was wrong information. So I just want to correct that impression that I gave. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that. And we will, of course, come back to the tendering of documents. As soon as we have sent this witness out of the courtroom, then we will deal with the administrative matters. But, now, we will hear the last part of the testimony. 
Prosecution?

$RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, an extract was read to you from the judgement against you, and the name Claudette Mujawabera was cited. Could you tell us, please, is that person the same as the Claude that you have mentioned many times during your testimony? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness doesn't seem to hear the interpretation. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I will repeat the question: In the extracts from the judgement against you that were cited earlier, the name Claudette Mujawabera was referred to. Could you clarify, please, for the Court, whether that person is the same or different from the character named Claude that you have talked about a lot during the course of your testimony? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Claudette Mujawabera, as you can see in the document containing my confession, was the secretary of the Interahamwe. But since there was -- since there were problems relating to this judgement that you refer to, I mentioned her name. She used to work with Angeline, Claude, and **********, and she herself recognised this -- admitted this. This you can see on the list of the directors of the Interahamwe. And you can find that at the bottom of this document that you are referring to. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So is it right then that there are two people, Claude and Claudette, one is a man and one is a woman? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
That is correct. Claudette is the wife of Simon Pierre Niyoyita, whereas Claude is a man. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We need these names, now. Let's start with the last one, shall we? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
The last one it is in the document that was produced by the Defence. It's N-I-Y-O-Y-I-T-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you find that name in the three paragraphs that were read out? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, it's in the middle of those three on page 85. And there also appears the spelling of Mujawabera. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But, then, in the transcripts, we have Mujawabera referred to as a man, not a woman, whereas -- 
@WITNESS BUO:
No, Mujawabera is a woman. Claudette Mujawabera. Claude is a man. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I am aware of that, Mr. Witness, thank you. I am just reading from the English version of the transcripts. All right. That's now clarified. Is there any other name we need to spell? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Mr. Witness, we are in open session at the moment so please don't refer to the position that you were appointed to. But, when you were appointed to that position, can you recall how that appointment took place? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes, I remember. Angeline Mukandituye told me this personally and then later on she informed my colleagues. And in the evening of the 28th she explained that Claudette, too, had been appointed secretary of the Interahamwe. This was in the month of April. I was appointed to this position on the 20th of April 1994. I recall clearly. I cannot forget it. It's a date I cannot forget. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And when you were in that position was there any special clothing or equipment that you had that could identify you as being in that position to other members of the Interahamwe? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Defence feels constrained to object at this stage, because counsel for the Prosecution should not start the examination anew. She should deal with issues that were dealt with by the witness in cross-examination and not to start a re-examination -- her examination-in-chief all over again. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the last question actually arise from cross-examination, Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
In my submission, it does, Your Honour, because it is suggested by the Defence that the witness is in some way an impostor; that he was not in the position that he was in. It is, in my submission, perfectly reasonable for me to elicit from him, as a result of that, any additional information that might convince the Judges that he isn't such an impostor. I am not intending to labour the point, at all. This is my last question, in fact, on that issue. But I would say it is completely legitimate re-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you recall the question, Mr. Witness? Can you answer, or shall I repeat? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
You can repeat the question, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
In the position that you say you were appointed to, did you have any special clothing or insignia or anything that might distinguish you -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Melluish, can't you speak more slowly? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I am sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Anything that might distinguish you in that position in the eyes of other Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
No. There was no specific insignia I might have had to show that I was holding such a position. Angeline announced it to the Interahamwe and introduced me to Claude and to Nkeshimana for us to be able to work together. There was no campaign, there were no elections, as was done in the past before the genocide. I was simply appointed during that exceptional period. And when I deemed it necessary, I even wore the uniform of the Interahamwe and used the weapons I required. But there was no specific insignia to prove to the others that I was holding such a position. And, besides, everybody knew who I was. My leaders knew, and some Interahamwe also. Those who were often at Angeline's place knew that I was holding such a position. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. Now, finally, Mr. Witness -- 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Could the registry please provide the bundle of photographs to the witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this arise from cross-examination? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Because, Your Honour, it was suggested for quite some time by the Defence in their questioning that this witness was not able to distinguish between different types of gun, and I simply want him to see if he can identify some of the guns photographed in this book. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Defence did not make use of the pictures to deal with this matter with the witness, because the Defence deems that when one has received training, one does not require any photographs in order to be able to say what training one received. So, I fail to understand why such an exercise should be carried out using the photographs. So this is why we wish to object to this procedure. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Here I am afraid I have to overrule the objection, because it is true that there are guns in these photographs, and it is arising in the sense of knowledge of guns, what we are now about, presumably, to hear. 
So which photograph do you go -- are you going to show us now, Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps if the witness could just look at the first photograph, number 1. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Are you able, Mr. Witness, to identify for the Court any of the weapons that we see -- the guns that we see photographed there? 
@WITNESS BUO: 
Yes. Yes. I can show you some specific types of weapons. There is one firearm which is held by a person who has something in his mouth, and it is an RK gun -- R4, sorry. And that person is holding the butt at his belt. So this is an R4 type of weapon, the one I am just showing you. 
There is another person who is not very tall and who is wearing a beret and a camouflage dress. That person has in his hand an Uzi gun, it was the same type of weapon that (unintelligible) had. 
And the person who is in the middle, and who is wearing a hat, a cap, also has a firearm that is not quite visible, but I can see that it is a Kalashnikov rifle There are two magazines on this last weapon which are attached with a black piece of material. 
And then at the right-hand corner, there is another R4, but I am not positive about that one. So R4, Kalashnikov, and Uzi, in the order I just indicated. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, I have no further questions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was your testimony, Mr. Witness. We have reached the end of your evidence. Thank you very much for having come the long way to Arusha to testify. We wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. 
@WITNESS BUO:
I thank you also, Mr. President. May God keep you and bless you. May peace be with you. 
$(Witness excused) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You started with the statement of 12 September 2006. You want that in English and French. The English version is signed by the witness and is the A version, French being the B version. 
Mr. Matemanga, next exhibit number for the Defence, please? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 14.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal, thank you.
$(Exhibit No. D. 14A and D. 14B admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we have the document elaborated by Reporters sans Frontieres. This document is an excerpt, namely, page 20 to 22 of a more general document. Do you know when that general document was published? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Date of publication appears on the first page, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So my question is then, really, whether the 4th of July '94 to the 28th of August '95, which is 13 months, can be considered the date of the document? My interpretation was, rather, that this was the relevant period. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. In fact, this is an annual report which was published in 1995 following work carried out from 1994 to 1995. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Published in '95. All right. That is noted. 
Ms. Melluish? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I do object to this being exhibited by the Defence. It wasn't actually shown to the witness. It was simply -- or, some of the words in it were referred to when he was asked to comment on the gist of the story. He didn't recognise the document or anything of that sort. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I am afraid we have to overrule this. It was used; it was read out. It was meant to be put to the witness, and it is legitimate to enter it. 
Next number, Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 15. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 15 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then there was the judgement of 24th October 2003, pages 85, 145, 146 and 168, plus the front page, apparently, page 1. No problem with that? 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 16.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The fact that this witness's name appears amongst many would probably lead to it being placed under separate cover? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, I think so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 16 admitted, under seal)
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the next witness is being brought in, I see that we are now approaching DBN, is that so? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it now clear that Alison Des Forges cannot testify during the present session and that there is a need to split this up? Has there been any contact between the parties concerning the timing of Alison Des Forges, if she will at all testify? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, is it all right if I intervene here? The situation is that we are awaiting the translation from her report which was filed a couple of weeks ago, from English into French. So it's not a long report. And even -- I think it's 16 pages. We have identified the material which has already been translated from the report which has been used in other reports and given that to the translation service. I think we got an indication last week that they hoped to have completed the translation by the end of last week or early this week. But that hasn't -- it hasn't come through yet, and so we'll make some inquiries this afternoon as to what progress has been made. So far as the effect of that, I suspect that my learned friends, once they receive the translation into French, I suspect they will be wanting some time to review that in French. 
She was -- Alison Des Forges was initially scheduled to come during the week of the 21st of February; that was on the basis we were doing half days. She is available the week after that. As well, I have been in touch with her the last couple of days. So she is also available during the last week of February. And I can make inquiries to see if she is available during the week after that, as well. She would be one -- if I can just indicate briefly, and put it on the record now, Your Honour -- it appears there is one of our witnesses, ACK, who we have been advised is to undergo an operation in the next week or two, and we are hoping to get a medical certificate to that effect today. And we have drafted a motion, which we will be filing once we have the medical certificate, to request that that witness's evidence be heard by way of video link from Canada. If it is subject to Your Honours' ruling in respect -- in regard to that and if that was granted, then it would be -- we would be, I think, asking for her to be given two or three weeks to recover from her operation. And, so, that last week in February or if -- first week of March might be suitable -- her evidence is not long, perhaps an hour, hour and a half of testimony, and then cross-examination. So there would be Dr. Des Forges, that witness -- Your Honours, have also indicated to date that you have not been prepared yet to admit the ************ because of concerns about it, where it came from. We appear to have tracked down the person who made the tape, and we are in the process of trying to get a statement from that person. And if that -- it may be that that evidence, which might take half an hour, we might also ask to be heard -- and we would be seeking to drop a witness, BX, who was another witness who was going to testify as to the identity of the speaker. So it would be -- there is possibly a motion to add and drop a witness, which might also -- so, potentially, if I can say, Your Honours, at the end of next week, we expect to have completed all witnesses, subject to Dr. Des Forges, the sick witness, and this brief evidence as to who recorded that audio tape. 
I can confidently advise Your Honours that, subject to any time that may be spent arguing regarding Dr. Des Forges's expertise -- which I don't know if we are going to have a voir dire as to that, as has been the case in some of her -- before some of her testimony; but, subject to that, I would not expect to take more than half a day in leading her evidence. So if -- I don't know if that assists Your Honours, perhaps half a day of testimony from her, half an hour -- if we are able to get this other witness, and Your Honours allow us to call this witness who taped, and perhaps an hour and a half, at most two hours, in respect of the witness who is currently ill. So, there is perhaps a day's evidence in chief which may -- we -- which, subject to Your Honours' -- obviously Your Honours' obligations and the Court schedules, if there was time at the end of February or beginning of March, if that was more suitable to Your Honours, I am in Your Honours' hands regarding that. I don't know if that assists you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. Do you have any comments on this, Defence, concerning timing of this -- what could be a couple of days remainder? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President. I am listening. I am trying to make my own calculations. But, for the time being, I have no specific observation to make on the projections that were given to us, especially regarding Witness Alison Des Forges. I have just heard that half a day would be sufficient to the Prosecutor to examine her. As far as we are concerned, I am not in a position to provide any estimation at this point in time because this would require that I have some knowledge of her expertise. But if the projection focuses on late February, early March, I believe that would be correct, because then we will be able to observe the 21-day deadline regarding Mrs. Des Forges and will leave us time to prepare ourselves. Because, as you well know, all the statements that she made in previous trials has been disclosed to us, and this requires a lot of work. So I have no specific objection to make on the timetable that has been proposed to us. 
$(Pages 45 to 52 by Judith Baverstock)
1525H
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All we can do now is to note what has been said, and in particular, the availability of the parties to hear the rest of the testimony, probably late February or early March. Let me simply say that the dates that have been circulated -- namely, the 26th, 27th and 28th of February -- will not be possible because some of us are away those days. So there will, then, be a need to look into the total court schedule, including Judge Arrey, who is sitting in Bikindi, and some other matters. But the window that has been mentioned should be our aim, as it's suitable to both parties. Thank you for this.
Let's, then, bring in the next witness, please. 
$(Witness entered courtroom) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS DBN:
Good afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness DBN in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth. And the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness DBN in Kinyarwanda)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The document in front of you, Mr. Witness, bears your signature, isn't that correct? 
@WITNESS DBN:
Yes, that indeed is my signature. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS DBN:
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 74. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 74 admitted, under seal)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I wonder if we could go into closed session for a matter of minutes.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will do that. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 55 to 56] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
$(Pages 53 to 53 by Vicki Eastvold)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness DBN, we are now in open session, and your examination-in-chief continues. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, as of the 7th of April -- on the 7th of April, where were you? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I was outside Camp Kanombe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
For how long did your battalion remain stationed there after the 7th of April? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I think we stayed there for about a year, because the RPF was shooting at us from Kabuga, Rusororo. And when there was sustained firing, we were forced to leave that camp. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm not sure if this is --
@WITNESS DBN: 
We stayed there for about a month. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. And when you left, where did you go to? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
We went in the direction of Kicukiro, and then towards the centre of Kigali town, and then we went to Gitarama. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
The 7th of April, did you know Tharcisse Renzaho? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I knew Renzaho because he was a member of that battalion. We know that that was before he was appointed to his new position. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what position do you mean, when you say his "new position"? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Around '87, '88, '89, he was a member of the paracommando battalion. Later, he was appointed préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture, and that is when he took leave of us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall when he was a member of that battalion, what position he held within the battalion? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
He was known as the S3. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you explain to the Court what that means, "S3"? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
S3 is someone in charge of military operations within a battalion. It is, therefore, the person who -- in other words, it is the person who is in charge of military tactics. He was also in charge of all training within the battalion. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall during that period of years what rank, or ranks, Renzaho held? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
While he was in our battalion, he was, first of all, commander. And then he was promoted to the rank of major. Those are the various ranks that he had. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And in April 1994, do you know what rank he held then? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
In April 1994 he was a lieutenant colonel. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, after the 7th of April, 1994, did you ever see Renzaho? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I saw him in the Kajagari neighbourhood downhill from the military camp. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When was this that you saw him? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I saw him before noon. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to assist with a day, or date, when you saw him? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Let me try to estimate, because that was a very long time ago. This was, I believe, two days following the death of President Habyarimana, or possibly three days later. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This neighbourhood is on the spelling list as 98, "Kajagari" spelled with an R. In other cases, sometimes it's spelled with an L, and sometimes even with an A before the K. What shall we adopt in the present case? Kajagali or Kajagari?
MS. MELLUISH: 
I've taken the spelling from the indictment, so it might be better in this case to stick with the R for consistency. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's do that for consistency. We hereby adopt number 98, on the spelling list for this trial. Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, you said you saw Renzaho in the Kajagari neighbourhood. Can you tell us what you were doing when you saw him?
@WITNESS DBN: 
I went out during that period. I was going to give supplies -- deliver supplies to the soldiers stationed in the residence of President Habyarimana. It was during that movement that I saw him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you tell us, please, where it was that you first saw Renzaho? Where was he when you first saw him? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I went out of the camp going in the direction of Kajagari. He was on the road Kigali-Kanombe, from Kigali to Kanombe, and I saw him aboard a vehicle at the turning, close to the military camp. That is, the turning -- or the junction of the road coming from the town centre, and the one coming from the military camp. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, do you think you would be able to draw us a simple map of the area you're talking about? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Since you do not know the locality, I can try to draw a sketch. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I wonder if the witness could be given some paper, and pen -- or I can give him paper if there isn't any available. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Unless there is an objection from any party, our preference would be that sketches are drawn up in connection with the preparatory meeting with the witness, and that it's just presented. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Certainly, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Almost done, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS DBN:
I'm just about finished, Mr. President. 
I've finished. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We must ask the booth, kindly, to translate a few Kinyarwandan words. 
Shall we ask some questions now, please? And then we can maybe come back to this sketch, if you need it, when it's all copied with the translation on the map. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, you drew a picture of a little car and you wrote "Renzaho". I saw that on the map. 
Is that -- did you mark that to show where you first saw him, in answer to my question, or is that showing something else? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Yes. I wanted to indicate the direction he was coming from when I saw him the first time. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And referring, if you could, to your map -- I know you haven't got it in front of you, but if you'd just tell the Court where on your map you were when you saw him there. 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I've also indicated my position by drawing a larger -- a bigger vehicle, and I wrote on that vehicle "witness". 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And at that time, can you describe what Renzaho was doing when you saw him? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
You want to know what he was doing? He was in his vehicle, and he was coming from the Kigali town centre on his way -- going the direction of Kajagari. Since I was also going in that direction, I let him go ahead of me, and I followed him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What kind of vehicle was he traveling in, if you recall? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
He was aboard a Hilux vehicle, a four-wheel drive, white in colour. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how is it that you knew that it was Renzaho in that vehicle? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I've spent sufficient number of years with him to be able to recognise him. Even at night I'm sure I can recognise him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you tell us, if you recall, was he alone or with others in that vehicle? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
In the back cabin of this vehicle, there were Interahamwes wearing kitenge. Several Interahamwes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to estimate the number? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Between 20 and 30. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you describe for us what these Interahamwe were doing? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
The Interahamwe were in the vehicle. They were singing and whistling. Some of them were almost perched on the vehicle. That is what I saw.
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall what they were singing? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
They were chanting Tubatsembetsembe, which means "Let's exterminate these Inyenzi Inkotanyi". 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, when Renzaho's vehicle reached the crossroads, in which direction did he go? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
He proceeded towards the -- he proceeded downhill. I have not indicated that on the sketch. But that was in the direction of the Kajagari neighbourhood. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You told us that you allowed him to go ahead of you, and you followed. Were there any other vehicles, or people, or anything in between your vehicle and his when you were following? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
No. There were no other vehicles between us. But when he was going downhill, there was another vehicle that came from the president's residence. I let it pass. But in the meantime, Renzaho had gone ahead, and I followed him. And between him and my vehicle -- between his vehicle and my vehicle, there was no other. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know where he went in his vehicle? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
The Kajagari neighbourhood is a trading centre, a commercial centre. He moved in that direction. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that you let him go ahead. Did you catch up with him at any point? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Yes. Since I was going further than him, I got close to his vehicle when he stopped in the Kajagari neighbourhood. And since the road was narrow, I had to stop myself. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know why the préfet's vehicle stopped? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I realised that the vehicle stopped, and the Interahamwe were -- who were at the rear of the vehicle got off and went into the various houses. I saw the Interahamwe entering the buildings. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you say you realised that the vehicle stopped and the Interahamwe got off. Did you actually see them get off? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Yes. I saw them when they got off the vehicle, because I was behind their vehicle. It was on a roadway, vision was clear, so I saw them getting off their vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see whether they were armed or not when they got off the vehicle? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Yes. They had all the necessary equipment: spears, machetes, clubs. They had all those equipment. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you came up behind this vehicle, where was Renzaho, do you know? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
When the vehicle stopped, he got off the vehicle and stood not far from the vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And for how long did you remain in that place behind him? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
About five minutes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you perhaps explain in a little more detail why you were unable to pass? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I was driving a big vehicle, and the road was narrow; so narrow that I could not easily overtake Renzaho's vehicle which had stopped. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And so how was it that after a period of about five minutes you were able to pass? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
He came to move his vehicle, and I was able to pass. I even realised that I stopped there for quite some time. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said you saw the Interahamwe entering houses. What kind of houses were these? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
These were residential houses. Houses belonging to residents of Kanombe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to comment, for example, on the wealth of the people who owned or lived in those houses? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
The houses belonged to different categories of people. Some of the residences belonged to people who were quite well off, whereas others belonged to people who were not very poor. I would say that they belonged to the middle class. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what about the ethnicity of the people who lived in those houses? Do you know anything about that? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I had just spent a lot of time in the neighbourhood, and I knew a number of Tutsis who lived in some of the residences that -- in which the Interahamwe went. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know what the Interahamwe were doing inside the houses when they entered them? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I am not aware of what they were doing. I could not see inside the houses. I was on the road. However, since I was aware of the context prevailing at the time, I understood that they were hunting down the Tutsis. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you describe briefly how you saw them entering the houses? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
There were many of them, and they went from house to house. There were many houses, and they entered them with their weapons. And sometimes when the doors would be closed, they would break down the doors or the windows. They did not enter the houses as visitors. They entered the houses by force. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see the Interahamwe come out of the houses? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Some of them would enter houses; would go out and enter yet other houses. There was some disorder, because there were many Interahamwe on the site. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did -- as far as you know, did the Interahamwe find anything that they were looking for in the houses? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I saw the Interahamwe beat people. I do not know whether they had found the people in the houses or elsewhere, but I saw with my very eyes the Interahamwe beating people with -- beating three people with their clubs. I do not know to which group these people belonged; but given the situation that prevailed at the time, I assumed that they were Tutsis. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you saw that, how far away were those Interahamwe who were beating the three people from you? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I was not very far. The houses were right next to the road, and these people lived on the road. So there was a distance of around five to ten metres between the place where I was, and the area where the scene I just described was taking place. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did the Interahamwe say anything when they were beating these people? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
The Interahamwe were saying that they had just found Tutsis in houses. They were saying that they would have to search all the houses, even those houses where the doors were open. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And while these people were being beaten, where was Renzaho? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
Renzaho was standing there. He did not go away. Even if his house was in Kanombe, he did not go to his house. He stayed there, and everything happened before his very eyes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that he got out of the car and he was standing beside it. Did he remain in that position for the entire five minutes that you were behind his car? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
He was standing and was looking at what the Interahamwe were doing. Subsequently, he moved his vehicle, and I left. But he did not leave that position. He stayed standing there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, when you left, where did you go to? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I was heading towards the residence of President Habyarimana. I went there, and I supplied them with food. And it's not far from that other location, so I dropped the food over there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I wonder if you could explain to the Court, looking at your map, the president's house is on the far left. But Kajagari, or Kajagali is shown to the south. Why was it, as you've explained to us, I believe, you didn't turn right towards the president's house to deliver the food, but followed Renzaho down to Kajagari? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
We were not authorised to use the asphalt road. The president, alone, would use that road. There was another road we would use which passed through Kajagari, and then we would turn to arrive in the rear courtyard of the president's residence. The asphalt road was only used by the president and his guests. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How long did your delivery of food at the president's house take? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I did not stay at the presidential residence for very long. I did not remain there for more than ten minutes. Those who were there merely took the delivery of food, and I left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And then did you return by the same route that you've come, or did you take another route? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I used the same route, because that was the route we would always use. We were not authorised to use the asphalt road. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see Renzaho again that day? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
When I was on my way back, they were still there where I had left them. They were still moving around the neighbourhood and had not left yet. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about Renzaho? Where was he? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
His vehicle was still there when I came back. They were still at the same location. I don't know when they left, but on my way back he was still there where I had left him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you find out what happened to those three people you had seen being beaten up? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I did not try to learn what had happened subsequently, but it was obvious that they would not survive. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After you returned to your camp, did you ever go back down to that area of Kajagari? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
I would use this route every day because ************************************ of those who were stationed at the presidential residence. So the following day, I used the same route. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And that following day, did you notice anything in particular in that area? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
As a matter of fact, from the day the president died, onwards, there were always dead bodies in that neighbourhood in Kajagari. There was one vehicle that was entrusted with the -- that would pick up all the dead bodies. But for four or five days, we could see dead bodies along this road. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know why that area was a target for attacks? 
@WITNESS DBN: 
This neighbourhood was targeted for the attacks because after the presidential plane was shot down, most of the soldiers attacked inhabitants they already knew, and killed them. That was the first thing they did immediately after the plane crashed. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. I have no further questions for you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The duration of the cross-examination for this witness, approximately? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it would be between half an hour and three-quarters of an hour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there a witness in the waiting room? Very good. Please proceed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. Mr. President, I wish to deal with matters pertaining to the witness, and I believe perhaps we should sit in closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we do that, do you want to enter this sketch?
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Ben Salimo?
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
P. 75, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't think we have to place that under separate cover.
$(Exhibit No. P. 75 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will have to go into closed session for some time in order to ensure that the witness's identity is not revealed. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 64 to 79] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
$(Pages 57 to 63 by Vicki Eastvold)
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, just before the witness is sworn in, I wonder if I could ask whether there is any objection if, following her swearing in, she meets with the Prosecutors this evening. If there is, I would ask that we can swear her in tomorrow morning. She's the photographer, I don't think there should be any particular objection.
$(Witness entered courtroom)
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there's no objection from our side. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's very helpful, thank you. 
Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Good afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are testifying under your own name, I understand? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That's right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Corinne Dufka in English) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you there with your signature? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, I do. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this means that the information contained in this document is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That's right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 76. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 76 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will now adjourn for the day, because we have been sitting from 8:45 this morning, and we will start your testimony tomorrow morning at 8:45. 
We have not been informed that we have to continue in this courtroom, so there is every reason to believe that this witness will then testify tomorrow at the fourth floor, in the Laity Kama courtroom, the normal courtroom. But should there be any last-minute change, please read Patrick Enow's notice very carefully this evening to avoid any misunderstanding. 
So the Court is adjourned until tomorrow morning.

Good morning, the Court is in session. 
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Good morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we start your testimony, we will enter the exhibits mentioned by the Defence yesterday. 
You did refer to, Defence, a statement to investigators dated the 25th of December 2000. That is the first statement of Witness DBN. But did you actually use it? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, since my colleague is not here, I must say that I am not able to answer that question. I don't know if counsel for the Prosecution can assist me. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I don't -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, those of us who have read the transcripts know the answer to my question. But why don't we postpone this, then, to the return of Maître Cantier, who was actually involved in that exercise, and then we will start immediately with the witness.
Please remember the pause, madam. It's very important to have a pause between question and answer, and answer and question, because there is a need for translation and transcription.

testified as follows:
##
$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Ms. Dufka, could you tell the Court, please, what your profession was in 1994? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
In 1994, I was a journalist with the Reuters news agency. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And speed. And that goes to both of you. 
You must slow down, Ms. Melluish. Please. It's easy. 
And now the same goes for you. All has to be interpreted and written down. So just slow down. We have this Tuesday. Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
As at April 1994, for how long had you been doing this kind of work? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
For about six years. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And as a photo journalist, did you have any particular specialism? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, I began photo journalism in El Salvador and covered Central America, and from there specialised in doing -- in covering armed conflicts. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And as at April 1994, how many armed conflicts had you covered as a photo journalist? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I believe six or seven as of that date. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall where you were at the beginning of May 1994? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, at the beginning of May I was covering the elections in South Africa. I had been covering the elections in South Africa from about the third week of April, and as of approximately May 1st or May 2nd -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's too fast. We are losing parts of the French. Please. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Sorry. 
Should I begin the question (sic) again? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
From mid-April, I had been covering the elections in South Africa. And on May 1st or 2nd, I flew from South Africa to Nairobi to begin covering the conflict in Rwanda. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And where in Rwanda did you cover the conflict? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
In the -- from approximately May 1st to May 8th I flew to Tanzania to cover the exodus of some 250,000 Rwandan refugees into Tanzania, and briefly went into Rwanda at that time. From May 10th I went into Rwanda through Burundi, up to Kigali, a trip I did on a subsequent time. And after that I flew into Kigali from Nairobi, as of May 22nd. And I stayed in Kigali from May 22nd to approximately the 3rd of July. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So between May and the end of July you visited Kigali three times. On the first occasion, how did you travel to Kigali? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
On the first occasion I went overland from Burundi into Kigali. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you travel alone, or with anyone else? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I travelled with a colleague at Reuters named Peter Smerdon; one other journalist, a British journalist; and then a Burundian driver whom we had contracted to take us into Rwanda from Bujumbura. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And by what means did you -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Wait. Reuter is R-E-U-T-E-R, and then the journalist whose first name was Peter, can you spell his last name, please? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. S-M-E-R-D, like David, O-N, like Nancy. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And if you can recall, in what kind of vehicle did you travel to Kigali? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, I went in two vehicles. The first one was a small sedan that we contracted in Bujumbura, which took us through Butare, where we spent the first night, then Gitarama, where we spent the second night. From there it was too dangerous to go with a private driver, so we had arranged -- we had received permission to travel into Kigali in Gitarama, and we went in the vehicle of a gendarme -- lieutenant, I believe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how easy or difficult was it to travel from Butare to Kigali? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
It was very, very tense because of numerous checkpoints which were manned by individuals in civilian dress, armed with various different types of weapons, who were often inebriated, very threatening, so it was extremely tense. And the closer we got to Kigali, the more checkpoints we encountered. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, generally, what happened at these checkpoints when you got to them? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, generally the individuals manning the checkpoint would brandish whatever arms they had, which included firearms, AK47s, Uzi submachine guns, clubs that were studded with nails, knives, machetes, iron bars, pistols. And they would ask who we were, they would sometimes point their guns directly at us. And they often asked -- the first question that they often asked was whether we were Belgian. They would go through our belongings, look over our passports. So they were -- it was very frightening for us and they were -- I would consider them to be very intimidating and unprofessional for -- in the manner that they manned these checkpoints. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you now described your first trip. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, my second trip was very similar. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But on this first occasion, we are then around the 10th of May? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That's right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that first occasion lasted from the 10th of May until? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
The 14th or 15th of May. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And on that occasion, travelling to Kigali, did you ever feel personally threatened at a roadblock? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, I think all of the occupants of -- of the vehicle felt threatened, including the gendarme. He was visibly shaken whilst passing through the checkpoints. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to estimate how many roadblocks you passed through on the way to Kigali? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
From the border in Burundi? I would estimate approximately 50. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And within Kigali? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
The closer we got to Kigali from Gitarama, the more checkpoints there were. But I can't -- I can't say how many in Kigali. It's -- it's hard to estimate how many in Kigali there were because they were concentrated, actually, at the entrance -- or, in the kilometres coming up to Kigali. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you got to Kigali, were there any incidents that occurred at roadblocks that particularly stick in your mind? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That would have been on the second trip that I came in, where I travelled by myself. I was the -- I didn't travel by myself, I was the only foreigner, the only Caucasian journalist travelling in a car. I was travelling with a few local Rwandan journalists. And I remember very distinctly coming to the first major checkpoint in Kigali where, upon arrival, an individual pulled out a very large pistol and put it to my head and said -- asked me if I was Belgian. That was the first question that he asked. And at which point other individuals surrounded the car, including -- I remember very clearly the image of a militiaman in a white doctor's coat that was visibly splattered with blood, and others who had clubs studded with nails, which I observed had some kind of flesh and hair on them. So that was very frightening for me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this was in the beginning of the second trip, which lasted from when to when? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
The second trip lasted from the -- the 18th of May to the 20th or 21st of May. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, just to go back to your first trip, where did you stay in Kigali, if you stayed there? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
We were taken by the gendarme directly to the UNAMIR headquarters where we spent one or two nights, I can't recall exactly, at which point I flew out to be able to transmit my pictures in Nairobi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you recall briefly what you took pictures of on that occasion? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. I had taken pictures in a place called Kabgayi, which is near Gitarama, of a -- a place in which there were several thousand mostly Tutsis being -- who had taken refuge in this place. And then later in Kigali I took a few pictures around the UNAMIR headquarters and of a few other things in the immediate vicinity of the UNAMIR headquarters. I did not feel safe to go out on my own, or with a driver, and take pictures in general around Kigali. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about on the second occasion when you went to Kigali, between the 10th and 14th? On that occasion did you also drive from Burundi, or did you come from another route? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
The second occasion was from the 18th to approximately the 21st. And on that occasion I drove as well from Bujumbura up to Kigali. I spent the first night in Kabgayi, and then went to Gitarama, at which point I met a few local journalists with whom I then went into Kigali. And it was a difficult decision whether or not to travel, given my first experience. But I took the risk in part because I recall on May 19th, there had been the shelling of the Kigali hospital, allegedly by the RPF, which had resulted in numerous deaths of the injured and other -- others in the hospital. So I thought that, as I passed through the checkpoints manned by the militia, that I would tell them I wanted to cover the shelling of the hospital, which I indeed did, because this was also a violation. And I had anticipated that that would have led to some understanding, common ground, which would facilitate -- which would have facilitated my entry. And that worked. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
On this second occasion, where in Kigali did you stay, if at all? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I stayed at UNAMIR headquarters again. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you recall for how many nights you stayed there? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
It was for -- for one or two nights. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you go into Kigali to the hospital, as you said you wanted to? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, I went first to the hospital and took photographs of the wounded and the destruction at the hospital. And then I had heard about Tutsi refugees being inside the Sainte Famille church. So I then asked the driver to take me to the Sainte Famille church to take pictures of the refugees inside of it. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Before we get to your photographs, how -- you had a driver, you've mentioned. Did you have anyone else in the vehicle with you? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
From Gitarama to Kigali, I had a local journalist. I cannot recall whether he went with me to -- to Sainte Famille church. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you were at Sainte Famille, did you take any photographs? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, I did. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Could the registry please provide the book of photographs to the witness. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recognise these photographs? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, these are all photographs that I took in Rwanda. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, do you recall that -- there are, amongst these photographs, obviously some different scenes. Are you able to recall when you took any of these particular photographs? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. The photographs of Sainte Famille reflect three different trips that I made to Sainte Famille church. And I can recognise which ones I took on which trip. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And all these visits took place during the second trip? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
No, they took place on three different trips. The first trip to Sainte Famille took place approximately the 18th or 19th or 20th of May. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Lack of communication. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have described that you were in Rwanda on three occasions, in three periods. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Mmm-hm. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the question now is simply, when you say that you visited Sainte Famille on three occasions, it would be useful to know whether these three occasions took place during that second round, or the second period, or whether the photographs relate to the three trips. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
They relate to two trips. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which ones? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
The first trip from May 18th to 20th, and the second -- excuse me. The second trip, from May 18th to 20th, and the third trip, from May 22nd to approximately July 3rd. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, Ms. Dufka, looking at these photographs, are you able to identify which ones were taken during your second trip, from the 18th to the 20th? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Could you tell the Court, please? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. Shall I identify them by number at the bottom? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
That would be helpful, yes. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
To clarify, it is this number, not the two-digit number, correct? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't you simply use the white number instead of the K number. It's easier. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
They're both white, sorry. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Bottom right-hand corner. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Oh, right, sorry. I heard white, I'm sorry. Okay, so 17, 18, 19, 20. That would be it. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Looking at those photographs, do you recall now that particular trip to Sainte Famille? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm sorry, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Mr. President, we of the Defence cannot follow because in our album the numbers do not correspond to those being mentioned. I wonder if the Prosecution can assist us. We only have the K numbers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. We all agree that we now have this small bundle in front of us. Is that the one we are using, not the big one? But it is the same, the small one. Now, having looked at the small one, you will then start with K number K0376703. Do you not have, then, a number 17 on the right-hand side? That's what you are explaining. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, ours start with K0376701. We do not have 703. I don't know if my album is incomplete. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
701 is the first photograph, you are quite right. But since the witness is now referring to photograph 17, you have to go to the 17th photograph, and the K number is marked 703. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last three digits. And you will see it's a nice photograph of a child, if you look here, please. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I don't know if it's this one. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, it may be that -- 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I believe we are now with you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. 
Now, you have now seen that photograph with the child with the white jacket. Do we agree now that the next photograph is of a child resting at her mother's knees? Is that the next one? And then the next one is a man lying on a bench. And this is followed by a person reading a book. And we have now identified 17, 18, 19, and 20, and these were the four referred to by the witness. All right? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, they follow as you have just indicated. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the last K number ends with the digit 705. Have you seen that? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
All right, let's continue. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Ms. Dufka, looking at those photographs, do you recall the day that you visited Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, very well. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, when you got to the Sainte Famille complex, was it easy just to go in to the church? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
No. In order to enter the church compound, which is quite large, we, again, had to pass through a checkpoint manned by perhaps eight to ten men in civilian dress who, again, asked many of the same questions: Who we were, what we were doing. And I particularly recall that one, that checkpoint, because it struck me as very curious that the checkpoint had set up a very large approximately metre-long model of the Concorde. And it just struck me as rather curious, so I do remember that particular checkpoint. 
So, after some minutes talking with them, we were able to go into the Sainte Famille compound.
MS. MELLUISH:
I don't know if the exhibit, P. 6, is in court at the moment. I wonder if it could be obtained. Photographs P. 6. Which bundle? The second bundle. Book 2, Sainte Famille. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Ms. Dufka, I wonder if you could look at the photograph numbered 07 -- they should be in numerical order. Do you recognise that place? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Is it possible, on this photograph, to indicate where the roadblock or checkpoint that you referred to is, or does the photograph not show the correct area? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I am able to recognise approximately where the checkpoint was. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Could you hold the photograph up so that everyone could see it. I know it's quite small. And please indicate? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. It was -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could the Court video system now kindly zoom in on the witness, please. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
It was approximately right here. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. Can you zoom in closer to the witness, please. That's good. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Okay. At the entrance to the church compound. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the witness is pointing at the right-hand side of the church as we see it on the photograph. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
On this photograph, we see a large sort of dust area, I could perhaps describe it as a yard or a courtyard in front of the church, or the photograph. What, if anything, was happening there when you arrived at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I recall there being very little activity in the courtyard, very few individuals there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what atmosphere, if any, did you sense in that area? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, upon entering the church, people appeared to be quite tense, very depressed, or a very dampened mood. And I would say that people appeared to be concentrated in the courtyard behind the church. That's where I saw the vast majority of refugees in that compound. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How easy or difficult was it to get inside the church? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, I don't recall having to wait outside the church for very long. We had -- rather, I had heard the name of the father, Father Wenceslas, whom I asked for upon arrival at the church. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you find Father Wenceslas, or was he not there? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
He was there, and he -- we -- or, I asked him permission to take photographs inside the church, which he granted. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Apart from the church, you mentioned a back -- backyard, I think, where you said there were refugees. Did you go -- did you visit that area on this occasion? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I can't remember. Can I add? I can't -- I don't recall taking pictures in the backyard, even though that's where the majority of people were, because I recall the pictures were more compelling inside the church. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to recall -- or, estimate how many refugees you saw at Sainte Famille that day? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I would say there were upwards of 8- or 900. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you speak to any of the refugees? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Very briefly. People seemed subdued or frightened of talking, and I didn't want to make them feel uncomfortable so I didn't pursue conversation with them after initially greeting them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And were you free to wander around as you pleased, or did the father escort you? What -- can you describe that situation? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I was free to wander around. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After you had visited the church and taken these photographs, what did you do? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, after taking the photographs, I recall chatting with Father Wenceslas, and I recall asking him if I could take pictures of the checkpoint outside of the church, because as a photo journalist, we try to tell various aspects of the story. The human aspect of the refugees who have taken -- who have sought refuge in the church is one aspect; the other aspect I sought to cover was the military component. So Father Wenceslas was very open, accommodating, and he said, "If you want pictures of a checkpoint, come with me and I will take you to a checkpoint in Kigali where you shall be able to take pictures of them." 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did he say anything else about what you might expect to find at that roadblock? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
He said that he would try to find a militia leader who could describe the objectives and work of the militias. I don't recall if he called them militias or civil defence. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, he made this offer to you. What did you then do? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Okay. I evaluated in my mind whether this would be safe or not. And I recognised that Father Wenceslas was someone who had standing within the community, and assumed he would not have made such a suggestion if it would have been risky for me. So I went. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how did he take you? Did you go on foot or in a vehicle? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
We went in a vehicle. Himself, dressed in a white flak jacket, and with a -- I recall seeing a pistol that was tucked inside his -- his belt. And a driver, and we went in a small white pickup. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was that the same or a different vehicle from the one that you had travelled to Sainte Famille in? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
A different vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You must remember the pause, Ms. Melluish. Please. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Sorry. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall where you went with Father Munyeshyaka? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I recall the approximate area within Kigali where we went. It was some 10 to 15 minutes' drive from Sainte Famille. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The pistol was within the belt of -- or, inside the belt of Father Wenceslas? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That's right. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Ms. Dufka, we have a map of Kigali. I wonder if you could come and have a look at this map. Come out of the box. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Okay. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Keep your headset on, please. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Oh, fine. Sorry. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Just to warn you, the camera is going to focus on the map, so if you try to stand slightly to the side. Are you able, looking at that map, to identify the area you went to? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Approximately -- thank you. I do recall that it was on a high ground within Kigali and I recall it being approximately -- can people hear me -- in this area. I recall that it was towards the side of Kigali that leads to -- or, near the road, excuse me, that leads towards Butare. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, you can take your seat again, please. 
On -- on your way to that place, did you pass any other roadblocks? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, we passed through a few roadblocks, but I do not recall how many. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was it easy or difficult to get through those roadblocks? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
It was quite a bit easier on account of the presence of Father Wenceslas, who facilitated our passage from one checkpoint through the other. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how, as far as you are aware, was he able to do that? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
He was speaking in Kinyarwanda to those who were manning the checkpoint, so I can't say what it is that he told them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you got to your destination, what did you find? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
He took me to a rather large checkpoint that was manned by approximately 30 individuals, most of whom were in mixed styles of camouflage, others of whom were dressed in civilian clothing, and who were armed with various different types of weapons, including small arms, knives, hand grenades, steel bars, and a few other types of weapons. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you take any photographs at that roadblock? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, I took approximately a roll or two of pictures, a roll having 36 pictures in each. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do any of the photographs appear in the bundle you have before you? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, photographs 1 through 14. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And these photographs were taken on the same day as your visit in Sainte Famille, only later in the day? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That's right. That was May 20th. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you ask the militiamen to pose for the photographs, or did they do this naturally, by themselves? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Upon arrival at the checkpoint, Father Wenceslas spoke to those in charge of the checkpoint, and also at some point called an individual who Father Wenceslas said was the chief of the militia, named Robert Kajuga. So he said -- and I can't recall if I started taking pictures before I did a brief interview with Mr. Kajuga, or afterwards. The individuals did not -- or, I'll start the sentence again. I did not ask the individuals in the militia to pose, but they started posing themselves in front of me. So, as you can see by the photos, some of them are group pictures when they pulled themselves together for a photograph, and others are of them working, stopping vehicles and so forth. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how did these militiamen seem to you? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, I recall smelling alcohol on their breath. They were jumping around the checkpoint shouting excitedly. They weren't threatening to me in particular, but I must say I felt particularly anxious because one of them kept playing with the pin of a hand grenade. And given the fact that some of them were evidently inebriated, and their behaviour was rather undisciplined, I feared that there could be a grenade explosion. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do any of the pictures you've taken show the individual who played with the hand grenade? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, number 8, the second individual to the left within the photograph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And, Defence, that is then the 8th photograph when we count from number 1, and the K number ends with 699. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I have the photograph, Mr. President. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You mentioned speaking to a man who was described to you as Robert Kajuga. Can you briefly describe that person to the Court? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I recall him being approximately six foot, of sturdy build, and in -- and partly dressed in fatigues. I cannot remember entirely what his dress was. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did he appear to know Father Wenceslas? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about the other militia, did they appear to know Father Wenceslas, or not? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I can't recall. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall any conversation you had with the man described as Robert Kajuga? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, I recall asking if I could do a brief interview with him. And as a journalist, especially in a situation which is potentially dangerous, one has to frame questions very carefully. So I asked him about the current -- sorry. I asked him about the role that these armed individuals were playing in the armed conflict in Kigali, and he described the ongoing battle for Kigali. He described how the RPF were trying to come into the city, and that the armed individuals were trying to defend Kigali from the RPF. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall how long you spent at this roadblock? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Approximately 30 to 40 minutes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And afterwards, where did you go? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you recall the name of this roadblock? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I do not. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does the Prosecution have a suggestion as to which roadblock this may have been? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, Your Honour, other witnesses have testified to it being at Gitega. But, no, beyond that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
Which institution were you representing? Were you a freelancer? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I was working with the Reuters news agency. But at that time I was not a staff photographer, although I had a -- an ongoing relationship with them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And your interview, was it later published somewhere? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
It was published. I recall reading it at some later point. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, after spending time at this roadblock, where did you go? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I then got back in the white pickup with Father Wenceslas and returned to Sainte Famille. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after that? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
From there I went to the UNAMIR headquarters, and either that day or the next day, flew out of Kigali to Nairobi to be able to transmit my pictures. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Looking back at the photographs of Sainte Famille that appear in the bundle, can you identify those which you took on the second visit that you made to that place? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let us agree on when this second visit took place. Shall we do that? The second visit to Sainte Famille, which date? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
It was either May 29th or May 30th. 
Photographs 15 and 16. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you recall what was taking place that is shown in these photographs? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, when the reporter, Peter Smerdon, and I arrived at Sainte Famille, there was a meeting of all the refugees in Sainte Famille being organised. So these pictures reflect that meeting in progress. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about photograph 21? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. Excuse me, all the photographs that show people together sitting on benches were taken on May 29th or 30th. Excuse me. So then to correct myself, the ones taken on May 29th or 30th would be photographs 15, 16, 21, 22, 23. Up to 23. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And just to clarify this, what about photograph number 24? Do you recall when that was taken? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I do not recall when that was taken. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And 25? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I don't recall when that was taken. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So now we have been through all photographs until K number 720, and the last two questions related to 725 and 741. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
741 or 711. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
One of them does not appear to have a K number. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's where the holes are. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
It must be 741 because -- 711, sorry, because the following picture ends in 741. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
At least the last one we have been referring to is the one with someone eating; an adult and a crying child. Yes. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Besides taking those photographs of the meeting, do you recall anything else about your visit to Sainte Famille on the 28th or 29th of May? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Again, the feeling within the church was one of tension, anxiety among the refugees. That day I also observed a few gendarmes milling about the church, which is reflected in two of the pictures. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, were those people that you hadn't seen before at Sainte Famille, on your previous visit? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I believe they were the same people, they were just all brought together in one place. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Sorry, I meant the gendarmes. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Oh, I am sorry. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Had you seen them before? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That was the first time I recall seeing the gendarmes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall how many gendarmes you saw at Sainte Famille on that occasion? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Approximately three or four. They were not plentiful in number. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Have a look, please, at photograph number 26. That's the photograph K number ending 741. Can you recall when you took this photograph? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That photograph, number 26, as well as others which follow it, were taken sometime in June. But I don't recall the date. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you mean all the other photos following it up to 32, or were there any that weren't taken in June? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, photographs 26 through 33 were taken in June. All taken at a particular side alcove of the main church which appeared to be serving as a makeshift hospital ward. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you recall if -- or, did you ever know how these people came to be sick or injured? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
No, I do not. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, I have no further questions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, let's look at pictures 15 and 16. Shall we do that? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last three digits there are 721 and 722 respectively. There are persons in uniform on these two photographs. Do you know who they were? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I believe they were gendarmes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. And do you base that on any particular element of information, or were you told? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I recall that's how gendarmes dressed, in the red beret and then with the red piece of fabric on their shoulders. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you. 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Most obliged, Mr. President.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Good morning. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, I would like to start with the following question: The reports which you made during your trips to Rwanda in 1994, were they published in your agency? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, they were published through the Reuters news agency, and they were then picked up by various newspapers throughout the world. I have received a few clips from various different newspapers in Britain and other places of some of these photographs, but not all. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we move on, did you want to tender any exhibit in connection with this testimony, Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
The book, perhaps, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any objection, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 77. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 77 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Please proceed. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, did you keep the references of those publications, and do you have some copies with you? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
No, I don't have any copies with me. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But do you remember the dates and references of those publications, and if so, can you give them to me, please? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I don't recall the dates. Perhaps I can explain, if I may, how transmission and publication happens within a wire service. The photographer transmits images. Those images are then transmitted around the world to subscribers, who then choose to use them or not use them. So not every photograph that I sent was "picked up", as we say. However, many of them were, particularly because there were very few, if any, photographs in Rwanda at that date -- at those dates that I was there -- at least in May. So I recall pictures being published in British newspapers, and my editors in London told me that the pictures had been used very widely. But usually the photographer who's in the field does not get copies of the actual newspapers where the picture was published. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Witness, for these explanations, but I want you to shed some light on some issues for the Defence, because these are very important. First of all, do you still work for the Reuters agency? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
No, I do not. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, at the time, did the agency keep an archive of the transmissions that you sent to them, and is it possible to access this archive, from what you know? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I believe they do keep an archive of the pictures that I transmit, but I did not transmit every single one of these pictures. On a given assignment, for example, the militia checkpoint, I took approximately two rolls of photographs, a roll being 36 images, and would have transmitted perhaps four or five. So those that they would have in their archive would be the ones that I transmitted. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Witness. Tell me, Witness, during your interview with members of the Office of the Prosecutor, were you able to give them any evidence of the fact that at the time you were a correspondent of the Reuters agency? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Sorry, the question is if I was able to provide proof that I was a correspondent of Reuters? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is this disputed in the case, that this witness was a journalist in 1994, working for Reuters? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I just want to be sure. For now there's nothing that indicates to me that this is indeed the correspondent. It is in the interests of the Defence to be sure. So I wanted the witness to tell me if she was able to prove that in one way or the other to the Office of the Prosecutor. I'm not challenging it, I just want some clarification. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Well, I suppose that they have my passport, and I was a very well-recognised and well-known photo journalist at that time and for a period of about 12 years. So I think it's well established that I am who I am. So, I suppose that was proof enough for them. 
Also, I was in possession of the negatives. So that would also add weight to the fact that these negatives are mine and that I took these images. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Witness. Don't take -- don't hold it against me that I am asking you some of these questions. Some of these questions might be disturbing, but it's just to clarify things for the Defence. I don't want to dwell on this thing for fear of hurting your sensitivities. 
You had to undertake a total of three trips to Rwanda; is that correct? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, during that time, that is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And if I understood you correctly, Madam Witness, there were two trips in May, and one in June; is that correct? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
That is correct. 
Sorry -- I'm sorry. There were three trips; all of them commenced in May. The final trip, during which I stayed for six weeks, began approximately the 23rd of May. Excuse me. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you for this clarification, Witness. Now, during your first visit to the Sainte Famille parish, did you have the opportunity of looking all around you, and were you able to see the nature of all the buildings? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, I walked around the compound. I couldn't say if it was all of the buildings because I didn't know until which point the compound extended. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you were inside the church building itself, since you took photographs, did you think that the roofing looked normal? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I don't actually recall the roofing. It was cool inside the main building, but I don't recall whether it would be characterised or normal or not. It seemed like a normal roof. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
It did not appear to you that this roofing may have been blown off by shelling? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
No, I don't recall that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Very well, Witness. And while you were with Father Wenceslas, were you discussing normally with him? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, we chatted, we discussed, he was very pleasant and accommodating to us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did he have the opportunity to tell you a bit about the conditions under which the refugees were living? Did you have any discussions on this? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Briefly. That was especially the case for the visit that I did on May 29th or 30th, and I was aware that the journalist with whom I was reporting spoke with him at that time. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, Witness, do you still recall the name of this journalist who was with you, and do you know what happened to him? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, it was Peter Smerdon. He was, at that point, a correspondent for Reuters based in Nairobi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, I also want to talk about this local journalist who was in your company. Do you recall his name? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I do not. I had met this local journalist in Gitarama. He had come to Gitarama to cover a press conference, I believe, that had been called by some of the government who, at that time, were operating from Gitarama. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, during those trips you made to the Sainte Famille family (sic) in May and June, you did not see any traces, any signs of shelling of the Sainte Famille parish? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I do not recall seeing signs of the shelling, but I do recall the incident, and recall that it happened sometime in June, and that there were a number of wounded, and I believe two killed. But I do not recall seeing the evidence of the shelling inside the church.

Is this issue of shelling of crucial importance in this case? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, this is an issue that falls within the defence theory, but I am not going to dwell on this. I just wanted to know from the witness, since she was at the site, to get some information from her, but if she cannot assist me in that regard, I will move on to something else. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you told the Chamber that in the course of your first visit to Sainte Famille, the guard post that you saw was the roadblock manned by a certain number of people. Was that the only guard post controlling entry and exit into the Sainte Famille parish? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
This is the only one. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. And when you went back to that place to photograph people meeting within the church building, you found gendarmes, which are on the photograph. Do they appear to be threatening the refugees who were there? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
No. I recall that they walked around, primarily, the front part of the church and in and out of the entrance, but they did not appear -- appear to be threatening the refugees. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were there militiamen, that is, the kind of militiamen you found at the place during your first visit? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
To clarify, is the question, "Were the militiamen inside the church?" Is that the question? Okay. No, I do not recall seeing militiamen enter inside the church. They were outside of the actual church building. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you for this clarification, Madam Witness. 
Now, Madam Witness, I want us to focus on the roadblock where you took photographs of people in a state of inebriation as you stated. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we didn't get the end of counsel's question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat your question, please? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
My question was whether that was the only roadblock that she had to photograph, that is, from photograph number 14 to -- number 7 to 14 - number 1 to 14. Sorry. 
Was that the only roadblock you had to photograph during your trip to Kigali? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, that was the only roadblock I photographed throughout Rwanda. It was very, very tense and I felt threatened at roadblocks, and it was only because of the introduction to the militia heads or leader by Father Wenceslas that I felt that I could photograph there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. And you did say that this was a roadblock which was close to the road leading to Butare, is that correct? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I didn't say, "close," it was on the side of Kigali closer to the road that led down to Butare. I cannot recall exactly where it was, but as I mentioned it was a high ground on that ridge overlooking the hills and the road that goes down to the road to Butare. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Very well, Witness. Did you observe while you were there that there was a big junction with traffic lights in that neighbourhood? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
I don't recall that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, Witness, as far as you can recall, this roadblock, was it a large one or a middle one, based on your observations made at the other roadblocks? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
It was quite a large one. And I am estimating from the various roadblocks that I observed after having crossed into Rwanda from Burundi. Many of those roadblocks had approximately five, six individuals, but this one was one of the larger ones that I had observed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, even though you and I do not perfectly know Rwanda, I am able to suggest to you that this place that you are referring to is within the Nyabugogo neighbourhood because that is the neighbourhood that is closest to the road leading to Butare. If I were to put that to you, would you accept it? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
No, because I simply cannot remember the exact location of the roadblock, nor the name. Indeed I didn't know that roadblocks had names. I assume it corresponded to the neighbourhood within which they were located, but I did not have that level of familiarity with Kigali then to be able to identify that it was where you just mentioned. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What we just heard is that the Defence has a view as to which roadblock this may be. Now, we have heard the Prosecution and two-three witnesses say that this is the Gitega roadblock. Is that also the view of the Defence, so that it is undisputed which roadblock this is? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, that specifically is the point that I want to clarify for the Chamber. If it is a roadblock which is not far from the road leading to Butare, it could not have been a roadblock in Gitega, because these are two neighbourhoods which are far from each other. So that is the clarification that I am seeking to make through this witness. 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
Can I clarify -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. But the witness doesn't know -- 
Did you want to add anything? 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
Yes, if I could just clarify. According to this map, where I recall that roadblock, was on the western side of town, if this map corresponds to west and east, like it does, but that it was close to the road going down to Butare, I don't -- I didn't say that nor do I mean that. I simply can identify the side of town that the roadblock was -- where the roadblock was. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But leaving aside the testimony of this witness, since you were now suggesting an area where this roadblock could be, it was my impression that the Defence may have a view as to which roadblock photographs 1 to 14 are referring to. What is the position? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
From the description that the witness gave us this morning based on -- relying on the map, we were able to locate that photograph -- that roadblock in the Nyabugogo area. And, Mr. President, we believe that the Defence could also use this map to get the witness to locate the Gitega neighbourhood so that the Chamber may see that these are two completely different neighbourhoods. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. So you are disputing that it is the Gitega roadblock. That's noted. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Exactly, Mr. President. So, by the leave of the Court, I don't know if the witness can go back to the map to indicate to the Court the Gitega neighbourhood, because this is indicated on the map. 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
Okay. And can you please repeat for me the name of the neighbourhood that begins with an N so I can look for that as well? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
It's Nyabugogo, Nyabugogo. 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
And where is Nyabugogo? Sorry, I am not finding it on the map. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, do you want me to come over and assist you? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Fine. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you may use the legend which gives you the names of the neighbourhoods and the clear situation on the map. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why should we use an American witness to read a Rwandan map? She doesn't know the details of the town. Maps usually speak for themselves. What's the purpose? 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
Anyway, I found it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Congratulations. 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
Like I said, since I was not familiar with Kigali, I just can't say with precision where this checkpoint was. I do recall that it was a high ground, like I have said, some place in this area. But unfortunately I can't be any more specific. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I am sorry for taking this Chamber through this exercise, but this witness, who is an American citizen, was in Rwanda and it is in the interests of the Defence to get her to locate where she took the photograph. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, Madam Witness, let me ask you another question in relation to that. The area, the neighbourhood, that you have just located, will that be the Nyabugogo neighbourhood that you also identified on the map? Were you able to see Nyabugogo, and are you able to say if that area you are referring to is within the Nyabugogo neighbourhood? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Can't say. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Very well, Madam Witness. This question brings me to the end of my exercise with you.
@MR. NEKUIE:
And I thank the Chamber for its patience. The Defence has come to the end of its cross-examination. 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
One question, Your Honour, if I may.

$RE-EXAMINATIOIN
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mrs. Dufka, are you able to say that the roadblock you took these photographs at was in Kigali town? 
@WITNESS DUFKA: 
Yes, absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The checkpoint outside Sainte Famille church was manned by who? 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
By men, young men in civilian dress. I referred to them as militias. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Civilian attire? 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
Yes. Sorry, Your Honour. Can I clarify? Sometimes at the militia checkpoints, the military element dressed in mixed camouflage and civilian. So they might have a civilian top and camouflage trousers. So I cannot say with certainty that there was not -- one stitch of camouflage on those militiamen, but they were primarily dressed in civilian dress. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The purpose of the question is just to find out whether you saw any soldiers there, and you did not. 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
No. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Now, Witness, a small question. Yes, coming back to this roadblock where you took your picture. Do you recall how long did it take you to travel from the Sainte Famille church to this particular place? 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
It was approximately 10 to 15 minutes. But, recall, that we had to pass through a few checkpoints and negotiate our way past the individuals manning those checkpoints, which took a bit of time. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
So if it were in a normal situation, it would take less than 10 or 15 minutes, even? 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
A bit. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you very much. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Madam Witness. 
Thank you very much for having come to the Tribunal and contributed to the proceedings. We wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you. 
@WITNESS DUFKA:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The next witness is? 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour: Next witness is Witness ACS.
If I can ask the assistance of registry to distribute to Your Honours and others around the court the personal information sheet for that witness, along with -- there is a very brief list of some additional names which may come up during the course of his testimony. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this a long witness? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I would estimate one to one and a half hours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So there may be a need, depending on cross-examination to have a new witness in this -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
We already have someone here. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. Thank you.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Morning, Witness. 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Morning, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Before we commence, can I please just remind you that what you are saying has to be translated and recorded. So if you can we are to speak slowly, and not in too long passages, I think it will assist us all. 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Okay. 
@MR. MOSES: 
As at beginning of 1994, do you know who the préfet of Kigali was? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yes, I knew him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And who was that person? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
It was Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho, and I think he had been in that position since 1990. He remained a préfet until 1994. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you recall the approximate or the date that he became préfet? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I don't recall the exact date, but he was appointed in October of the year 1990. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is there any particular reason why you recall his appointment? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I think the Inkotanyi invaded Rwanda on October 1st, 1990. From that date on there was a reorganisation of the administrative set-up in Kigali city. A military préfet was appointed to be at the helm of that préfecture, certainly, in order to be able to mobilise the inhabitants of Kibuye with regard to the combat, the fighting that was likely to take place in Kigali city. I think that is the reason why he was appointed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did anything happen to you soon after his appointment?
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yes, something happened to me. But before then, the préfet had officiated at a meeting in my secteur. It was a meeting bringing together all the members of the population, and members of the cellule committees from in attendance. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I will just stop you there, Witness. Can you please just listen to the question that I asked. Did anything happen to you that you recall after the appointment of Renzaho as préfet? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yes. I was one of the people arrested because we were considered as accomplices of the Inyenzi. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And how long were you detained for? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Between five and ten days. I no longer remember the exact period. But when we were rounded up, we were placed at the Nyamirambo regional stadium and subsequently detained at the Kigali prison. It's at that prison that I was released. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And were you ever charged with any offence? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I was not charged. Actually, there was a list of important personalities, but my name was not on that list. So it was decided that people whose names were not on that list had to be released. Those people were immediately released who were not charged. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that. Now, can I ask you briefly to focus on the period from 1990 to April 19 -- sorry, from the date of Renzaho's appointment in 1990 to April, the beginning of April 1994, were there any difficulties for you in moving around or outside Kigali? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I don't quite understand your question, sir. Are you referring to the pre-1994 period or are you referring to 1994? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, from October 1990 to April 1994, did you have freedom of movement? Could you move around in Kigali, in and out of Kigali? 
@WITNESS ACS:
Now, I have understood that question. It was not possible because from my arrest and subsequent release, I could not leave Kigali city, for instance, to go Kacyiru without a pass. I think that document had been designed to prevent the Tutsi in Kigali city to flee. So personally, I could not move about in Kigali city without that pass. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And once again, very briefly, did -- to obtain that travel pass, where would you have to go to obtain it? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
At that time, in order to be issued with a pass you had to go to the commune office. So I had to go to the Nyarugenge commune office. As a matter of fact, the pass was a document required throughout Kigali-ville préfecture at the helm of which was Tharcisse Renzaho. The instructions instituting that pass had come from the office of the Kigali-ville préfecture. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, I would like you to focus on the period of April 1994. Without giving the specific location, where -- where were you when you heard about the death of President Habyarimana? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I was at home. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, at this stage I think it might be safe just to go for about five minutes into a closed session. There is a little bit of evidence I want to lead regarding his location and that of other people which could potentially lead to his identification. So to be safe, perhaps if we could have five minutes in closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will close for five minutes. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 28 to 32] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera). 
$(Pages 19 to 27 by Judith Baverstock)
$(Court resumed at 1145H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is sitting under Rule 15 bis because Judge Egorov had to be excused until lunch. Please proceed. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, shortly before the break you told the Trial Chamber that you had left your home and had sought refuge at a place called CELA. Do you recall giving that testimony? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I recall that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Approximately how long after the death of President Habyarimana was it that you sought refuge at CELA? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
One week following the death of the president. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And how long did you remain at CELA? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I believe I left the CELA centre at a date that I cannot forget. It is a date which is very important. We left the CELA centre on the 22nd of April at the time that there were killings at that place, killings led by the préfet, Tharcisse Renzaho. 
@MR. MOSES: 
We will come to that. You have said that you left on the 22nd of April. Were there many people like yourself who had taken refuge at CELA during the period that you were staying there? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
There were a lot of people at that place. Some got there before me and others got there after me. There were so many people, and I can say we were more than 80 persons. We were many. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, if I can ask you to focus on the 22nd of April. What is the first thing that you remember happening on the 22nd of April which was unusual? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
The specific incident that I recall on that day of 22nd April is that a large number of people from my secteur came to weed the area in which we are taking refuge at the CELA centre. Officially, they had come there to weed the bush so as to find the Inyenzi. It was on that day that the people at CELA were killed. But before the massacre there is what is referred to as communal work. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, after these people from your neighbourhood came for the communal work, did you see anyone arrive at CELA? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I do not clearly recollect who came to the CELA centre, but I recall the attack against the centre. I don't know if I should talk about this attack in detail. On the 22nd, while a large number of the population was weeding the bush around the CELA centre, I saw an armoured vehicle. This is a type of vehicle that cannot be pierced by bullets. Renzaho was not on board that vehicle. I believe he was on board his own vehicle, together with Angeline Mukandituye, who was a primary school inspector in the Nyarugenge area. He was with Odette Nyirabagenzi, who is conseiller of my secteur. He was also with Jean Bizimana, bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune, gendarmes and soldiers that I could not identify. Those -- I was able to identify those who were not soldiers, because I used to see them quite often. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Can I just stop you there? You said that you recognised some people who were not soldiers. Who did you recognise of the people who were not soldiers? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
There was Angeline Mukandituye, school inspector in the Nyarugenge commune. Odette Nyirabagenzi, who was conseiller. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have all the names on record here. I don't think we need the spelling. 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honours, that wasn't -- I'll redo my question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Apart from the officials that you have described, were there any other people with Renzaho that you recognised? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
There were several Interahamwes, and I remember the names of some of these Interahamwes. I don't know if you want me to give you those names. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I do, if you can give us two or three names of Interahamwe who you recall being with those officials at that time. 
@WITNESS ACS: 
There were several Interahamwe, but I remember one Nkeshimana, son of Gikongoro. There was Fidele Habimana, alias Castar. There was one Rwagatara, Faustin, alias Las Vegas. There was very many, but these are the ones I remember. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, Nkeshimana is 183, Fidele is 49; Castar, 39; and the last name is on the additional list at number 4. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And was the father's name Gikongoro? 
What was the name of father, please? 
@WITNESS ACS:
Thank you, Mr. President. It's Nkeshimana whose father was Gikongoro. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We just want to make sure that the father's name is spelt in the same way as the location. Do you spell -- 
@WITNESS ACS:
It is the same spelling, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, when you first arrived at CELA about a week after leaving -- after the death of the president, were there any priests present at that centre at that time?
@WITNESS ACS: 
When I got to the CELA centre, all the priests living at that centre had left. I met people who had the same problems as myself, who had sought refuge there, otherwise the priests had left well before. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what about on the 22nd of April, were there any priests present there? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
On the 22nd April, I will talk about the priest, Wenceslas Rucyaka (sic) who came with Renzaho Tharcisse, Angeline, Odette, the soldiers, and the gendarmes. These priests accompanied them, together with the attackers on that day. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you have said that the préfet arrived, are you able to give an approximate time of day that this -- that you saw these people arrive? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
From my recollection, people came before 10 a.m. but the attack continued well into the afternoon. At the beginning, there was this communal work, and then Renzaho came with the Interahamwe attackers, gendarmes and soldiers, and other persons. It is an attack that lasted for some time. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And when you say Renzaho -- without giving the circumstances, had you ever seen Renzaho prior to that date? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I saw him earlier in 1990 when he convened a meeting in my secteur. This was a public meeting to -- with the general public and the responsables de cellule were invited. That was my first time seeing him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, apart from that meeting in 1990, had you seen him in person again between 1990 and the 22nd of April '94? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I saw him on several occasions between 1990 and 1994. As the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture, I saw him during several -- the several meetings that he convened. But on the 22nd of April 1994, I saw him again face to face. But even before that occasion, I used to see him on -- during several meetings. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. We'll come back now to the events of the morning of the 22nd of April. After the arrival of Renzaho and others, what happened? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Before their arrival, I recall that there was the communal work that was carried out by the members of the population. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And -- my question was to focus on what happened after his arrival. What happened? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yeah, now I understand you. After the arrival of the préfet at the CELA centre, he asked that all those in the CELA centre hall should get out. But when we saw him we thought it was a way of being saved. We said, "The préfet is now here and we'll be saved." So he asked us to get out and we assembled in the courtyard. They lined us up. I don't know if I should continue explaining what happened. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just stop there, and I will take you through bit by bit. I think it will be easier for us all if we do a little bit at a time. Now, when you say "He lined us all", was this men, women, children all together? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yes, everybody was asked to line up. Women separate from the children, and also separate from the men. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just so we can clarify, were you one of the men who were lined up? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yes, I was one of the men who were lined up. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, was this exercise, clearing bushes, carried out from 10 o'clock or did the organisation of the massacres start at 10 o'clock? 
@WITNESS ACS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. Even though the community work was carried out, I would like to say it was just a pretext for massacres to be committed. As far as I remember, there were many people who came to clear the bushes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes. Now, please listen to the question, Mr. Witness. You have mentioned that a lot of people came around 10 o'clock. Was that in order to do the community work or was it in order to start lining up people? I just want the time estimate. Can you help us? 
@WITNESS ACS:
To be candid, it was not community work. We were the ones being sought by those people. That is what I can say. We knew what the meaning of the community work was, under normal circumstances. It was simply something aimed at preparing our massacre. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's understood. Now, what interests us now is, when did Mr. Renzaho arrive? Let's me put it that way. What was the time? 
@WITNESS ACS:
I no longer remember the exact time. In any case, he arrived there before noon, before the end of the community work. It was still before noon. But I can't remember the exact time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When did the community work start -- or this work with the bushes? Can you remember that, approximately? 
@WITNESS ACS:
Approximately, I would say the community work started a bit earlier, around 10 o'clock or shortly before 10 o'clock. I cannot remember the specific time. In any case, it was before noon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And Mr. Renzaho arrived not in the armoured vehicle but in his own car. Was that the testimony, yes or no? 
@WITNESS ACS:
He came in another vehicle. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what -- 
@WITNESS ACS:
-- the armoured vehicle had only soldiers in it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And there was only one armoured vehicle there. Is that your testimony? 
@WITNESS ACS:
I no longer remember quite well, but there were more than one armoured vehicles. I saw it. You see, when you are scared, it is difficult for you to notice everything. But, in any case, there were more than one armoured vehicles. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@WITNESS ACS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Witness, once you were lined up, were -- did anyone give any instructions or what happened? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
After lining us up, Préfet Renzaho personally gave instructions. And I think he remembered that very well. He was the one directing that attack. He had a piece of paper in his hand, which piece of paper he handed to Angeline Mukandituye, who was a schools inspector for Nyarugenge commune. That list was read out and Renzaho said, "Take whoever you want."
Should I continue to tell you how it all unfolded after he made that statement? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'll ask you some more questions now, too, so we can all find out bit by bit, rather than giving too much information at one time. 
So, after you say that Renzaho had asked -- or told Angeline that she could take whoever she wanted, were there any names called out? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yes, names were read out. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you recall what the -- what was the first name that you recall being read out? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
The first name was that of one Charles Rwanga. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Was Charles Rwanga -- 
@MR. MOSES:
That's number 241 on the list, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
-- was he among the men who were lined up outside? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Rwanga, Charles, was not in another queue. He had been in hiding somewhere, because he knew that since 1990 he was a wanted man. And since he was not in that line, Angeline Mukandituye, while speaking to Wilson and Déglote Rwanga, who were Charles Rwanga's children, she said, "If you want your lives to be spared, then go and look for your father". The children burst out in tears and told their mother, "Mummy, go and ask daddy, because we do not want to be killed". That is how the Interahamwe looked for Charles Rwanga everywhere around. They found him and lined him up, just like everyone else. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. 
@MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honours, it's -- 244 and 242 are the names of the Rwanga sons. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, I'm just wondering, when you are answering, if you could just keep your eye, if you can, on me, and I will hold my hand up if I think you are going too fast or giving us too much information. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you using the most updated spelling list now, or the previous one? I think we should probably agree that the spelling list dated 22nd of January 2007, which was the last one, there Charles is number 242, Déglote 243, and Wilson 245. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You are quite right, Your Honour. I must have a slightly earlier version. I apologise for that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who read out these names, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS ACS:
When Préfet Renzaho handed the list to Angeline Mukandituye, she was the one who read out the names, because most of those people at that centre were residents of her secteur. She was our neighbour; she knew all those people. The préfet did not know all of them. He simply gave her the list and told, "Take whoever you want". So Angeline started reading out the names while we were lined up. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Witness, is this something you heard with your own ears or something someone told you? These instructions you heard from the préfet and Angeline? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yes, indeed. I was lined up and awaiting my death. I listened to it with my own ears. It was done while I was being lined up. We were in the courtyard, all of us together. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And apart from the Rwanga children and their father, do you remember the names of anyone else who was called out on that list? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I remember many names. For instance, Emmanuel Gihana, who was with me. If you want, I can give you all the names that I remember. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Emmanuel Gihana is number 65 on the list. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Perhaps if you remember two or three other names, if you could give us those names. 
@WITNESS ACS: 
There was one Albert, who worked at Radio Rwanda. Christophe Safari, who I believe was a student in the faculty of management in the university. There was also Charles Gahima, and one Rugingwa (sic). I remember those names very well. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Christophe Safari is on the additional list, Your Honour. The last -- I think Gahima is reasonably well known. And perhaps if I can ask the witness to spell Rubingwa (sic). 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Could you please just spell that name?
@WITNESS ACS: 
Rwigamba is spelt R-W-I-G-A-M-B-A.
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Witness.

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Witness. Earlier in your testimony, you had referred to the fact that you had seen a person, a Vincent Mugiraneza when you were at CELA. Did you see him that day? That is, on the 22nd? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
It was not only on the 22nd I saw him, I saw him ever since I arrived at the CELA centre. We were at CELA centre together. Now, do you want me to explain what happened? Because there was something peculiar that happened there. Do you want me to move on? 
While we were told to queue up, Mugiraneza, who had been a Rwandan ambassador to China, said, "I am lucky, I have just seen Renzaho. We both hail from the same préfecture". So he moved closer to Renzaho to say hello to him. Renzaho exclaimed -- I remember very well. I remember it vividly, it's not something I can forget. So he said, "Hey, Mugiraneza, so you, too, are here"? So he said, "Go to my vehicle. I will take care of you later". 
Should I continue? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just stop you there very briefly. First of all, do you know what ethnicity -- I don't know if we covered this earlier -- what ethnicity Vincent was? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
For me, he was a Tutsi, because his family had been exterminated. I mean, his wife and children, as I told you when I started my evidence. That is even the reason why he had taken shelter at the CELA centre. All of us at CELA centre were of the same ethnicity. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, when he said that he was from the same préfecture as the préfet, do you know what préfecture that was? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Kibungo préfecture. Mugiraneza hailed from Kibungo. And from what I knew, I think he hailed from Kigarama commune. He was my neighbourhood, so I had to know where he had come from in Kibungo.
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Thank you for that. Now, did Vincent leave CELA that day, yes or no? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Are you referring to the 22nd of April when we had just been lined up, when Renzaho told him, "Go to my vehicle, I will take care of you later"? When they started by taking out the people who were wanted, such as Rwanga, there were about 40 in number. On that date, the women were not touched in any way. I don't believe I had mentioned this before. So the women and the men who had remained there, just as me, were told to go. We were told to return home. In fact, it was Renzaho who told us, "Go back to your homes, and we are going to take care of you in your respective homes". It was Renzaho who took Mugiraneza away. Until this day we had never seen him. Perhaps you need to find out from Renzaho what happened to Mugiraneza. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we appreciate your courtesy, and that you are looking at the Bench. But do you think you could look at Prosecution counsel instead of looking at us? You see, that will facilitate the communication between you and him. And he will, then, be able to stop you, because you are quite eager. If you could take this step by step, please. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, I think in your last answer -- in fact, you've covered a few different aspects which may save us some time now. You have -- if I can just clarify. Vincent Mugiraneza did leave CELA that day, on the 22nd of April? Yes or no. 
@WITNESS ACS: 
He left CELA on that date. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You've, I think, told us that you haven't seen him since, is that correct? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
That's right. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And also in that answer I think you said approximately 40 people were taken away from CELA. Is that your evidence? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
What I gave was an estimate. It was more than 40 people. I cannot remember exactly how many people. But let's just take 40 as a reference point. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay. Of those 40 people who you saw taken away, do you know if any of them are still alive? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Of that group of more than 40 people, there is one Bitega who reportedly jumped out of the vehicle which was carrying the people being taken to be killed. That person survived. I saw him after the events. He was one person who survived from that group of people taken away to be killed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's number 20. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. The remaining people, do you know -- do you know what happened to them? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Is your question in reference to those who remained at the time we left the CELA centre? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It was my -- my question wasn't very clear, and I apologise for that. Of the approximately 40 people who were taken away, you've told us of one person who survived. The remaining people, do you know what happened to them? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
They were all slaughtered. We did not see them again. They were killed along the road going down towards our secteur. Some bodies were dumped in the graves located at the place called CND. It was the home of one Mr. Iyaremye, who had dug very deep graves for bodies to be dumped into. That is where some of those bodies were placed, whereas other persons were killed along the road. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And very briefly, how do you know that they were dumped at Mr. Iyaremye's house? 
@MR. MOSES:
And that's number 85.
@WITNESS ACS:
After the genocide, we tried to locate the bodies of our family members who had been killed. So the bodies buried in that grave were exhumed for subsequent burial. That is where we saw the body of Albert, who was working at Radio Rwanda. And at that time we could recognise them because of the clothing of those people. That is how we were able to recognise Albert, as well as Emmanuel Gihana. Because of what they were putting on. 
$BY MR. MOSES: 
@MR. MOSES: 
And just to very briefly clarify, were you present at the exhumation of those bodies there? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Yes, I was there. I was present during the exhumation. I was also present when those bodies were given a decent burial. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Just a couple of quick questions regarding the incident that you've referred to on the 22nd of April. From what you were able to observe, who appeared to be in charge of the operation at CELA, if anyone? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
That operation was conducted under the leadership of Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho. Any junior official could not have directed the operation in the presence of Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho. He was the one who gave the orders, no one else spoke on that occasion. So it was Renzaho who directed that operation in his capacity as préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture. Even though there were certain other personalities like the conseillers, the bourgmestres from Nyarugenge commune, as well as Angeline Mukandituye, I confirm that it was Renzaho who directed the operation. In fact, he was the one who had the list of people being wanted. I did not know where he had come with that list from, but he had it in his hands. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Did this process of bringing the refugees out, separating them, and then choosing people, did it -- and then taking them away, are you able to give any indication how long that process took? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I believe your question has already been answered by me. It took a long time. That operation started in the morning, and went on until early afternoon. I cannot give you an exact time, but the operation lasted several hours. I can't be more specific than that. But the operation lasted a long time. I am referring to the process of taking us out of the classrooms, lining us up, and reading out the names of the people being sought. It all took several hours. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And after that incident that you've described on the 22nd of April, what did you do? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
When Renzaho personally ordered us to leave the centre so that our security could be taken care of in our neighbourhoods, I understood that I did not have any other place to go and seek refuge at. I had left my home to go to the centre, but I couldn't go to the Sainte Famille church because that site was under the management of Munyeshyaka, who himself had participated in the attack against CELA. So that spurred my decision to return home. I should even tell you that those who survived at the CELA centre were subsequently killed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, you have indicated to the Trial Chamber that you had seen Renzaho at meetings on several occasions prior to April 1994, and you say that you saw him again on the 22nd of April 1994. Do you believe if you saw him today you would recognise him? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I knew him. I used to see him. If you want, I am ready to identify him for you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, if you could briefly stand up where you are from where you're sitting. Stand up. 
And are you able to have a look around the courtroom and see if you're able to see the person who you -- in the courtroom? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Do you want me to point him out? It is that person who is seated over there wearing spectacles. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, you see, I think there are -- the direction you're pointing there are three rows of benches. Which row? Is it in the front bench, the middle bench or the rear bench? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
It is the person who is seated to that extreme. I believe that is the first row. He has a fair complexion, wearing spectacles. The person sitting next to him is not wearing spectacles. And to the other extreme, there is a white person. In any event, I cannot forget Renzaho for my whole life. Even during the event I knew him very well because I lived in Kigali town. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In spite of a slight ambiguity with spectacles, we consider identification to have taken place. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. I've got no further questions. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence, will you perform any of your cross-examination in closed session? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. I think I will have to begin in closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If that is the case, I think this is a good moment to decide your request for your investigator to be present in the courtroom during closed session proceedings. 
You filed this motion on the 18th of January. The Prosecution informed us that they had no comments or objections. That was made in the courtroom. We have looked into the matter. We have studied the reasons for the request. This particular request relates to Investigator Jean Marie Hakizamungu, H-A-K-I-Z-A-M-U-N-G-U. We are granting that request. 
Do you want to start in closed session immediately, or do you start in open, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I think it is better to go immediately into closed session, but I won't be long. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And can you give an estimate so that those following us in the public gallery has an idea? Do you think you will need all the time until lunch in closed, that's 25 minutes. Or less? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I think I'll take about ten minutes, not more than that, except if the witness extends too much during his answers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. Well see how this develops. But now we have to go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 45 to 53] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
$(Pages 40 to 44 by Vicki Eastvold)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us go back for a while on -- let us go back to the incident that occurred at the house of Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza which you witnessed. On that day, did you see Angeline Mukandituye arrive, and could you tell the Trial Chamber whether she was only with Interahamwe, or with soldiers, either from the army or the gendarmerie? 
@WITNESS ACS
There is one aspect that comes back to my mind, but let me start with what I saw regarding Mugiraneza's death, as well as the death of the members of his family. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we are in open session now. So we really do not want to know exactly where you are staying or information about your neighbourhood. 
So at 14:55:58 there is a sentence starting with "I told you that --" and that sentence will be placed under seal, all of it. 
Will you please watch out, Mr. Witness? Please do not transmit that, video booth. 
And now the next question -- or a continuation of what you may wish to hear from this witness, Defence Counsel. Can you ask a precise question so that the witness is assisted to respond to exactly what you want to know, instead of repeating this evidence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I simply wanted the witness to answer the question I put. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Among those who were accompanying Angeline, were there only Interahamwe, or were there also soldiers? Witness, could you answer this question? 
@WITNESS ACS
I was about to answer the question. There were Interahamwe, and there were also members of the Presidential Guard. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, according to you, did Angeline Mukandituye seem to have any authority whatsoever on the members of the Presidential Guard? 
@WITNESS ACS
I cannot state that she gave orders to the members of the Presidential Guard. She gave orders to the Interahamwe, and the members of the Presidential Guard were present. But it was as if they were approving the orders given by Angeline that members of the Presidential Guard, as well as the other people I already mentioned, did not go in to Mugiraneza's house. So she did not give any orders to the members of the Presidential Guard, but rather to the Interahamwe who, besides, were living at her house. Let me say, in passing, that the headquarters of the Interahamwe was in her house for the secteur in which I lived. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you know how many members of the Presidential Guard you saw on that day? 
@WITNESS ACS
There were two presidential guards, and I recognised them because of the uniform they were wearing. I do not know whether there were others wearing civilian clothes, but I heard them say that the person whose name I've already given, and I do not wish to repeat in open session -- so it was that person who confirmed subsequently that the two people in uniform I had just seen were members of the Presidential Guard. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And, Witness, what was that uniform? 
@WITNESS ACS
I wonder whether you are familiar with the uniform of Habyarimana's army. It was a camouflage uniform. That was the uniform worn by those two troops. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which two troops, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS ACS:
I'd already said there were troops of the Presidential Guard, as well as the Interahamwe accompanying Angeline, in addition to the other people I already mentioned. I already referred to those two Presidential Guard troops. I wonder if you want further explanation regarding those two Presidential Guard soldiers? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The point is this, Mr. Witness. How do you distinguish the Presidential Guard from the normal Rwandan army? How were you able to do that? Can you help us with that? 
@WITNESS ACS:
Presidential Guard soldiers did not wear the same uniforms as the other soldiers. Their uniforms and berets were different from those of the other army units. As a matter of fact, each unit has its own uniform. For someone living in Rwanda, especially in Kigali, I knew that the gendarmes had red berets, soldiers had blue berets, and there were some soldiers with camouflage berets. And I identified those soldiers as Presidential Guard troops because they were in Presidential Guard uniforms. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE: 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, it is your evidence that Presidential Guard soldiers had camouflage berets, is that what you said? 
@WITNESS ACS
I don't think we should have a fixation on this issue of colour of the beret. Even if I was mistaken, the person who was my neighbour confirmed to me that they were troops of the presidential guards, and I also had noticed that there were soldiers of the Presidential Guard. So I don't think their uniform should be at issue here. Rather, we should focus on what happened at my neighbour's place. What was the source of the problem was not their uniform. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you see the berets worn by those soldiers of the Presidential Guard on that day? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS ACS
I saw them. They were wearing camouflage berets. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you know that at that time Presidential Guard soldiers were, rather, wearing black berets? 
@WITNESS ACS
Counsel, let me tell you something. I was not a soldier, I was a civilian. And I've told you that we should not engage in such arguments regarding the berets. But from what I observed, and from what I was told, I've retained what I've told you. So I don't think we should belabour these points regarding the berets or the uniforms. Rather, let us focus on the massacres committed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
In this connection, Witness, I am putting it to you that if you are unable to describe the uniforms worn by those soldiers you state you saw, then it means that you did not see anything on that day. What do you have to say to that? 
@WITNESS ACS
When I started giving evidence, I did not say that I was testifying against Presidential Guard soldiers. I testified against Angeline Mukandituye and those accompanying her, that is, the Interahamwe. When the trial of the Presidential Guard soldiers will start, then I will be ready to come and testify. But I don't think that it should be an issue today, because I don't know where you're driving at. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I also put it to you that you did not see Angeline Mukandituye that same day. What do you have to say, sir? 
@WITNESS ACS
Do you mean that I didn't see Angeline? Where? Where do you say I did not see Angeline Mukandituye? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At Vincent Mugiraneza's place, Witness. 
@WITNESS ACS
I am under the impression that you keep on backtracking. I have already told you who the person directing that attack was, and I told you it was Angeline Mukandituye. What else do you want? I've already told you she was the one who directed that attack. What do you want as an answer from me, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, exactly when did you leave your place to go to CELA? 
@WITNESS ACS
That I've already explained that, Counsel. I said I left my place one week after the attack against Habyarimana's plane. And I explained that I no longer remember the exact date. But, approximately, it was one week following the date when the president's plane was attacked. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So if I were to put it to you that it must have been between the 13th and the 15th of April 1994, would you agree with me? 
@WITNESS ACS
That is the way you construe it, sir. But personally, I know that in my statement I was hesitant regarding the date, but I remember it was one week after the attack against the presidential plane. But if you have those two specific dates, I am unable to confirm them on account of the time which has elapsed since those events and today. And in this connection, I would like to crave the indulgence of the Trial Chamber with regard to dates. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, rest assured, even the Defence will not take offence if there's any problem regarding the dates. All we want is to give an objective review of the events. May I ask you, Witness, how many days you had been at CELA before the incident of the 22nd of April 1994? 
@WITNESS ACS
I would say about one week, or slightly more than one week. Because if we count one week after the 6th of April -- I cannot remember the exact date. Because, you see, I don't want that to be an issue. Approximately, I would say I'd spent about one week at that centre. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Now, do you know how many rooms the refugees were occupying while you were at the CELA centre? 
@WITNESS ACS
I told you that we were harboured in rooms, and I did not count the rooms harbouring refugees. I'm unable to give you the number. I am simply familiar with the circumstances under which we fled our homes, and the place we went to take shelter. Don't put questions to me regarding the number of rooms which we occupied. I know there were many rooms, and there were many of us. All those things happened a long time ago. And I didn't try to count the number of rooms accommodating refugees. All what I know is that we fled our homes to go and take shelter in that centre. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Would you remember how many of you were there in the room which you occupied? 
@WITNESS ACS
There were many of us, but I cannot remember the exact number. But there were quite a few of us in that room. Don't ask me to give you a specific figure. When I say we were many, it means we were more than ten in the room where I was. Besides, I just told you that I did not conduct a census. I didn't count those people. I didn't have the time to do that. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
If you were more than ten, Witness, then you should be able to remember the number of women and children who were in your own room. Can you remember that? 
@WITNESS ACS
I am unable to remember that. I cannot know the number of women, children, or men in that room. You cannot be in a state of fright, and you start counting people. We were not in a census exercise. Perhaps those who conducted a census could give you a figure. We all had the same problem; we were hiding so as to escape the massacres, and we were a waiting our impending death. I was not able to conduct such a census.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
While you were there, did you have the time to go and see Mr. Mugiraneza? 
@WITNESS ACS
We were all together in those rooms; we were all faced with the same problem. Everyone was speaking to everyone else; we trusted one another. So I was able to speak with Mugiraneza 
and the -- the other people in that centre. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, Witness, if I understand you properly, you could move from one room to the other while you were at that centre; was that the situation? 
@WITNESS ACS
Yes, that was possible, the rooms were not locked. I told you that the priests had locked their offices, but the rooms were open, and they had left without giving us anything. They took their belongings and left. By the time I arrived there, the refugees had nothing. Those who had preceded me there had nothing, so people could meet without any problems and discuss about their common difficulties; it was quite normal. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But though you were able to move about, you are unable to remember the approximate number of rooms where you met other refugees? 
@WITNESS ACS
I have told you that I did not make a census. I am sorry, Counsel, but please don't put questions to me regarding the number of rooms. Rather, put questions to me regarding the circumstances under which people died. I cannot give you the number of rooms, nor can I give you the number of people who were in those rooms. All what I can say is how people were killed. But, right now, when you see people who were with you and who survived, that is when you can make an assessment of how many people were killed. But you need to carry a census to get all those figures. 
However, concerning the number of rooms, I have told you I did not count them. Perhaps there's someone who conducted a census -- maybe with the intention of killing those people. Perhaps that person may be able to give you the number of rooms and the number of occupants in those rooms. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, how many rooms were there between the place where you yourself were and the place where Mr. Mugiraneza was? 
@WITNESS ACS
What I remember is that in that room where I was -- even though I did not count the number of rooms, what I can tell you is that I think I was in the same room with Mugiraneza. I believe that was the case. Those were large rooms, which had perhaps been meeting rooms before, and there were many people in those rooms. I did not go back to the place to count the rooms. I believe that since the 
22nd of April 1994, I have never set foot at that place again. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And what about that person, whose name I'm not going to mention, but whom you said was able to escape from the incident at CELA? Was that person in the same room with you or was he in another room? 
@WITNESS ACS
I cannot give you an answer, Counsel, without knowing who you are referring to. You are telling me that the person who survived was the person at the CELA centre or outside. Give me the information regarding the circumstances under which that person survived, then I'll be able to answer you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You mentioned 40 persons and said that only one of them survived. That's the one he is referring to. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness just mentioned the name of that person and the interpreter is wondering whether to do the same thing in open court, that is.
@WITNESS ACS:
Now you put a question to me which compels me to mention that person's name and we are in open court. I don't know how to answer that question of yours, Counsel. I don't see the relevance of that question when we are in open court -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any problem in mentioning that name, I cannot see that? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, as long as counsel only refers to the name and no other information -- yes, I see no problem. I led it in open court. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. 
@WITNESS ACS:
Now, Counsel, you can repeat your question and I'm going to oblige you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, my question was as follows: Were you in the same room with Mr. Bitega or not? 
@WITNESS ACS
It is difficult for me to remember the exact location of people. I knew him, but no longer recollect whether we were in the same room or whether he was in another room. I have kept on telling you that I didn't pay attention to such issues. Rather, you should put questions to me about what happened to him. I knew most of the people who were there. And, besides, it was a long time ago; I no longer remember all the people who were with me. I'm afraid I cannot answer that question. Put questions to me regarding the crimes committed and put specific questions regarding what happened to each and every one of those people. I know those people very well. For instance, ask me how I got to know him; but, don't ask me in which room he was. It is when I try to reminisce about what happened at CELA that I am able to remember certain people who were with me there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, the Bench understands what you are saying. We do not need to hear the same explanations over and over again. Could you kindly, when these brief questions are asked, answer them with very few sentences? Often a yes and a no will be sufficient, and then other questions will follow. Can you help us with that, please? 
@WITNESS ACS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. I will try to be terse. But, you see, Defence counsel is putting questions to me which are similar to earlier questions he had put to me and which questions I'd already explained, and I don't like repeating myself. But, as you have said, I will try and be brief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And it's very good that you do not like to repeat yourself. Just continue with that. 
Now, here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I think this is the best way of putting the question to you. Should I take it that you also don't remember the rooms where Charles Rwanga and the others -- that is, Charles, his children and his wife, including Albert, whom you mentioned in your testimony, where they were located? 
@WITNESS ACS
I have told you that most of those people were with me. But I stated further that you did not have to ask me where each and every one of those people was located -- in which specific room. But those people whom you just mentioned were in the same room with me, except Mr. Ruhanga, who was in hiding in a separate location. But most of those people were with me. So I don't want to repeat this -- I've already mentioned it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So should I conclude, Witness, that most of the refugees were in a single room and that just a few other refugees were located in another room? 
@WITNESS ACS
Here comes my answer: We were in several rooms; there was not only one room. So I think that addresses your problem, because I don't really think that that is what is indeed important in my testimony. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you able to know how many refugees were there in all, at that time, including you, of course? 
@WITNESS ACS
That is a question I've answered already. I have told you we were many, but I can't remember the exact number of refugees. I told you I did not conduct a census. I told you I did not try to remember who had died and who had survived to be able to give you a specific figure. And as the President himself has said, I don't want to repeat myself; that is a question I've answered already. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, the Defence needs specific information about this. Were you more than 100, more than 200 or more than 300? I believe you can make a difference between those three figures. 
@WITNESS ACS
I told you that on that occasion, more than 40 people died and many people survived that day. I cannot give you a specific figure. I simply told you we were many. I gave you the number of people who were killed and I told you many of us remained at that place. In any case, we were more than 100; we were quite many. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, when more than 40 people were taken away, do you have an idea about how many men remained there? 
@WITNESS ACS
Yes, there were quite many of us there, but I can give you some names of certain men there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Spare me the names, Witness, just give me an approximate figure, please. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, no names now, Mr. Witness, only figures. 
@WITNESS ACS:
I would say about 20 men remained at CELA and they survived. Now, if the Court wants the names of those people, I can give the names in writing. I won't do that now -- you see, we are in open session. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, Witness, one can reasonably conclude that as of the 22nd of April, you were about 60 men at CELA? 
@WITNESS ACS
Those are the people I remember very well and whose names I know. But there were other people there whose names I didn't know. I'm talking to you about the people I knew very well -- neighbours who were in the same secteur as I was. But there were people who had come from elsewhere -- for instance, from Rugunga, or from other neighbourhoods in Kiyovu or even Gikondo. This should be very clear. I did not know all those people. Some of them had even come from Kacyiru, so you'd understand that I didn't know them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, all those people -- all those men who had come from elsewhere, approximately how many of them remained after about 40 men had been taken away from CELA? 
@WITNESS ACS
I have told you that I did not conduct a census. I did not make an inventory. I did not try to know how many men survived at that centre. I was at that place to seek refuge. My mind was not thinking about counting those people -- making a headcount. Perhaps Préfet Renzaho, who was the chief administrator at the PVK, could give you such figures. He can tell you how many people were at Rugenge secteur, because there were figures. We had data -- data provided to him by the conseillers and the responsables of the cellule, so he can give you those figures. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, could you briefly describe to the Trial Chamber, CELA at the time, and also by locating the area where people were carrying out community work, as well as the room in which you had sought refuge? Could you give a brief description of the location, if that is possible? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen, it's absolutely impossible to answer such a long and compound question briefly. So if you really want this information, you must split it up. We will never end with that answer. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Very well, Mr. President, I shall do so. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, from the entrance of CELA, can you tell the Trial Chamber where, exactly, was the room in which you had sought refuge? 
@WITNESS ACS
I do not know whether you have already visited the CELA centre so that I can tell you in which room I was. I do not know whether you have a plan of CELA or a sketch, and then I could tell you in which room I was. For you to be able to understand where the room was located, you should either have a plan of the area or you should have visited CELA. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, from the main entrance of CELA, there is a building which is along the corridor, am I correct? 
@WITNESS ACS
That is correct, but there is a -- some distance between the main entrance and this building you are talking about, because immediately after the main entrance, there's a courtyard, and the first building is the one where there is a room, and it is exactly there that I was. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, as you see, it was easier to answer my question in that way, Witness. 
Witness, the day before the incident of the 22nd of April 1994, was there any incident whatsoever at CELA? 
@WITNESS ACS
That was a long time ago and I do not recall whether there was any incident prior to the event I referred to. Are you talking about the day before the incident or any incidents which would have come before the major event we talked about? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Generally speaking, Witness, during your stay and until the 22nd of April, was there any other incident? 
@WITNESS ACS
I told you that I had arrived there towards the end of the week when the president died, and I do not believe there was any specific incident in CELA until that date of the 22nd of April. Oh, I have just remembered one detail because, as you know, this was a long time ago. I do not recall the exact date, but while I was at CELA, I remember that Interahamwe came to seek refuge where we were. I remember one Aluwa, Joseph, who came and who told us that he was trying to seek refuge there. He spent the day in CELA -- and, if my memory serves me well, there was some fighting at the time against the Inkotanyi in Kacyiru, and people came running to CELA, among which the gentleman I just referred to. And when Aluwa arrived at CELA, I believe it was before noon, he remained there until the evening and then, in the evening, he went back to his home. And we believe that this same Aluwa was the one who had put -- had written the list of those who were at CELA, and which was used subsequently. 
So this occurred before the 22nd of April. I did not mention this incident in my written statement, but I just remembered it -- thanks to the question put to me by Defence counsel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you please spell the last name of Joseph? 
@WITNESS ACS:
Aluwa is spelt A-L-U-W-A. I do not know whether I can proceed to explain to you where this name comes from, it is not a Kinyarwanda name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine, Mr. Witness, here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us now turn to this incident of the 22nd of April 1994. When the members of the population arrived, were there gendarmes at the gates of CELA? 
@WITNESS ACS
No, there were no gendarmes -- except for those who arrived in the company of Renzaho. There never were any gendarmes at CELA, and the gendarmes were never in charge of that security of that centre ever since I had arrived there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And when the population got there, could you tell the Trial Chamber whether Mr. Renzaho and the other Interahamwe arrived at the same time or whether it was a bit later and how -- what time elapsed between this arrival and the arrival of the second group? 
@WITNESS ACS
What I do remember is that Préfet Renzaho, as I already stated, arrived with two armoured vehicles on board of which were soldiers and gendarmes, and he was also accompanied by 
Bourgmestre Bizimana. But I note that Defence counsel is asking me to repeat the names once again. I do not know whether this might not take too much time, but the préfet was accompanied by the bourgmestre, the conseiller and the inspector. They all came in the same group -- well, it's the Defence counsel who is forcing me to come back to -- to revisit the matter, even if that was not necessary, 
Mr. President. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when you are saying that they all came in the same group, you referred to the members of the population who were carrying out community work. Is it with those members of the population that Mr. Renzaho arrived? 
@WITNESS ACS
If you followed me closely, I told you that the members of the population were cutting the bushes around the CELA centre, and they were saying that they were looking for the Inyenzi -- from what I was told subsequently. You will understand that the préfet and the other officials I mentioned could not have gone into the bushes. They sent members of the population for them to do this clearing work. I believe you should put the question to your client because he was the one who was in charge of organising the community work, also known as umuganda. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you see the population arrive in order to carry out the community work -- and this from your vantage point on that day? 
@WITNESS ACS
What I saw was that the bushes behind the centre were being cleared; we could all see that. But when we left the centre in order to seek refuge elsewhere, we were able to see that; it was not very far. The bushes were outside of the courtyard and all those who were in the centre could see such bushes, and this was not done without any noise. There was a lot of noise. The members of the population were shouting, "Where are the Inyenzi?" If you had been in Rwanda at the time, I could have told you how the genocide took place. Everything took place in broad daylight; there was no secrecy whatsoever. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are falling back to a bad habit. Your answers are too long. You see, what counsel wants to know now is very simple. He wants to know the persons who started to clear the bushes, did they come before Mr. Renzaho or did he arrive together with them and send them in to clear the bushes? Can you help us with that little bit in one sentence, please? 
@WITNESS ACS:
I thank you, Mr. President. If Defence counsel had worded his question in the way you did, I would have been able to answer it. 
The members of the population arrived there first and subsequently, Renzaho and his group arrived. But, when Renzaho arrived, the members of the population were still busy clearing the bushes; they had not yet finished their work. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, which part of CELA were the members of the population clearing before Mr. Renzaho arrived? 
@WITNESS ACS
Earlier on I told you that it would be easier if you had a plan of the buildings, but it was in the part that was down the road, because up -- in -- in the upper area, there was the tarmac road. So it was in the direction of the Saint Paul centre. If you have the sketch with the centre, you will be able to locate that area. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you are saying, "in the lower part", that is, after that room where you were, or was it in the upper part -- and this compared to your vantage point? 
@WITNESS ACS
It was lower -- as if one wanted to go around the centre, and we could see the people who were clearing that area, and there was a lot of noise. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, we all know where the entrance of CELA is -- is that area on the left-hand side of the entrance, or the right-hand side of the entrance? Where was it that the community work was taking place? 
@WITNESS ACS
It is on the right-hand side of anyone who would be entering the centre. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let me remind you that when one enters the centre, it is the building that we find -- it is the first building that one finds. Can you tell the Trial Chamber which bushes were being cleared by the members of the population on that day? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That question was not clear. 
Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
I was just -- sorry, Your Honours, I was just trying to make the point, it's going to only get an unclear response. In my opinion, this line of questioning, in the absence of any document or sketch or whatever, it's going to leave everyone, I think, somewhat confused. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. What do want to achieve, Defence counsel? I assume that you are disputing that the witness was there. That can be the only aim of this line. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Then my objective is being reached, Mr. President, because I do not believe the witness should require a plan to tell me exactly what was taking place on that day. And once I get the answer to the last question I just put to him, I'm going to prove that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you must be clear. At least the English version was not very easy to understand and I also see the French version and am not convinced that you will ensure efficient communication. So try again, please. Kindly reformulate. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I shall do so, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I was telling you that when one is at the main entrance of CELA, as you described it, what one has on one's right is the building which is along the corridor and there are no bushes there. I wish for you to tell the Chamber, on the basis of the description I have just provided, where were the bushes you are referring to that were cleared on the 22nd of April by the members of the population? 
@WITNESS ACS
I don't know when it was that you visited the CELA centre, but if you were to visit it today, you would not see any bushes, because new buildings were built. So I do not know when it was that you visited CELA for me to be able to explain to you. There were even Eucalyptus plants, which are no longer there today, because at the location where such plants were, there are buildings today. So please tell me when it was that you visited the centre and then I can provide explanations to you -- in 1994, or in 1995? Because today, there are buildings there and you cannot imagine that where such new buildings are, there used to be trees and bushes. So, please tell me when it was that you visited the CELA centre for me to be able to provide you with an answer that will take into account the knowledge you have of the centre. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, it's clear, Mr. Witness, that Defence counsel visited CELA after '94, that's obvious. Now please do not repeat your answers over and over again. Let' see whether we can now do this in an efficient way. 
We have P. 3, map of CELA; P. 4, map of CELA; P. 6, photo book of CELA. So you have three documents, Defence counsel, that you can use in the communication with the witness. If you really want to pursue this, in what way do you want to ensure that we achieve something? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I shall put the suggestion to the witness in order to conclude with this line of questioning, and I will not require the exhibit for that purpose -- even though I wish to thank the Chamber for having made such a proposal to me. 
And with your leave, Mr. President, I shall put one final question to the witness on this issue. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I put it to you that from the entrance of CELA, the only bushes there were, were on the left side of the CELA entrance, that is to say, facing further up -- facing the building that is on the right and this is contrary to the description you provided whereby there were bushes further down. There were no bushes there in 1994 and there are none today. What do you say to that? 
@WITNESS ACS
I would not go as far as saying that you are lying, but I did not make any mistake in my statement and I do not believe I am the only witness who has been called to testify on the incidents that occurred in CELA. But regarding the bushes, the bushes were further down on the side of the facilities of JOC. There's the entrance of CELA and today there are new buildings that were erected by brothers. On the left-hand side, further up, it's the tarmac road, and further, we have the Kinyamateka buildings. What bushes would there have been there? Such bushes would not even have required that the members of the population be present to clear them. 
My feeling is that you're trying to delay the proceedings, and I am absolutely certain that there will be other witnesses who will explain this to you. There were bushes that went all the way to the Saint Paul centre, and passing further up, as you stated, one could not reach the Saint Paul centre because one would have to first cross the buildings of the Kinyamateka newspaper. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we move on? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I did not follow the -- the answer (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you not hear the witness's last answer or my remark? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
It is your observation which I did not hear, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
My suggestion is that it is probably wise if you could move on to the next line now. That was also your intention, I understood. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Indeed, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what was the time that elapsed between the time the work started and Mr. Renzaho arrived? 
@WITNESS ACS
It did not take very long. I told you that the community work had started in the morning, and Renzaho also arrived during the morning. And I told you that the operation continued until early afternoon. I cannot give you any exact time at which Renzaho arrived, but I can confirm that the community work was still ongoing when Renzaho arrived on the site. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
In what vehicle did Mr. Renzaho arrive, if you recall? Do you remember the make of the vehicle? 
@WITNESS ACS
No, I can not remember on board which vehicle Mr. Renzaho arrived. I simply said that he arrived on board his vehicle. So, there was his vehicle, the pickup truck, which took the people away, as well as the armoured vehicles. I did not -- I was not in a position to check and thus be aware of the make of the vehicle. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did all the vehicles come into the courtyard of CELA, Witness? 
@WITNESS ACS
I remember that it was only Renzaho's vehicle that came into the compound and that the others remained outside, behind the gate. But Renzaho's vehicle entered the compound. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And who was with Mr. Renzaho -- in the vehicle? 
@WITNESS ACS
Counsel, you are making my life difficult when you're asking me who was with Renzaho in the vehicle. I only saw the person who went on board the vehicle when the vehicle left. I already gave you the list of those who were with him, but I did not pay attention to the other people who were in the vehicle. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, how did those who were accompanying Mr. Renzaho arrive, do you recall? 
@WITNESS ACS
I told you that we saw them when they entered the compound of CELA. So I do not know how they got there. I merely saw them once we were asked to come out. I do not know how they arrived at the centre. I only saw them enter the compound. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What about the escort you mentioned, Witness? Was it around Mr. Renzaho when he arrived? 
@WITNESS ACS
What escort did I refer to, Counsel? I was talk -- I -- I referred to the people who came with him. When you're talking about escort, I have a feeling you're talking about those who were in charge of his personal security. I made no such reference to bodyguards. 
Furthermore, he himself was well aware of the incident. Unless he is disputing that there were incidents in CELA and is disputing that he was present. 
Mr. President, could you please ask the Accused whether he is disputing the fact that he was present at CELA on that occasion, so that this will put an end to the questions put to me by counsel, who is repeatedly dealing with the same issues? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not the time to ask that question, Mr. Witness. But we are now well into your cross-examination and I do not think there is so much left, so please be patient. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I'm going to read a small portion, a very small portion of your statement of 2004 to you. It's actually the last page of your statement, page 4 of the French version, the beginning of the fourth paragraph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please start. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now this is what you said: 
"On the 22nd of April 1994, we were visited by Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho, escorted by a group of soldiers and about 20 Interahamwes -- some of whom I knew." 
That is the only passage I'm going to read out to you to refresh your recollection to the fact that indeed you mentioned him being escorted. So I am pleading with you to describe to the Chamber how that escort was accompanying Mr. Renzaho when you saw them arrive. 
@WITNESS ACS
Thank you for that question. In fact, I think I've already explained that. You just said that in my statement I mentioned Renzaho's visit. Actually, we thought the préfet was visiting us; that is why we immediately came outside, because we thought it was for our protection. So you yourself have read that we were rather delighted at the visit. 
About his escort, the soldiers accompanying him carried firearms. I don't remember saying that they were providing his protection. I even said that there were gendarmes and other personalities there. That is what I said in my statement. I don't know what you want me to explain to you in that statement. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When Mr. Renzaho ordered that men be picked out, as you said, how far were you from him? 
@WITNESS ACS
But, Counsel, I have the impression that you always want to take us back. Don't ask me how far I was from him. It is impossible for me to tell you how far we were. But even in this courtroom, we can hear one another. We were in a queue, but don't ask me the exact distance separating me from 
Mr. Renzaho. I just gave you the example of this courtroom where anyone sitting in this courtroom -- at any corner of this courtroom can hear anybody else in this courtroom who is speaking. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and let's use this courtroom now, Mr. Witness. You are sitting where you are, would you say that the distance is, for instance, between you and Defence counsel, or between you and me, or between you and one of the booths on the two sides of the courtroom? What would be your estimate? 
@WITNESS ACS:
We had been lined up -- we had been asked to line up, but the women were not part of our group. So, we had lined up so as to hear him. We thought he had good tidings for us. So the men queued up on one side and women queued up on the other side. So, from the place we were, we could hear and see what was being said and done. So after he asked us to line up, that was the time when names on the list were read out, the names of the most wanted people. So everyone could hear what was being said. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But the question is very simple: What was the distance between you and Mr. Renzaho, and we realise that it's very difficult after 12 years to estimate metres, but since you yourself referred to this courtroom, can you compare the distance with something inside this courtroom? Would you say it's from that one to that wall, or is it from you to the Bench, or is it from you to Defence counsel? 
@WITNESS ACS:
It is the same distance -- like the one between me and Préfet Renzaho at this instant. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, according to the courtroom measurements, the distance between the witness to the middle of the first row of the Defence is 7 metres and 40 centimetres, so about 8 metres then. We realise that this is only an estimate. 
Next question? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you said during your evidence-in-chief that Mr. Renzaho gave a list to Mrs. Mukandituye and told her that she could take whoever she wanted. Is that what was done in the final analysis -- or, were those picked out only those whose names were on the list? 
@WITNESS ACS
I said that after Renzaho gave the list to Angeline Mukandituye -- telling her to take whoever she wanted -- the names on the list were read out, and those were the people who went away -- those whose names were on the list. After that, he told the others to return to their homes -- that that is where their security would be ensured. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You gave the names of some of the people who were on that list. Obviously, should I consider that your name was not on that list? 
@WITNESS ACS
My name was not on that list -- otherwise I would've went with the others. Besides, there were other men who stayed back and who were my neighbours; that is why I'm telling you that those who left were the people whose names were on the list. Let me, however, point out that subsequently some of those people who stayed back on that occasion were killed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
According to you, Witness, were those picked out people -- who had a common denominator, which made it possible for them to be picked out. 
@WITNESS ACS
What common denominator are you referring to, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
From what you could observe on that day, was there something common to all those people which warranted them being picked out on that day? 
@WITNESS ACS
Sir, kindly give me an example of one of those criterion so that I'll be able to answer you. I don't quite understand your question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Since you all knew one another, were those wanted senior Tutsi officials, or were they Inkotanyi -- that is, people who had infiltrated -- that is, young people? Or was it simply that you did not know what the criteria were? 
@WITNESS ACS
Who told you those people were the Inkotanyi? The Inkotanyi were not in Kigali; they were in Byumba. They were not Inkotanyi; they were Tutsi who had gone into hiding just as we had. And if they had been the Inkotanyi, they would have defended themselves. They were Tutsi civilians who, just like me, had sought refuge. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, you said other Tutsi civilians stayed back, but not all of them were picked out. Why? 
@WITNESS ACS
I explained to you that the names on the list were read out, and the people whose names were read, were taken away on the orders of Renzaho. Then, Renzaho told us to leave that location and to return to our homes where we would be protected. But, that was not true. I don't want to dwell on this because it is something I have visited comprehensively. I said that I realised I could not go and seek refuge elsewhere -- but, for instance, I could not go to the Sainte Famille site, given that Munyeshyaka was responsible for that site was -- was participating in the attack. I even explained that most of the CELA survivors who went to the Sainte Famille site were subsequently killed. I will end there, 
Mr. President, so as not to waste time. But, once again, let me ask Defence counsel to refrain from constantly taking us back. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, kindly do your duty to shed light on issues and questions being put to you and to refrain from making such comments to Defence counsel, who is doing only his job. Can we agree on that? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that doesn't call for any comment. 
What is the next question? I understand this witness's testimony as being, that his perception of the relevant criterion for selecting people was that their names were read out. That is what he knows. I think that is the situation. Where do we go from now? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you said when those people were picked out -- they were taken away in that pickup truck, is that correct? 
@WITNESS ACS
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did the pickup truck enter the compound so as to carry those people -- or, were they led outside the compound before they got into the pickup? 
@WITNESS ACS
Now, let us take the example of the door behind you. The door was there. The pickup remained behind the door and it was at this level where I am that the people were taken away in that vehicle. I don't know how you want me to be more graphic. The Interahamwe were armed -- and when someone is being taken to be killed, it all happens and unfolds very fast. It was just like sacks of beans were being loaded into the vehicle. I won't say it was outside or inside the compound; it was actually at the gate. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And at the time that they were entering the pickup, do you know exactly where the pickup was heading to? 
@WITNESS ACS
I didn't know immediately, but I learnt subsequently. As I told you, I had a good neighbour, and when I left the CELA centre to return to my home, it was that neighbour who told me all what had happened. He was the one who described to me how those people had been taken away from the CELA centre, the destination they had taken and the circumstances under which they were executed. We subsequently conducted investigations to confirm and ascertain that -- even when you are in hiding, you do all what is in your power to know how your relatives were killed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, did -- did that person, did he tell you the direction the pickup truck took? 
@WITNESS ACS
I've already explained that, Counsel, but let me repeat myself. The pickup truck went down towards the place where our secteur office was located. I'd rather not mention the name of that place because we're in open session. And along the road, they were killing the people who were in the vehicle up to the point where were located those mass graves; the place nicknamed CND. And it was in that mass grave that they dumped the bodies, and I told you that during the exhumation, we were able to identify certain bodies by their clothes that the victims were wearing at the time they met their death and subsequently dumped in the graves. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Regarding the pickup, Witness, can you remind the Court of how big the pickup was? When you talk about the pickup truck, is it like a Toyota pickup, or is it like a tipper lorry? 
@WITNESS ACS
It was a pickup. A pickup is smaller than a lorry -- or, a tipper. I did not pay attention to know whether it was a Toyota or a Daihatsu pickup. All that I know is that it was not a tipper lorry, because a tipper lorry would be bigger. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is this word "kipper" or "tipper" lorry? Can you help, please? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
It's spelt T-I-P-P-E-R, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A tipper lorry, thank you very much -- thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And all those 40 people, who had been selected, were carried at the rear of that pickup truck? 
@WITNESS ACS
Yes, they were all carried in that pickup. You can imagine for yourself the circumstances under which someone is taken to the abattoir; they are not really normal circumstances. Such pickup trucks can even load as much as 100 people -- since they're being taken to be killed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When those people climbed into the pickup trucks, had they been tied? 
@WITNESS ACS
No, they had not been tied, but what I know is that they were being manhandled when they were climbing -- some of them were even kicked around, and they climbed one on top of the other, none of them was even standing. When you put such questions to me, I believe you're being deliberate. How do you think someone being taken to the gallows is transported, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did the Interahamwe also climb into the vehicle as well as the soldiers accompanying Mr. Renzaho? 
@WITNESS ACS
I don't know what you want. Are you asking whether they were in the same vehicle as Mr. Renzaho? I didn't quite understand your question. All that I know is that some of those Interahamwe were hanging on to the frames of the cabin and were even standing on the bodies of the people who were to be killed. Renzaho did not accompany them; he simply gave the order that they be taken away. He did not go with that vehicle accompanying the victims. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you have an idea of the number of Interahamwes who were hanging on to the frames of the pickup truck, Witness? 
@WITNESS ACS
I believe that in my statement I had already given the figure. I talked about the number of people who had come with Renzaho, but there were also other people who were part of the population that was clearing the bushes. I mentioned Nkeshimana, Castar and Bwanakweri -- they were also in their numbers and they were armed. 
I told you I did not conduct a census to know the number of Interahamwes who were present there -- the number of Interahamwes who left with the people who had been taken away from the CELA centre, but I'd given specifics in my previous statements. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on, we have, of course, Castar as 39 and Nkeshimana as 183, but what was that third name, do we have that? 
@WITNESS ACS:
I think it is Bwanakweri and that is not mentioned in my statement, but I can also remember other names as time goes on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, do we have it? 
Can you spell it, Mr. Witness, Bwanakweri?
@WITNESS ACS:
That name is spelt B-W-A-N-A-K-W-E-R-I. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And we do not want you to add any other names, but have we now been through the three names that you mentioned. You didn't mention more names, did you? 
@WITNESS ACS:
Actually, I mentioned four. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what is the fourth name, please? 
@WITNESS ACS:
I mentioned Nkeshimana, Bwanakweri, Fidèle, Castar and Faustin Rwagatara. 
@MR. MOSES:
That's on the additional list at number 4, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Next question, please? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, concerning that pickup, which was carrying the 40 people who had been selected, I would like you to give me an approximate number of Interahamwe who were also on board, and who had been hanging on to the frames of the pickup to lead the people to be killed. 
@WITNESS ACS
That is a question I just answered, Counsel. I really don't understand why you are asking me the same question again. I told you I did not make a census. I gave those names in answer to that question, Counsel. I said there were a number of Interahamwe who left with those victims. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So there were many of them, but you cannot give an estimated number? 
@WITNESS ACS
When I say there were many Interahamwe, actually, I mean there were more than 10 people. Don't say I just said there were 10 of them, but what I mean is that there were more than 10. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you think that it is realistic for more than 10 people to be on board a pickup truck which is already carrying more than 40 people? Do you think that is reasonable? 
@WITNESS ACS
I told you that when people are sitting comfortably, that is not (sic) impossible. But those were people being taken to their killing ground. They had just been piled one on top of the other; it could have even been more than 100. There were many people. I think even some of them had to be killed on the way because there were so many of them. I believe I have explained this already. Let's not talk about the figures, let's talk about what happened. Let's talk about how those people met their death. But, the fact that the truck was full of people is not a problem to me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a difference between the English and French version of what was said in Kinyarwanda. I think the French version is correct. I will read it: 
"I told you that when people are transported comfortably, that's impossible. But those were people taken to be killed."
So now we have removed that discrepancy. 
Next question, please. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, among the people who were picked out, you told the Trial Chamber that many of them were people you knew quite well; am I correct? 
@WITNESS ACS
That is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So these are people whose death remains in your memory, am I correct? 
@WITNESS ACS
Yes, Counsel.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you remember having gone to give a statement dated 27th of April 1998 on those events at the level of the Rwandan judicial authorities? 
@WITNESS ACS
Yes, I do remember. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you recall also having gone, on the 20th of March 2000, to file a complaint against the people who were responsible for such incidents? 
@WITNESS ACS
I do recall having made statements, but tell me about the crimes I mentioned, so that I can answer. What specific statement are you referring to, Counsel, and who are those people I filed complaints against during such statements, for me to be able to better answer your question? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You just referred to a document dated the 20th of March 2000, according to what we have in the transcripts. Is that what you said, or did you say the 20th of March 2003? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, we have received a statement of the 20th of March 2000, but it is written the 20th of March 2003, and there is a written correction that has been put on the copy we have with us -- a handwritten correction. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, thank you. 
And the question now? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let me refer to your statement dated 27th of April 1998, and I will only mention the reference you made to CELA in such a statement, because it would be tedious to read out all this statement. It is document K03091 (sic), and I am on page K0163092. 
Witness, let me read out the very first question put to you on the second page. And here is the question: "All those 18 people, did they commit the same acts?" And your answer is: "Yes, they committed the same acts. They were in the crisis committee. His objective was to defend itself, get rid of accomplices by exterminating them." 
Let me read out the whole paragraph. 
"According to them, the accomplices were the Tutsi. Regarding the acts they perpetrated, I personally know that they killed people in many places, namely CELA, Sainte Famille, and Saint Paul." I shall stop here, and I would like to tell you that you referred to CELA. Does this refresh your memory? 
@WITNESS ACS
Yes, I do remember, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. 
Witness, could you, therefore, explain to me why, on the 27th of April 1998, you did not mention the name of Préfet Renzaho as being amongst the perpetrators or co-perpetrators of the CELA incident? 
@WITNESS ACS
Thank you, Counsel. The Trial Chamber should make a distinction between the two documents. In that statement I made in 1998 at the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda, this statement is different from the statement on the CELA attack in which I mentioned Préfet Renzaho. 
Mr. President, I -- this might take some time, but I need to provide all the necessary explanations. 
When I made the statement at the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda, I was not referring to the crimes that were perpetrated at the Saint Paul or Sainte Famille centres, because for me Renzaho was not concerned by such events. And even for what happened in our neighbourhood, I did not refer to Renzaho. But Renzaho participated in the events at the CELA centre, along with other people. There are meetings I referred to, and for which I did -- I made no reference to Renzaho. I only talked about Renzaho on the occasion of the meeting that was held in 1990. 
So you should not mix up the two documents. The statement of 1990 deals with the people who lived in my secteur. It is true that some of them were with Renzaho at CELA, so I did not need to refer specifically to Renzaho in that statement because he did not participate in all the crimes that were perpetrated by the -- these people who were living in my secteur. So a distinction should be made between the two statements. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, in your complaint dated 20th of March 2000, you wished to be heard on Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye. Before I read out a short excerpt of this statement, I would like us to agree on one point. You have mentioned these two persons as being -- as both being authors of the incidents in CELA perpetrated, along with Mr. Renzaho, on the 22nd of April 1994; am I correct? 
@WITNESS ACS
That is correct, Counsel. Let me seize the opportunity to tell you that the people I talked about in the framework of the crisis committee, I would like to say that I have filed complaints against them and I can provide explanations. I could not mention Renzaho when talking about the crisis committee or the Saint Paul centre. When I went to testify before the public prosecutor's office, I did not refer to Renzaho because he was not involved in those specific cases. I started with those who were my neighbours. But even to this day, we are still filing complaints against other people. I wish for this to be clear. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let me read out a short excerpt of this record of hearing. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
This is page PG001516, Your Honours. And I would like to read out the second question put to the witness, as well as his answer, and then the third question put to him. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So here's the question put to you, Witness. And I quote: "Do you know Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye?" And your answer is: "I know them." Question: "What was their behaviour during the genocide?" And your answer is quite lengthy, so that I will not read it out. Do you recall having made such a statement in 2000? 
@WITNESS ACS
I already provided explanations regarding that event. I told you that I remembered having made the statement before the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
In your lengthy answer regarding the behaviour of these two persons during the genocide, you did not refer at any point to any acts perpetrated by them, along with Mr. Renzaho. Why is that? 
@WITNESS ACS
Well, I do not know whether I'm being understood, Counsel. I told you that I talked about Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye before the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda, within the framework of the crisis committee. I talked about the meetings that were taking place; I talked about the crimes they had committed at the Saint Paul centre, as well as in my neighbourhood. I explained to you that I could not talk about Renzaho and involve him in acts that had to do with the crisis committee when I had not noted his presence. 
I talked about Renzaho with regard to what happened in CELA. You have to understand that they did not commit crimes only at CELA. So I could not accuse Renzaho of what had occurred at the Saint Paul centre, or of anything that had to do with the crisis committee meetings when I was not aware that he was involved in such events. I talked about these people, taking into account what had happened in CELA, but I also talked about them, describing other events in other sites where Renzaho was not involved. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, Mr. Renzaho had people who were dear to you killed, and on two occasions you go to the Rwandan judicial authorities, you talk about his accomplices and co-perpetrators regarding such events without ever referring to Mr. Renzaho? Do you believe that such a thing is normal? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But we do not need a repetition of the witness's answer now. He has responded. Opinions may be divided whether this is convincing or not, but the Bench has understood. 
Are there any other questions left? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I shall abide by the decision of the Trial Chamber requesting me to move on to another subject. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I put it to you that you were never at CELA on the 22nd of April 1994, and that you never saw Renzaho -- Mr. Renzaho there. What do you say to that? 
@WITNESS ACS
Are you saying that I did not see Renzaho on the 22nd of April? But, Counsel, he is sitting right beside you. Put the question to him and ask him whether he was not at CELA on that date, and then we can proceed. Did you put the question to him, and did he tell you that he was not at CELA on that date? Ask him whether he was not at CELA. 
Mr. President, the allegations made by Defence counsel are untruthful. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness maintains his version. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether I should interrupt the witness while he is speaking. I was waiting for him to finish, and then I would continue. Because a number of observations are made to me by the Trial Chamber, and if my cross-examination seems to be exasperating a number of people, I'm willing to stop at that point -- at this point. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The situation is only that we want to avoid repetition. And you did now simply put to the witness that what he said about CELA was not correct. Then he gave a long answer. In order to do this in an efficient way, we are summarising that he maintains his version. That is the gist of all the questions that he is putting to you again. 
What is the next question? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what were the clothes that were on Charles Rwanga's dead body as you discovered it -- at Iyaremye's house? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I don't believe he mentioned that particular person. I think he referred to Albert from ORINFOR and one other person, but it was not the name that has been mentioned as one of the two bodies that he said he discovered. I may be incorrect, but that's my strong recollection. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Answer this question with a yes or no, Mr. Witness. Did you see Charles Rwanga's dead body? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
No, Charles Rwanga's body was never found. And I made no reference in my testimony of the fact that he would have been found anywhere. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, on this matter, let me refresh your memory on the basis of your statement made on the 24th of November 2004. Page 4 of the said statement, French version. And let me read out the beginning of the fourth paragraph. And this is what you state, Witness: 
"Angelina (sic) had a list of several people whom the Interahamwe called out and put aside. Among them were Charles Lwanga (sic)" -- I assume it's Rwanga -- "a bricklayer, and his two sons, Wilson and Déglote, Emmanuel Gihana, and Albert. The Interahamwe took them out of the CELA centre in order to kill them on the orders of Renzaho, who said, 'Take these people away.' We found their remains in mass graves after the genocide. We identified their bodies by the design on their clothes." 
Was that indeed your statement, Witness? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS ACS
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. Could you now answer the question I put to you previously, that is to say, what type of clothes were they wearing when you found their remains? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now the question is more general. You want to know the clothes of the victims in plural. 
But the point here now, Mr. Witness, is that according to this -- this statement, Charles Rwanga seemed to be included amongst the bodies found. Now, what is your comment on that? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
That is not correct. I mentioned those that we were able to identify thanks to their clothes. I talked about Albert and I talked about Gihana. And even if you read out my statement again, Charles Rwanga is not mentioned amongst those who were identified thanks to their clothes. I gave the names of those bodies we were able to identify by their clothes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that's the witness's answer. Do you now want to pursue this in relation to the clothes of the other persons? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of my cross-examination, and the only thing that remains is for me to ask the Trial Chamber to kindly have admitted into evidence the documents I used throughout my cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will do that in a moment. 
Now, any re-examination? That's not the case. 
Are you ready to indicate the documents you want to tender, Mr. Nekuie? Which one do you want to start with? Do you want to start with the one on 27th April 1998? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 20. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the handwritten Kinyarwandan version, B for the French, C for the English. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 20A, D. 20B, and D. 20C admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you then want to move on to the 20th of March 2000? It follows from the original handwritten Kinyarwandan version that this is indeed from the year 2000, not 2003, which is in the English version. So it's 2000, just as marked in the French version. 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 21. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the handwritten Kinyarwandan version, B for the French, C for the English. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 21A, D. 21B, and D. 21C admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then you also read from the document 24th November 2004. There we have only two versions typed. The signed version is the French one. A for the French, B for the English. 
And the number, Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 22. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And all these three will then be placed under separate cover -- under seal. Thank you.

@MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm obliged, Mr. President. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, just one question, please. Did I understand you to say that after October 1990, when Renzaho became prefect of Kigali, he instituted a procedure whereby everybody -- where people needed passes to travel within Kigali préfecture? Is that what was -- was that your evidence? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I believe I had not insisted on that point, but perhaps I can do so now. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
No, I just wanted to ask, was that your evidence? Then I can ask the next question. 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I believe I have made such a statement, but I don't know whether I referred to passes. But such passes were established in order to try and restrain movements of people so as to make the killings easier. When the passes were instituted, it was an initiative from the Kigali town préfecture, and more specifically, an initiative by Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho in order to keep people in Kigali town, for them to be killed easily. But before he was appointed préfet, there were no passes. And even if you were to put the question to him, I do not think he would deny that. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you -- 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I don't know whether I have answered your question. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes, you have, but there is a second arm to the question. Did this apply to everybody living in Kigali préfecture, or were there only certain persons who needed these passes? 
@WITNESS ACS: 
Thank you. The laissez-passer was not required for all the inhabitants of Kigali. The Tutsi alone were to get such a pass, and it was in fact a strategy to prevent the Tutsi from leaving the town of Kigali to join the Inkotanyi, or to go to other countries. But the Tutsi would never be able to get the pass. And in order to get the pass, one would have to give very convincing reasons. 
Let me give you my own example: I was never able to get such a pass issued to me, and I'm not the only one. If you conduct an investigation, you will hear about the situation that prevailed in Kigali town at the time. It was not possible to leave one commune of the Kigali town préfecture to go to another because there was distrust vis-à-vis the Tutsi, and they were said to be Inyenzis who were infiltrating Kigali town. The passes were issued only for the Kigali town préfecture, that is to say, in the three communes which made up this préfecture, that is to say Nyarugenge, Kacyiru and Gikondo -- Kicukiro, sorry. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness. Thank you for having come the long way to Kigali -- to Arusha to testify in these proceedings, and we wish you a very safe journey home. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you very much. 
@WITNESS ACS: 
I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. Thank you for having kindly listened to my testimony, and I would like you to indeed make use of this testimony during your deliberations. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a witness in the waiting room. We will just be able to swear in that person. I suppose he or she has been waiting for some time, and we should ensure that that has not been in vain.

Madam Witness, we will commence your testimony tomorrow morning in this courtroom at 8:45. 
Anything of an administrative nature? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just to indicate that I do believe, bearing in mind the nature -- the place where the evidence that this witness is to testify about and its relation -- its proximity to her own residence, we're going to have to at least commence and lead most of the evidence which relates to that place in closed session.

$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, do you remember that when we finished yesterday, you had just described what happened at Sainte Famille on, you thought, about the 16th of June 1994. Do you remember that? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
Yes, I do. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you said that after Renzaho came the second time, he beckoned -- or it's unclear, actually, whether it was Renzaho or the lieutenant in terms of the -- in charge of the gendarmes. But you said that he beckoned one of the Interahamwe. Can you recall who it was who beckoned to the Interahamwe? Was it Renzaho or the lieutenant, or somebody else altogether? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
I explained to you that it was Renzaho who beckoned to the Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You also said that, then, the Interahamwe called Cimba came back and said, "Musee has just ordered us to stop". If you have a view on this, can you tell the Court, please, who you believed he meant by "Musee"? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
Usually in Kinyarwanda when you use that word, it is out of politeness and deference. And when I heard it, I realized that of the people present the most respectable was Renzaho. Now, if you ask me, I will tell you my understanding was that the Interahamwe was referring to Renzaho. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you very much. I have no more questions for you, Madam Witness, but the Defence may have. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Madam Witness, may I ask you, during your testimony you mentioned names of two ladies, Odette and Angeline. Did you know those ladies before the events in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
Yes. I knew them because Angeline had been the head teacher of the school complex where I attended second -- primary school. Subsequently, she was promoted to the post of school inspector for Nyarugenge commune. But above all, she was **************. Concerning Odette Nyirabagenzi, she was a conseiller de secteur, and I knew her because her home was close to the school complex where I attended primary school. And, in fact, her children were schoolmates of mine. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. And do you know what happened to these ladies after the events?

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us delve into the events at CELA immediately, and let us start by talking about the soldiers who accompanied Mr. Renzaho when he arrived there. And in that connection, my question is to know whether at the time you could make a difference between soldiers and gendarmes. Are you able to tell us whether those accompanying Mr. Renzaho were soldiers, or gendarmes? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
Yes. I can make a distinction between gendarmes and soldiers. Soldiers had blue or green berets, whereas gendarmes had red berets. I think that the people accompanying Renzaho were gendarmes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. On that 22nd of April 1994, was that the first time you had seen gendarmes within the CELA compound, or were there some gendarmes already ensuring the security of CELA before Mr. Renzaho arrived there? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
There were no gendarmes ensuring security in that centre. It was the first time I was seeing gendarmes at that centre. And even though it was the first time I dared looking at the road, I said to myself that if they had been gendarmes before that date I would have learned of it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam. Would you also remember how Renzaho was dressed when you saw him arrive? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
I don't remember how he was dressed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
To make it simple, Witness, since you said that when he came to the Sainte Famille he was in a military attire; when he came to CELA was he in military or in civilian clothing? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
I told you I no longer remember the type of clothing he had on. If I was able to state the type of clothing he had when he came to the Sainte Famille, it is because I was able to remember. But I cannot remember how he was dressed when he came to the CELA centre. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, ma'am. Now, when you said that in front of Mr. Renzaho and Bourgmestre Jean Bizimana was Mr. Renzaho's vehicle, can you tell the Court whether that vehicle was parked within or without the CELA compound? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
I think you misconstrued me. I did not say there was a vehicle parked in front of Mr. Renzaho. I said when we went outside, we saw one ordinary vehicle and another armoured vehicle. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Apart from those two vehicles, you didn't see any other vehicles on this day? Can you be more specific? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
On that day there were many vehicles inside the centre, because the missionaries, when leaving, did not go with their vehicles, so they had left many vehicles parked inside the compound, inside the centre. The other vehicle I talked about to you was parked outside, and one could know that the vehicle had been used. It is possible that there were other vehicles that had recently been used, but when I made that observation I noticed that it was that particular vehicle which had been used recently. Let me state, however, that inside the compound were other vehicles which had been parked and which had not been used. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I thank you. Witness, you said that Mr. Renzaho arrived in the company of Bourgmestre Jean Bizimana. Do you remember what the bourgmestre was doing when Mr. Renzaho was discussing with the Interahamwe when they arrived there? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
When they got there, they did not really part ways. They were in the same group. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, ma'am. You also said that after discussing with that group of attackers, Mr. Renzaho spoke to Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza. Are you certain that he did not also speak to you, the other refugees in general? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
I told you that he ordered us to return to our homes, that our security would be ensured in our very homes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I don't think my question was clear enough. Before he ordered you to return to your homes, and at the time when he was talking to Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza, did he not speak to other refugees before he gave you the orders subsequently? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
I don't know how to explain this to you. I had already described to you the place where we were. As I said, our group was separated from the other refugees. There was some distance between us. You see, our group was on the higher ground in the garage. And in that group, Renzaho spoke only to Vincent. And what he said was what I'd already told you, that is, that he ordered us to return to our homes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Talking about groups, now. How were the groups organised? Did you just gather randomly, or did you line up when the Interahamwe asked you to separate yourselves? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
Which group are you referring to, Counsel? Can you be more specific? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Let's take your group, for instance, Witness. Did you line up, or were you sort of grouped in a random manner? That is the only way I can explain it. 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
At the place where we were, we were not lined up or queued up. I thought I explained this to you yesterday. I told you I don't even remember how we went right up to the garage. I mean, I and the other people who were with me, about ten of them. But when we went up to the garage, there were other young men who were being picked up from the various parts of the centre and placed in front of a veranda in one of the CELA buildings. But at the place where we were in the garage, we were not lined up. Let me state further that the place we were was slightly higher than the other parts of that centre, and that made it possible for us to look down at the other people in the centre. And that is how we were able to notice when the Interahamwe brought one Albert. The various people who were brought in there were placed below the place where we were, and lined up in front of a long veranda of the building below the garage. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, you have on a few occasions now mentioned that you testified about these matters yesterday. With other words, you seem to be under the impression that there is some repetition involved here. Now, the system in the courtroom is that first the Prosecution will ask questions, and then the Defence will ask questions about roughly the same matters as the Prosecution went through. And the purpose is to obtain clarity and further precision, and this will inevitably imply some repetition. So that's the system, and the purpose is to establish the truth. So you do not have to remind us that you told us this yesterday. We all remember very well your evidence. It's a matter of further precision. 
Here follows the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, concerning Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza, you said that after Mr. Renzaho called him an Inyenzi, Fidèle took him away. Can we come back to this for you to tell us where Fidèle took him to? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
When Fidèle took Vincent from our group, he went down with him to the veranda where the other people were. But subsequently when the people to be killed were brought -- and I should state that this is information I got from the people who were at the Sainte Famille church -- Vincent was not taken away with those people, the group who were to be killed. Vincent was taken out of that group of people to be killed. He was taken out of that group, actually, by Renzaho. And when I arrived at the Sainte Famille church, I met one of his children who had survived, but who had been hit by a bullet on his leg. He told me that he hoped -- he had hopes that his father was still alive because he had been told that someone had protected him and had assisted him in fleeing, as it were.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
The further information you got concerning Vincent was something you subsequently got to know? I mean, you did not witness Renzaho taking him away, am I correct? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
That is correct, Counsel, because Fidèle went down with him to the garage and placed him together with the others who were below in front of the veranda. That is what I was able to observe. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. I have one last question for you regarding CELA. Are you certain that when Mr. Renzaho spoke to you, he requested you to go to your respective homes, rather than to the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
I am sure of what I'm telling you. That is the truth. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Let us now move to the Sainte Famille parish where you found yourself several weeks. You said you saw Mr. Renzaho at the Sainte Famille on two occasions, correct? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
Correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Are you sure you did not see him a third or a fourth time? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
I saw Renzaho twice on the same day. But before, I had seen him pass by the church when he was going to the Saint Paul centre, and was accompanied by other people. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you say you saw him twice on the same day, Witness, can you be more specific and give us a time of day when you saw him that same day? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
The first time was around 10 o'clock, between 9 and 10 o'clock, and it was on the 16th. Actually, it was on the 16th that I saw him twice. Then I saw him again perhaps around 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, with the leave of the Chamber, I'm going to read certain portions of your statement of 9th of January 2000, when it was signed, and relating to the dates when you claim you saw Mr. Renzaho.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the witness's statement signed on the 9th of December 2000, with a K reference K0153332 for the French. I'm actually on page three, with the K reference, K0153334, on the subsequent page. All that concerns the French version. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are referring to the 9th of December because that is the signature of the witness, whereas the date of the interview is the 31st of August 2000. Is that so? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That's right, Mr. President. 31st of August. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, Witness, let me read certain passages to you. "I saw Odette Nyirabagenzi, the conseiller, Tharcisse Renzaho, and militiamen come to the Sainte Famille church. They conferred briefly with Father Munyeshyaka and moved together to Saint Paul's where there were other refugees. The day after their visit to Saint Paul's, some refugees were killed". 
And I will move to the fourth paragraph so as not to be on this very long. This is what you continue: "The day following the evacuation, that is, the RPF evacuation, Renzaho came along with several militiamen, to the Sainte Famille church where he visited all the refugees, and they left". 
Now, Witness, let me skip a few passages. I'll move to the seventh line where you say, "The militiamen told us to thank them". And you're referring to the day when Renzaho came the second time. "The militiamen told us to thank them, and then they departed, sparing our lives. The day after the massacres the UNAMIR soldiers arrived, but Father Munyeshyaka adamantly refused to let them enter the church. Around 6 p.m. on the same day, Renzaho arrived in the company of Father Munyeshyaka". 
Witness, let me stop the reading at this level and ask you whether, from your statement, it doesn't come out that you saw Renzaho at Sainte Famille three times and over three different days. Is that not what one can understand when reading your statement? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
Thank you, Counsel. In my statement it is said that Renzaho came to the Sainte Famille church, as you just read, and he was accompanied by Odette and other people, including Munyakaze, and they went toward the Saint Paul pastoral centre. And a few days later, there was an RPF raid, and RPF troops evacuated certain refugees. And the day following that operation, Renzaho came to the Sainte Famille church. He arrived there in the company of the priest. Actually, they did not get there together, but when we saw them they were together, and they left some moments later on. I don't know whether the passage you read, the Interahamwe asked us to thank them because they had stopped the killings, I don't know whether it was not mentioned that it was the order they had just received. And the following day, UNAMIR continued its operation to evacuate people who wanted to go to RPF-controlled territory, and others who wanted to go to government-controlled territory. When UNAMIR troops arrived there, the priest refused to let them in because there were many bodies in that compound. Thereafter, the bodies were lined up in the place and covered with sheets. And as you actually said, Counsel, I did not remember that detail. And I believe you can understand that, because those things happened a long time ago. In fact, I don't think we would want to reminisce about all those gory incidents. 
The following day, as the priest had forbidden UNAMIR troops from entering the site, there were some military commanders who came there. Renzaho did not come alone, he came with other soldiers who passed for officers, because I did not know them. And Renzaho was in a gendarmerie uniform. When they left, the bodies were removed. There were some young men responsible for that duty, and as a reward they were given milk. Those young men removed the bodies and placed them at the procure. I don't know where the bodies were subsequently placed, but I know that on that occasion they were moved to the procure. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So around the 16th of June, how many times did you then see Mr. Renzaho, in total? Just answer now with a number, please. 
@WITNESS ATQ:
I saw him four times. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you saw him four times over how many days? Again, just a figure, please. 
@WITNESS ATQ:
Three different dates, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the first occasion was at 10 o'clock, as you described, true? On the 16th. 
@WITNESS ATQ:
No, not true. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then explain when the first occasion was. You see, this is the purpose; to make sure that we really understand your evidence. What was the time when you first saw him on the 16th? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
The first time I saw Renzaho while I was at the Sainte Famille church, Renzaho was passing by that place. He was accompanied by other people. They were on their way to the Saint Paul centre. On the 16th, I saw Renzaho again twice. And on another date, which may have been the 17th or the 18th, I saw Renzaho in the evening. Those were the different times when I saw Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, what was the date when you saw him passing by on his way to Saint Paul, approximately? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
I no longer remember the date. You see, we remember those dates depending on the events we were experiencing. You can have -- if you can have a witness who was at the Saint Paul centre, he may be more specific to you regarding the date in reference to the events following Mr. Renzaho's visit. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we understand that fully, and that's why I used the word "approximately". 
Now, would you say that you first saw him on his way to Saint Paul a day before the 16th, a couple of days before the 16th, or more? Just give us an indication so that we understand your testimony, and then we will move on. 
@WITNESS ATQ:
It is very difficult for me even to give you an approximate date. But in any case, it was not only two days before the 16th. All I remember is that he was on his way to the Saint Paul centre. But the RPF raid on the Saint Paul centre perhaps took place one week after the killings which had taken place at that centre. So you may use that as a benchmark to give a timeframe when Mr. Renzaho visited that place. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This sighting of Mr. Renzaho, shall we say that it happened in June? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
Yes, that's what I think, though I'm not certain. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then we move onto the 16th, and that's where you had two observations, one at 10 o'clock and one at 12 o'clock. Is this correctly understood? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
I've always said "around 10 o'clock" and "around 12 o'clock" so those are just approximate times. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. We understand that. And then the last occasion, when would you place that in time, the fourth time? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
It was perhaps on the 18th in the evening around 6 p.m. or 4 p.m. -- or, rather, between 5 and 6 p.m. I remember that because UNAMIR troops came and evacuated people, but they could not gain access. We could see trucks outside. The following day, Renzaho came there and bodies were removed. Now, if I remember that, the operation took place on the 16th, that means that Renzaho visited that place around the 18th. But once again, that's an approximate date. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine. Thank you, Madam Witness. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, just two last questions for you. Are you certain that on the 17th of June 1994 Major -- or Colonel Laurent Munyakaze did not evacuate refugees from the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille after the RPF raid? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
And where would he have evacuated them to, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
To the Mille Collines hotel and the Kigali archdiocese. 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
Counsel, I don't know whether I should explain this to you, because that is information I came to know about subsequently. But it was an operation which concerned the elderly persons who were still at the Saint Paul, and other people who were scared and who did not understand that it was an Inkotanyi-led raid. And subsequently, Father Celestin and the other people were evacuated and moved to the Saint Michel church. That is the only operation I know of which was conducted after the RPF raid. About the people Munyakaze may have moved to the Mille Collines hotel, when we arrived at the Sainte Famille church those people had already been evacuated, and I know not of anyone who was reportedly evacuated to the Mille Collines hotel from the Sainte Famille church on the 17th of June. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Last question, Witness. When you saw Mr. Renzaho on the 16th, didn't you see beside him an officer of UNAMIR who was allegedly with him on that day in order to organise the transfer of refugees? You do not recall such a visit by Mr. Renzaho and an officer of UNAMIR? 
@WITNESS ATQ: 
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the cross-examination by the Defence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any exhibits to be tendered? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. The statement I made use of, and which bears the signature of the witness, and is dated 9th of December 2000, the date of the interview being the 31st of August 2000. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The French version is the signed version, will be A, the English version B. Mr. Matemanga, the number?

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And under seal. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 24A and D. 24B admitted, under seal)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, you were born in 1976, is that correct? So in 1984 at the time of the genocide you were just 8 years old. 
@WITNESS ATQ:
Did I understand you correctly, Your Honour? Which year are you referring to? 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Were you born in '76?
@WITNESS ATQ:
Yes. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So in '84, how old were you? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
You're mistaken, Madam. I was -- it was 1994. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes. What I wanted to ask is did you own a wristwatch at that time? You had a watch? You did? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
No. I did not have a watch. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we agree that you were approximately 18 in '94, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, we have to place that on record because yesterday there was a slight mistake in the transcripts when it came to your age in '94, and now we have corrected that. 
Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza, had you ever seen him before the 22nd of April? 
@WITNESS ATQ:
I saw him when he came to seek refuge at CELA. I do not know whether you wish me to provide any further details on the matter. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just need to know whether you knew Vincent Mugiraneza before you saw him at CELA. 
@WITNESS ATQ:
I knew him. ***************************. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was the end of your testimony, Madam. We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you very much. 
@WITNESS ATQ:
I also thank you, Mr. President.

testified as follows:
##
$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, in March 1994, where were you living? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I was living in ************* in the Rugenge secteur. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And who were you living with, if anyone? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I was living with my paternal aunt, as well as her family. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you have an occupation at that time? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I was a pupil at the Rugunga secondary school. I was in second year. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, after the 6th of April, did you remain at home with your family? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
After the 6th there was insecurity in our neighbourhood following Habyarimana's death, so we decided to leave that neighbourhood because we had been -- we had come under attack the previous night. And so I left, along with those members of my family. (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to give a more precise date as to when you left home? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I do not know with certainty, but I believe it was between the 8th and the 10th. It was during that period that we left our home. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This last sentence in the previous answer, does that raise a protection issue? It's difficult to understand what is actually meant by it. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I wouldn't pursue that -- investigation of the meaning of it without going into closed session, so perhaps it could be extracted. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's do that. So we will place under seal the sentence starting at 9:43:42, "And it was". That will be placed under separate cover. 
Video booth, please do not transmit that. 
Madam Witness, please ensure that you do not give information which directly or indirectly may reveal your identity. We are not certain that this would, but to be on the safe side. 
Next question, please? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, please, where you went when you left home? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
We went to the CELA centre, which was managed by White Fathers, and we remained there until the 22nd of April. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And, Mr. President, a correction from the interpreter's booth. The witness was a student, and was in her fifth year. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much to the interpreters. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us why you left on the 22nd of April? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
On the 22nd, we were attacked by Interahamwe at that location where we had sought refuge. They came with Préfet Renzaho, as well as other officials of the Rugenge secteur, such as the conseiller de secteur and the school inspector. They came with Interahamwe, as well as some of our neighbours. They abducted a number of people from CELA and they took them away to kill them. And on that day, the préfet ordered us to leave the centre and go back home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, I'd like you, please, to tell us about the events on the 22nd of April in a little more detail. Can we begin with the first moment that you became aware that the centre was under attack? Can you tell us what you were doing at that time? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I was in one of the rooms where we had sought refuge, and we heard people shout and say that the Interahamwe had just launched an attack. In fact, we were expecting it, because a few days before there was what was called community work carried out around the centre, and there were even people who had infiltrated the centre claiming that they were refugees, but we thought that they had come to assess of number of refugees who were at the centre. So we saw the attack coming. But prior to that, there was also a priest of the Sainte Famille church who would come to the centre quite often in order to see who was there. So this did not come as a surprise. We heard shouts, we heard whistling. There was a lot of noise, and we understood that we were under attack. Some of the attackers came in beating people. They took us out of the rooms and brought us before the préfet. And they told us that a meeting was going to be held, and so we went to listen to what the préfet had to tell us. And some people were saying that since the préfet had just arrived, we would be saved, whereas others thought it was a bad omen. And one of the people who had gone to school with him told us that we would not have any problem. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, we have to proceed more slowly. You have answered the question posed by the Prosecution. Now follows the next question. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you describe briefly whereabouts in CELA it was that you were brought before the préfet? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
It was next to the garage, not far from the entrance of CELA; the entrance which is on the asphalt road, the tarmac road. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you give us the name of the préfet? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Tharcisse Renzaho. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was that the first time that you had seen Tharcisse Renzaho, or had you seen him before the 22nd of April 1994? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I had seen him before on television, but I had never seen him face to face. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So when you first saw him on the 22nd of April, did you recognise him yourself? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I did not recognise him immediately because I was not close to where he was. But when I went near him, I recognised him. And even those who were with me, as well as the Interahamwe, would tell us that it was him. And the Interahamwe told us to go and listen to what the préfet had to tell us, and to go and attend the meeting held by the préfet. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you first saw him on 22nd of April, who was he with, if anyone? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
He was with many Interahamwe. There were a lot of people around him. I saw Interahamwe who were wearing strange clothing, and I also saw gendarmes in the group, as well as the conseiller of Rugenge, Odette Nyirabagenzi, as well as Angeline and other people such as Gisagara; Fidèle, Castar; Kivide. There were many people from our neighbourhood. There were very many of them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We need two names. Gisagara; can you help us with the spelling there, Madam? 
@WITNESS HAD:
G-I-S-A-G-A-R-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then there was another name after Fidèle. Can the booth help us with the spelling there? 
@WITNESS HAD:
One Nkeshimana, whose nickname was Kivide. Kivide is spelled K-I-V-I-D-E. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Nkeshimana is 183. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
And just for clarity, Madam Witness, what time was it when you saw Mr. Renzaho for the first time on the 22nd? What time of the day? 
@WITNESS HAD:
I do not know exactly what time it was, but it was before noon. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, when you saw the préfet, can you tell us what, if anything, he did? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I was not as close as the others. But when I got there, he was saying that people had to be sorted out. That women and children had to be put on one side, and young men on the other side. And he was saying that the women and the children should go home, and that their safety would be ensured in their homes. We told him that we could not go back to our homes because our homes had been destroyed, and he did not say anything to that. I should also add that none of those who went back home survived. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Firstly, Madam Witness, to whom was he saying that the people had to be sorted out? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
He was telling the Interahamwe that they had to sort people out and put men and -- to put women and children in a different group from that of the men. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said, "We told him that we could not go back to our homes". Who do you mean by "we"? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I'm referring to the refugees who were there, especially the women and the children. Because we realised that the men were going to be killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did the préfet say anything else beside what you have told the Court? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
As far as I know he did not say anything else. They selected the refugees and took away a group of people, and I left. I wanted to go back home since that was what we had been told to do, but at that point the gendarme told us to go to Sainte Famille because we might be killed if we went back to our homes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When people were being selected as you described, was the préfet still there, do you know? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The préfet was there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And while that was happening, what, if anything, was he doing? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
He was standing there and he was talking to the people who had accompanied him. I was under the impression that he had other obligations, and that he would go elsewhere after having left the CELA centre. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What type of people were selected? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Young Tutsi men. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall how many were selected? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
There were many of them. I cannot give you the exact number. I did not even want to see what was happening. I did not want to meet any of the attackers' eyes so that they would not put me in the group of those who would be killed. What I do know that is there were more than 40 -- 30 young men. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know how the selection took place? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I don't quite understand your question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, we have two versions now. Can you repeat your answer? You said that -- it's difficult to assess the number. But "What I do know is that there were more than" -- and then you gave an estimate. Can you just repeat that estimate? 
@WITNESS HAD:
Forty. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
My question about the selection, Madam Witness, was whether you know on what basis those approximately 40 Tutsi young men were picked from amongst the refugees? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
They had a list, and one of Interahamwe was reading out the names on the list. But I should also say that the attackers were our neighbours. They were friends of our families. They even knew some -- they even knew some of the people very well. So they would read out the names on the list, but they would also choose the people they knew from -- in the neighbourhood. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you know any of those who were taken away? Selected to be taken away? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I told you that they left with Rwanga, his family, as well as his two sons, Wilson and Déglote. They also left with a neighbour, Charles Gahima, and his eldest son, whose name I no longer remember. They went away with plenty of people, namely, one Rwigamba, Christophe Safari, and other young people of that neighbourhood. We really did not want to watch that scene unfold because we did not know we would survive to one day tell the story of what happened. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. We just need to deal with some spellings before we move on. The Rwanga names appear at 242, 243 and 245 of the list. Charles Gahima was spelled yesterday as G-A-H-I-M-A. Christophe Safari, I think, speaks for itself. But, Madam Witness, can you help with the other name you gave? I think it was "Rusegamba" (phonetic), is that correct? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I said Rwigamba, spelled R-W-I-G-A-M-B-A. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Do you know why Charles Rwanga and his family were targeted? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Charles Rwanga had been a long time resident of Kiyovu neighbourhood. And as I explained to you, people were slaughtered by people who knew them very well. So Rwanga had gone to hide at the CELA centre. But when his wife realised that the children had been abducted, she went to plead with Préfet Renzaho because she knew him, and she said the children were young and they were not involved in politics. And she said if they wanted to abduct people, then they should take away the adults. The préfet answered her that if they had been able to get Rwanga, then they would have spared the children. That is how the lady went to get Charles Rwanga. But, unfortunately, he was taken away, along with the children. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you hear that conversation between Charles Rwanga's name and Renzaho yourself, or did somebody tell you about it? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I personally heard that conversation. Because as I told you, *************************************************. So when that conversation took place, I was there. Because those who were close to that lady at that time were just me and her young daughter. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when did that conversation take place? 
@WITNESS HAD:
It took place while the attackers were selecting the refugees, asking ladies and children to return home. That is how that lady started pleading for her children to be spared. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were you still at CELA when those 40-odd people were taken away? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
After the selection had been done and we had been ordered to return home, and when the gendarme warned us against it and told us not to go to our homes, I pretended to return home but I really did not go home. Rather, I went down to a small room which was the infirmary. That is where he was holed up. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So does it follow from what you just said that you didn't -- you weren't present when the people were taken away? Or have I misunderstood what you've said? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
When those 40 people went out of the compound, I did not see them because I went and holed up in that small room I told you about. But I saw other people who had been asked to kneel down in the garden. Those are the people I could see because they were just in front of me. Subsequently, they were led away. However, the 40 other people were located at the place I could no longer see. But when they were subsequently led away, I heard gunshots, and later on the Interahamwe came and looted CELA. They had a list from which they read out the names of the people they had not yet laid hands on and whom they were still looking out for. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see that list yourself, or did you just hear about it? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The people who had the list were just close to me, because I was hiding in that room. And since there was a screen between us, I could see them. They were talking, saying that Rwanga and his children were dead, so their names should be crossed out. And they continued saying, for instance, "This person has escaped, he jumped out of the car, we need to wait for him here". And they said "This other one has left". They also said that Vincent had left with Renzaho. So I was able to follow that conversation, and I could see them crossing out the names of people who had been killed and they were saying they would identify the people who had not yet been found and who needed to be tracked down. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And was this on the same day, the 22nd of April, or another day? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
It was on the same day, April 22, because everyone had left the centre and I was almost alone there. But I should further state that I also left that centre in the evening and went to the Sainte Famille church. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall approximately what time of day it was that you heard the Interahamwe talking about the list and the people that had been killed and so on? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
During such trying moments, it's difficult to know exact times. But I would say it was about two hours since the rumpus had stopped, so it was at that time that I heard the Interahamwe returning to the centre. By that time even the gunshots had ceased. There was no noise. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You told us earlier that a gendarme had warned you not to go home, and that was why you didn't. Can you explain to the Court the circumstances in which he said that? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
You know, those committing the killings were the ones who could spare your life. Some of those people actually did not have the intent to kill. It was very easy for them to reach us at the places where we were grouped up. I think he had been ordered to warn us so that we would, rather, fall into a trap laid by the attackers.

$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What trap do you mean, what kind of trap are you talking about? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
It was for the refugees to gather at one place; that would have eased the massacre. Instead of having to go and look for each and every refugee here and there in the various places where there were hiding. So it was much easier to gather them all at the same place. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, you -- you said earlier that had -- that all the people that went home were killed. Are you now saying that, in fact, it would have been better for you to have gone home? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
That would not have served any purpose because we did not have any other place to go and seek refuge, actually --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the French interpreter did not get the first part of counsel's last question. If that could be repeated, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you simply repeat your question? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm trying to remember what it was, Your Honour -- on the basis -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But, we have it (French spoken) 
MS. MELLUISH:
Oh, I see, yes, I -- I don't have it in French in front of me. 
My question was that you said earlier, that all the people who went home were killed. Are you now saying, in fact, it would have been better for you to have gone home? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You mentioned, Madam Witness, somebody called "Vincent" whom you heard -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you moving slightly to Vincent now? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you move on -- Madam Witness, you saw Renzaho arrive before noon on the 22nd of April; that's what you explained, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS HAD:
That's right, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Approximately when were the 40 persons led away?
@WITNESS HAD:
I no longer remember if that operation lasted for a period of hours. But, you see, when you're undergoing such trying moments, it's as if it's taking forever. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It was in the afternoon or the evening? 
@WITNESS HAD:
I think it was still before noon -- or around noon, because the attackers did not stay long at the centre. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, now, you also mentioned a group that was kneeling -- persons were kneeling, do you remember that? 
@WITNESS HAD:
Yes, I do. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a different group, isn't it? 
@WITNESS HAD:
That second group was a group of people who had been asked to kneel down in the garden. But subsequently, they were also put into the car. I gave the figure of 40, it's not because I counted them when they were standing there. But subsequently, when we gathered our wits together, each and every one gave the names of those who were with them before, and who had been taken away. That is how we were able to reconstitute what had happened and to arrive at that figure. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But just for communication purposes now, there was one group of 40 young men, and one group, which I have referred to as "kneeling people". Is that correctly understood? 
@WITNESS HAD:
Amongst the people kneeling in the garden, were also young men and young women. So the young men added to that first group to take that figure to 40. But, mind you, that figure is just an approximation because I didn't count them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine, Madam, I'm trying to find out whether there were two departures: One departure of the 
40 young men and one other departure of those who had been kneeling. Can you just explain that? 
@WITNESS HAD:
No, there were not two departures. Before being taken away, the groups of -- the two groups were taken and in that group of people kneeling in the garden, were young men and young women. So, the young men from the kneeling group were taken to add to the group which was located above. And when they had that consolidated group of 40 people, they were all taken away at once. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, madam. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You mentioned someone called "Vincent" and you said that you heard Interahamwe say -- I think it was Interahamwe - say, he'd been taken away by Renzaho. Who was that Vincent, do you know? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, I knew that Vincent. Vincent was a head of a family; he had children who were of my age. I knew him like someone who lived with us in the same neighbourhood. He had been a minister in the transition government and his wife also worked at Electrogaz; that is how I knew Vincent. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know his second name? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I think he was called Mugiraneza -- I am not sure, but I think he was Mugiraneza. But whenever I had to talk -- to talk to him, I called him Papa Vicki; that is why it's difficult for me to remember that surname because I didn't often use it. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, did you ever find out what happened to those 40-odd people who were taken away from CELA? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
What I heard from the Interahamwe was that those people had been gunned down along the road. In fact, the Interahamwe said some of them had been gunned down and others had escaped. Furthermore, I knew that when we exhumed the bodies, which had been buried in the mass graves, we identified the bodies of some of those who were of that group. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall what mass graves those bodies were exhumed from? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The most renown grave was the one below the Rugenge secteur office; that grave was dubbed CND. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know why it was dubbed CND? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
You see, during the talks, RPF people came to Kigali and were quartered at the CND, so it was a way of making people understand that the Inyenzi had to settle at the CND. It was just a way of making people understand that they would go and join people of their like. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
In April 1994, did you know a person called Jean Bosco Higiro -- or Higiro? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I know Bosco, yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us whether he -- like you, was a refugee at CELA or not? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
He lived at the CELA centre. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you remember whether he was there during the attack on the 22nd of April or not? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I think he was present, because there was no other place where we could take shelter, and there was only one place of exit from that centre. 
MS. MELLUISH:
That name, by the way, is number 83. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Also in April 1994, did you know someone called Joseph Bitega? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, I know Bitega because I studied with his sister. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see him at CELA whilst you were there? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, I did. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall whether or not he was present during the attack on the 22nd of April? 
Did you hear the question, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
He was there, I saw him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now we have two versions of that name, but you want the version spelt in number 20, don't you, with other words with a "B"? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
At the beginning of your testimony today, you said that you left CELA on the 22nd of April. Where did you go to when you left CELA? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
From CELA, I went to the Sainte Famille church. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you got to Sainte Famille church, what did you find there? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Many refugees -- some of them had fled the acts of violence from the Interahamwe. Others had fled the fighting at Gisozi. I also found some of the people who had been with me at the CELA centre. I also found Rwanga's family, including his wife and his daughter, Hyacinthe Rwanga. There were also many other people there, who were experiencing very difficult living conditions -- even though there was some people who seemed unconcerned by what was going on. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Hyacinthe Rwanga is number 246. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you left CELA for Sainte Famille on the 22nd, was that so? 
@WITNESS HAD:
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Afternoon, evening, approximately? 
@WITNESS HAD:
It was around 3:00 in the afternoon. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall how long you stayed at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I stayed at the Sainte Famille church from that date -- that is to say, the 22nd of April, and it is around the 19th -- or the 20th, that I went to Kabuga. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
The 19th or 20th of what month? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Of June, 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And with "Kabuga", you mean the location, not the person? 
@WITNESS HAD:
It is a location which was controlled by the RPF, and that is where UNAMIR would evacuate people within the framework of their refugee evacuation operations. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Whereabouts in the Sainte Famille parish did you stay? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I was inside the church -- behind the altar. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you estimate how many other people were staying inside the church? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
There were many people in the church, and there were two separate categories of refugees. There was one group of refugees that was close to the altar and that place had also been nicknamed CND. 
And now the building has been changed and this is next to the main entrance. There was another part that was nicknamed "Camp Hutu" that was safer. So, the group in which I was was the group where there were problems. But what I can tell you is that there were very many refugees in the church. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what do you mean by problems? What problems did your group have? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
It was an area which was exposed to danger. During that period, if you were Tutsi -- and, as you can see, we had been placed in an area which was different from that of the other group and this place was nicknamed CND. And we were always being watched over. We could not even go to the other group in order to hide or try to escape danger. So, we had problems. We didn't have any water, no food -- we had many problems and we were always facing death. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Who had placed you in that area that you considered to be dangerous? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I do not know who did it, but during that period, just anybody could give you orders -- even a small child. We asked the priest to tell us where to hide and that was the place that was shown to us. I do not know who had selected the area for our group. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Which priest did you ask? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Father Munyeshyaka. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that when you were in the area called CND, you were always being watched over. Who was watching over you? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The other refugees would be watching us, as well as gendarmes -- and even amongst the refugees, there were Interahamwe who would watch us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
These other refugees that were watching you, were they -- were they Hutu or Tutsi or neither? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
They were Hutu who were claiming that they had fled because of the insecurity brought about by the Inyenzi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, in the time that you stayed at Sainte Famille, did you ever see the Préfet Renzaho at that place? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I saw him on the 17th of June when people were killed at the Sainte Famille church, amongst which my friend, Hyacinthe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us what time of day you saw the préfet? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
It was before noon when we heard that the préfet was in the compound of the church. Now we feared him and we thought that whenever he came, people would get killed. So we took fright and we went to check whether he was, indeed, present and I saw him with Father Munyeshyaka when both of them were going to the procure. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Before that -- that day, had anything unusual happened or not? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The previous night, the RPF had evacuated refugees who were at the Saint Paul centre. And the next day, there was this attack and the attackers were saying that they were seeking revenge because they claimed that the Tutsi had killed some Hutu. But that had not been the case, because the RPF had evacuated the Tutsi refugees who had problems. So, it was on the next day that they came. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you saw Renzaho with Father Munyeshyaka, was there anyone else with them or were they alone? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
When they got down -- there were two of them -- but there were already a number of attackers in the compound of the church. The Interahamwe would be climbing the walls of the compound. Every single time there was an attack, there would be a terrible noise. There would be a lot of noise, whistling and they were shooting all over the place. There were also the officials -- such as, the conseiller and the inspector, as well as many other people who were awaiting a final decision. I thought they were coming from a meeting where they had decided what they would do. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Just to clarify, you mentioned a conseiller, which conseiller is that? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The conseiller of Rugenge, Mrs. Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And the inspector, who was that? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
It is Angeline Mukandituye. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you first saw those two people, were they together with or apart from Renzaho? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
There were not only two people, there were many people. I gave you the names of those I was able to recognise, but when I saw these two ladies, they were not with Renzaho. At that time, Renzaho was with Father Munyeshyaka and was going towards the procure. And when these people came, they had a list and it is that list that the Interahamwe used -- and let me tell you, *********************************************. 
Father Munyeshyaka, I cannot say that it was because he was good to us that he did that. But during that period, people would take advantage of other people because it was Father Munyeshyaka who wanted to sexually exploit Hyacinthe, but Hyacinthe refused. So, in order to avenge himself, Father Munyeshyaka asked her to set up a list because the UNAMIR would evacuate people on the basis of lists provided. So he asked her to write a list on which she would -- should put the names of her closest friends, so that when UNAMIR would come on the following day, in order to evacuate people towards Kabuga, that list would be used. So, he stated that he was going to give that list to UNAMIR. 
So we thought we would have been spared because Father Munyeshyaka had forcefully kissed Hyacinthe, and Hyacinthe had come back crying. And I told her that maybe the priest felt guilty and wanted to help her. So *********************** and I told her that probably, on the next day, we would finally be saved. ********************************************************************************************** ********************************************************************************************************************* 
And the following day, in the morning, it is that list that they used to put people to death -- that list we 
********************************. But when they went out, I saw Father Munyeshyaka with that list in his hand and I recognised the sheet of paper, **************************************************************, and it is with that list that the Interahamwe killed people. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the friend, the spelling is Hyacinthe, H-Y-A-C-I-N-T-H-E, is that correct? 
@WITNESS HAD:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you, Your Honour, for that clarification, but the name is that that appears at 246 and we've been spelling it differently throughout proceedings to date. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm raising this because we have two versions in the transcripts. So shall we then adopt the 246 model then and start with the Y, not with the H? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I think that would be easiest. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you say that you saw the list ********************* in the hands of Father Munyeshyaka on the 
17th of June, what makes you say that the Interahamwe used that list? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I am saying so because the order in which the names came on the list was the very same order in which the names were read out -- and those were the people who were killed. 
My name was also on the list. Perhaps he could also -- have also drawn a list, but ******************** ****************************************** and that is in -- it -- and it is that order that the names were read out. And, besides, ***************************************************************** and I could not be mistaken. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You say people were killed. Can you describe how the killing took place? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Préfet Renzaho and Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka came out of the church compound. Quite often -- immediately before killings took place, we would no longer see the ringleader -- if I may use that word. But, after the killings, the father would also come back and say: "Oh, it was unfortunate I was not present, and I did not hear of what had happened." But we could see that he was well aware of what had happened. Maybe he felt guilty. But there was nothing we could say; there was nothing we could do against him. 
Now, regarding the 22nd, at CELA, the Interahamwe came and killed people. But on that day, there were killings perpetrated even in the compound of the church -- in the garden facing the priests' house. They came into the church and started shooting. They even shot at the statue of the Virgin Mary saying that she was a Tutsi. And next to the altar, there were people who were injured and who were being treated at the Sainte Famille church. The Interahamwe came and finished them off. They read the names on the list and they killed people in the garden facing the priests' house; it was a horrific scene. The Interahamwe were pronouncing -- were uttering terrible words. 
After the killings, the attackers said that the Hutu had just been killed by the Inyenzi and there was nothing we could say. Hyacinthe was killed. When the Interahamwe came -- and since her name was the first one on the list, they were saying that they were looking for Hyacinthe. She went to hide in a room; they tracked her down, went into that room and shot her in the head three times close to her ear. Once they reached the name of Hyacinthe's mother on the list, they told her that they could spare her because her children had already died. 
They killed many people on that day. Young people; it was a grizzly scene. We knew the Interahamwe. We knew that they were acting as animals. But on that day, it was truly horrible. I cannot even describe the scene to you. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know where Renzaho was while this killing was taking place? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
He would go out -- he would go out and ask his dogs to attack us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you personally see him again after that first time? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I did not see him again, but in the evening, the father provided explanations; that is all I can say. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to estimate for how long this attack took place? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
On the 22nd, the attack lasted a long time. I can say that it lasted throughout the day. After the Interahamwe, a policeman arrived -- when the bodies of our friends and our family members were still there. The policeman arrived and said that it was not possible to kill all the Tutsi. And he said: "You, the Hutu, go out, we are going to destroy the church." It is as if the -- these people were starting to move. It took a while and subsequently, they were told that UNAMIR was coming, and they thought that UNAMIR was coming to save us. That is when they shot in the air and retreated. It was in the evening, and usually they would kill during the day, and at night they would rest. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you have referred to the 22nd on a couple of occasions. This attack which you are now describing, which date was that? 
@WITNESS HAD:
The attack took place on the 17th of April. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
@WITNESS HAD:
These events I'm recounting are quite sad and I -- I wish to apologise to you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now you said April, is that what you mean? 
@WITNESS HAD:
It was on the 16th or 17th of June, it was in the month of June. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have some questions left, haven't you? 
MS. MELLUISH:
A few, Your Honour, but we could break. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I would think this would be a good moment for a break. We will have the 11 o'clock break a bit earlier today and start in about 20 minutes. 
The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1053H to 1124H) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we proceed, just a small administrative matter. Before the break, we had a spelling of Hyacinthe and the witness confirmed the spelling. Then, reference was made to a Prosecution spelling list. I think it does happen that even Prosecution spelling lists may have mistakes and we should probably not be bound by them throughout the trial. So I've asked someone now kindly to go through that list. We will still continue to write Hyacinthe with a H, which is normal practice in French. And I also think that Kajagari, which was another issue a couple of days ago, will have to go back to Akajagali, which has been the spelling throughout the life span of this Tribunal, with all due respect to the Prosecution spelling list. 
Now, let us continue. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, are you able to estimate to this Tribunal how many people were killed at Sainte Famille on the 17th of June 1994? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I am not able to give you any precise number because all the people were not killed at the same place. Some were killed in the courtyard. Others were killed in the stairs that go from the procure to the presbytery. Others were killed in the garden. In other words, many people were killed on that day. And some even died inside the church -- that is to say, those who were injured and who were being treated there. Let me tell you that we were all afraid, and the operation only ended in the evening. On the following day, the dead bodies were piled up somewhere, and I'm truly not in any position to give you any specific number. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This part of the church referred to as the procure, P-R-O-C-U-R-E, where exactly was that, madam? 
@WITNESS HAD:
The procure was between the buildings where we had the économat général, and the garden -- or, the place where Hyacinthe was killed. Between the two, there was a petrol pump and that is where the entrance of the procure was, where there are buildings where visitors were housed. And that was the entrance that would be used for the refugees who would come to that site, because the other exits -- or entrances had been closed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, Madam Witness, you told us about your friend Hyacinthe, and you said that she had come to you and told you that she had been forcefully -- I think you said forcefully kissed by Father Munyeshyaka. Do you recall any such incidences of -- of that nature taking place at Sainte Famille, while you were there? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, Father Munyeshyaka had another young lady amongst the refugees who had almost become his sexual slave during that period. During that period, he would abuse young girls. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did anyone else abuse young girls at Sainte Famille besides Father Munyeshyaka or was he the only person doing that? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
As I stated previously, there were other Interahamwe on the site -- and even Interahamwe, who had come from elsewhere, could go into the centre without any problem. When they needed one person, they would come and abduct that person. There were no safety measures to protect those who were being sought after. Young girls were raped; others were executed. And if there are women or young ladies who were not raped, it was because they were fortunate because it was customary for rapes to take place. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how did you know about this happening? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
There are young women or ladies who would be taken away and who would subsequently come back. And there was even one lady who was mentally disturbed and who was raped by the Interahamwe at Hotel Africa, but she came back afterwards -- even if it -- it was said that she was dead at the time. You do know that anybody who is mentally ill cannot hide anything, and she told us everything that had happened. 
I know of another young woman who was abducted by the Interahamwe -- I mentioned his (sic) name was Cimba, and the Interahamwe made her believe that this was a way of sparing her life. Unfortunately, she subsequently died. So these events were well known and it was no secret. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. 
I think the name given was Cimba, C-I-M-B-A. 
Thank you, Madam Witness, I have no more questions for you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before cross-examination, Madam Witness, just a clarification, the list which you referred to on the 22nd of April, you said that you saw that list? 
@WITNESS HAD:
Concerning the list of the 22nd, I told you that I saw it when certain Interahamwe came back to the centre. So, they were reading out names of some people which were on the list and who had already died. So it was some sort of a stocktaking to identify those who were already dead and those who had not yet been killed. And when the Interahamwe were reading names on that list, they were close to me, because I was lying on the ground and there was a screen separating us, so I could see them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see that list in open air or inside the building? Where were you? 
@WITNESS HAD:
I was in a small room near the shed where I had spent the night. The CELA buildings had big windows with screens, and I could see those Interahamwe because of that screen between us. But the Interahamwe did not see me and they did not know that I was there -- especially because that room itself had been locked and they were speaking to one another and reading out names from that list. 
When I left CELA, I actually knew the people who had already died, and those whom had not yet been caught by the Interahamwe. The day following my departure, the Interahamwe came back to the 
Sainte Famille site in an effort to locate the people who had not yet been killed. But on that day, they didn't see anyone. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just listen to the question and answer them briefly, please. Now, what kind of screen are you referring to? 
@WITNESS HAD:
I'm trying to explain to you that even though I was in that room, I could see through the glass pane and see what was going on outside the room where I was. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I leave the rest for cross-examination, Defence, thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Most obliged, Mr. President.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning, Witness. 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Good morning. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, in describing the events at CELA, you said in chief that a few days before the 22nd of April 1994, there had been community work in that place. Do you remember having said that to the Prosecutor? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, I do. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Please tell the Court about how many days that work was carried out before the attack on the 22nd of April? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
When we went to CELA, we did not have any calendars, we did not have any watches, we did not have any radio stations in order to be able to know the exact date. But I can tell you that the community development work -- umuganda was carried out while we were there. Even though they referred to it as umuganda, it was just a way of clearing the surroundings so that we could be quite visible and easily accessible. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, actually, Witness, I just want to know whether you are able to know the number of days which elapsed, because you said the work was carried out in preparation for the attack. Was it two, three or four days before -- as far as you can remember, that is? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Even if you'd asked me to give you a number of approximate days, I will need to take a reference point. I simply told you that between the date when the work was carried out and the date of the attack, a few days elapsed, but I cannot tell you how many days. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. What about the day of the attack itself -- that is, the 22nd of April 1994, was there any community work? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
That day, I would say that the people who arrived there, wanted to prevent us from going out through any road, but on that day, they entered the CELA compound. However, there had been community development work, as I referred to it, between CELA and the JOC. But when they entered CELA, they even cut down the banana plants and any shrubbery around that centre; they cleared up everything. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Talking about that attack of the 22nd of April 1994, if I understood you properly, Witness, it appears as if the Interahamwe came to CELA on that date twice: The first time with 
Mr. Renzaho, when they picked out people who were either or not on the list which they had; and the second time, when you were hiding in that room that you just described to us a while ago. Is that correct? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
No, Counsel, I think you did not quite understand me. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Can you therefore be more explicit, Witness? Was it during the same attack that the Interahamwe used the list twice, or did the Interahamwe first go, then they came back -- from your description? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Concerning the attack of the 22nd of April, I told you that Préfet Renzaho ordered that the refugees be separated in various groups; that sorting was carried out. And, when I went down, I saw another group of people who had been asked to kneel down in the garden. Then, I went and hid in that room. 
I learnt of that list only when the Interahamwe came back later on to loot that centre, and when they were talking amongst themselves -- and, sort of comparing notes. Otherwise I don't believe I said that I saw Renzaho with any list. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. When the Interahamwe came with that list which you saw, Mr. Renzaho was no longer there; correct? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
That is right, Mr. Renzaho was no longer there any longer. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, the second trip of the -- of the Interahamwe after Mr. Renzaho's departure, did you mention it when you had your interview with the investigators of the Prosecutor? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Are you referring to the episode when the Interahamwe read names out of the list? I don't remember whether I mentioned it in my statement -- but today, I'm telling you that that is how the things happened. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. However, Witness, I would like us to take a look at the statement you gave regarding those events of the 22nd of April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
And, Your Honours, it is the witness statement recorded on the 22nd of August 2000 and signed -- December 2000. The French version is 153328 -- and I'm on page 3, which is the single page of the statement given by the witness. The date when it was signed was the 9th of December 2000. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, allow me to jog your recollection on a significant event which you described during that interview, and I'll then put questions to you. 
Concerning the 22nd of April, on line 9 of that page 3, at the end of that line, this is what you said: "Militiamen -- the militiamen threw grenades into the men's group, killing about 100 of them." 
Witness, do you remember making such a statement in connection with the events at CELA? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
It is -- it is true that grenades were thrown into the refugees and Gihana, whom we knew very well, died. And if I mentioned about a hundred of victims, it is because a lot of blood was spilled. There were bodies cut into pieces. And at that time, I estimated it was about 100. I don't know whether there was an investigation conducted subsequently to ascertain the exact number of victims, but that is what I said in my statement. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, kindly tell the Court at what exact time during (sic) Mr. Renzaho's presence in that 
area -- in that compound that the grenades were thrown? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Counsel, I told you we were not on a picnic; we had gone to seek refuge -- it was not on a merry trip, so we did not have our wristwatches with us. All what I know is that when the grenade was thrown, the people who had been selected to be killed had not yet left, and I told you that from the high ground where I was, I could see Renzaho. But, I don't know whether he was there at the exact time when that grenade was thrown because I was no longer watching -- I was no longer seeing him, but I could not see him because I had left that high ground where I was before. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, were the grenades thrown at those people who had been selected, if I understand you correctly? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
No, the grenades were thrown into the group of people who were in the garden and who they wanted to move. It was in the part of the centre where a bungalow had been built. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did all the refugees who were with you see the grenade being thrown on that group you're referring to? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The garden is not located at the same place where Renzaho was because Renzaho was near the main entrance to CELA, whereas the garden was a bit further away and below. So, there is some distance between the two places. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
(No interpretation)
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter did not get the first part of counsel's question. 
@WITNESS HAD:
(No interpretation)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Hold on. 
Could you kindly repeat your question, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
My question to the witness was to know whether Jean Bosco Higiro and Joseph Bitega were amongst the group of people on whom the grenades were thrown. 
@WITNESS HAD:
I think that's a question you may want to put to those people, because anyone can talk about the events which he witnessed or which were experienced by people immediately close to him. I think that is what you may want to do. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you see, I'm putting that question to you because when Prosecution counsel asked you questions about those people, you said you saw them on the 22nd of April. Where did you see them on that day? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
When I saw -- I saw those people on the 22nd, it was because we all stayed at CELA centre up until that day. But I cannot tell you exactly where Bitega was or where Higiro was standing. I am unable to confirm to you that they were in that group of people at whom the grenades were lobbed. I am categoric about Gihana because Gihana died of the grenade wounds -- and that was even being talked about before we left CELA. And when I left CELA, I was able to see his body. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, how were you told to go and attend the meeting which the préfet had convened that day at CELA? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The Interahamwe found us in the room where we were; they were armed -- some of them with grenades, others with guns, and others with machetes and spears. Each and every one of them was armed in one way or the other. They were dressed in strange clothings and were shouting. They asked us to go up -- because there was a meeting. I was not the one particularly invited, given that the statement was addressed to the entire group. And I should say that some of those militiamen had on feathers of birds. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know the first name of Mr. Gihana, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS HAD:
No, I don't, I'm afraid. I know he was simply known by the name "Gihana". 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you said that during that meeting, the préfet told you to return to your respective homes, and that a gendarme later on told you to rather go to Sainte Famille. Tell us where that gendarme who spoke to you had come from? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I told you that Préfet Renzaho was accompanied by Interahamwe and gendarmes. So the gendarme who spoke to me was one of those who had come with the préfet. He spoke to the group telling us: "Go back, go back", but he took us aside and murmured to us you should rather go to the 
Sainte Famille, because if you return to your homes, you will be killed there. 
Some of the people, who were with us, returned to their homes, but others shared the information that the gendarme was, rather, advising us to go to the Sainte Famille. That is how we decided instead of going to our homes to, rather, go to Sainte Famille. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you certain that it was that gendarme who gave you that advice on that 
22nd of April 1994? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, I am, because I heard him say that -- I even tried to go after him to seek some explanations from him, but he moved away. So I hereby confirm that it was the gendarme who gave us that information. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I'm going to read lines 12 and 13 of the statement you gave the Prosecutor. And then, I will ask you to comment. 
This is what you said -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And since there are several statements, you are now referring to which date, please, just for the record? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
The same statement of December 9, 2000, Mr. President, the same page. The statement signed on the 9th of December, but recorded on the 22nd of August 2000. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. And now the reading, please. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you.
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm on line 3 -- I mean, line 13, and this is what you said, Witness: "Renzaho called a meeting to order us to proceed to Sainte Famille or Saint Paul church saying that the men will go to the CND." 
Do you remember that statement which you gave the Prosecutor on December 9, 2000, Witness? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I couldn't have said that because that is not how it happened. My statement was not properly recorded because what I'm telling you is what happened; that is the truth. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So are you saying that those addresses are wrongly ascribed to you in that statement? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I think there was a mistake -- even this day, you notice that there was a mistake on the personal information sheet. I don't think I could have been mistaken regarding my address and the various places where I stayed at. There could have been a mistake in the way some of the information was recorded. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, ma'am. When you hid in that small room that you mentioned a while ago, were you all alone or with some other people? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I was with other people. I remember Bernadette and her younger sister who died during an attack, which was launched from the Saint Paul centre. But, I no longer remember the other people -- and I should state further that I followed them into that small room when I saw them get in. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Was it along with those people that you subsequently went to the Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Bernadette was the oldest amongst us. She was the one who later on advised us to go there. She even gave money to the Interahamwe who escorted us. When we arrived at the Saint Paul centre, she was accepted in, but I was denied entrance into the Saint Paul centre. That is how I went to the Sainte Famille site. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you accompanied by some of your relatives, if you recall? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Which event are you referring to? When I left the CELA centre to go to the Sainte Famille church -- or, would you rather wish to know whether there were members of my family who were also with him (sic) at the Sainte Famille church? When I left CELA, there were no members of my family with me, but I found them when I reached the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you did all that from 3 p.m. onwards, as you testified; am I correct? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Well, I did not give you the precise time, it was just an estimation. I was following the movements of the sun in order to be able to determine what time it was. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, could we deem that it was, in any case, in the afternoon? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, it was in the afternoon. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
Witness, let me once again refresh your memory and read out your statement dated 9th of December 2000 on this same matter. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I am on the 16th or 17th line, Mr. President, Your Honours, which starts with: "At about 11 a.m. on the 22nd of April". So, I'm dealing with the same statement which obviously has the same references -- immediately after CND. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And this is what you stated, Witness, and I quote: "At about 11 a.m., on 22nd April 1994, I went to the Sainte Famille church with my paternal aunt, my two cousins and one female cousin." Do you remember having made such a statement, Witness? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I could not have made such a statement because this is not how things happened. The truth is that I was with them at the Sainte Famille church; they (sic) did not leave together. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you sign this statement after you gave it to the investigators of the -- of the Office of the Prosecution? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I do not recall. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. So, this is yet another wrong description of what you stated to the Prosecution; am I correct? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
These family members of mine lived with me. I was living at their home and at the Sainte Famille church. I was with him -- with -- with them. But when I went to Sainte Famille, coming from CELA, I was not with them. There might have been a communication problem because we were speaking different languages. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, so it is because of this communication problem that no reference was made to the second attack of the Interahamwe, with a list at CELA -- a list you were able to see on that occasion. Are we to consider that this was also yet another omission? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Well, everything depended on the investigator. One investigator might put a lot of questions to you and then you can provide a lot of information -- or, put few questions to you, and then you won't be as forthcoming with the information you're providing. I don't see how it would be in my interest not to share the information that is in my possession or to not tell the truth. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you very much, Witness. 
Witness, let us now go to the Sainte Famille church and focus on the events of the 17th of June, 1994. On how many occasions, did -- or, rather, how many times did you see Mr. Renzaho on that day at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I believe I saw him on that morning, but the Interahamwe would come to the church often. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, you only saw him in the morning; is that correct? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you also see General Munyakaze on the 17th of June 1994 in Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I saw Munyakaze on the following day or two days after that, because it was at that point that he came in order to evacuate a number of people. But I do not believe I saw Munyakaze on that day. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. So, you did not see General Munyakaze in the company of Mr. Renzaho at any point in time. Would I be correct in making such a suggestion? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I stated previously that on that day I saw Renzaho in the company of Munyeshyaka while they were going towards the procure. But I did not see Munyakaze. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. Witness, let me once again refer to your statement dated 9th of September 2000 and read out to you the lines that come immediately after the ones I read out a moment ago. And it starts with: "On 17th of June 1994, before noon." 
Witness, here is what you stated, and I quote: "On 17th June 1994, before noon, I saw Tharcisse Renzaho, Odette Nyirabagenzi, Angeline Mukandituye and Lieutenant Colonel Laurent Munyakaze." 
Was that, indeed, what you stated, Witness -- or not? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
That is what I stated. But as for the fact that I allegedly saw him with Munyakaze, I thought I explained to you that all of them were present, but they were not in the same group. I told you that they went down towards the procure with Angeline, as well as the other Interahamwe, but Renzaho did not go there with Munyakaze towards Munyeshyaka's office. It was, rather, Renzaho and Munyeshyaka who went to join the Interahamwe as well as the other officials or soldiers who were further down. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, you did see Munyakaze on the 17th of June and subsequently on the 18th of June; am I correct? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
On the 18th, I saw him when he came to evacuate a number of people from the Sainte Famille church. As regards the 17th, I heard that Munyakaze was amongst the attackers. I was still young. I did not know him; I did not know the officers. I saw Odette and the others and I recognised them because I knew them before. But when he came back, I was able to recognise him because he had been shown to me. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when describing the killings which were perpetrated -- allegedly perpetrated on the 
17th of June 1994 at Sainte Famille, you stated that the Interahamwe were using a list; am I correct? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, Counsel, yes, they had a list. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you tell the Trial Chamber, Witness, whether it was mainly those who were on that list -- a list which you drew yourself -- who were being sought after, or whether all the refugees were being shot at in a disorderly manner? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
On the 17th, the group of refugees were -- was shot at at random. But there was also another incident where one Interahamwe was reading out the names on the list, and the names that were being read out are the people -- whose name was being read out, would go to the garden. 
There were people who were killed -- even though they were not on the list. There were people who were killed inside the church, and they were not on the list either. There is one child, called Maguru, who was killed on that occasion. So there were different strategies used during those killings. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That name, please, the spelling? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, in the statement -- one of the statements, it's spelt M-A-G-U-R-U. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you aware of the way in which the different killing incidents ended on the 17th of June 1994? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The killings on the 17th finally ended because when they would kill people, the attackers would go and rest at some point. And it was almost nighttime, and the attackers would not kill people during the night. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, if I understand you correctly, Witness, it is because they were tired that the attackers stopped killing; is that what I am to understand? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I told you that it was said that UNAMIR had just arrived. I don't know why they feared UNAMIR. But when UNAMIR agents were there, they would not kill anyone. So someone said, "UNAMIR is coming." And they retreated. And what you're saying is true. They were tired because they had killed a number of people. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you mention the arrival of UNAMIR when Madam Prosecutor questioned you regarding the end of the killings? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I do not recall. When questions are put to you, and when you are telling the truth, you assume that you have given all the information that was in your possession. I cannot state with certainty whether this question was put to me and whether I gave such information. But I can tell you that this is what happened. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you tell the Chamber what distance there was between the Sainte Famille parish and the Mille Collines hotel where the UNAMIR was stationed? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I did not measure that distance, but UNAMIR soldiers could arrive where we were at any time. They were those who evacuated us to Kabuga. The Mille Collines hotel was not a place where they were staying without being able to go out. They would often come to where we were. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And this will be my last question, Witness: From what you know, was the Mille Collines hotel far from the Sainte Famille parish? Since I do understand that you might not be in a position to assess the distance. 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The Mille Collines hotel is not far from the Sainte Famille church. But during that time, for us, it was quite far. But in -- under normal circumstances, one can say that it's not very far from the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Madam Witness. I thank you for having answered the questions put to you by the Defence. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the cross-examination of Witness HAD, and I would request from the Trial Chamber that it have admitted into evidence a copy of the statement I used during this cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. So this is, then, the statement signed on the 9th of December 2000, dated the 22nd of August 2000, the French being the signed version, the English the unsigned version. A for the French, B for the English. 
And the next exhibit number, please, for the Defence?

$RE-EXAMINATION 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, you've just described how somebody announced that UNAMIR was coming and the Interahamwe left, on the 17th of June. Now, it was suggested in the questions that UNAMIR did in fact arrive on the 17th of June. Could you clarify for the Chamber whether, as far as you're aware, UNAMIR came on that day, or not? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The UNAMIR soldiers did not come on that day. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, I am coming back to this list on the 22nd of April again. Now, the person holding the list, was he in the same room as you were? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The person holding the list was an Interahamwe, and he was outside. I was hiding in that room that was next to the place where the Interahamwe was standing. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, I know that this person was an Interahamwe, Madam Witness. But you referred to "the screen". Explain once again what you meant by that. We have now clarified that the Interahamwe is outside the room, and you are inside the room. So where does this screen come into place? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
The window I was telling you about was -- I referred to was simply to explain to you that I could see what was happening outside through the window. I cannot see what is happening behind you because there is a wall behind you. But you could see the Interahamwe through the window of the place where I was lying down. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and this is quite clear to everyone in the courtroom, Madam Witness. Does that mean, then, that you simply was looking through a window in order to see the list outside? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
I could not read out what was on the list. They were the ones who were reading out what was on the document, and I could hear what they were saying. And this is how I understood what was on the list. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. And we have also understood this. Now, listen very carefully to the question. The question is not what you think it was. The question is: You were simply looking through a window, then, in order to see the list. To see it. Not to hear anything. 
@WITNESS HAD: 
When I looked through the window, my objective was not to see the list, because I didn't know they had the list. I simply wanted to know what was happening to see whether they were about to launch another attack against the place where we were. So I was not interested in the list, per se. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Also perfectly understandable, Madam Witness. Now, was there glass in the window? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
Yes, there was glass. In fact, it's as if the whole wall was made up of a window pane. It was bay -- they were bay windows. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you simply looked through the glass in order to see the list; there was nothing else separating you from the list. You simply looked through the glass in the window. Is that the evidence? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
They were right next to the place where I was. It's as if they were leaning on the wall that was close to the window. So I could not see their faces. But I could see part of their bodies, and I could see the list. I could not see their faces because I was behind them. I could only see their backs. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is my last attempt, Madam, and then this will be the last question. There was nothing else separating you from the list than the glass in the window. There was no curtain, there was no screen, non-transparent, only glass. Have I understood it correctly? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
There were curtains in a transparent material, which I could see through. So I could see easily. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you saw the list through the curtains? 
@WITNESS HAD: 
No, it was not even necessary for me to draw the curtains. I could see through without drawing the curtains. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine, Madam Witness. 
This was the end of your testimony. Thank you very much for having come the long way to Arusha to testify. We wish you a very safe journey home. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you very much. 
Is Maître Cantier close to the courtroom? This could be a good time to discuss some scheduling issues in connection with the remainder of the Prosecution case. Could he be asked to come, or should we, rather, adjourn and do it at 3 o'clock? I do not know what would be the preference of the parties. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm in Your Honour's hands. I'm -- 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, if this is the Trial Chamber's wish, we can go and get Counsel Cantier, who is certainly somewhere downstairs. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are you ready to address scheduling matters now, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I am.
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. But then if the Defence could kindly ask him to come, that would be highly appreciated. Thank you. 
Meanwhile, we could start with the witnesses for next week, please. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. There are six remaining for next week. Three arrive tomorrow. And the order for the witnesses: The first will be MW, the second will be AWN, and the third will be UI. So they all arrive on this Friday. Three remaining witnesses arrive on Monday, and they will be called in in this order, hopefully, Your Honour: AWO, KBZ, and AWX. So, I think it's -- it's highly likely their evidence, all of these remaining witnesses is reasonably brief. So I think we will conclude by Tuesday, if not Wednesday, at the latest. If I can advise that. 
If can I also put on record, Your Honour, that there are two witnesses who we can formally drop at this stage. The first of those is GI, and the second is MF. They're both other CELA witnesses, and we've already heard a number of witnesses from -- and those. So those two are to be dropped by the Prosecution. 
That leaves on the list, Your Honours, three remaining witnesses. The first is ACK. That is the witness who is sick. Now, she was spoken to on Monday and at that stage indicated that she thought she was in fact too unwell even to do a video conference. Subsequently, yesterday she has indicated a willingness to at least try and do that, and has -- in respect of that, indicated she will try and get a medical certificate faxed through to us sometime later today, though. We have drafted a motion in French, and you will be -- my friends will be pleased to know that it wasn't myself that drafted it in French. But that should avoid there being a delay in the Defence responding to it. 
So that, potentially, subject to their -- my friends' attitude, and obviously, more importantly, Your Honours' attitude to that application, there is potentially a video link. If you see the name of the witness, it's a name which has arisen, and family members who have arisen. We are certainly reluctant to withdraw or drop that witness. 
That would leave two other witnesses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Video link from Rwanda, or (microphones overlapping) 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, a video link from another North American country. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That would leave two other witnesses. The first is BKX, who was to be called to give evidence as to the voice identification. We've now heard four people give that evidence. Clearly Your Honours are more interested in -- from -- or, more concerned, I should say, with where the tape came from. We have now located the person that we believe taped that and who provided it not only to the Rwandan government, but in fact under a separate K number has apparently provided it to the Tribunal, or the investigators, as far back as 1995. That person is being seen in a European country at the moment, and has indicated a -- a willingness to -- to testify. It would be very brief evidence. That person is unable to identify the Accused's voice, but would be able to testify as to how and where he recorded that. 
So there would be potentially another motion to be filed early next week, and we would try and do that in French as well. A drop/add motion, to drop BKX, and to add this other witness, subject to what he tells us in the next day -- day or so. But that's our intention, if I can indicate at the moment. 
And then the final witness would be that of Dr. Des Forges. In respect of her, she is available in the weeks -- or, the time period that Your Honours tentatively arranged, and around that time period. The issue so far as her -- she is concerned has to do with the translation of her report. Yesterday we were advised by the translation department that they have translated her report into French, subject to it being revised. Now, we can apparently obtain, either today or perhaps tomorrow, and disclose the unrevised translation of her report. The difficulty, if I can say, is that we have also been advised that there are higher priorities which would mean that the revised report may be one or two weeks away. Obviously if my friends are -- depending on -- the 21 days, if that can be from the date of the translated but unrevised copy, then that gives, I think, Your Honours and ourselves a wider span in terms of times that might -- the 21 days would be able to run perhaps from today or tomorrow, and that may, in turn, ease the scheduling issues. 
So I think I've addressed everything that I can at the moment. I indicated earlier this week as to the approximate times that I thought the evidence-in-chief would take. I think Your Honours will note from -- from both parties that the times we indicated have actually been less than that which has been indicated, and I think this week we've actually got through -- completed and finished eight witnesses, which is, certainly in my experience at the Tribunal, some form of record for Prosecution witnesses. Maybe not for Defence, but certainly in terms of Prosecution. But it's -- we've certainly made good -- good progress, if I can say that. 
So whether that assists in terms of the length of time that will be required to conclude those three witnesses, I will leave to Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
We have now identified the six witnesses for next week. We have heard that two witnesses have been dropped, and we know that there will potentially be three remaining witnesses, one by video link, one, if granted by the Chamber, following a motion to vary the witness list, and the expert witness. 
Could we start in the end of translation with the expert witness? The translation is available, it can be disclosed now. Revision is usually simply a double check of the quality of the French. Could we agree that this will not cause a problem so that we can consider the report having been made available in its unrevised form? That would, of course, facilitate matters. Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. Regarding the witnesses for next week, no problem. Concerning the motion for adding new witnesses, well, we will look at it. Concerning Dr. Des Forges' report, if actually we receive the first version, Mr. President, then we are going to consider it as such, unless there is a subsequent revision regarding essential points. But we can start working on the first version of it, provided it is disclosed to us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's a good approach. So, I think in all the probability this will solve the problem and the Defence will then receive it today or tomorrow, I understand. Thank you very much. 
There is a need for about two to three weeks in order to ensure that witnesses can appear and video links can be arranged. 
In view of other scheduling issues, could we now fix Thursday the 1st and Friday the 2nd of February (sic) for the remaining testimony of the Prosecution, possibly followed into the next week, starting on Monday the 5th, it being understood that a maximum of about three days will probably be all that is needed. That would be a window which both parties could live with? With other words, a time span from the 1st of -- sorry, I'm mixing up the months, here. I mean the 1st of March, 1st and 2nd of March, following on to the 5th and 6th of March. Would that be a good time span? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That would be a very -- I think very good for us, especially if this witness is operated on in the next week or so, then it would give some time for recovery. So it would be good for the Prosecutor. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What about the Defence, could this be agreeable? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I don't see any particular impediment. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's very helpful. 
We realise that the question which is now being asked could be slightly premature, because there are still six witnesses to be heard next week, plus one to three witnesses in that additional Prosecution slot which we have just decided. But would it be possible to indicate the commencement of the period for the Defence case, roughly? If we end this Prosecution case no later than Wednesday the 7th of March -- it's probably earlier -- could sometime in May then be a good time? You may wish to reflect on this, it's not necessary to make any decisions today. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, if you allow us time, because I am really not at ease right now to assess the work to be done and the time needed for that work to be done, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will leave it at that for the time being. Thank you very much to both parties. 
Is there anything of an administrative nature, or shall we simply decide to meet Monday at 8:45? That seems to be the best approach. 
So the Court is adjourned. Have a nice weekend.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning. The Court is in session. 
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS MW:
Good morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness MW in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness MW in French) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you, Madam Witness, with your signature, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS MW:
That's so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS MW:
Yes, it is.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
The translators have kindly gone through the Prosecution's spelling list and that list, with the comments from the interpreters, has been forwarded to the Prosecutor. And I see a revised version in front of us this morning. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. You will note that your -- whoever it was that you kindly asked to kindly do this job accepted our spelling of Kajagari, but I have changed it to Kajagali to suit Your Honour's request. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I have no strong feelings about that word. So we will simply follow what is correct, so maybe there still remains an issue on that point. But, never mind. Thank you for your comprehension and for following this up. 
And thank you very much to the interpreters for having improved this very useful list. So this is then updated master list number 3 dated the 5th of February. 
Are you starting in open or closed? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Open, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. Please proceed.

testified as follows:
##
$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, could you tell the Court, please, whereabouts you were living in March 1994? 
@WITNESS MW: 
In March 1994 I lived at Rugenge secteur, ******************* cellule, in Nyarugenge commune. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And with whom did you live? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I was living with my husband, my four children, and two maids, as well as a watchman. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after the 6th of April did you remain at home? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I remained at home, my home, until the 9th of April, because, from the morning of the 10th of April, I had to leave my home with my children, my maids, and the watchman. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And why did you have to leave your home on the morning of the 10th of April? 
@WITNESS MW: 
We had to leave our home because we were being threatened. There were militiamen coming from about everywhere -- from the opposite hill in Kacyiru, and we also heard via the phone that there were militiamen coming from the place called Kimisange, below Kimihurura. We were told that those militiamen wanted to attack our cellule, ***************. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are both again speaking far too fast. We get signals here. So, both of you must slow down. 
Secondly, Madam Witness, it is important to have a pause between the question and the answer, and the answer and the question. So these are two techniques we have to observe in this courtroom in order to create an environment where everyone is comfortable and can work efficiently. 
May I ask, is also your CaseView out of order, Prosecution? English? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes it is, but I am not sure - 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Not so fast. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I am not sure if the problem is within the court system or my computer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The purpose of the question is to find out whether it is only some computers or in general. 
Now, let's stop for a moment. 
Maybe we have now found a solution. We have. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, mine isn't, but it may be my technical inabilities. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about your husband? You didn't mention him leaving with you. Did he stay at home or did he go elsewhere? 
@WITNESS MW: 
He stayed in our residence until the night of the 16th, because during the day of the 17th he had to flee our home, and he joined us at the Saint Paul national pastoral centre. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And why was it that he remained at home when you and the others fled? 
@WITNESS MW: 
He stayed there for two reasons: Reason number 1, he thought that he would not be directly threatened, because he was not a Tutsi. Reason number 2, he wanted to make some effort at protecting our house from any possible destruction or looting. But, in the final analysis, he had to flee because he had just heard rumours that he would be attacked, that his name was on the list of people who would be killed, given that he was a Hutu who was not pro-MRND and pro-Interahamwe; that is, he was not a supporter of the government at the time, and also he worked in a firm owned by a Tutsi. It was a major firm. So, for those two reasons, he was threatened. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, before you left your home on the 10th of April, aside from feeling threatened, was anything unusual happening in the area around your home in your neighbourhood? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. There were to-and-fro movements. Vehicles were moving back and forth in the road opposite our house, so there was some unusual movements, because it was not often that we saw such movements. There were militiamen in pickup trucks with weapons, and sometimes there were soldiers passing by. And when we saw what was going on at the opposite hill, we were afraid we would be attacked, because the overall atmosphere was not really conducive for people to stay at their homes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know -- or did you know where those vehicles that you have talked about were going to or coming from? 
@WITNESS MW: 
From what we heard, we were told that the vehicles were going to and coming from the home of Mrs. Angeline Mukandituye who, at the time, was the schools inspector in the secteur in Nyarugenge. So the vehicles were either going to or coming from her house, or going to or coming from the house of Odette Nyirabagenzi, a conseiller who lived within that neighbourhood also. 
@MS. MELLUISH:

(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will delete that sentence at 9:07:00. Both sentences will have to be deleted and placed under seal. 
Video booth, please do not transmit that. 
But the Prosecution's question was slightly different and then less risky: What was the distance in metres, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS MW:
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This answer is less risky, but in an abundance of caution, we will also place that under seal. 
Video booth, please do not transmit that answer. 
All right, let's continue. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I am grateful, Your Honour. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know -- or, did you know, rather, at that time why there might have been this toing-and-froing from the house of Angeline Mukandituye? 
@WITNESS MW: 
It was common knowledge in the neighbourhood that Angeline Mukandituye was the leader or chieftain of the Interahamwe militia ***********************. She was quite an influential person within the MRND and the militia. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And was that something you had known before the 7th of April or only afterwards? 
@WITNESS MW: 
We had known it well before then, because with the advent of multiparty politics, each Rwandan had to choose his or her side. Of course, there were people who did not want to join any of the camps, but it was known that Angeline was 100 per cent behind MRND. And she even incited others, right up to the teachers under her authority, to join the MRND. Those who did not want to join the MRND were not in her good books. Some people, like me, were not in any political party. I, my husband, or our family members, did not choose any political parties. But there were many teachers who were members of the MRND party. They even had membership cards. Angeline was the chieftain of the MRND ******************. Sometimes when there were rallies, she could be seen presiding over those rallies. And she was there in broad daylight. Everybody could see her. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, when you left home on the 10th of April, where did you go to? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I left my home on the morning of the 10th of April. When I wanted to go to the Saint Paul national pastoral centre, I found other people who had sought refuge below the Saint Paul national pastoral centre in the buildings of the JOC secondary school. There were, amongst others, a lady of ************** who worked in that school. She asked us where we were going to. We told her that we wanted to pass through the fence to go to the Saint Paul. And she said, "Come here." I, my children, and my husband, and the girls working there had sought refuge at the JOC school. We stayed there for two days. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is fine, Madam Witness, but you are speeding up slightly now. Please keep a slow speed. 
@WITNESS MW:
I am sorry. I will make an effort. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Why did you leave JOC after only two days? 
@WITNESS MW: 
On April 12th, around 9:00 or 10:00 a.m., one young man came and warned us. He was the drover responsible for the cows of the Kigali archdiocese. There was a building -- the stables were near the dormitory of the JOC, where we were. So we had actually familiarised ourselves with that young man because we had some foodstuff and we shared the foodstuff. So that morning -- actually, first of all, there were certain people who had come to the woods at CELA. CELA was the centre for the teaching of African languages. It was a centre owned by the Missionaries of Africa. So, in the woods -- two people fled to those woods. The militiamen could not lay hands on them. So they were following them, running after them, and they thought that those two people had succeeded in seeking refuge at the JOC or at the stables for the archbishop's cows. So they wanted to attack that place. And the young man said, "No, no one had come there." So those two militiamen were not convinced, and they told him, "Listen, young man, you don't want to tell us the truth. So we are going to come with other militiamen and soldiers, and then you will be compelled to tell us where those people have gone to." So that young man became afraid for us, so he came and told us, "Listen, you have to leave immediately because militiamen and soldiers will come here soon." It was at that time that all of us had to leave to save our lives, as well as the lives of our children. So we forced our way into Saint Paul by passing below the fence -- under the fence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. A question like the one the Prosecution now asked you, madam, can be answered briefly or in a long way. You decided to give a very comprehensive answer. It's not always necessary. Could you kindly look at the Prosecution when you are answering the questions, and then she will give you a little sign if your response is getting too detailed. All right? So, please watch out.
Next question, please. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you got to Saint Paul, what did you find there? 
@WITNESS MW: 
We found other people there; people who had sought refuge. We also found Father Célestin, who received us, as well as some watchmen who worked at Saint Paul and who were supposed to be guarding the buildings of the Saint Paul premises. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after finding refuge at Saint Paul, were you safe? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Not entirely. It is true that it was shelter, but from time to time there were militia as well as soldier-led attacks. So it was not complete security. It was negligible. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall the first such attack that you witnessed? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When did that take place? 
@WITNESS MW: 
The first attack took place on the 22nd of April. Many militiamen came there. They entered the dormitories where we were, but on that occasion they did not take anyone. But they took certain things; for instance, a radio set here and there, or if someone had some money on him, they would take the money away. But, on that day, they did not take anybody. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was there a time when they did take somebody? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. The attacks which I remember during which the people who were with us were taken away were actually two in number. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Tell us about the first of those, please. Can you recall the date of that attack? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes, I think it was about two days after the first attack of the 22nd, so it must have been on the 24th. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And who on that occasion were the attackers? 
@WITNESS MW: 
The first time the attackers were militiamen of our neighbourhood; and in the afternoon there was another attack led by soldiers. The first attack of the militia, which took place in the morning, during that attack seven people were taken away, and in the afternoon when the soldiers came there, Father Célestin tried to reason with them. He even offered them a bull by way of ransom. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can we start, please, with the morning attack? You said they were militia. Can you remember how many militia came to Saint Paul that morning? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I cannot give you the number because there were so many of them. Some of them entered our dormitory. I was in dormitory 1. Some had remained outside. So, honestly, I cannot give you the number; there were so many of them. In fact, there were more than 20. Those who entered were at least 20 in number, yet there were others outside. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when they came into your dormitory, what did they do? 
@WITNESS MW: 
They didn't take anybody from our dormitory. But if perhaps I can say what happened to me personally, they wanted to forcefully take us with them. The one who appeared as the leader at that time was one responsable de cellule in our neighbourhood. He wanted to forcefully take me, my husband, and my children, but someone intervened and said, "No, stop. Show them that there is security, then you can come back subsequently". In my dormitory -- actually it was a dormitory occupied mainly by women, children and a few men. But dormitory 2 was a dormitory occupied essentially by men and young girls, and it was from that dormitory that they took seven people away, which seven people were subsequently killed near Rugenge secteur. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you mentioned a responsable de cellule. Would you describe him as -- or her as being part of the militia or not? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. He was part of the militia. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what makes you say that he appeared to be the leader? 
@WITNESS MW: 
It was quite known. They were the leaders; they didn't hide that fact. He was there. He had a weapon. And even before the outbreak of the war, there had been a system of watch -- neighbourhood watch, and he was the one collecting money from the families to pay those people who were supposed to be watching the neighbourhoods. Those people had been recruited with a specific purpose. When the war started, those same people (unintelligible) were forced into militia. He was the one who was their leader, he was the one collecting the money before; he was the one paying them. And when he came there, he was carrying a weapon. So it was easy to note that he was a leader. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Just to clarify: At the beginning of your answer, you said "They were the leaders," who do you mean by "they"? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Him, one Léonard Bagabo, who was the responsable de cellule. In normal administration, he was a civilian authority. But the civilian authority was also the one in charge of the militia. Now, the militia was not comprised of soldiers, they were mere civilians who had been trained and enlisted to massacre undesirable people. He was a civilian authority and, he was the one leading those civilians who had converted themselves into killers. And when I said "They," I was referring to him, Bagabo and the other members of the cellule who were there and whom I knew in our neighbourhood. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you described the militia taking seven people from the other dormitory, other than the one you were in; how was it that you became aware of that? 
@WITNESS MW: 
When they left our dormitory, their first gesture was to try and look through -- our first gesture was to try and look through the window to see what was going on. Our dormitory was near the stairs. So I saw them going up, then we saw a pickup going out with people in it. Subsequently, we were able to learn the names of the people who had been taken away. Amongst them I remember three people. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you ever find out what happened to those people that were taken away? 
@WITNESS MW: 
We were subsequently told that they had been killed in Rugenge secteur at a place called CND. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know why that place was called CND? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Honestly, I cannot tell you why it was christened that way. But CND normally meant Conseil national de développement. That was the national assembly. Now, the national assembly building was being used to quarter the 600 RPF soldiers who had been authorised to come to Kigali to ensure the protection of the RPF members who were to be part of the transition government. Now, all places where people were killed, for instance, the mass graves, such places were either called CND, to mean that that was a place where the Inyenzi, the roaches, were being lodged, or Kinihira. Kinihira was another place where Habyarimana's government and the RPF got together towards putting in place the transition government. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall who was it that told you that those people had been killed there? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I remember getting that information from Father Célestin, who was the one in charge of the national pastoral centre. I also got the information from the watchmen of the national pastoral centre, who could move about the neighbourhood. So there were rumours abound. I sought to know from one of the workers, and he confirmed it, and I got further confirmation from Father Célestin.
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, we don't need to go into the names of people taken, but are you able to tell the Court, if you know, why those particular seven were selected and taken on that day? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Amongst them was a journalist who was not a government supporter. The reason why he had sought refuge at the Saint Paul national pastoral centre was because he was threatened. What he wrote was not well appreciated, because he always told the truth about what was going on. In that same group was one young man who was a student in the secondary school, but who had actually distinguished himself sufficiently in the PSD party. He was a young man aged somewhere between 18 and 20, and whenever there was an anti-government demonstration, he was amongst the first people to demonstrate conspicuously. So he always made it known that he did not support the regime. 
Another person I remember who was killed, was one young Tutsi who was a member of the PL, that is, the liberal party, and who also had always made known his anti-Habyarimana regime feelings. There were other Tutsi I did not know in that group. I know those three people because we were all in the same neighbourhood. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was the journalist a Tutsi? 
@WITNESS MW:
No, he was a Hutu. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was the student a Tutsi? 
@WITNESS MW:
No, he was a Hutu. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This first attack, when did the attackers arrive in the morning? 
@WITNESS MW: 
It was around 10 a.m. Let me say between 10 a.m. and noon. I am not able to give you an exact time. It was mid-morning, towards the end of the morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what was the total duration of the attack? When did the attackers leave? 
@WITNESS MW:
They left around 12-12:30. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you said that 20 persons came into your dormitory. Can you give an estimate as to how many attackers there were in total? Simply an approximation. 
@WITNESS MW:
I am not able to give you an estimate. I only saw those who came into our dormitory. Those who went -- I didn't know the number of people who went into the other dormitory, and there were others outside as well. So I really cannot give you a figure. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You mentioned a second attack taking place that day. Can you recall at what time that took place, approximately? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I believe it must have been around 1330 hours, 1400 hours, because we had not got in time -- we had not had enough time to get over the first attack. That evening there were soldiers who came in the company of two young men, two young boys of about 15 years old, and they were helping them to carry their ammunitions. And they were also from our neighbourhood, so that they can show them where to go to exterminate. They came -- 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Sorry, I just want you to clarify: Did the soldiers come at around 1:30, 2 o'clock in the afternoon or in the evening? 
@WITNESS MW: 
They came in the afternoon, around 1400 hours. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know what type of soldiers these were? 
@WITNESS MW: 
From what we were told subsequently, they were troops from the Presidential Guard coming from Mount Rebero. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And where were you when the soldiers arrived at Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I was in the dormitory. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you just refer to Mount Rebero? 
@WITNESS MW:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how was it that you became aware that an attack was taking place? 
@WITNESS MW: 
When they came, they immediately wanted to fire in the direction of the buildings. Father Célestin wanted to prevent them from doing so. He told them that, "Look, they are just ordinary citizens so let them come out". So he came into our dormitory, called the other people who were there, that is the priests, and asked them to tell us to get out. And when we were getting out, we thought that there were -- there was RPF shelling of our buildings. We thought we were going to take refuge. When they got to the staircase, at the foot of the staircase we saw the soldiers who had pointed their weapons towards the dormitory. We came down, and they gathered us on the grass, asked us to sit down, and then they started sorting us out. Anyone who lived in Saint Paul knows about this attack or wagiye, meaning "you are dead". They started sorting us out or segregating us on the basis of our ethnicity as indicated in our identity card. When it is seen that someone is a Tutsi, they said "wagiye", meaning "you are with those who were going to die". They started segregating us. 
Finally, Father Célestin sought a way out of this situation. He spoke to the soldiers, and then he went to call the gendarmes who were on the other side at the Sainte Famille, asked them to come and assist us -- assist, and asked -- assist him to negotiate. His argument was that those people taking refuge there were ordinary citizens, and that they were no Inyenzi, no cockroaches, no agents of the RPF among them. Finally, they accepted to leave with a bull as ransom, a bull which they took from the livestock of the archbishop. And then, among us, we gathered some money -- collected some money. We were able to put together 200 thousand francs to buy our lives. When they got the bull, they left. But, in the evening, they came back for money. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, are you able to estimate how many soldiers there were participating in this attack? 
@WITNESS MW: 
On account of the prevailing situations and weapons trained or our buildings, there was one who even shot into a room which had refugees. I was a bit confused. So I am not able to give you an exact figure, but what I saw personally, I will be able to say that there were about 10 of them. What also shocked me were these young boys of about 15 years old. I know some of them; some of them were my students or my pupils and they come from my neighbourhood. I saw about 20 soldiers and these children who accompanied them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall how long the process of sorting people out took? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I won't be able to give an accurate estimate, but it lasted more than an hour. Even with the negotiations that took place, they were not -- because of the negotiations that took place, they were not able to finish with the sorting out. At one point in time, when they were convinced, through the promises that were made to them, they left us alone, but at that stage there were some people who had not yet been sorted out. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the soldiers left, when? 
@WITNESS MW:
It must have been around 1500 hours, 1530 hours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And no one was killed or injured during this event? 
@WITNESS MW:
No, nobody was killed; nobody was hurt. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were you one of those that were sorted, as you put it, or had they not got to you when the negotiations meant that they left? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Of course, I was one of those to be killed. So I was in the group of those who were labelled as wagiye. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you help us with that word, Madam Witness, the spelling maybe? And what does it mean? 
@WITNESS MW:
W-A-G-I-Y-E. Wagiye means "you are gone". And during the genocide era in the context of genocide, it means "you are dead". 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So after these two attacks on the 24th of April 1994, were there any others that you are aware of at Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS MW: 
There were several which did not take any anyone away. But on the 14th of June there was a huge attack which took with it 60 young persons. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I would like you to tell the Court about this attack. Can we start at the beginning please. When were you first aware that an attack was taking place that day? 
@WITNESS MW: 
The first time was in the morning between 9 and 10:00 a.m. I had come out of my dormitory on my way to the clinic to seek some medical care for my little girl who was sick. They had set up a clinic, and medicine was coming from -- medical supplies were coming from the International Red Cross. There were a lot of nurses who had come to the centre. They wanted to come to the dormitory but the two gendarmes who were at Saint Paul arrested them -- or stopped them and went to call Father Célestin. He came and started negotiating with them. They told -- they told him that they had a list and those on the list were to be taken away. They showed him the list. And from what the gendarmes told me, is that Father Célestin told them that this list is not signed, it's not official. The gendarmes left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you clarify, please, who are "they", the people that wanted to come to the dormitory? 
@WITNESS MW: 
They are militiamen. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, at that stage, did you see any of them? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes, I knew them. I knew some them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And where were they when you saw them? 
@WITNESS MW: 
When I saw them the first time, they were on the main road at the centre, opposite the all-purpose room. That is where they had met and were waiting for the instructions of their leader. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know who their leader was? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I saw their leader, and from what I heard subsequently, it was said that his first name was Jean, that he came from the Muhima neighbourhood. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to estimate how many militiamen you saw at that time? 
@WITNESS MW: 
There were many. In any event, more than 50. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, a gendarme told you that Father Célestin had told them that the list wasn't signed. What happened after that, if you know? 
@WITNESS MW: 
When he told them that the list was not signed, the gendarme left with them. And from what he told us subsequently, he went to look for a military authority to ask him what was happening. And when they got there, and the few military authorities they found told them that, "Listen, this does not concern us". He told the militiamen that, "If you want to fight go to the war front, there is a lot of work there, so don't continue causing havoc among the population." The military officer did not want to sign the list. The militiamen left and the gendarme came back. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who said this? 
@WITNESS MW:
It is the gendarme who told us this when he came back to Saint Paul. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And who was it that said, "This doesn't concern us, go to the war front"? 
@WITNESS MW:
According to the gendarme, these were military authorities that he, together with the militiamen, went to see. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the evidence clear here? Do you want to clarify? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You heard all of this from a gendarme, is that right?
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, when he told you this, he had returned, I understand you said, with the militiamen, is that correct? 
@WITNESS MW: 
No, he came back alone. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where were the militia at that time, do you know? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I don't know where he left them, but when the soldiers refused to sign the list, he came back alone. But some time later, maybe an hour, hour and a half, I am not too sure, the militiamen came back but, on that occasion, in a very angry mood. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, just to go back to when the gendarme returned, do you know which military authority he had been to? 
@WITNESS MW: 
No. We didn't get to know exactly whom he went to see. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when he came back, did he have the list with him? 
@WITNESS MW: 
No. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, is that sufficiently clear now?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So when the militia came back, you said they were angry, what did they do when they arrived at Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS MW: 
When they came, the first thing they did was to enter the dormitories. They started sorting out people, people who were there, on the basis of -- their criteria for selection was young people between 16 and 35 years. They would take them out of the dormitories or rooms that had been converted into dormitories and gathered them on the grass in front of the building. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And while this process was taking place, where were you? 
@WITNESS MW: 
When they came back on this second occasion, I had gone to the clinic because on the first occasion I couldn't get my daughter taken care of. And each time they came, we had taken refuge in the dormitory. So when they came on the second time, there as well I went into the dormitory. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was anyone in the dormitory with you selected in this way? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes: There was my husband, who was selected, and then my brother, who was with us. There was another man, who was further on, who was taken away. There were girls, as well as women, who were selected and taken out of the dormitory. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us whether when your husband and your brother were taken you were actually present or not? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes, I was with them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall who took them from the dormitory? 
@WITNESS MW: 
The first time my husband was taken out -- was taken away by a militiaman that I did not know. Subsequently -- and there was a few minutes between when my husband was selected and my brother was selected -- there was a lapse of a few minutes. The first time they took my brother, there was this militiaman who looked like the leader and who had a list. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall did he say anything when he came and took your brother? 
@WITNESS MW: 
When he came for my brother, we were sitting side by side. My brother was seated to my left. And when he wanted to haul him by his jacket, I tried to pull my brother. My brother said, "No, I am not from this neighbourhood." And I continued saying that he was not from that neighbourhood where we came from. But the other one was saying that, "This Inyenzi, this cockroach, I know him, he is from Muhima." I tried to negotiate or to fight with this militiaman, but he was poking the list under my nose and telling me that, "Look, can't you see that he is on my list?" I looked at the list, and even though I was not able to read the entire content, I saw some names on that list. But since he was in a position of authority and he was stronger than myself, he took my brother away. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, can you tell us a bit more about the list that you saw? What kind of document was this? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I could not read the entire content of that list, but from the little that I saw, it contained names, numbered names from "1". I cannot longer recall the number. But what struck me -- or what I really wanted to verify was to see if the list had been signed, because I had heard about the list earlier on during the first attack which was -- which failed. So when I saw the list, I had a reflex of finding out if the list had been signed. There was the official stamp -- the then official stamp -- and then it was written "the préfet of Kigali-ville", and there was also a signature. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you remain inside the dormitory after your brother was taken away or did you go elsewhere? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I remained in the same dormitory until the following day. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know what happened to those, including your brother, who were taken outside the dormitory? 
@WITNESS MW: 
We knew fully well -- or we got to know subsequently, that they were killed at the same place of Rugenge secteur called CND. When they were taken away, we knew what was going to happen. We knew they were going to be killed, and this was confirmed subsequently. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was it your understanding that your brother was picked because he was on the list or because he was known by the person who said "I know this Inyenzi", irrespective of the list? 
@WITNESS MW:
In fact, the list was a laissez-passer to enable them into the centre. But what I heard from the gendarme was that there were some people who were actually on the list and some were not. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not really know whether your brother was, in fact, on the list? 
@WITNESS MW:
No. But what I am sure of is that he was known to this militia leader who took him away. He knew him very well. He comes from the neighbourhood of my parents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And why was the form of this list or the model used a laissez-passer? 
@WITNESS MW:
In fact, the longer the war lasted, the more these killings were criticised. And Father Célestin, all along, tried to negotiate and to call on the civilian authorities to help him ensure the security of the people under his care. So the militiamen, if they brought a list, also indicated that even the civilian authorities that he called upon were in agreement. So it was a laissez-passer to enable them to enter the dormitories so that Father Célestin would not resist the entry of the militiamen, even if -- even though his opposition to them did not yield any fruit. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After he was taken from your dormitory, did you ever see your brother again? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Never again. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about your husband? You said that he had been taken also. Did you see him again? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when did you see him again? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I saw him a few minutes before the others were taken away. So he came back to our dormitory. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And can you explain how it was that he was able to come back to you? Briefly. 
@WITNESS MW: 
He did not do anything to come back. When they took my brother away, my mother, who was with us, was so upset she in fact became hysterical and she started insulting the militia. So she went out and was able to make out certain militia, and she started talking to them. One of the militia entered our dormitory and selected two girls. When he went out with them, they arrived downstairs. Some of the militia were hitting at my mother with the butts of their guns, and on account of her hysterical status she could not really feel anything. The head of the militia, who had the list, saw the girls and my mother, whom the militia wanted to take away, and he said, "No, this lady and those girls are not on my list. We will come back with a list which will bear their names. So let them be for the time being." So the militia who had taken those two girls became angry, and he said, "This time around, I know that they had been to Kinihira, and you are refusing, and if that is the situation, then I will choose from any of the people you are taking and will send them back." 
So he was looking at the people who had been sorted. And my husband was standing a bit by the side. The militia looked at him and he said, "You, stand up". Since his head had been lowered, he did not even know that he was the one being talked to. And then the militia said, "You with the striped shirt", so he raised his head and realised that he was one the militia was talking to. He stood up, and the militia left him there, and he left. The gendarme who was standing by the side with another militia called him and asked him to show his identity card, which he did, and afterwards they told him, "Go back to the dormitory." So he returned. And a few minutes later the others were taken away and killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know how they were taken from Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS MW: 
From what my mother told me, first of all, they took off their shoes, then they tied them one to the other with their shirts, then they went down through the stairs and passed through the second entrance, which was at the rear of the Saint Paul national pastoral centre. And that was a route they took, right up to the Rugenge secteur, where they were killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know how many people were actually taken on that day? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Subsequently, we tried to count the exact number of people, and we realised that between 56 and 60 people had been taken away. Some of them we didn't know their names, but the names which we knew were about 50 to 54. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you mentioned the list that you saw had the stamp of the préfet of Kigali-ville. Do you know who that was at the time? 
@WITNESS MW: 
The Kigali-ville préfet was Tharcisse Renzaho. What I noticed was the mention, "the préfet of Kigali-ville" followed by the name and then the official stamp. I was not able to decipher what was in the stamp, but I saw the official seal with the seal of the republic, but the words "Préfet of Kigali-ville" and the name below, I saw those. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
At that time, did you know the préfet of Kigali-ville? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Oh, yes. Of course, I knew him. He was often on TV. Personally, as a state employee, I had seen him on quite a few occasions. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you were at Saint Paul centre, did you ever see him? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I personally saw him on the 16th of June; that is, two days after the attack against us. He came to the Saint Paul in the morning. I am unable to give the exact time, but it was between 9:00 and 11 a.m. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did he come alone or with others? 
@WITNESS MW: 
He came with the conseiller of our secteur, Odette Nyirabagenzi, many militia, as well as UNAMIR soldiers. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you say "militia", do you mean Interahamwe or something else? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know why Renzaho came to Saint Paul with Interahamwe and the conseiller and UNAMIR soldiers? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I cannot say why he was with militia, but his arrival there with the conseiller and the UNAMIR soldiers was to discuss with Father Célestin and those of us who had taken refuge at Saint Paul about our evacuation by UNAMIR. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did Renzaho say anything when he was at Saint Paul that you are aware of? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes, he was the one who chaired the meeting -- the discussion which took place there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you hear him say anything yourself? 
@WITNESS MW: 
No because when they came there, I was in a dormitory which was perpendicular to the multipurpose hall, and amongst the people accompanying him were many militia of my neighbourhood who knew me. There was also Odette, who knew me very well. So I chose not to be a member of the people who had gathered outside. But I followed the scene of what was going on through the window. I climbed on a table and I could see through the window. I saw him speaking. I could hear voices without actually making out what he was saying, but I could see him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you -- you said you couldn't hear exactly what was being said. Did you subsequently learn of the nature of the discussions? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. At the end of the meeting, the first thing I did was to ask my comrades of misfortune to tell me exactly what had happened and what had been said. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what did you learn from them? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I learnt that the préfet was talking to them about our evacuation which would be conducted after all the people who had taken refuge at the Sainte Famille would have been evacuated. So he said we would be evacuated second. But we were requesting to be the first to be evacuated. Now, if you allow me, let me give a brief description. You see, those two centres were accommodating refugees with different status. At the Saint Paul national pastoral centre, it was known that the Hutu or Tutsi who had sought refuge there were people who were fleeing from the militia, so they were directly threatened. But at the Sainte Famille parish were two categories of people; some of them had fled RPF combat zones, and others had fled the militia. So there was that mix, and it was not easy to sort them, whereas we had been selected to be killed. So when he said that we would be evacuated after the other people, there was some sort of panic. So my comrades insisted that we be the first to be evacuated, and at one stretch. So Renzaho's response, he did not even allow UNAMIR to state whether or not it was achievable. He said that, "Even God cannot do so. You will be evacuated after the refugees at the Sainte Famille, and it would be in several stretches". 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what, in fact, happened to those, including yourself, at Saint Paul after that? Were you evacuated or not? 
@WITNESS MW: 
We were evacuated. But our evacuation was not conducted by the government in place, nor was it conducted by the UNAMIR. During the night of the 16th to the 17th of June, we were evacuated by the RPF troops who came to Saint Paul at night. In fact, they even went to the Sainte Famille, but they did not succeed in the evacuation drive at the Saint Famille. So, at night, they led us away on foot up until Kabuye, where we spent three days, and subsequently we went to Kabuga, which was in RPF-controlled territory.

$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
During that evacuation, do you recall any fighting taking place between the RPF soldiers who rescued you, and government forces, or militia? Interahamwe militia? 
@WITNESS MW: 
We could hear a lot of explosions and gunfire even while we were at the centre. We could hear a lot of explosions, detonations. But we could not know exactly whether they were just deterrent shots or actually combat shots. Subsequently, we heard that RPF troops had taken up positions in strategic places and were firing deterrent shots to prevent the government army from intervening. Even at the Saint Paul, there were weapons pointing at directions where we thought attacks would come from. Personally, I did not see any person killed, apart from the people who were with us. Because when we arrived at the Kacyiru hill opposite us, they were hit by bullets, or grenades fired by the militia, or the government troops who were behind us. From what we learned, the RPF had set up an evacuation corridor. Because in order to come and conduct the evacuation, they had gone to Kabuga where there was a refugee camp, people who had come from the Sainte Famille. And amongst those people were young persons who were very familiar with that area. So those were the young people who guided the RPF troops to come and evacuate us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your evacuation from Saint Paul, did it take place on the 16th of June, or later? 
@WITNESS MW:
It took place on the night of the 16th to the 17th, so it was around 1, 2, 3 a.m. I cannot be more specific. But it was during the night of the 16th to the 17th of June. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Just to clarify, you said that you didn't see anybody killed apart from the people who were with you. Do you mean by that refugees, or do you mean soldiers, rescuers? Who are you talking about who were killed? 
@WITNESS MW: 
There were refugees who were killed. I know some of them. About 20 of them were hit by bullets. But there was also one RPF soldier who was also hit and who died during our evacuation. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Now, just to take you back to when you saw the préfet on the 16th of June, you said he was accompanied by the conseiller and militia. When you saw that, did it strike you as usual, or unusual, to see an administrative official to -- accompanied by Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS MW: 
It was quite normal at the time. Because the civilian authorities were either militia or were working hand in hand with the militia. The militia comprised groups which had been incorporated for a particular purpose. And for civilian authorities to be accompanied by militia was quite normal. They, by themselves, constituted an army. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. I have no further questions for you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, this second occasion when you referred to a list. I understand that you yourself saw numbered names. That is true, isn't it? 
@WITNESS MW:
Yes, but I was not able to read to know that this person's name was on the list. But I saw a numbered list. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you yourself see a stamp?
@WITNESS MW:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you yourself see a name of any official authority? 
@WITNESS MW:
I saw the wording, "The préfet of Kigali-ville", and the name I saw "Re", then the rest was covered by the stamp. But the wording, "The préfet of Kigali-ville", stood out clearly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the "Re" was the beginning of which word, read in context?
@WITNESS MW:
It was the name of the préfet of Kigali-ville, Tharcisse Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you yourself see any signature? 
@WITNESS MW:
Yes. There was a signature in the stamp. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your husband was the man in the striped shirt, is that so? 
@WITNESS MW:
That's right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why did the militiamen address him?
@WITNESS MW:
That militia who talked to him, and who unconsciously saved his life, was furious because he had been refused the possibility of taking the two girls away. When he said that they, the militia, would come back with a list of women, he became furious. And he told them that "If that is the case, then I'm going to take who I want". That is why, by some stroke of luck, his eyes fell on my husband. I can't really say what the criterion for his choice was, but my husband was slightly away from the others. So fortunately for him, the militia's eyes fell on that man, on my husband. And that particular militia wanted to revenge because the other militia had prevented him from taking the two girls away. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So he wanted to take away your husband, but then the identity card was produced. Is that the sequence? Showing them that your husband was a Hutu? I'm trying to find out why the chain of events which started with an act of revenge, ended up with your husband being exempted from the process. 
@WITNESS MW:
The person who took him back to the dormitory was not the one who had taken him out initially. There were two different people. There was one person who took him out of the dormitory. That person placed him in the group with the others, then he left. Then there was this second person who had taken those girls, and he wanted to lead the girls away. Now, when he went down, the militia leader told him, "We are not taking those girls with us. They are not on my list. Those girls and the lady will remain here, and we will come back with a list where their names will be". So that second militia who had taken those girls down became furious. So he said, "You don't want me to take those girls. If that's the case, then I will take back to the dormitory whoever I want". And that is how, by some stroke of luck, his eyes fell on my husband, who was slightly away from the others. He said, "You, stand up". So he stood up. But the person who asked him to stand up left him there and went away. So my husband stood up there, foolishly. And subsequently a third militia, who was standing by the side with the gendarme, told him, "You, come here". So he went towards the two other people. They asked him to show his identity card, which he did, and they realised that on his identity card was the mention Hutu. So they told him, "You go back to the dormitory".
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Madam Witness. 
Defence, please. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Good morning, Witness.
@WITNESS MW:	
Good morning. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, to start the cross, I have certain questions which concern the witness's close proximity, so perhaps we should think about a closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
About five to ten minutes? Is that a good estimate? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That's right. Five minutes would be enough. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So if those observing us now could leave us for five minutes, and then you are welcome back soon. We will move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 22 to 25] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
$(Pages 18 to 21 by Vicki Eastvold)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness MW, we are now in open session, and your cross-examination continues. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Witness. Let me come back to the issue of the identity of these gendarmes who were present. And you said that you cannot give the name of one of those gendarmes, more specifically the one who was with you on the 14th of June.
@WITNESS MW: 
No. I'm not able to give names. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
This gendarme, did he have a chief, a boss? 
@WITNESS MW: 
The one who appeared to be the leader is the one who took the militiamen to a place that I do not know, and who came back to say that the authorities he met did not want to sign the lists. He is the one who appeared to be the leader. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And you're not able to give his name? 
@WITNESS MW: 
No. Not even a first name, no. Because to know his name, I had to be in direct contact with him. There was some contact, but they spoke only to Father Célestin who was in charge of the centre, or with workers of the Saint Paul centre who used to accompany him in a vehicle to fetch water. I have no interest, nor any authority, to ask him, "Who are you?" We knew that they were gendarmes, but I'm not able to give their names. It was not my duty at the time. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, were there soldiers at the site? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Maybe around the place, but not within the centre. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, are you able to distinguish between soldiers and gendarmes from the uniform at the time? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. The uniform was different, particularly with regard to the -- the gendarmes were wearing red berets. Even the epaulette on their shoulder were red, whereas the soldiers were wearing black berets, or berets with spots with the insignia of the Republic. I do not know if the insignia was different, but I clearly recall -- I'm not able to explain exactly -- but on the beret of the soldiers, there was an insignia. And on the beret of the gendarmes, there was another insignia. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, I'm asking you this question because a while ago you explained that during the 14th June attack, the gendarme who went with the militia to see the soldiers -- to see the soldiers -- that is why I'm asking you if there were soldiers at the site. And you are saying no. 
@WITNESS MW: 
Well, let me be clear. Not at the site, Saint Paul site, but around, depending on the position they wanted to take, there were soldiers. I mean, the town itself, because the Saint Paul centre was within Kigali town close to the Sainte Famille church. So in the town, or on specific positions, there were soldiers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you see soldiers yourself on the 14th of June within the area of Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS MW:
No. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, in one of your testimonies, statements, taken by the investigators of the ICTR -- I'm referring to page 3. In this statement of 31st May 2000, reference K0052707, paragraph -- page 3, paragraph -- the paragraph referring to Angeline, school inspector, and making reference to the discussion that, Witness, you had with Father Hakizimana. You said in that statement, "Before he was able to say the reason for his call, Angeline told him that he should not in future call the authorities if he wanted to prevent the Interahamwe from acting, but that he should refer to her". Do you recall this conversation? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What lesson did you draw from this, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS MW: 
Let me start by saying, what happened before Father Célestin was able to tell me this, or to understand why the conversation took place -- I'm sorry, I'm not able to give the number -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We're in public session, Madam Witness.
@WITNESS MW: 
-- but there was a radio announcement calling on civil servants to go to Gitarama -- I cannot recall any longer -- to collect their April salary -- no -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Corrects the witness.
@WITNESS MW:
It was March salary. Now, I and my colleagues, office colleagues, asked me to ask Father Célestin if it was possible to give him an authorisation for him to go to Gitarama and collect our salaries for us. I spoke to Father Célestin about it, and he told me that it was dangerous. "They would get to know that you are here". I told him, "Listen. Try. Try. If you observe that the situation -- it's getting complex, you just leave it". So he called Angeline. When he called her the first time she was not there, but when she came back they told her about the call. Angeline -- and I no longer recall if it was Father Célestin who called, or if it was Angeline who called. I cannot recall that any more. But when he heard her speak -- if the Kinyarwanda booth can interpret exactly what I'm going to say, tell me if that is possible. 
So Angeline told him, "You, a reverend father, who is appearing difficult and angry, if you want a protection, whatever the nature, do not -- do not call on the authorities, be they soldiers, or otherwise. You should refer to me". 
Now, when Father Célestin heard this attack, he no longer said what he wanted to say. So, finally, the call was stopped and he told his colleagues that, "You should no longer think about this money", and told us what Angeline told him. So we put a cross on this money and never spoke about it again. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have now, Mâitre Cantier, used a portion of a previous witness statement, and you gave us the K number and the date. The date we heard was the 31st of May 2000. Is that the same statement as the one signed by the witness on the 12th of June 2000? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. There's always some difficulty getting -- running through these documents. The passage that I was referring to was in the statement of 8th of May 1998, and the reference I gave you K0052707 is the right reference. Date of interview, 8th May 1998. And the reference in French, K0052707, paragraph 3. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. With this correction, everything fits nicely together. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, in the document that you saw on the 6th of June, you said that you saw the préfecture stamp. 
@WITNESS MW: 
Let me make a correction. I saw the official stamp. I was not able to read the words that were there. But I saw under the stamp, "Préfet, Kigali-ville", with "Re". And then the rest disappeared under the stamp. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And you are saying that you are not able to see the signature very well because it was mixed up with the stamp. I believe I understand you clearly. 
@WITNESS MW: 
Yes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
You talked about a conseiller of your secteur. Do you know the bourgmestre of the commune in which you lived? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I recall that he was called Jean Baptiste Bizimana. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
During these events that you described, did you see him at that location? 
@WITNESS MW: 
I did not see him with my own eyes. But from what was reported to me, he allegedly came to the Saint Paul centre on the 24th of April. The seven persons who were abducted, it was he himself who told Father Célestin that, "Don't worry, nothing will be done to them. I guarantee their security". He was there. And among those people who were taken away, he was there. Finally, he did not give any security, because they were killed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, a while ago, you recounted what Mr. Renzaho might have said on the 16th June 1994. Do you confirm that you yourself did not hear this conversation? 
@WITNESS MW: 
But I could see him about five or six metres away. I could see him through the window. I could hear sounds, but I could not understand or distinguish the sentences. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The meeting that you saw from behind the window, you said you were standing on the table. How long did that last, approximately, do you recall? 
@WITNESS MW: 
No. No. In any event, it did not last more than an hour. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, have you had to testify in Rwanda in any case before the courts? 
@WITNESS MW: 
No, never. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And have you ever had to testify in Gacaca proceedings? 
@WITNESS MW: 
No. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well. Mr. President, I have completed my cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. Re-examination? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This was the end of your testimony, Madam Witness. Thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify. We wish you a very safe journey home. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you very much.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS AWN:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There's an administrative issue before we start your testimony. 
Are there any exhibits to be tendered by the Defence in connection with the previous witness? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you. I cross-examined the witness on one of her statements, but the answer was a bit fluffy, so I do not intend to enter that document into evidence. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
Madam Witness, you will be referred to as Witness AWN in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness AWN in Kinyarwanda) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you, Madam, with your signature. Isn't that so? 
@WITNESS AWN:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This means that the information in this document is correct, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS AWN:
Yes, it is.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, what area were you living in in March 1994? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
In March 1994, I lived in Kigali city in Rugenge secteur. (By order of the Court, this portion of evidence was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We do not want all those details, and we'll place under seal the reference to the cellule. 
Video booth, please do not transmit that. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Who were you living with at that time? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I was living with my father, my mother, my brothers, as well as my younger sister, and my older sister. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How many brothers did you have? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I had two brothers. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After the 6th of April 1994, did you remain living at home with those people? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I did not quite understand your question. Which period are you referring to, ma'am? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Let's put it like this, on the 6th of April 1994, were you living at home? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes, I was at home. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness mentioned the secteur again, Mr. President. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you were living on the 6th of April with those family members you've just described to us, is that right? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
On the 6th of April 1994, I was at home with my father and other family members, excepting my mother and younger sister who had gone to see my grandmother in Gitarama. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After that date, did you see your mother and younger sister again? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I didn't see them throughout that period until July. It was only after the war that I saw them again. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So on the 6th of April, you were with some of your family, your father and some of your siblings. Did you and they remain at home after that date? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes. We remained together at home. That is, I, my father, my two brothers, as well as my sister. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And for how long did you all remain at home together? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
We stayed at home up to the 19th when Interahamwe attacked our house and killed my father and brothers. So up to that date we had remained at home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall how many Interahamwe were involved in the attack in which your father and brother were killed? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
There were perhaps four of them, but I remember only one name. That of one gentleman called Kabyola (sic.).
MS. MELLUISH: 
Don't think that's on the list, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If it's not on the list, we need the spelling, please. Can you help us, Madam?
@WITNESS AWN:
K-A-B-I-N-A (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just say the name again without spelling it, please. 
@WITNESS AWN:
Kabiyona. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And according to the booth, that should, then, be spelled how, please? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
K-A-B-I-Y-O-N-A, says the Kinyarwanda booth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, were you yourself present when this attack took place and your father and brothers were killed? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I was present. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after that happened, what did you do? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
After the Interahamwe attack, which led to the death of my father and brothers, the attackers forced my elder sister to drink a full bottle of whiskey. And when I asked her to leave the house together with me, she told me she could not leave with me. Rather, she begged me to go, and that she would pray for me. So I left, but my elder sister remained behind. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And where did you go when you left? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
When I left our home, I went to the home of the conseiller, because that conseiller had been my mother's friend, and I thought she could give me assistance by me taking shelter in her home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell the Court the name of the conseiller whose home you went to? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Our conseiller was called Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you got to her house, what did you find there? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
When I arrived at her place, the conseiller was not in, but present were her younger sister and another girl, first named Kayitesi. There was another gentleman called Etienne, as well as his wife and children. There were also two young boys there, sons of one Ibambasi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Are you able to spell that name that you've just given us, Ibambasi? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I-B-A-M-B-A-S-I. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the other two names were Etienne, which is easy, and Kayitesi, K-A-Y-I-T-E-S-I, I assume. 
@WITNESS AWN:
Correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How were you received when you got to the conseiller's house? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
When I arrived at the conseiller's, I was relieved because I already knew that young girl called Kayitesi. But since the conseiller was not in, I was asked to wait for her arrival because no one apart from her could authorise anyone to stay at her home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did the conseiller arrive at some stage? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes. The conseiller returned in the evening. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was the conseiller alone when she returned, or accompanied by another, or others? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
The conseiller was putting on a military trench coat, and she also had a firearm. The weapon she was carrying was known as G3, so she was in military attire and was with other Interahamwe, one of whom was called Gisenyi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just like the area, Gisenyi? 
@WITNESS AWN:
It is true that there was a préfecture with the same name, but we often called that person Gisenyi. I don't know whether it was his real name, or whether it was an alias. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the spelling was the same, yes? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how did the conseiller receive you when she returned? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
When the conseiller came there, I did not go to see her because of the Interahamwe. But her younger sister told her that there was a child from the home of someone -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- and which the witness mentioned.
@WITNESS AWN:
And so the conseiller asked that I come and see her. So I told her that I wanted to hide at her home because my father and brothers had just been killed. The conseiller denied my request, saying that one could not go and hide at her place to escape death. That even if she wanted, she could kill me. So she asked me to leave because her home could not be a hiding place. Her younger sister insisted. I think that they had other reasons. Subsequently, the conseiller accepted that I stay there because she remembered that she used to drink beer with my mother. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the English booth, the witness mentioned the name of someone who may have been one of the parents, and the English interpreter didn't mention it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, you have now on two occasions referred to family members. We are in open session and you must not do that, please. So it was picked up by the English translation, preventing that the name came out. But in the French version we will place the reference under 11:48:08 under seal. 
Video booth, please do not transmit this. 
Next question, please. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said you think they had other reasons. What do you mean by that? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I think that the reason why her younger sister was insisting that I stay there was because subsequently ********************************************************************************************************. And since ******************************************************************************************************************* in that duty. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
As far as you are aware, did the conseiller know what ethnic origin you had? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I think she knew, because I told her I was not a Tutsi. I insisted in saying that I was a Hutu when I was begging her to accommodate me at her place. But she called her daughter and asked the policemen and the Interahamwe why they had killed someone who was of the same ethnicity as them. But she continued, rather, by saying that there was no similarity between my physical features and those of her daughter. So I answered her that I had always thought I was a Hutu. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
For how long did you stay at the house of the conseiller? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I think I spent about one month there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Besides yourself and the conseiller, how many other people were staying at that house during that time? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Do you mean at the conseiller's own residence? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. 
@WITNESS AWN: 
About eight people had come to seek refuge there. I was there with Kayitesi, the two sons of Ibambasi, Etienne, his wife and children. So there were eight people who had come to seek refuge there. But there were lots of other Interahamwe there, I can't know the numbers. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what about the conseiller, did she live alone or with family members or anyone else? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Her brother and younger sister, as well as the children of the conseiller. There were also the children of the conseiller's younger sister. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall the name of the conseiller's brother? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
The conseiller's brother's name was Munanira. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
That's number 158, Your Honour. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, generally, during the period of about a month that you stayed at that house, what happened there? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
During the time when I was at the conseiller's place, the conseiller and the Interahamwe would get up in the morning, go out, and then would come back later. ***************************************. All of the activities hinged on massacre operations. They would go out, kill, then come back. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how do you know that when they went out, they would kill? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I got to learn of it because on one occasion the conseiller came when we were busy **********************, and the conseiller said that one André Kameya, who was a journalist at Kinyamateka, had been flushed out after a long period when he was being hunted down. So he was flushed out from the Kinyamateka premises. And the conseiller narrated how he had been executed. And judging from the tone of her voice, the Interahamwe were actually pleased with the way they had conducted that operation. Because they first tortured the victim by cutting off some of his limbs. So I realised that whenever they went out, it was to go and kill. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, why was it you left the house after about a month? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
There was a problem at the conseiller's. You see, that conseiller sold beer at her home. And a bottle of beer cost 800 francs, but her younger sister sold a bottle of beer for 1,000 francs and she used the extra money to buy beer for herself. When the conseiller returned, I think she carried out a control, and she learned that her younger sister had asked the clients to pay more. So she started remonstrating. And her younger sister said that it was because there were many Tutsi at her residence she had been confused. So the conseiller decided to drive ****************** away from her home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And where did you go when you left? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
The conseiller told us to leave very early in the morning before the killings were to start, and I thought I could not walk up to our home because it was a long distance and the road had a number of roadblocks. So I begged the conseiller's brother to accompany me. He said he could not escort me during the day, that I had to wait until the evening when he would be able to escort me right up to my home. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did that happen? Or did something else happen? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
So he made that offer, and actually took me, rather, to his home. But in the evening, instead of taking me back to my home, he wanted to rape me. So I begged him and told him that I was in my period, but that afterwards I will be amenable to his overtures. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what happened after that? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I lied to him, saying that I had my period, and he understood what I said and took me home. And when we got there, I found an Interahamwe called Matata who was there, so I felt I was in security. Matata said he heard that I was in a conseiller's house with my elder sister. The Interahamwe promised that nothing was going to happen, and that anyone who will attack us will have to deal with he himself first. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Matata is number 132 on the list. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you explain why the presence of this Interahamwe called Matata meant you felt secure? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I felt safe because Matata was an Interahamwe. He was a strong person, and he was carrying a weapon. He had a firearm and grenades, and he was a family friend. So when he told me that, I felt safe. I was reassured. His parents were my parents' friends, so I had confidence in him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you say that your older sister was also at your home with Matata, or have I misunderstood your evidence? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes. When I got to the house, Matata had already found my elder sister and brought her home. I don't know where he found her. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, with Matata at your house, were you safe? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
We did not have any problem in relation to the previous situation. But when I told the person who saved -- Munanira to come and see me after my period, he actually came. But he came when Matata was not there, and I could not resist him. A child saw the event -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And witness has given her name. 
@WITNESS AWN:
-- and he said so-and-so has been abducted. So Matata came and followed us all the way to the Sainte Famille. So he took me by one hand, and Matata took me by the other hand. Matata was telling me to go back home; Munanira was pulling me the other way. And Matata realised, and it was a difficult situation. So he took a grenade. He removed the safety pin and said that if Munanira refused to leave me, he was going to throw the grenade and we are all going to die. And when Munanira realised that he was going to die, he released me, and Matata took me home. And when we got home, about 15 minutes following our arrival home, the conseiller came aboard a vehicle in the company of policemen, and Interahamwe, including Munanira, and told Matata that the Tutsi girl who is with him should come and see the conseiller in her office. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In which house are we now, Madam Witness? Who is the owner of the house in which we find ourselves just now, according to your testimony? 
@WITNESS AWN:
This happened in our house. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In your family's house? 
@WITNESS AWN:
Yes.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
How long after you returned to your own home from Odette's house was it that this incident you're relating took place? Was it the same day, or some days later, some weeks later, some months later? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
It was a few days later. Munanira had to come to see me after my period, so it was a few days later. Let's say about a week, but I have no clear recollection of that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, after the conseiller arrived at your house, you said that she instructed that you be taken to the secteur office? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
That is what she told Matata. She told him to come to the secteur office together with the Tutsi girl who was with him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you go to the secteur office with Matata, or not? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
We left immediately. The others left with him, and Matata and myself went on foot. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what about Munanira, where was he at this time? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Munanira left, together with the conseiller, aboard a vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How long did it take you to get to the secteur office? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
About five minutes. The secteur office was not far from my parents' house. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you got to the secteur office, what did you find there? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
When I got there, the conseiller and Munanira were already there. I also found there the responsable of our cellule, who is called ***************. Those are the persons that I found there. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
************* is not on the list, but I believe it's *****************. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And when you got to the office, what did you do? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
When we got there, this ********* looked at me in a contemptuous manner and said, "So you -- you are the one who refused to sleep with this man". They had spoken about it, so he made this comment. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was anything else said to you while you were at the secteur office? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
At that point, I saw a vehicle arrive, and there were soldiers and the préfet of Kigali-ville in that vehicle. The préfet was called Tharcisse Renzaho. So I saw this vehicle arrive with the préfet and those soldiers. I thought he came there to see what was happening because there were a lot of people at the secteur office. So he asked what was happening, and I explained to him that I refused to marry somebody. And he said that this is the time to show Tutsi women, and that the Hutus are strong and can do whatever they wanted to do with them. I don't know what he wanted to say. I don't know if he meant that they could rape them. But that is what I heard him say.

$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how far away from you was he when he said that? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
There was a distance of about 3 to 4 metres between us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Had you seen the préfet before that date? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes, I had seen him, I was in primary 4, and there were elections for conseillers, and that was -- it was during those elections that the conseiller, Odette, was elected. There were candidates, Odette and Sebushishi, who were MDR. And, during the campaign, the préfet arrived and people were saying the préfet was here. People went to see him and it was on that occasion that I also saw him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And on the day that you've been telling us about when you saw him at the secteur office, can you describe the man that you saw? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
He was a stocky man who was wearing spectacles and who was bald. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the two candidates during the elections were Odette and Sebushishi, 255. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, I'd -- I'd like you to see if you can identify Renzaho today. Could you please stand up, could you have a look around the courtroom at the various people in it, and could you tell us, do you see Tharcisse Renzaho? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I can see the person I saw on that occasion. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Could you tell us, please, where in the courtroom he is sitting? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
He's sitting in the first row and close to the window. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a positive identification. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you, you may sit down again. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, besides what you have told us he said, did Renzaho say anything else at the secteur office that you heard? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
He made that statement and then he spoke to Nyirabagenzi, but I could not hear their conversation. And after that conversation, he climbed on board his vehicle and left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what happened to you after he left? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
After his departure, Nyirabagenzi first called Munanira -- or, she spoke to Munanira loudly, and said that she was going to do her best to ensure that this Tutsi girl begs him -- for him to have -- to have sex with him. And then, he spoke to -- and then she spoke to Matata and left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And then what did you do after she left? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
After her departure, I left with Matata to the house. I thought there was no further problem and it was all over. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And was it all over? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
That is what I thought, but when we got home, a few days later, Munanira came again. It was in the evening, and he was in the company of another Interahamwe -- or, other Interahamwe called 
Sese Seko and Gisenyi. And they took us away -- my elder sister and myself. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Sese Seko is 257. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where were you and your sister taken to? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
They took us to their headquarters, it was in town. It was close to the SEFA office. I don't know the exact name of the locality. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you spell SEFA for us, please? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
It's an acronym and I don't know the exact name of that building. That is how people used to call 
the -- the place. But that was not the real name of the locality. What I know is that that building is close to Hotel Pan Africa. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Booth, is SEFA spelt S-E-F-A?

Yes, Mr. President.

Thank you.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you got to this house, what happened? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
When we got there, Munanira raped me. He raped me. When we got there, Munanira immediately raped me. And after that, he told his colleagues that previously I had refused to sleep with him, so they could also do whatever they wanted to do with me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we realise that this is very painful and whenever you need a break, a glass of water, a handkerchief, just let us know. 
@WITNESS AWN:
I have all those things, Mr. President - and, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Next question, please. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did the other Interahamwe do anything? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Munanira -- Munanira hurt me because I refused to sleep with him and so he asked them to come -- he told them to come and also have a taste of a Tutsi woman. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And what, if anything, did they do after he said that to them? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
They also raped me. They raped me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now, Madam Witness, you have referred to these other persons, who were they, please? 
@WITNESS AWN:
They were Sese Seko, and another one called Bikomago -- and Gisenyi. Those are the names I remember. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Bikomago is number 17? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about your sister? You said that you were taken together to this place; do you know what happened to her there? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
We were together in the same room -- and when they raped us, we were together. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
For how long did this ordeal last? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
We remained in that place for some days, and then subsequently, they took us home. They would take us home and come back for us at night. But the second or third day, they took us together with our neighbour, called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted from the transcript and kept under separate cover)

Madam Witness, to write that name on a piece of paper, please? 
@WITNESS AWN:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will place that document under seal and enter it as the next Prosecution exhibit. 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:

@MR. PRESIDENT:
The next question, please? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, you were saying that these Interahamwe came back to your house and took you, your sister and your neighbour away. How many times did they happen, do you recall? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
The day they took us together with our neighbour, they did not bring us back home. They kept us at their headquarters. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This person whose name you wrote on a piece of paper, what was the ethnicity of that girl, please? 
@WITNESS AWN:
She was a Tutsi because members of her family had been killed and she had sought refuge with her aunt, who was a neighbour. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
For how long were you kept at those headquarters? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
About one month. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And while you were there, what happened to you? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
They continued raping us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What happened at the end of that month that meant that you no longer were kept at those headquarters? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
The headquarters was continuously shelled, so they moved us from that place -- and they almost stopped the raping. They placed us at the Sainte Famille site and became more occupied in the front. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall in what month it was that you went - or, you were taken to the Sainte Famille site? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I think it was in late June -- towards the end of June. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after moving to Sainte Famille, were you or your sister raped or subjected to sexual violence at all? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
That did not happen again when we'd gone to the Sainte Famille. It was as if they had stopped the raping, because the war had intensified a great deal, and it was said that the Inkotanyi had entered into the city. But another fille -- another girl --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction -- 
@WITNESS AWN:
called Hyacinthe Rwanga and another one called, Nyiratunga, were raped. I saw them when they were being led away by Father Munyeshaka. 
MS. MELLUISH:
That -- that second name is 205. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And how do you know that they were raped? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Oh, sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us also agree on the first name, shall we? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Hyacinthe or Hyacinthe Rwanga is number 245. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now, the question? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How do you know that these two girls were raped? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
The priest who'd come and take them, they would come back later on, and the people who were there discussed it. Those people said that Munyeshyaka was the one raping them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
For how long did you remain at the Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I didn't stay at that site for a long time because the war ended a few days subsequently. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And after the end of the war, what state of health were you in? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
At the end of the war, I did not have any problems, but my mother, who had been made aware that we had been raped, took us to a centre called ARBEF for testing, and we tested positive for HIV -- I and my elder sister -- ARBEF is A-R-B-E-F. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And besides that, were there any other effects on you and your sister of having been raped, as you've described? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I was with child, but I gave a stillbirth. But my sister had a child -- the baby subsequently fell ill. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Finally, Madam Witness, do you recall how old you were in April 1994? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
In April 1994, I was 14, because I was born in ************* of the year 1980. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, I have no further questions for you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you should try to place in time when you saw the préfet making that utterance, which you quoted, in which month did this event take place? 
@WITNESS AWN:
I would say it was in May -- towards late May, because I went to the conseiller's in April, and she drove me out of her home in mid-May. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I'm obliged, Mr. President.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good day, Witness. 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Good day, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, to start our examination, let us try and place in time when you first saw Mr. Renzaho. When you say it was at the time of the elections, in which year would you say did those elections take place? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I no longer remember the year, but I do recall, however, that I was in primary school then. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
If I can give you certain indications, was it one or two years before the war broke out, for instance? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Are you referring to the 1994 war, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness. 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes, let's say, two years before the 1994 war. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. So at that time, you were about 12 years old and you were already interested in politics? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
No, I was not interested in politics because I was still young then, but since the elections were taking place in our school centre, we had gone to see what was going on there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Concerning Mr. Renzaho's arrival in the secteur office, you said he had arrived there in a military vehicle, is that what you said? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Even though that vehicle may not have been a military vehicle, during the war it was usual that vehicles be camouflaged such that they would look like military vehicles. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, actually, if I understand you properly, you cannot remember exactly what type of vehicle he was in when he arrived there. Is that what we should understand, Witness? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Did you say the type of vehicle? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, was it a military or a civilian vehicle? Now, if you cannot remember, then we'll move on. 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I don't know whether it was a military or civilian vehicle, but there were certain features which gave the impression that it was a military vehicle, amongst which were the colours -- they were camouflaged colours. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well. Witness, if I understand your evidence, Mr. Renzaho seemingly intervened to say something because you were still resisting the advances of Munanira, who was the conseiller's brother, would that be the case? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I am not aware of that, I simply saw him arrive there. I do not know whether he had been called because I had refused to sleep with that person -- or whether he was simply passing by. All that I know is that he stopped at the secteur office. I thought it was perhaps he had seen people gathered at the secteur office, but I don't know what was the real reason for his presence there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when in an answer to Prosecution counsel you said Mr. Renzaho had come there seemingly to see what was going on, what did you mean? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
What I meant was that there was a crowd at the secteur office. You certainly understand that whoever realises that there is a crowd at a given place would want to know what is going on. And, in his capacity as the préfet of the préfecture, it was but normal for him to be curious because of the crowding at the secteur office, which secteur he hailed from. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, let me try and read out to you an excerpt of the statement which you gave to officers of the Prosecution on the 20th of October 2004. That is the date of interview, in which statement you signed on the 7th of December 2004. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the witness statement which I just gave the date for, and I am actually looking at the other side of page 4 in the French version, with reference K0339804. It's page 5 of the French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, where do you want to start on that page? There are no paragraphs. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I'm starting with the portion where it says that, on the right side, "Matata and I went to the secteur office where we saw many people." That is a free translation. "Matata and I went to the secteur office where we saw many people." It is about 15 or 20 lines from the bottom. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
It is 17 lines from the bottom, Mr. President. And at the extreme right, he (sic) says: "Matata and I walked to the secteur office" -- in the English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have found it. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let me read that portion out to you and this is what you told the officials of the Prosecution. 
"Matata and I walked to the secteur office where we met so many people. I later realised that the people were gathered there ******************************************************************************
********************************. The truth was I had refused to sleep with him. Odette remarked that Munanira should not worry and that she would make me beg him to sleep with me. It was here that I saw Renzaho, the préfet of Kigali, who I knew before the war." 
I'd like to end there, Witness, for now and put the following question to you: With regard to what you said, did you see Renzaho there when you arrived there -- or, as you stated before this Trial Chamber? Did Renzaho come there when you were there already? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Renzaho came to the secteur office while I was there already. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And what about the rumour that you had refused Mr. Munanira's advances, had that rumour been spreading already? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
The vehicle carrying Munanira, the conseiller, and the other Interahamwe from my place to the -- to the secteur office had already left. And during the war, the Interahamwe were always making noise, saying what was going on and all what they were going to do. Given that when the Interahamwe went back to the secteur office, they already knew that I had turned down Munanira's sexual advances, they made it known to all those who lent them their ears. So, they certainly told the people who were at the secteur office that the Tutsi girl had refused Munanira's sexual advances. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, Witness, it is possible that Mr. Renzaho also heard the rumour and he had gone there to see what was going on? That is the way I understood the answer you gave to Prosecution counsel, correct? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I don't know whether Renzaho was aware of that -- whether he had received information about that. I simply saw him arrive at that place. I do not know whether he knew what was going to happen at the secteur office or otherwise. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us look at the account of the tragic disappearance of your father and brothers. You told this Court that four or five Interahamwe were the co-perpetrators of their murders, correct? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Before taking this issue further, you told the Prosecutor that you had two brothers. Were those two brothers of yours murdered on the same day or was it only one of them -- and, if that is the case, what happened to the other brother? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Only one of my brothers was killed that day, but the second one survived and he is still alive. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. Witness, if Munanira needed only four Interahamwe to help him murder your brother and father, do you think that in order for him to rape you, it was necessary for him to seek the interventions of other people than the assistance of his friends? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
It was not Munanira who killed my family members, rather, it was the Interahamwe called Kabiyona, who came with the other Interahamwe to kill my family members. The episode concerning Munanira started when I arrived at the conseiller's home. Munanira was not present when my father and brother were killed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for that correction. Actually, my question to you, Witness, was whether it sufficed for four or five Interahamwe to come to your home and murder your relatives, do you think that for Munanira to rape you, he needed the intervention of his sister, the conseiller, as well as the préfet? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
It was not necessary for him to be aided by those two people, but since I had turned down his advances and I felt safe with Matata -- if, actually, I had accepted his advances before then, I don't think all what happened would have happened. Rather, I think that Munanira went and told his sister and the other people that Matata had been protecting certain Tutsi. That is what complicated things and that was the reason why we were summoned to the secteur office. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And when you saw Mr. Renzaho come to the secteur office on that day, do you remember exactly the people accompanying him? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I noticed that the people accompanying him were in military attire and were carrying firearms. I don't know whether they were bona fide soldiers or otherwise. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And, Witness, when you say that some days later on, Munanira came back to look for you, as far as you remember, how many days elapsed between the time when Mr. Renzaho came to the secteur office and the day when Munanira came back for you? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
You want me to give you the number of days between the two dates? I would say it was a time span of about two weeks. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And that two-week period, Witness, when would you place it? In May or in June? Because we are not quite able to understand the exact sequencing in the dates which you've been giving us, Witness. 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I'm unable to give you specific dates, sir, but if I take as a point of reference the date when my family members were killed and my departure from the conseiller's home, I believe I left the conseiller's place in mid-May, and I think Munanira came to look for me at home, perhaps one week afterwards. It may have been in the month of June, but, you know, all those things happened a long time ago. It is impossible for me to remember with text-book precision all those things, and one does not like to reminisce about all those things. Honestly, I'm unable to give you a specific date. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I understand you perfectly, Witness, but when in your statement you said as follows -- 
@MR. NEKUIE:
And, Mr. President, Your Honours, I am still referring to the same page, towards the end, and I'm going to quote what the witness said. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q. 	"One month after this incident, towards the end of May 1994, Munanira and an Interahamwe named Bikomago came to our house." And I'll end the quotation here. When you mentioned the period "one month", were you mistaken, Witness? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I don't quite understand what your problem is. You said I was mistaken when I said they came to our home around end of May? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is not what I said, Witness. I'm simply refreshing your recollection of what you said. You said it was one month after the incident. So when you say, "One month after the incident" then you cannot remember the time which elapsed between Renzaho's arrival and Munanira's arrival at your home? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
My statement was recorded in 2004; that war had taken place in 1994, so there was a 10-year period between those two dates. I could be mistaken, but I must admit that right up until this point, I don't quite understand your question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I just want us to have a clear idea of specific dates. But since you don't understand, then I'm going to note your hypothesis that it was at the end of May that Munanira came to your home and you told the Court that they held you for about three weeks, correct? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And at the end of the three weeks, they took you to the Sainte Famille parish, correct? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes, when we left their headquarters, after three weeks, we were moved to the Sainte Famille site. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So you arrived there practically towards the end of the month of June, is that the way I should construe your evidence? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Are you referring to the Sainte Famille church? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Absolutely, Witness. 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes, you're right, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And Witness, it was at your arrival that you saw that Hyacinthe and the two others were being constantly taken away about Father Munyeshyaka? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you certain that at your arrival, which -- would you say, was in end of June 1994, you actually saw Hyacinthe and the other girl, whose name you gave, and who were being constantly taken away by Father Munyeshyaka? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
Yes, I'm certain of that because I personally saw him come for those two young girls. It's possible that the date -- or, the month which I gave were not correct. But personally, I saw Munyeshyaka come for those two girls -- but as I just said, it's possible that I was mistaken regarding the month. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, should I move on or allow the Honourable Bench to adjourn? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It depends on your estimate on how much is left. If it rather brief, then we would prefer to finish the testimony. If it is not brief, then we have to adjourn. What is your assessment of the situation? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I have just a few questions for the, Witness, actually, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I'm really sorry that I have to put questions to you without having a clear idea of the dates when you say you experienced those painful events. But, I'll just have to move on by putting the following question to you. Apart from the fact that you saw Hyacinthe and the other girl being constantly taken away by Father Munyeshyaka, what other memorable events did you witness at the Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I stayed at the Sainte Famille parish site for a short time and I did not see anything unusual -- apart from the fact that I saw the Interahamwe, who came there to abduct people. Otherwise, there's nothing else which I noticed. But on one occasion, I saw UNAMIR troops who came there looking for refugees, but they were refused access into the premises. I remember that when the war ended, I had just spent a few days at the Sainte Famille church site. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And was it while you were at that site that you witnessed the end of the war -- or, were you at some point in time evacuated from that site? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I was at the Sainte Famille church site when the war ended. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, if I put it to you that you could not have seen Hyacinthe when you arrived at that site, because she had already been killed a long time before your arrival, what would you say? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I would challenge your assertion because I saw her. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And, Witness, if I put it to you that you also could not have seen Mr. Renzaho in the secteur office, because it was not necessary for him to intervene -- for Munanira to have his way with you, what would you say to that? 
@WITNESS AWN: 
I did not assert that the préfet had come to the secteur office to allow -- or to assist Munanira to have his way with me. The préfet was passing by. I don't know whether he had -- he was passing by and he had stopped there because of the crowding or because of the incident. Neither do I assert that he had come there to assist Munanira in any way for him to have his way with me. I simply saw the préfet there. And, Munanira, the conseiller, and the Interahamwe were strong enough to do whatever they wanted to with me. It was not necessary for the préfet to personally come down to that place. On that occasion, the préfet arrived there and he asked what had happened. Then, he made the utterances which I narrated here. I cannot assert that that was the purpose of his trip to that place, but I simply noticed what I noticed and I heard what he said. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Ultimate question, which can help shed light: Can you tell us what is the meaning of AVEGA? A-V-E-G-A. 
@WITNESS AWN: 
AVEGA means association of widows of the genocide, I am not certain -- I think it means association of widows for the genocide -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is the end of the Defence cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Re-examination? 
MS. MELLUISH:
No, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the end of your testimony, Madam Witness. Thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify. We wish you a very safe journey home. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you. 
@WITNESS AWN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will continue at 2:45, and the pseudonym of the next witness is? 
@MR. MOSES:
UI, Your Honours. Perhaps, if I could at this stage, also indicate on Friday we realised that UI had testified under a different pseudonym. On Friday, we gave the transcripts of his testimony to the Defence. I understand it's not -- I understand it's not causing any difficulty, but my friend might wish to indicate otherwise. We filed them officially today, but as they're probably not on your folders, I have French and English copies for Your Honours, if there's going to be any use or reference made of it during the course of the cross-examination. 
I can indicate that the testimony is likely to take perhaps one and a half to two hours. So that if -- if there was any matters that were wanting -- my friend was wanting to raise regarding that testimony, which he feels there's been any problems, then perhaps we could leave it till the morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the following witness will be, after UI? 
@MR. MOSES:
AWO. Can I also perhaps at this stage, make a comment regarding the last three witnesses. 
Your Honours, all three are due to arrive this afternoon in Arusha. All three are -- amongst other testimony -- are all rape victims. All three need to be prepared for their testimony, and it's obviously more sensitive perhaps than some other witnesses. We've arranged matters so that Ms. Melluish is, in fact, going to lead the evidence of the three women who will be testifying. She'll be able to see two of them this evening. She's indicated to -- prepare -- prepare them. It may be at the end of those two testimonies, if there is -- has not been an opportunity, perhaps tomorrow morning for her to see the third witness, that we may request a -- perhaps a longer lunch break than necessary for her to be able 
to -- to see and prepare that -- the last of the witnesses. 
So, can I just alert Your Honours to that? That it -- it may be that we don't need any such adjournment, but can I put you on notice that there could be circumstances arising for that application. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Any comments by the Defence at this stage? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President, no comment. Indeed, my learned friend on Friday afternoon handed the transcripts of a trial where that witness testified. It's quite bulky, but I availed myself over the weekend to peruse through the literature, so I don't need an extension of the time frames. I think the reading so far is quite convenient, and I don't have any problems. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that remark. 
We will then resume at 2:45, but you had an additional issue, Maître Nekuie. Was that linked to the document you used during cross-examination? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That's right, Mr. President, which I would like to tender. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And we'll do that immediately after the break. Thank you. 
The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1314H to 1450H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS UI:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will just tender an exhibit and then we will start with your testimony. 
You wanted to tender the interview dated 20th of October 2004, is that so? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The French version being B, the A version, being the English as it has been signed, under seal. Mr. Matemanga, number? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 26. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 26A and D. 26B admitted, under seal)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you will be referred to as Witness AWN in these proceedings -- 
@MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour, he's under a different pseudonym. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will not be referred to as Witness AWN in these proceedings, Mr. Witness, you will be referred to as Witness UI in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness UI in Kinyarwanda)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document there with your signature, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS UI:
I do have the document before me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this means that the information contained in that document is correct, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS UI:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 86. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 86 admitted, under seal)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Open or closed? 
@MR. MOSES:
To commence in open -- and then we'll go into closed a later bit later, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do. 
@MR. MOSES:
Sorry, has the witness been sworn in? Oh, he was. I'm sorry, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I just took the wrong document for UI and let's hope this will not continue. 
@MR. MOSES:
I certainly hope so. 
$WITNESS UI,
first having been sworn,
testified as follows:

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, please, without telling us where you were living, can you please tell the Trial Chamber where you were on the morning of the 7th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Thank you. In the morning of the 7th of April 1994, I was at the JOC in Kigali. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, the JOC that you are talking about, what institutions is that close to? Is it near any buildings or other institutions? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, the JOC was not far from a centre called CELA. And, besides, JOC was not that far from the Sainte Famille church either, as well as from the Saint Paul centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, on the 7th of April, did anything unusual happen whilst you were at the JOC? 
@WITNESS UI: 
On the 7th of April 1994, there was something that happened. We heard gunshots not far from the place where we were. I went out to see what was happening and I noted that a young woman had been injured. She was the one who told us about the event that had taken place. So there was an incident that occurred on that date. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what did this young girl tell you? 
@WITNESS UI: 
The young girl told us that the soldiers had arrived and had entered their home and had forced the young women to come out. The soldiers set the young Tutsi girls aside -- on one side and the Hutu girls on another side, and subsequently, the soldiers shot the group of young Tutsi girls -- I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Where had these girls been prior -- do you know -- prior to the soldiers arriving? 
@WITNESS UI: 
The young girls also lived at the JOC, there was a home in which the young girls lived. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you say you saw a young girl who had been injured, did you see any evidence of young girls having been shot? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, there was evidence because there were the -- there were bodies of some of the victims. I do not know who had covered the bodies with blankets, and the one I told you about was injured and was bleeding. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What, if anything, was done with the bodies of those girls who had been covered with blankets? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Subsequently, the people who had been hiding at the CELA centre buried some of the dead bodies. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you know where these girls were buried? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, I know more or less where the bodies were buried. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And where were they buried? 
@WITNESS UI: 
At the CELA centre. If you go past the two blocks of buildings, further down, there was a garden which was divided into two parts: One part with a banana plantation and the other one with just grass, and it is on that side, the grass side, that the bodies were buried. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, now -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know approximately how many Tutsis girls that were killed? 
@WITNESS UI:
I do not know how many were killed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Five, 15, 50, just an estimate? 
@WITNESS UI:
Well, there were less than five young girls. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Less than five? 
@WITNESS UI:
That is correct. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Approximately what time of day on the 7th was it that it occurred? 
@WITNESS UI: 
It was during the morning before 10 a.m., let us say between 9 and 9:30. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, as a result of seeing these bodies, did you personally do anything? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Personally, I took time to think and I realised that I was not safe. Other persons in my -- and myself, decided to go and take refuge at the CELA centre. That is what I did. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Why did you go to the CELA centre? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I decided to go to the CELA centre, because it was a religious centre and we thought we'll be safer there than elsewhere. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you say it was a religious centre, do you know who was in charge of it? 
@WITNESS UI: 
That centre belonged to a congregation of white priests, and the one leading -- directing the centre was called Jacques Vleugls -- Jeff Vleugls. 
@MR. MOSES:
It's number 281 on the latest revised list, sir. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you know Father Vleugls? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I knew him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How did you know him? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I used to attend mass in that centre. He's one of the priests who say mass there, that is how I came to know him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you know the names of any of the other White Fathers who were there? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I knew some -- such as, Ireneé, Jacob. There were about four priests in that centre. 
@MR. MOSES:
Ireneé-- Jacob Ireneé is not on the list, Your Honour, but I understand the spelling is I-R-E-N -- and acute È, N-È (sic) -- acute É.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the entire name or -- 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, Jacob -- it was Ireneé Jacob was the way in which it was -- it came across. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you now trying to convey both a surname and a first name, will you help us with both, please? 
@MR. MOSES:
The first name is Jacob, J-A-C-O-B, and the surname is Ireneé. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
These persons you have just referred to, Mr. Witness, do you know whether they had any particular nationality? 
@WITNESS UI:
That person is Canadian. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Both of them or the last one? 
@WITNESS UI:
The last person whose name I mentioned is a Canadian. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
What about Father Vleugls, do you know what nationality he is -- or was? 
@WITNESS UI: 
He's Belgian. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, when you arrived at the CELA centre, apart from the white priests, were there any other people who were there? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I met several persons who had come to seek refuge -- and these are people who lived in the CELA neighbourhood and the JOC neighbourhood. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And approximately how many people were there when you first arrived? 
@WITNESS UI: 
It is difficult for me to make an estimate, but obviously there were more than 200 persons. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And were those all one sex or were they both men and women? And, in terms of the ages, were they all -- well, what age range were they? 
@WITNESS UI: 
It was a mix of persons -- men, women, children, a bit of everything, a mixed group. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did that group all remain at CELA? 
@WITNESS UI: 
After some time, the priests decided that the women and children should be transferred to Saint Paul, and only the men remain at the CELA centre -- about a hundred of them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, when you say "after some time", can you give us indication of whether it was on the 7th, a day later, a week later? 
@WITNESS UI: 
It was on the 7th, two or three hours after my arrival. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And after the women and children left on the afternoon of the 7th, did any more people arrive at CELA during your stay there? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, people continued arriving, and I left the CELA centre when there were about 500 people there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, did the White Fathers remain living with you all the time you were at CELA? 
@WITNESS UI: 
The White Fathers continued living at the CELA centre with us and they were evacuated around the 12th, and it was Caucasian troops or soldiers who came to evacuate them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And were you still at CELA when the White Fathers were evacuated? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I was still at the CELA centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And was Father Vleugls one of those who left on that date? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, he was also evacuated on that date. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And when he left, did he do or say anything to you? 
@WITNESS UI: 
At the time he was being evacuated, he, first of all, informed me that he was leaving, and then he handed me the bunch of keys which he had, telling me that we might need them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know why he gave the keys to you? 
@WITNESS UI: 
There were two of us when he gave me the keys, I don't know why he chose me. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And after he left on that date to be evacuated, did you ever hear from him? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, when he got to his country, he called me on the phone because among -- in the bunch of keys that he gave me, there was one that could open a room in which there was a telephone, so I was able to talk to him on the phone. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what, if anything, did he say to you when he spoke to you? 
@WITNESS UI: 
He asked me about the situation prevailing in the centre and I gave him an account of the situation. He then asked me to move documents from his vehicle and keep them in his room. And he indicated where 600,000 Rwandan francs were -- where he kept 600,000 francs, and told me that we might need them (sic) to buy foodstuffs. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you give us an indication, if you can remember, how long it was after he had left or been evacuated that he called you at CELA? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I believe he called me the day after the evacuation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And as a result of him telling you about this money, did you subsequently do anything about that? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I took 200,000 francs out of the 600,000 -- that is, the money that we found in a box at a place he indicated. I just took 200,000 francs out of the 600,000.

$BY MR. MOSES 
@MR. MOSES: 
Which room was this? Do you remember? 
@WITNESS UI: 
The money was in Father Vleugls' room. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you say he handed you some keys, did you use any of those keys to open any of the rooms in the CELA centre? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, I used those keys. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you see or find anything that you thought might be of use to you as he asked you to use the keys? 
@WITNESS UI: 
For example, we observed that there was a telephone in their sitting room which enabled us to contact the outside world. In his room, there was a bed, a small desk, a fax machine, a photocopying machine. We also discovered a small store room in which there were one or many firearms. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you say 'one or many firearms', do you know how many firearms you found? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Three guns. And among the three -- among the three firearms, there were three rifles and one pistol -- sorry, two rifles and one pistol. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know what sort of rifles they were? 
@WITNESS UI: 
These were firearms that looked like hunting guns. That is the type of guns people used when they go to hunt in the forest. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Was there any ammunition for those hunting guns? 
@WITNESS UI: 
No. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you've said there was another pistol; is that correct? 
@WITNESS UI: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And was there any ammunition with the pistol? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, there were bullets in the pistol. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know who these guns belonged to? 
@WITNESS UI: 
It was obvious that they belonged to the white priest. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Why do you say that? 
@WITNESS UI: 
First of all, the weapons were in the house, and then there were permits for carrying weapons next to the weapons. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you do anything with the guns you've described as hunting rifles? Did you do anything with it? 
@WITNESS UI: 
No. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what about the pistol? 
@WITNESS UI: 
To tell the truth, we did nothing with that pistol, but I can tell you that I moved it from where it was and I took it with me. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you say, "to tell you the truth, I did nothing with the pistol", was the pistol ever fired during the time you were at CELA centre? 
@WITNESS UI: 
No, no one fired a shot with that pistol. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now after the white fathers had left CELA, did any -- were there any priest who came over at CELA? 
@WITNESS UI: 
After the departure of the white Fathers, Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka came to the centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Who was he? 
@WITNESS UI: 
He was a priest from the Saint Famille Parish, a priest, who looked young. He was a very emblematic personality of the parish before the authorities and the other persons. That is what I can say about this priest. He came to the centre on three occasions. And during the war, he used to move around with the Interahamwe. We used to see him often with the Interahamwe.
@MR. MOSES: 
Had you ever seen him prior to the 6th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, I used to see him because I used to go to -- I used to attend mass at the Saint Famille (inaudible), so I used to see him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you said you saw him on three occasions. Can you describe the circumstances of the first visit - or, first occasion that you saw Wenceslas? 
@WITNESS UI: 
On the first occasion, I did not see him because he came at night. He came through an opening or a back door and those who were at that place did not allow him entry into the centre. He was in the company of three persons. But I did not see him, I only heard his voice. They prevented him from entering the centre because it was at night. So on that occasion he was unable to enter the centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Was this before or after the white priest had left? 
@WITNESS UI: 
It was after the departure of the white priest. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What about the second occasion, did you see him that time? 
@WITNESS UI: 
On the second occasion, I saw him. He came through the same opening, but on this occasion during the day. So he was allowed in. He moved towards where we were standing. He asked for my name. It was obvious that he did not know me. We told him. He was not present in the centre and I saw him on that occasion. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Was he alone on that occasion or with other people - persons or other people? 
@WITNESS UI: 
He was not alone; he was in the company of another person. It was, subsequently, that we got to know the person who was with him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When was it that you subsequently got to know the other person? 
@WITNESS UI: 
We saw the same person when the attack that got people out of the CELA centre took place, and that confirmed to us that he was an Interahamwe because on that occasion, the person in question was carrying a weapon. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the third occasion that you saw Wenceslas, what happened, if anything, on that occasion? 
@WITNESS UI: 
On the third occasion, Wenceslas came during the day. He entered the centre. He asked me to open the Father's room for him saying that he had a discussion with Vleugls, who told him to take the money and the priest's vehicle documents. I opened the door in the company of one Gisagara. We opened the rooms for which we had the keys. We realised that Father Wenceslas did not have a lot of information, for example, he could not locate where the money was, whereas the money was in the same place. He was not able to -- he couldn't find the keys of the vehicle. We realised he was just inspecting -- looking around. And he said he was going to take the photocopying machine and the fax machine.
@MR. MOSES: 
There has been reference, I think, to Gisagara, and that is number 70. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you say number 17? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, 70, seven, zero. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES: 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, apart from the pistol that you told us about having located, were any other persons at the CELA centre armed, specifically with any firearms? 
@WITNESS UI: 
No one else had firearms at the CELA centre. There were stones, sharpened sticks and a bow. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, earlier in your testimony you said that there were around 500 people, I think, at the time you left. Is there any reason as to why you would know how many people there were at the CELA centre at that time? 
@WITNESS UI: 
There is a reason which enabled me to know that number. We organised ourselves and recorded the names of the persons who were at the centre and those who were coming. So we knew the number of persons. I had a list -- with the list of persons who were at the centre before we left that place. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Why did you make that list? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Among the refugees in the CELA, there was one person who worked with the human rights organisation and he was the one who advised that we make the list of those who were staying there and that was what we did. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now how -- when did you leave the CELA centre? Do you remember the approximate date? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I believe I left CELA around the 20th. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And on that date, what -- did anything special or unusual happen? 
@WITNESS UI: 
On that date, there was an important attack that was launched against the centre, and amongst the group of attackers, there were soldiers, Interahamwe, as well as many inhabitants. There were more than 600 attackers and I believe that it was on that day that the préfet of PVK came to the centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, we will come to that. What was the first indication that you learnt that there was a problem at CELA that day? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I was in the living room of the fathers, and if my memory serves me well, I had gone to pick up the telephone and somebody came to tell me that an attack had just been launched against the centre, an important attack. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And when you received that information, what, if anything, did you do? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I asked some questions to those who had just informed me in order to see whether we could try to prevent this attack, but it was not possible because there were many more attackers compared to us. I threw the weapon I had in the room and I looked for a place of hiding and I went to hide in the chapel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you remain -- stay hiding in the chapel for very long? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I did not stay in the chapel for very long. After a while, my name was being called throughout the centre and I had to go out of the chapel to see who was calling me. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you find out who it was -- who was calling your name? 
@WITNESS UI: 
The person who came to see me told me that Préfet Renzaho was the one looking for me and when I came out I noticed that it was, indeed, him. He did not introduce himself. I already knew. I had already seen him during meetings or on television.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And what is the date now, Mr. Witness?
@WITNESS UI: 
Unless I am mistaken, I believe it was on the 22nd, but I am not quite sure about the date. It was during the period from the 20th to the 22nd. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And will you state the month for the record as well?
@WITNESS UI: 
It was during the month of April. 
$BY MR. MOSES: 
@MR. MOSES: 
Approximately what time of day was it? 
@WITNESS UI: 
It was before noon, around 11:00. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you say you went -- and you went out and saw Renzaho, where were you when you actually saw the préfet? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I went to join him where he was standing and he was at the main entrance of CELA. That is where he was in the company of other people. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did he say anything to you? 
@WITNESS UI: 
He asked me to introduce myself and he asked me why I was in that centre, and also asked what relationship I had with the priest. I answered him and he also asked me why we were hiding the Inyenzi/Inkotanyi in the centre, and I told him that that was not true. In fact, he asked me to explain to him why the people who were at the centre had fled their homes. In the meantime, there were Interahamwe shouting and pushing me around and saying that I was lying. I tried to tell the truth to him, and I even gave him the list of refugees who were at the centre, and I explained to him that all the refugees were inhabitants of the neighbourhoods. And I also told him that these people had identity cards that we had seen -- the IDs. So that was the conversation I had with Mr. Renzaho. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You have said that there were people you described as Interahamwe, who were pushing you around and saying things. Did the préfet say or do anything in respect of the Interahamwe who were present? 
@WITNESS UI: 
When I arrived, the préfet was telling them not to attack the refugees immediately. And I remember that he told them not to help the enemy. He was telling them that everything that was being done was being observed by the satellites and that as a consequence had to act in an intelligent manner. He gave instructions to them and he told them to choose amongst the refugees the ring leaders. That was the word he used. And he said that the ring leaders were to be taken to the Muhima Brigade and be tried before a military court. But, in fact, he was not doing that because he wished to save those who were staying at the centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
After you had -- I am sorry, you mentioned giving a list to Renzaho. Do you know what he did with that list? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I do not know if he could give the list back to me. I would be quite happy. I do not know what he did with the list I gave him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, after you had finished this conversation with the préfet, what happened to you? 
@WITNESS UI: 
He handed me over to a soldier who was there and asked him to take me further down, and the soldier told me that they had heard that we had dug trenches in the centre, and that he would check and if that were true, he would kill me immediately. It was in the back courtyard of CELA next to the fence. We went there; he did not find the trenches, and we came back together. And we went next to another block of buildings and we found there people who had been asked to kneel. That soldier did not seem a very -- evil to me, except for what he said. That is to say that he would kill me. I tried to bribe him, if I may say so, and I told him that if he could save me I would give him money. A few minutes later, he asked me to stand up and we left using the same path. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I just want to take you back briefly. You said that you left the position with a soldier, the position where you had met Renzaho. Was he the only soldier you saw there? 
@WITNESS UI: 
There were other soldiers. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you've described how this soldier took you down behind CELA to look for trenches. Now, approximately, how long did that take for the soldier to look around the rear of CELA with you? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I would say around 15 minutes. I did not look at my watch, but I believe it was around 15 minutes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now you told us also that after that, you came and you saw some people who were kneeling. Now, approximately, can you remember how many people were there at that time? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Around 20 people. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what if anything did the soldier make you do when you arrived and saw that group of around 
20 people kneeling? 
@WITNESS UI: 
He also asked me to kneel with the others, and that is what I did. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, approximately, how long were you kneeling there for at that time? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I did not stay there for long. I would say around three to five minutes. And, subsequently, the soldier called me back. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And during those three to five minutes, did the number of people who were kneeling at the rear remain the same? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Other people joined that group of people who were kneeling. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you know where they were being -- where those persons came from? 
@WITNESS UI: 
At CELA, there are different buildings and people had been grouped next to the blocks of buildings. And those who were asked to kneel were selected among those refugees. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Could you see that large -- well, that other group of refugees from where you were kneeling? 
@WITNESS UI: 
No. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you have told us that from your knowledge, you thought that there were around 500 refugees at CELA at that time. At the time that you were kneeling at the rear there, were other persons inside the CELA compound apart from refugees? 
@WITNESS UI: 
There were also attackers; those who had launched the attack. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you able to give any indication as to the number of attackers who were inside the CELA grounds using perhaps the number of refugees as some sort of reference? Were there more attackers inside CELA or less? 
@WITNESS UI: 
There were more assailants than there were refugees. I would say that there were more than 600 attackers. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now you told us earlier that it was -- you were kneeling for about three to five minutes before the soldier called you. What, if anything, did he say to you? 
@WITNESS UI: 
He did not say anything to me on the spot. He told me, "walk", and we left, and he asked me where he could take me, and I told him to take me to the Saint Paul centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you get to the Saint Paul centre? 
@WITNESS UI: 
We were not able to reach the Saint Paul centre because at a distance of around 50 metres from CELA on the tarred road, we met a group of women among which was Rose Lwanga, and I asked them where they were heading, and they told me that they had been ordered to go back home, and I told them not to go back home because it was a lie. And, I believe, the other attackers noticed that I was with that soldier, so they called us and I was asked to go -- or, rather, I was asked to join the group of refugees. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you met Mr. Renzaho -- or, at least you first saw him at 11 o' clock, on probably the 
22nd of April. Is that the evidence?
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then you had a conversation with him, and you have given us a summary of that conversation. Then you left and, at some stage, looked at the trenches and then we had the kneeling, and then you left and met the group of women. What time is it when you were meeting the group of women, approximately? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Mr. President, I would be hard pressed to give you an exact time, but I would say that it was around 
30 minutes subsequently. So I would say that I met the ladies around noon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the whole sequence we have just heard you describe actually took place in a limited period of time, within half an hour to an hour. So it is now around noon; is that so? 
@WITNESS UI: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
In your previous answer, you had said that you had asked the women where they were hiding and they told you that they had been ordered to go back home, and I told them not to go back home because it was a lie. Now, can you help the Trial Chamber understand what "was a lie"? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I told them that this was a lie because it was a way of killing them in their own homes. That is what I meant. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Had the women told you why they were going back home? 
@WITNESS UI: 
They told me that they had just been requested to go back home; that there was nothing they should fear, and that the killing should cease. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, you said that you also said later in that answer that you were called and asked to go and join the group of refugees. Do you remember saying that? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I am sorry, Mr. Prosecutor, but I did not quite understand your question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
After you had met the women, what, if anything, did you do? After you had had this conversation, what did you do or where did you go? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I was asked to join the other refugees and I went to join the group of people who were kneeling, so I also knelt. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And who asked you to do that? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I do not know who exactly. Someone called that soldier and asked him where I was going, and it was that same soldier who brought me back towards the group of people who were kneeling. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And on this -- the second occasion, how long did you spend kneeling? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I would say around one hour on the second occasion. I knelt for around one hour. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I think at this stage, can we go into a closed session because there is information which I will now be leading, which, bearing in mind earlier testimonies, I think could lead to the identity of this witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and this is the final portion of the testimony? So we will not go back again. 
@MR. MOSES: 
We can probably come back into open session for a few minutes at the end of the testimony. There is an incident which he is now going to recount. Where he goes after that incident can be done in open session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you find it difficult now to address that open session testimony right away? It's easier for you to follow the chronology? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I think it would be easier for everyone, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. We will then have to move into closed session. For approximately how long? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Perhaps 20 minutes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. If those in the public gallery could kindly leave us for that period, that would be appreciated.

$(Pages 56 to 63 by Sheriffo Jammeh)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So Witness UI, we are now in open session to conclude your examination-in-chief. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, you said -- you've told us that you went to the Saint Paul's centre. Who was in charge of the Saint Paul's centre? 
@WITNESS UI: 
It was Father Jeff Vleugls who was in charge of the centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm talking about the Saint Paul's centre, when you arrived there. 
@WITNESS UI: 
I'm sorry, I made a mistake. It was Father Célestin Hakizimana who was in charge of the Saint Paul centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And how were you treated when you arrived at the Saint Paul's centre? 
@WITNESS UI: 
When I arrived, I was welcomed by Father Célestin who gave me a room and asked me to stay inside the room. In a few words, I was well treated. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And how long did you remain at the Saint Paul's centre for? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I stayed there from April, and up until the 16th or 17th. That is to say, until the 16th of June. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Under what circumstances did you leave Saint Paul's? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I left the centre when the Inkotanyi launched an attack against it and evacuated almost all the people who were at the Saint Paul centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did anything happen to you as you were -- or, as you'd left the Saint Paul's centre on that day? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I can mention one specific incident when we were crossing towards Kacyiru, I was shot in the knee. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you with anyone at the time? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I was with a number of other people. I was holding one of my children in my arms and there were three other people with us. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, you told us earlier that the conseiller of your secteur was a woman, Odette Nyirabagenzi. Did you ever see that person whilst you were at the Saint Paul's centre? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I saw her, but in special circumstances, if I may use that expression. I saw her when I was peeping to look outside. I was looking through curtains of a window. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When was this in relation to the day that you were taken -- or, the day that you left the Saint Paul's centre? 
@WITNESS UI: 
The last time I saw her was on the 14th of June. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what, if anything, was happening on the 14th of June? 
@WITNESS UI: 
That was the day when the young men who were at the Saint Paul centre, some 50-odd young men, were abducted and were led to their death. She was with Interahamwe and had a list in her hands. So that is the specific incident I can mention. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And during that incident where the young men were led to their deaths, were you -- did you stay inside, or did you ever go outside your room? 
@WITNESS UI: 
I stayed in the room. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I think that concludes the evidence-in-chief, if this is an appropriate time. 
There's one administrative matter before we conclude, that -- I've just received a note to say that my learned friend, Ms. Melluish, is in the safe house. AWO needs, or wants -- needs some medical treatment. She may not be able to testify tomorrow, and may -- there may be a need for a change of order. So if I can just place that on record and advise my learned friends that there -- of the three remaining witnesses, it may be that we alter the order in which they testify. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you mentioned originally that AWO would testify before these three, in order to facilitate the task of everyone, these three rape victims. What will be the order of these three? Their pseudonyms, please? 
@MR. MOSES: 
The three pseudonyms are AWO, KBZ, and AWX. Those were -- that was the original order. So if there is a change, I would imagine that the first witness after this witness will be KBZ, followed by perhaps AWX, and then finishing with AWO. Those are the only three witnesses remaining after this one. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, all right. That's noted. 
Mr. Witness, we will start your cross-examination tomorrow morning at 8:45. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. 
The Court is adjourned.

Witness AWO, we are from now on in open session. Please be careful so as not to reveal your identity. The Prosecution will continue its examination-in-chief. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you recall how long after you left the orphanage the first rape occurred? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
It lasted around one month and 24 days. As soon as I left the orphanage, I could no longer move about; there were roadblocks. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How frequently during that time were you raped? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
I cannot tell you on how many occasions I was raped because it would take place every day. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, on a daily basis, can you estimate how many times people would come to your house and rape you? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
They would take turns. I cannot know how many times. At some point I even asked them to kill me, but they refused. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you know why you were the victim of this treatment? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
They often said that they should go and taste what a Tutsi woman tastes like, if you have never had the opportunity to do so. And I believe that was the reason why I was targeted. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And during this time, where was your son? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
My children were quite young. I did not know where they were. Sometimes they were in water tanks, sometimes hiding in trees. I cannot tell you exactly where they were when I would be raped by these people. I saw him in a tree, but I did not know he was there. A bayonet had been put into my stomach, *****************************************************. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When -- when did this happen? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
I was still at my house when this happened, before I went to seek refuge in another location. *********************************************************************************************************************And the Sisters of Charity were the ones who came to my assistance. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you said that you remained at home and you were repeatedly raped for about a month and 24 days, you said. At what stage during that time was this incident with the bayonet? Was it -- for example, was it at the beginning, in the middle, towards the end of that time? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
It was towards the end of that period. I would say that it was after one month and a half. That was when I was taken away with the bayonet in the lower part of my stomach. I asked one of my attackers to kill me and he refused. And he said that he would make sure that no other man would ever sleep with me; and he hit me with the bayonet in my stomach and also on my ankle. And after that he left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Who was this attacker? What type of person was he? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
He was a soldier who had a firearm, on top of which was a bayonet. I had been raped so many times that I could no longer close my legs. And he said, "What we have just done is terrible, and I will make sure that no other man will ever touch you". And that is when he used his bayonet. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Was there anybody else around at that time? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
People would always talk about me when they were passing by and saying -- talking about the fate I was handed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about your son? Do you know where he was? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
He was a very boisterous boy and he was often in the trees. I only noted that he was there when he started throwing stones at the dogs **************************************. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have heard quite some evidence now, and I understand we are approaching when the sisters are intervening. Shall we go there? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
We can. Yes, sir. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you explain, Madam Witness, how it was that you left that place? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
I could no longer stand on my feet, so I started crawling. And the sisters who were picking up the dead bodies that were behind their compound heard people saying that there was a woman ***************************************, and that is how they came and took me with them. They washed me and treated me and then they took me to the Sainte Famille church. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you recall for how long you stayed at the Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
When I arrived at the Sainte Famille church, the war was almost over. After a few days the RPF carried out an operation at the Saint Paul centre where it evacuated refugees, and, subsequently to that, we had problems. On that occasion, I saw Renzaho, Angeline, and Nyirabagenzi, as well as the priest. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What do you mean by "We had some problems"? Can you expand on that, please? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Many people were killed at that location. There were evacuations towards the RPF-controlled areas or the government-controlled areas, and the young men were targeted throughout the period of the evacuations in order to prevent them from going to RPF-controlled areas. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
At what time of day was the RPF operation at Saint Paul when it evacuated refugees, do you remember? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
We were at the Sainte Famille church, but the operation at Saint Paul took place during the night. And the following morning, we heard that the evacuation of refugees from Saint Paul had taken place. The next morning around 11, Angeline, Nyirabagenzi, Renzaho, and one priest called the young one, and whose name was, in fact, Munyeshyaka, arrived and moved around the Sainte Famille church checking who was there. And, after that, they left. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can you tell us, please, who is Angeline that you refer to? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
She was a teacher and she was the headmistress of Sainte Famille school. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you know why she came to Sainte Famille with those other people who have mentioned? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Angeline used to say that there were Inyenzi at the Sainte Famille church who were causing problems to them. That is what she would tell the préfet of the Kigali town. She would tell him that the Inyenzi were causing problems. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where were you when you saw Renzaho and the others you have mentioned at Sainte Famille church, where in the complex of Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
I was inside the church. Some people would help me to walk and sometimes I could go outside. And this is how I saw them moving around the place. Subsequently, Munyeshyaka told us to prepare our hearts because the time had come and that we should sanctify ourselves. After that he said Mass and he left. Around 11, a great number of attackers arrived. They were Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
To you, what did Munyeshyaka mean when he said, "the time had come and you must sanctify yourselves"? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
He was, in fact, telling us that we were going to die. He told us that we should prepare our hearts and sanctify ourselves and that our time had come. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When the Interahamwe arrived, what did they do? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
There were a great number of Interahamwe. It was said that some had come from Gikondo, Kacyiru, and Remera. And they killed many people, especially men. There were numerous dead bodies; and the bodies remained there for a number of days. And, subsequently, it was said that they had to be taken away so that the UNAMIR soldiers would not see them. So the dead bodies were taken to a garage in the parish. And this priest who was called the young priest, told us that the dead bodies had to be taken away and that Renzaho would reward those who would do that, and that he would authorise the transfer of those who were going to pick up the bodies to Kabuga. 
Renzaho was in a place that was overlooking the area, and he was telling the Interahamwe to kill -- to kill many people. And he would tell us, the woman, to applaud, because now all the Inyenzi had been exterminated. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After that incident, Madam Witness, how long did you stay at Sainte Famille?
@WITNESS AWO: 
After sometime the Inkotanyi arrived and they took control of the country, and that is how we were able to survive. But before the arrival of Inkotanyi, there were young people hiding in water tanks or in the garden, and, subsequently, some of them were taken away. They would not be killed at the church itself, they would be loaded onto a vehicle and taken elsewhere. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You said that Mr. Renzaho was in an area that was overlooking the place. Did you see him yourself during the attack? 
@WITNESS AWO:
I saw him with my very eyes. We were taken out of the church, telling us to show our identity cards. So we would go out and pray and ask God to come to our assistance. Even if you were to come to the church, I could show you where he was. He was in a location which was overlooking the place. The Interahamwe came down and started killing people. And while the killings were taking place, he himself said, "Stop killing. We have killed all the Inyenzi; and you, the women, you should clap because the Inyenzi have been exterminated". And we did so in order to survive. And I can tell that you more than a hundred people were killed at that location, but there were other people who were killed behind the church, and that I was not able to see. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this attack lasted one day, less, or more? 
@WITNESS AWO:
The attack started at 11, and the attackers killed people, and then they finished their work and the dead bodies remained there. Subsequently, Renzaho and the Interahamwe left very rapidly, and Munyeshyaka asked the people to pick up the dead bodies. The dead bodies were put on a tarpaulin in the garage of the priests. And the UNAMIR -- we were told that the UNAMIR soldiers would come and bring us some biscuits. But there was nothing we could say. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this happened in which month? Can you recall? 
@WITNESS AWO:
It was almost towards the end of the war, perhaps in July, because after a while the Inkotanyi took over. When they killed all these people, the Inkotanyi were already in Gikondo, Rebero and Remera. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After the end of the war, Madam Witness, what state of the health did you find yourself in? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
I have many health problems. I have had problems in my womb because of one of the -- because of the bayonet that was put into my abdomen. I have gone to see a number of doctors, and I was given authorisation to go and get treatment abroad. But the Butare hospital, the CHK, decided that I had to be referred to another hospital abroad in order to receive treatment.
So I have many problems, and I wonder whether you can come to my assistance. I have come with my documents and the doctors' reports. And I have contracted a number of serious diseases. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. I have no further questions for you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we ready to proceed with the following questions right away, Madam Witness? Shall we continue or do you want a little break? 
@WITNESS AWO:
I believe it would be preferable for us to have a short break. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will do that. 
So the Court is adjourned for about 15-20 minutes.
$(Court recessed from 0958H to 1025H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are in open session and you will now be cross-examined by the Defence.

Good morning, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Good morning, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I wish to start my cross-examination by putting questions to the witness on her personal particulars. And, for that reason, I wonder whether we should not sit in closed session for a couple of minutes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. We will do that for a couple of minutes.

$(Pages 11 to 15 by Judith Baverstock)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness AWO, we are now in open session and the Defence cross-examination continues. 
Which part of the witness statement do you want to draw our attention to? In the French version, it's which number, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE:

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, in reference to that meeting, you told the Prosecutor the following: "The following day, Renzaho convened a meeting at Nyirabagenzi, Odette's house, which meeting I attended."
@WITNESS AWO: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) and even when Renzaho did not come, ***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, but I just want to ask you a question following this portion of your statement that I've just read to you. I want to know when you said, "I attended", would that mean that you attended that meeting by force or on your own initiative? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
But, I have already told you ***************************************************************************************. I told you that I was constantly raped by the police, the soldiers and the Interahamwes who lived in Nyirabagenzi's house. They had all the time to do whatever they wished with me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Both the French and English version is neutral as to force here. What is your point now, 
Defence Counsel? There's no contradiction. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
No, Mr. President, I put the question to the witness, she's answered and I'll move on to something else. I was under the impression that when she said, "I attended", it was of her own volition. But she explained that the Interahamwes took her there and I've taken note of that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now there is an observation from the Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, a different matter, at 10:55:32, I wonder if the first phrase there could be extracted. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the first four words in the sentence at 10:55:32, before the words "... and even when Renzaho did not come ..." shall be deleted and placed under seal. 
Thank you very much. 
Please do not transmit that, video booth. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, let's now focus on your stay at the Sainte Famille parish. You stated that when you got there -- or, at least, while you were there, the RPF carried out an operation of evacuation of refugees at the Saint Paul pastoral centre, do you recall that? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you stated that following that, there were several attacks launched by Mr. Renzaho and the persons whose names you mentioned against the Sainte Famille parish, is that correct? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Yes, they killed a lot of Tutsi. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And when the question was put to you exactly when the attack -- during which you heard 
Mr. Renzaho's statement took place, you said it took place in the month of July; do you recall that? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Yes, I recall that, because when the Inkotanyi carried out their raid on the Saint Paul centre, the war was drawing to a close. But I'm not able to give you the date because I was virtually dead, but I'm able to tell you that there were a lot of dead -- and I'm saying this as a person who was present at the site and who witnessed these unfortunate events. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And since you were present at the site, Madam Witness, what did you observe the day after the operation carried out by the RPF at the Saint Paul pastoral centre? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Renzaho first arrived in the company of a teacher called Angeline, as well as Nyirabagenzi and Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka. They went around and they were armed with pistols. They checked the identity of those who were present. After Renzaho's departure, Munyeshyaka conducted Mass, and he asked us to prepare and to sanctify ourselves because our time had come -- and subsequently, there was this attack that led to many casualties. I am not in a position to give you any specific number, but there were many people who were killed on that occasion. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And in the days that followed, Madam Witness, were there other incidents? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
In the days that followed, their bodies were picked up and piled in the garage, and they came back to check. I remember that the UNAMIR soldiers came and gave us biscuits. But at that time, the bodies were in the garage, and subsequently, they came and abducted young men who had been able to hide in water tanks or in the bushes surrounding the area. And, not long after, the RPF took control of the country. There was no fighting; there were no killings after that attack against the Sainte Famille church. But, he is present, he is aware of that -- he was present, he was there. I do not know whether he's not providing any explanations when he was there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, when answering a question put to you by the Prosecutor on your stay in the Sainte Famille parish, you stated that you had continued being raped there repeatedly, despite the fact that you were pregnant. Do you remember having made such a statement? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Yes, I did and it is the truth. I was pregnant, and I was stabbed with a bayonet in my lower abdomen -- I still have the scar, and I can show it to you, if you so wish. And it was at that point that *******************************************************. You do know that those who were killed would remain there. Their dead bodies would remain there and the dogs would feed on them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Madam Witness, my apologies for putting to you such questions, because I understand how difficult this can be for you psychologically. But, unfortunately, such questions are necessary for purposes of clarification. I simply wish to know, Madam Witness, whether you continued being raped during your stay in Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
No, I was filthy -- and there would be flies all over me. I was wounded. I had been stabbed with a bayonet -- I stank, and nobody could come near me. And this soldier who stabbed me with a bayonet, did so saying that he was acting in that way so that no man would ever come close to me again. And I told you that following this stabbing, I have had to suffer serious health consequences. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, while you were at Sainte Famille, you did not note that on the 17th of June, the day after the operation by the RPF, all the refugees were evacuated towards the Mille Collines hotel? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
My God, what are you telling me here? In order to go to the Mille Collines hotel, one had to be a very important person. Even if you had money, you would not be taken there easily. I think you should put questions to those who were there and who know what happened. Who evacuated such refugees? Who could have taken the risk of evacuating anybody and get killed in the process? I never heard such a thing, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So according to you, Witness, apart from those refugees who were killed during the attacks you recounted, all the other refugees remained until the town was freed by the RPF, is that what we are to understand? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
Those who were not killed remained there. Some had been told that they would be taken to Kabuga in the RPF-controlled area, but that never took place. And the RPF arrived, and it is the RPF that found us where we had sought refuge. And, for those of us who had been injured or were ill, we were transferred to the King Faisal Hospital. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam Witness, and I wish to apologise for the questions I put to you and which led to your shedding some tears. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the cross-examination by the Defence of this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No need to tender any exhibit, I understand? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I do not believe it's necessary for me to tender any document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. 
Any re-examination? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Just a couple of questions, Your Honour.
##
$RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Madam Witness, you mentioned a boy called ********, who you said you could describe as your 
son -- although he wasn't your own child. Did you witness his killing yourself? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
I was present; he was put on board a four-by-four red vehicle with the others, and they were taken towards the Kiyovu area. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that he was killed. Did you actually see that? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
There were gunshots and some young children climbed the wall to try and escape -- and some of them were killed. And when they finished killing, they would take their bodies away immediately so that UNAMIR would not notice the dead bodies at the different locations. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about ********, did you see his body? 
@WITNESS AWO: 
They were all killed in the neighbourhood. My son was traumatised; he is now suffering from mental illness. Jeanette was killed next to Kabuga's building. So my son was the one who witnessed all the rape scenes from the place where he was hiding and he's now suffering from mental illness. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, the meetings that you described as a ruse in which it was mentioned that peace had been re-established, but in fact the aim was to let people come out of their hiding places, such meetings, how many were there approximately, 5, 10, 15? 
@WITNESS AWO:
I would say that such meetings would take place approximately every three days. Three days would go by and then another meeting would be convened. But, I saw Renzaho only on three occasions. On the first occasion, at the Sisters of Charity; the second time at Nyirabagenzi's, and the third time at the Sainte Famille church. But such meetings would be held frequently, and when people were asked to come out of their places of hiding, they would and they would be killed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so you are now confirming -- and that was how I understood your evidence -- that 
Mr. Renzaho only participated in such meetings once, that is the evidence, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS AWO:
He would come, but he would not stay for long. I told him that I saw him on three occasions, at the Sisters of Charity, at the Sainte Famille church and at Odette Nyirabagenzi's. After his departure, the others would continue with their work. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But the meetings where one talked about calm, those meetings mainly took place in Odette's house, isn't that true? Please answer that with a yes or a no. 
@WITNESS AWO:
Yes, such meetings would take place at Odette's. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you only saw him at Odette's house once, isn't that also true? 
@WITNESS AWO:
Yes, I saw him, he was standing on the road. And at the Sisters of Charity, I saw him on 
another -- on another occasion, and on the other occasion I saw him at the Sainte Famille church. At the Sainte Famille church, I, in fact, saw him twice. First of all, when he came to -- came with Angeline, and then I saw him once again when they started killing the people. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness. Now, I'm still only interested in the meetings at Odette's house. You saw him once at Odette's house. Do you remember whether that was on the first meeting or in any of the subsequent meetings at her house? 
@WITNESS AWO:
It was during the first meeting that was held on the street facing Odette's house. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Witness, this was the end of your testimony. We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you very much indeed. 
@WITNESS AWO:
May I say something to the President of the Tribunal? 
I suffered health problems following the criminal acts that were conducted during the war. I brought documents related to my health situation -- and, if possible, I wish to ask for the Tribunal's assistance to help me receive treatment. I believe you are working in the field of human rights; I am very ill and I do not have the necessary resources to receive proper treatment. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, madam, for drawing our attention to the documentation you have in your possession. You will now be accompanied out of the courtroom and the witness protection officer will be given those documents by you, and then we will see whether there will be a possibility of a follow-up. 
@WITNESS AWO:
But, you can give me a direct answer, Mr. President. I have a medical report from the 
King Faisal Hospital, as well as another report from the CHK, and a report by the Butare hospital in Kigali -- I cannot receive treatment and I would like you to give me an answer before I leave. 
I would not want to say in the future that people refused to help me when you would -- you were willing to help me. I made a sacrifice to come here and to face this man and show him that I'm still alive. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But, you see, requests for help, we need to read them and look at them and look at what is available, and that is not something we can do in the courtroom now. So that's why I asked you kindly now to give that to the witness protection officer, and the Tribunal, who has some possibilities to assist, will look into the matters. So, rest assured that this will be looked into very carefully. Thank you very much, Madam Witness, and we wish you a good day. 
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the twenty-third Prosecution witness in 17 days since we started this trial on the 8th of January. There are no other witnesses available in Arusha now. 
Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour. As Your Honour has indicated, I believe we've made very good progress in respect of the case. So much so, Your Honour, that I can indicate that subject to the expert's testimony and two pending motions, the Prosecution -- the Prosecutor would be closing his case against the Accused. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed. 
We have received your first motion this morning, drafted in French -- possibly not by you, but by Mr. Tredici. And have you received this response, Defence? Have you received this motion concerning the variation of the witness list, concerning Witness ADU? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. Yes, Mr. President, we received it this morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you will then simply respond in writing in conformity with normal procedure; that is the thinking, isn't it? 
@MR. CANTIER:
We have started working on it, Mr. President, and you will have our response within the time allotted, that is to say, before the end of the week. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The purpose of this motion, according to what we read in paragraph 8, is to show the moral element -- the mens rea of the Accused. Now, we are aware what this witness is going roughly to testify to, but why is this so important in the interest of justice? Could you just explain that, given the fact that there have been other witnesses who may not have dealt with this issue, but who have approached general situations, and then it will be up to the Bench to decide. What is meant by paragraph 8? 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, to date, we have attempted on a number of occasions to introduce as an exhibit the audiotape which we, as we have argued previously, we submit is the voice of the Accused during the period of the genocide telling another person to exterminate people. 
Now, yes, we cannot prove that as a result of that particular order, people were exterminated and therefore it doesn't -- there's nothing in the indictment itself which relates to that particular act. However, they are words which we submit are words of the Accused that were spoken during the period of the genocide ordering the extermination of people. 
We don't know what the Defence case will be. But, if the Defence case was perhaps along the lines that the Accused was doing all that he could to prevent the killings, then this is clearly a piece of evidence -- direct evidence, in the Prosecution's submission, pointing to the fact that such a defence goes -- does not -- is not in conformity with his direct words. 
Your Honours have, at this stage, not allowed us to produce the audiotape because of the concerns raised by the Defence -- and, obviously, concerns from the Bench as to where the tape was recorded and the circumstances that it was recorded. At the moment, the only evidence before the Trial Chamber is that it was received from the ministry of rehabilitation in Rwanda, and there is no evidence as to how it got there. The evidence of ADU will assist Your Honours in that respect, we trust, and therefore, lead to us being able to introduce that audiotape as an exhibit in the Prosecution case. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that clarification and the Defence will then respond in due course in writing. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Unless the Trial Chamber wishes me to say, in a nutshell, what my sentiment is on the 
matter, either it would be a new accusation -- a new indictment. And my learned friend has just recognised that this could not be the case since that was not provided for in the indictment, as I had stated before you. Or -- and this is the thesis of my learned friend today, the purpose to this document is to demonstrate the mens rea of the Accused. Mr. President, Your Honours, this element, which is taken out of its specific context, cannot constitute an admissible piece of evidence, and this is what we are going to state and repeat -- the previous arguments we had submitted. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for those observations from both sides. 
Now, the next motion, any news about the medical certificate, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES:
It did not arrive overnight, Your Honour, so I'm personally unaware of how long the administrative side of it takes to organise a video conference, if Your Honours grant the motion for a video conference. That was really behind my suggestion yesterday, that perhaps we file the 
motion -- and file the report in a day or two when it arrives. But clearly, I'm in your Your Honours' hands. If Your Honours indicate that it won't take so long to -- to organise that from the registry side of matters -- and I think all Your Honours probably have more experience on that side of things than I do. So, I'm really in Your Honours' hands. I -- I can wait or I can file it today without the medical certificate -- also in French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you do not receive it right away, you may wish to file it any moment. 
You have probably received a copy of the judicial calendar dated Monday this week through the CMS, and will have noted that in conformity with what we agreed upon in this courtroom, the next trial segment will start on Friday the 2nd of March and continue in the following days. It will not start on Thursday the 1st because there is a need for one more day before we start. So the first day will be Friday the 2nd of March and then into the next week to the extent required by the number of witnesses to be granted and the duration of each testimony. But it's clear that we will not need the entire following week, so -- that's if we grant these two motions. 
And the next point then will be a discussion about the commencement of the Defence case. Is the Defence in a position to indicate when this could be possible? Let me say that, from an administrative point of view, we would seem to have courtroom space from the 16th of April onwards. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we contacted the witness protection section to know how much time would be required from when we handed the list of our witnesses for them to be able to bring the witnesses to the Tribunal. And they're saying that, at the very least, two months. 
That is the first comment -- and that is independent of the will of the Defence. As far as we are concerned, Mr. President, Your Honours, after the session we want to meet the potential witnesses. That is where we are. I did not know about this two-month time period. The explanation was that for some witnesses, they -- they need to apply for travel documents, which explains this long period requested by the witness section. 
As far as we are concerned, Your Honour, the time period that we want to ask for is two months. At the beginning, we talked about eight months, that is our -- about eight weeks. That is our situation, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Today is the 7th of February and two months from now would be the 7th of April, and that's around Easter. So would that imply that if we started, say the 16th of April, that that could be done? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I wish that we start the countdown from after the session, because the Defence has to prepare the next session, particularly regarding the expert witness. 
What the witness section protection told us, Mr. President, Your Honours, is that they need two months -- beginning from the day the Defence hands them the lists of witnesses that they wish to call. And this is something I did not know until now. So, the date you are referring to, 
Mr. President, appears very difficult to respect, because we would start from the end of the session -- that is, from about 8 March, that is when we'll start meeting our witnesses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It may be that this is something we should be discussing more informally, but I would assume that it would be possible -- just to give a hint -- to start meeting witnesses in the weeks to come -- at least, some of them, in spite of the fact that there is this one expert witness left. That is one consideration, but we could come back to that. 
And another issue is, it is true that the witness protection has this two-month deadline, but experience also shows that they can sometimes achieve results within less than that. And, in addition, it's not obvious that you have to provide all your witnesses at the same time. You could, for instance, provide them piecemeal, in groups, which would also facilitate the work of the witness protection unit. 
These are some of the considerations that could facilitate the work of everyone, but they are very technical and practical. But I understand that at any rate, then, that may be the 30th of April would be more feasible -- Monday, the 30th of April. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I have no idea at all because I don't know under what conditions the witness protection section is going to work. I have just reported to you what they told me. You have said that they could do better. I do not control the situation. 
However, Your Honour -- Mr. President, Your Honours, as far as the work of the Defence is concerned, we are going to move as fast as possible. I believe we have demonstrated that it's not just words from us, but more concretely, the work that we need to do today would request -- would require eight weeks for my team. 
I've heard you and you want us to give the lists of witnesses piecemeal to the witness protection section; I've understood that. If that will help them, I'll be happy. But the date you're proposing for now, I'm not too sure if we can respect that on account of what I've just said. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Because what you are saying now is that, first, you want two months, and then afterwards there may be a need for another two months. So you are up to four months; that is the worst-case scenario. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we should envisage the scenarios that are possible, not the worst. If, on account of what you have said, we can give the registry, as we go along and as we get the agreement of the witnesses that are coming, we can pass on their names to them and we could envisage that we'll take off before this time frame of four weeks -- four months. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This was a useful discussion. It is difficult to make a decision now based on the information available. Let us simply say that the Bench's clear preference is to start this case in May as early as possible, but we will get in touch with the Defence and the witness protection unit to see what is possible, and we invite the Defence to informal consultations to see how this can be done in as smooth a way as possible. And then a final decision will be made following consultations, is that okay? 
And let me simply say that the problem is that our courtroom schedule is very crowded when it gets closer to late June and July; that's why if we lose the momentum, it may have grave consequences. And, in addition, one of the Judges at this Bench is sitting in another case in parts of June, which also complicates the matter, but we will sort this out. 
Any other matters? 
@MR. MOSES:
In respect of the expert report, Your Honour, we filed the French version, which should have been served on the parties -- and in fact, I may -- it may be that that is the final version. So there seems to be a little bit of confusion, but my latest understanding is, in fact, from the language section that the version that has been filed will not be revised. So if I can just put that on the record. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All that remains now is to thank both parties for their professionalism. As mentioned, we have heard 23 witnesses in 17 days; some of them were half days. Even if we had to stop one week because of the Military I trial, it has been possible to bring this case to a completion subject to the two motions by today, since the 8th of January. So again, thank you to both parties for the way they have conducted and contributed to the proceedings. Thank you very much indeed. 
Warm thanks go to the registry staff for their never-failing efforts and quality work that is displayed everyday in the courtroom. To the professionalism, integrity and efficiency of the interpreters. And the quality and speed of the court reporters with a minimum of problems, if any at all. You all made a tremendous contribution, thank you very much indeed. 
The Court is then adjourned until Friday the 2nd of March. 
Thank you.

@MR. TREDICI: 
Good morning. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Good morning, sir. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, you are Rwandese? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, indeed. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
You are 60 years old? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, I am. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And you are living in Switzerland? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
That is correct. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
How long have you been living in Switzerland? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Since 1974. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And your first question, Mr. Tredici, was whether he was Rwandan; isn't that so? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
That was my first question, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Please watch the screen. Yes, next question. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, what was your occupation during 1994? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
In 1994 I was a journalist. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Were you employed or you were a freelance journalist? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I was self-employed. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, as a freelance journalist, which media houses were you associated with? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I worked with a weekly whose name was -- and still is L'Hebdo, as well as the Info-Sud agency. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honour, I don't know if we need assistance with the names of the media houses the witness has just mentioned. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We do need assistance. 
So you mentioned two names now, Mr. Witness, of two agencies. Can you help us with the spelling of those two? One by one, slowly, please. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Info-Sud is spelled I-N-F-O, hyphen, S-U-D. And L'Hebdo is L, apostrophe, H-E-B-D-O. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, where were you between the 2nd and the 23rd of April 1994? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I was at the CND. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
What were you referred (sic) to when you mentioned CND? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
It was a building at the time where a battalion of the Rwandan patriotic front was accommodated. The battalion was stationed there by virtue of the Arusha Accords. But well before that, I believe that building was the parliament of the former single party. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And where is this building located? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
This building is located in Kimihurura, Kimihurura. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Please mention the name of the locality where this building is located. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
You mean the town? In Kigali, of course. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much. What did you go to do in Rwanda in April 1994? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I had gone to Rwanda for a news report. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And could you please explain to the Chamber what were your goals or objectives when you went to Rwanda in April 1994? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I was an independent journalist who'd already worked with the Info-Sud agency on other subjects. I had convinced the agency, as well as the weekly L'Hebdo to go to Rwanda because what was happening there was very interesting for the Swiss public. So I had proposed to them the subject, they were the Arusha Accords, and I thought I would go and report on reconciliation and the Arusha Accords, and I had even made contact with WWF in order to deal with a subject which might have been of interest to Europe, which was the fate of the gorillas during the war. So I was going there with the objective of talking about peace and reconciliation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, could you slow down, please. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I shall try to do so, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you referred to WWF, which means World Wildlife Fund. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, indeed. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, you mentioned before that your primary objective, if I may say, was to conduct interviews and to cover the peace agreements in the course of your stay in Rwanda. My question is: Were you able to accomplish these objectives of your mission? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
The objectives of the news report were met beyond my expectations, but, of course, what occurred was not what I expected. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
I think the Trial Chamber would like to know, who were you planning to interview? You mentioned you were planning to conduct interviews. Can you please elaborate on this? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, apart from the two agencies that had sent me there, and for which I was accredited, I had already -- I had also created, with a friend of mine who died during the genocide, a newspaper. And that was a newspaper that we created when the Arusha Accords was signed. Our slogan was "newspaper born with the Arusha agreement", so we had decided to cover the country. He would cover the south, I would cover the north, the part under the RPF, and we had decided to meet in Kigali, which we did. We indeed met. 
I arrived in Kigali on the 2nd -- I arrived in Kigali on the 2nd of April. I met with him, and we had decided to set up a programme of interviews. And I remember there were a number of people we had appointments with, notably Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Joyce Leader, who was, I believe, an American who represented the United States, and Lando, Landouald Ndasingwa, among other people. But you know that when one goes on report, one -- it is not always easy to know who we will meet in advance. But those were the ones we had decided to see, and we had fixed appointments with them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, do you have this laminated document in front of you? Can you look at me, please? Now, these are guidelines for efficient communication in the courtroom. Do you see number 2 there? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
D'accord. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you will note when you speak slowly, you will particularly do so when you mention a lot of names. Can you please help us? Now we have to backtrack again, because you were too fast. We got Twagiramungu, we got Uwilingiyimana, but now you also referred to an American name. Please spell that name. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Joyce Leader is spelt J-O-Y-C-E, L-E-A-D-E-R.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Leader, like a leader in English. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, I do believe that is so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the word, please? Oh, no. Yes, it is L-E-A-D-E-R, according to the additional spelling list you have provided, number 1 on the list.
@MR. TREDICI:
That's correct, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And Landouald was number 2. We have all the four names on the spelling list. Thank you.

@MR. TREDICI: 
So, Mr. Witness, my question now is: In the light of the circumstances that prevailed in Kigali when you were there, were you able to undertake other journalistic endeavours while at CND? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, of course. When one goes on a report, one has one's ears and eyes open, and one's equipment ready. So very early in the morning, since one has to keep informed, I would listen to radio stations, and more specifically, those that were operating in Rwanda, Radio Rwanda, and also radio and television RFI, the BBC, and possibly other radio stations. I had my small recorder. I was always ready to take interviews. And then I would have to find a way to send news releases to the agencies that had sent me there. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Were you able to conduct any interviews at all while you stayed at CND? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, yes, I was able to interview a number of people indeed. When the war started, I remember, I interviewed General Dallaire. I was able to put a few question -- a few questions to him in passing. That would be a more apt description of what occurred. When the war broke out, I was able to talk with the first RPF soldier who was injured. And every occasion I had to ask questions, I would use such an occasion. I also recall having seen General Gatsinzi also. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. You mentioned that you had with you a tape recorder; is that correct? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, indeed. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Did you use this tape recorder? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, of course. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please explain to the Chamber what kind of recordings you made there? I am referring to your stay at the CND. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
So, at CND I was able to record -- I just referred to the soldier who was injured, et cetera. I was also able to record the RTLM radio, and that was the radio station I was the most interested in. It was a radio that was different from the others. So that was information. I was also able to record conversations of people who were talking amongst one another, using a walkie-talkie belonging to an RPF soldier. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, why did you choose in particular to make recordings of RTLM broadcasts? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I believe I gave the reason. It was because I had been greatly impressed when I arrived in Kigali. I was quite surprised that such a radio station be able to continue to broadcast, and that people had become used to such programmes. So this was, of course, something I wished to report on when I would return to Switzerland. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please specify, what were you using to record this broadcast? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I had a small radio I had brought with me, and also a small Sony tape recorder which was a bit more sophisticated than a dictaphone, since there was also an equaliser on this device. So this is what I used to make my recordings, but I would not do it continuously. It was when there was something striking -- which, of course, I never knew what orientation the speeches would take. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, many persons think fast. But that doesn't mean that you have to talk fast. Now, please help us. This is the third time. Speak slowly. Will you do that? You see, every word you say has to be interpreted. It has to be transcribed. And if you do not follow that rule, we have to play the tape of your testimony afterwards. Okay? Whenever Mr. Tredici does like that to you, it means you have fallen into your bad habits. 
Here comes the next question. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Obliged, Your Honour. Thank you very much. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, you mentioned that you also recorded a telephone conversation or telephone conversations between what you believed were officials. What kind of recordings were these? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not believe I heard the witness make such a statement. I do not know whether this is a suggestion that counsel for the Prosecution is putting to the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you are referring to the reference to telephone. I think we only have heard about walkie-talkie so far. So you are right, Defence. 
Please reformulate, Mr. Tredici. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
I apologise. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
So, my question would be: You referred to conversations that you recorded. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, indeed. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
And you made a reference to a walkie-talkie. Could you please elaborate on this issue? What kind of recordings were these? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Those were telephone conversations, mostly. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Could you please explain to the Chamber how you made these recordings? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, I got near to a soldier who had his walkie-talkie. He was with another soldier. I saw them laugh. I went next to them, and they told me that they were listening to conversations -- they were listening to telephone conversations. So I was quite surprised, and I asked them whether I could make recordings, and they accepted. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
They were listening to telephone conversations how? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Using the walkie-talkies. 
$BY MR. TREDICI:
@MR. TREDICI: 
Mr. Witness, can you recall the date in which you recorded these telephone conversations? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, I believe it was between the 14th or maybe the 15th and the 18th. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of which month? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Of April. April 1994.

Mr. Witness, would you be able to identify the recording you made of these telephone conversations? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, indeed.

Have you recently listened to the recording you made of these telephone conversations? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, in part. In part. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Where did you listen to this recording? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
First of all, I made copies recently, before coming here, because I wanted to have some backup copies. So I had the opportunity to listen to them at that point. But not the totality of them. I was just carrying out some checks. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Most recently, have you listened to this recording after you made these copies you just mentioned? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, yes, I did because I met with the investigators and they made me listen to the tapes. Yes. 
@MR. TREDICI: 
$(Microphones overlapping)...made you listen to? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you say something, Mr. Tredici? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What did you say? The mikes were overlapping. Can you repeat what you said? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
My question was: What is it that they made you listen to? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, in fact the investigators were the ones who made me listen to the tapes so that I would confirm that it was indeed the recordings I had made. What I was made to listen were excerpts of my recordings.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When -- when did this conversation with the investigators take place, Mr. Witness? When did you listen to the transcripts together with them -- or, with the -- to the tapes? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
On the first occasion it was in Brussels on the 2nd or the 3rd of February, I believe. It was on a Sunday, in any case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Of this year, 2007.

@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Non. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The English version runs until page 74, according to the pagination on the bottom right-hand side. Which page? 
@MR. TREDICI: 
I have given the witness the three versions; Kinyarwanda, French, and English versions. But I think it would be better to refer to the Kinyarwandan version. I am in your hands. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you speak Kinyarwanda, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Perfectly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

You did not translate the French and the English, but have you read those versions? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No. No.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the question now, Mr. Witness, you have the last page in front of you, and we would ask you kindly to read, in English, because this is written in English, into the record, the first sentence of the second paragraph, starting with your name. Can you do that for us, please? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:

@MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honour, if I may have one -- of course, the Prosecution intends to tender the CD-ROM that contains the audio recordings, and the transcripts. The Kinyarwandan transcripts that were identified as a -- as a legitimate transcript of the content of the audio recording, and the official translations. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that's understood, and that was what was meant. So now we would wish to hear the Defence before ruling on any of these matters. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, before I go into the possible cross-examination of this witness, Defence would like to submit to your Bench an oral motion on the testimony. So, by your leave, I would like to go into that request. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence motion seeks to have excluded immediately the testimony of Mr. Faustin Kagame for two reasons: One, that this testimony is on evidence which amount to new -- new facts which do not appear in the investment -- in the indictment, and cannot be entered through -- can only be entered through adequate notice, as established in the -- within the jurisprudence of this Court. 
For these two reasons, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence would like to state that the recording of the telephone conversation, which the Prosecutor would like to enter into evidence through this witness, Faustin Kagame, is clearly a new material fact which is not challenged by the Prosecutor. Besides, let me say, Mr. President, that the Prosecutor himself stated, in the course of whenever he addressed your Court, and whenever it was the case for the Defence to listen to these recordings. 
In order to refresh your memory, Mr. President, Your Honours, on the allegations of the Defence in relation to the nature of this new evidence, I am going to indicate to you that similar facts on the recordings or interceptions of recordings were clearly mentioned by the Prosecutor in his indictment in paragraph 14, because he was -- he was aware of the fact that these were material facts which ought to be necessarily brought to the notice of the Defence through the indictment. And in that paragraph 14, it is said -- he states as follows: "On 8 April" -- that is page 6 of the indictment, amended on 16th February 2006. Paragraph 14 is not very long, Mr. President, Your Honours, so I would like to read it. 
It states as follows: "On the 8th of April 1994, or around that date, Tharcisse Renzaho planned, ordered, incited to commit, or aided to commit the murder of the director of the Rwandan development bank. He confirmed this fact by radio telephone on the same date or around that date to Colonel Bagosora, who was participating in the common criminal enterprise referred to in paragraph 6 supra". 
It is therefore clear, Mr. President, that in the light of this reference made by the Prosecutor, the statement that we are making that it is a material fact cannot be challenged. 
Given the fact that this statement cannot be challenged, the Prosecutor later on notified on the 23rd October 2005, notified the Defence, and on that occasion was careful to mention the evidence that he wanted to have -- the evidence that he wanted to bring through the witness before you. And on that occasion, this is what he said -- and I would like to read it because it is also not too long. That is on page 20 and page 21 of the pre-trial brief of the Prosecutor. And these deal with the development that needs to be brought to the intention -- or the attention of the Defence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have now referred to page numbers of the pre-trial brief, but they differ in English and French. What is the paragraph numbers, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, it's page (sic) 89 of the French version, and the pages I gave were also the pages of the French version of the pre-trial brief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And what you did say in French now was that it was paragraph 89; isn't that so? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Eighty-nine, Mr. President. That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I just want to read a portion of that paragraph on the intention of the -- or, the intent of the Accused, where the Prosecutor alleges that, nonetheless, the Tribunal may infer this intention in addition to the facts already mentioned to a number of facts and circumstances. For example, the general framework within which the -- the fact which is normally referred to as genocide, which occurred in Rwanda between the 6th (sic) and 17 July 1994 occurred. I did not read the full paragraph, but let me just limit it to that, because that is the essence of what I want to bring to the attention of Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have the guidelines in front of you? With other words -- 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm paying attention to that, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. So you are now about to slow down when reading, aren't you, according to guideline 2. Please do. Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well. Very well, Mr. President. 
For the stenographers, for the sake of the stenographers, maybe I should read what I have just read more slowly. I was saying, Mr. President, the Prosecutor charges in that paragraph as follows: "However, the Tribunal may also infer that intent, in addition to the elements already mentioned, to a number of facts and circumstances, such as the general framework within which the material facts took place, that is, generally referred to as genocide in Rwanda, between the 6th of April and 17th July 1994, which refers to the large-scale massacres and subjecting Tutsis to conditions and other evidence which the Prosecutor will adduce. A -- subparagraph A", the Prosecutor says, "the Accused referred -- talked about extermination in a telephone conversation with Mr. Rugambarara, the Bicumbi -- the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, who was arrested -- which was intercepted". Sorry. 
It is therefore clear that in making reference to this in a pre-trial brief, and in making such assertions, the Prosecutor does not challenge the nature of the evidence which constitutes material facts intended exclusively, according to the Prosecutor, to demonstrate the mens rea of the Accused; that it is also established by statements of the same Prosecutor in reference to these charges, during the hearing of -- proceeding of 22nd January 2005, when the Accused clearly challenged the admission of this -- the interception of these telephone conversations into evidence. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this assertion is on the basis of the nature of the evidence which is at issue. The issue that your Chamber is being requested to decide on through our motion is whether this evidence, which constitutes material fact, and which does not appear in the indictment, may be admitted in view of the information -- or, the evidence that the Prosecutor has adduced thus far. And the answer, Mr. President, has already been given by your Bench through the main principles on the admission of such evidence in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Théoneste Bagosora and others in your decision dated 29th June 2006, on the motion submitted by the Accused, Ntabakuze, requesting for the exclusion of evidence which is in the same vein as this. 
Now, to answer -- in answering that motion, Your Honours, you set forth the following principles, in paragraph 10 of your decision. And here I only have the English version -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We remember our case law. Do you have a copy for the Bench available? Yes, please. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, what you are doing is to draw our attention to paragraph 10 in our decision of 29th June 2006, which includes one of the applicable principles to be adhered to in this area. All right, that's noted. 
So which sentence is it you want us to look at? The second sentence is: "Where the material fact cannot be reasonably related to the indictment, then it shall be excluded". And then, third sentence: "Where the material fact is relevant, then the Chamber will -- relevant only to a vague or general allegation in the indictment, then the Chamber will consider whether notice of the material fact was given in the pre-trial brief, or the opening statement, so as to cure the vagueness of the indictment". 
Are these two sentences the key sentences in that paragraph? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Exactly, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, those are the two main principles that your Chamber set forth regarding the analysis on the admissibility of this type of evidence. And the Defence submits that in the light of these rules, the evidence that the Prosecutor has brought before your Court cannot be accepted by your Court. The first reason for this Defence claim is that it is not challenged whatsoever, that this evidence does not appear in the indictment. It cannot be challenged. That this evidence cannot even reasonably be linked up to any charges whatsoever contained in the indictment that has just been established through the examination-in-chief of this witness who, in the entire course of his examination-in-chief, did not mention once the name of the accused person, Tharcisse Renzaho, as well as the Prosecutor, who did not even bother to mention Tharcisse Renzaho in the course of his examination-in-chief. 
In the light of the evidence of this witness, it is obvious that there is no link whatsoever between his indictment and the charges brought against the accused person by the Prosecutor in the indictment. We have already, Mr. President, Your Honours, made other submissions during the objections that we raised, particularly in January 2007, particularly with regard to the content of the indictment. I just want to refer your Court to these additional submissions so as to go on and raise the issue as to whether the second rule that you, yourself, set forth -- it is possible for the Chamber to consider whether this evidence is admissible, because the Prosecutor's -- the fact that the Prosecutor did not notify this earlier can be cured by the fact of sufficient notification. The answer, Mr. President, is no. 
The Prosecutor cannot submit that this allegation -- this charge is contained in his pre-trial brief, because the requirement of not -- notice, which you raise and which is in this decision of 29th January 2006, is such that notice shall be clear, coherent and done within a time limit that would enable the Defence to prepare to respond to the charges of the Prosecutor, and thus making it possible for your Court to have a fair trial. So there are three cumulative conditions for notice, for notice to be valid. 
In the case at bar, I have read the references that the Prosecutor has made to these new factual allegations. It so happens that even though that the Prosecutor pre-trial brief, it's dated 2007 -- 2005, the allegations, or the charges are vague. They do not contain any information making it possible for the Accused to know where this telephone conversation with the bourgmestre of Bicumbi came from, and how to investigate so as to be able to bring up new information on these new charges. 
Worst of all, the Prosecutor is going to limit himself to this mention -- or, limit himself to mentioning this in his pre-trial brief. The additional notice that the Prosecutor ought to have made would have attempted -- or, would have sought to make was on the 18th January 2006 -- December 2006, and was still very vague. And these were manuscripts -- transcripts of this telephone conversation -- manuscript transcripts which make reference Karera and not Renzaho, another way for the Prosecutor to disorganise the Defence when it comes to carrying out further investigations in relation to these new factual allegations. 
And having done that -- having done that, Your Honours, the Prosecutor will still fail to notice us (sic) with regard to the recording -- or, did not do this until 9th January 2007. He limited himself to this, and further limited himself to saying that only Witness ALG will have the opportunity to dis -- to identify the voice of Mr. Renzaho through -- by listening to this audio recording. Curiously, Your Honours, it was on 17th January 2007, in the course of proceeding, that the Defence is once again notified as to the will-say of Witness GLG (sic), UB, DAW (sic) as witnesses who are going to do the same identification that was announced for Witness LG (sic). And when the discussion came up -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. Now you had all these pseudonyms, and you didn't slow down. So the first one was which witness? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
The first witness is GLG, Mr. President -- GLJ, Mr. President. And the second one is Witness UB. And then Witness AW -- AWE. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, there's a procedure for notice that the Prosecutor followed while we are -- while they are bringing their -- their evidence before the Court. And because Defence is reached -- challenging, firmly challenging the admissibility of this event -- of this evidence, and that the Court, expressing its reserve about admissibility of the evidence, asked relevant questions to the Prosecutor. And that is when the Prosecutor thought it necessary to say that he was going to submit a motion to your Court to amend a list of witnesses so as to call the person -- to call the witness who was originally intended to testify to that recording. 
The Chamber, on 6 (sic) February 2007, notified its agreement and its -- and your decision, rendered two days later, got the Prosecutor to notify the witness to the Defence only on 7 February 2007. And they know that the Defence was going to have a problem, because the Defence team is English -- French speaking, and the disclosure was in French -- was in English, sorry. 
Still in relation to this listening -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. What is coming now is not clear. Did you just mean to refer to our decision of 16th February 2007, namely, the decision on Prosecution motion to vary witness list? Was that your last reference? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I got wrong the date of the decision. It was indeed 16th -- 16th February 2007. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. Yes, and -- very well. Now, in that decision of the 16th of February, there is a paragraph 6 where the Chamber addressed the issue of notice, unfair surprise, et cetera. And what is your comment in relation to that paragraph 6? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Defence position is that notice, in spite of these paragraphs from the Chamber, were not done in conditions that would enable -- or, which will ensure the proper protection of the rights of the Accused, Renzaho, as set forth in Article 20 of the statutes of the Tribunal. Because I'm arguing before your Chamber, Mr. President, Your Honours, that the conditions of notifications as very often admitted by your Court were not respected by the Prosecutor, particularly with regard to the dates of disclosure. 
You will realise that up until 2007, we are still having disclosure of this evidence, whereas he -- this had been in his possession since 1996. There's therefore no reason for the Prosecutor not to disclose fully, comprehensively, this new fact to us instead of sending us pieces of such evidence -- of this evidence as and when he thought fit. 
In conclusion on this issue, Mr. President, I would like to state that the last disclosure that we received from Prosecutor was dated 1st March 2007, that is, yesterday, the French version of the statement of this witness. 
Now -- and then, Your Honours, by proceeding in this manner has the Prosecutor made it possible -- has the Prosecutor made it possible for the Defence to organise itself properly to cross-examine this witness on the basis of information that we may have gathered from our own investigations? The answer is no. Because since 8th January 2007, we've all been here before your Court, and obliged to follow the evidence being brought by the Prosecutor, and unable to conduct any investigations whatsoever. Besides, the Prosecutor states that we were in a position to carry out investigations on the basis of the information he brought in his pre-trial brief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nekuie, you have to slow down; and the English interpreter must speak louder, because Mr. Nekuie has a very forceful voice. So if the booth could speak even louder into the mike, and the Defence could speak even more slowly, that would help. 
You are about to close now, I understand, Defence. Please continue. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I'm going to attempt to slow down and to -- and not to speak very loudly. I'm just concluding on the first point of my motion, not the motion as a whole. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to say that the conditions for disclosure were not met on account of the dates that the pieces of this disclosure of the factual elements that will allow -- have allowed us to conduct appropriate investigations. On account of the dates on which such disclosures were made, the required conditions for disclosure were not met, that is, conditions of clarity, conditions of coherence in the disclosures, and also conditions of disclosure with regard to time limits. That is, those are elements that your Chamber set forth, and they were not respected in the presentation of this evidence. 
Further, Your Honours, it is clear that these -- this evidence, as I said earlier on, has been in the possession of the Prosecutor since 1996. And by the leave of your Court, the Prosecutor has amended the indictment four times, and the last amendment, dated February 2006, was not -- did not even -- or, was not able to bring out the details of these charges. 
The Prosecutor therefore knew that he was going to use this evidence, and in the disclosure that he made, he keeps to himself the essential elements which would have enabled us to organise our work properly and ensure that your Chamber is able to afford our Accused -- our client a fair trial. 
$(Pages 1 to 19 by Kirstin McLean)
1020H
@MR. NEKUIE (continuing): 
Given these conditions, Mr. President, when Defence is deprived of all possibilities of organising itself to be -- to cross-examine this witness properly, how can you admit such evidence without necessarily prejudicing the rights of Tharcisse Renzaho to have a fair trial, the principle which is clearly set forth in Articles 19 and 20 of your statute? Your case law clearly points to the solution -- or, the decision that you have to bring to this motion. There is no possible way of going round this evidence brought before this Court, and this was not included in the indictment. Whereas he knew -- the Prosecutor knew that this factual element had existed since 1996, particularly so when you (sic) had the opportunity to amend his indictment on 16 February 2006. 
It is therefore clear that there is a serious risk to prejudice the rights of the accused person, Tharcisse Renzaho, in the event that this new evidence which constitutes new material facts were admitted. It is even more so, Mr. President, Your Honours, that the Prosecutor, in the presentation of this, even went fishing. He attempted this in the Karera case -- well, before then in the Semanza case, and realised that the Chamber refused that. And then he is trying to play that game again before your Court. Your Court takes its rulings on the basis of facts which are established beyond doubt. If this game that the Prosecutor is bringing up were accepted, it would amount to supporting this kind of game. I have spoken. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed. 
Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I will try and be brief. Firstly, I don't know what the title of the motion my friend has brought and whether it is a motion seeking certification of Your Honours' earlier decision; if it is, then of course, it is out of time. Your Honours have ruled in respect of these issues already and there are procedures in place which allow the Defence to seek certification of decisions if they do not agree with Your Honours' decisions. So it seems to me that this is simply a backdoor means of trying to go appeal the decision that Your Honours have already taken. 
Secondly, my friend mentions that the witness has not mentioned the Accused. With the greatest of respect for my learned friend, that shows a complete lack of understanding of the purpose of this witness's testimony and the reasons for which he has been called, which was clearly to address the issue of the circumstances in which the tape which has been played to witnesses was taken. It is completely open for my friend to cross-examine this witness as to whether he, in fact, would be able to recognise any of the voices. My understanding is, if I can be so bold, is that he would not. That's not the purpose for which we have called this witness. 
We then get on to the issue, Your Honour, which has been argued two or three times, either orally or in writing, and I don't know how many times I need to say this and to say it clearly -- and if my friends can clearly listen; we are not seeking a conviction for the Accused in respect of an allegation that this piece of evidence is -- amounts to a crime that is contained in the indictment. The purpose for leading this piece of evidence is, as we have made clear since October 19 -- sorry, 2005, is that it is evidence supporting mens rea, which is a completely different issue. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And on that point, does that mean this is not a material fact? 
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely. It is evidence; and evidence does not have to be cleared in the indictment, because the Accused is in no danger of a conviction in respect of this matter. This is in relation to -- we have led no evidence that persons were, in fact, killed as a result of whoever gave the order to exterminate in the hills of Bikumbi. So, there is no danger of the Accused being convicted of that fact. It is relevant to, we say, his mens rea, if Your Honours accept the testimony of the witnesses who have identified the voice of the Accused. And I don't want to go on and repeat this, because that is the issue, and I don't know if my friends have clearly understood that fact. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But one of the conditions for convicting someone is that there is mens rea. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This evidence is aimed at strengthening your case in relation to that point. Is it your view, then, that in spite of that being the purpose, it is still not a material fact? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. Yes, it is, Your Honour. 
And I refer to the Appeals Chamber decision in Kvocka on page 12, 28 February 2005, where the Appeals Chamber said, "Whether or not a fact is considered material, depends on the nature of the Prosecution's case. The Prosecution's characterisation of the alleged criminal conduct and the proximity of the accused to the underlying crime, are decisive factors in determining the degree of specificity with which the Prosecution must plead the material facts of its case in the indictment in order to provide the Accused with adequate notice." 
And it goes on to say: "For example, if the Prosecution alleges that an accused personally committed the criminal acts in question, the indictment should include details which explain this allegation, such as the identity of the victim, the time and place of the events, and the means by which the offence was committed." 
And my friend refers to a situation which is included in the indictment, which we have not led evidence of. Clearly if we had, so far as that conversation was concerned, that is something that he could have been convicted of. In respect of this incident, it's simply evidence of mens rea; he is in no danger of conviction in respect of that incident. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you now referred to the Appeals Chamber decision of 28 February 2005, and shall we, just for the record, agree on the spelling of that decision. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honours. It's K-V-O-C-K-A, and there are other accused, Radic -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Finally, Your Honours, as we have referred previously and I simply refer briefly again, to the other appeals decision of Nyiramasuhuko, which was a decision where the Appeals Court held that evidence could be led even though it was not contained in the indictment, on the basis that to make relevant to other issues before the Trial Chamber to assess, even though Nyiramasuhuko was in no danger of conviction in respect of the matters which were led, namely her involvement in the 19th April speech of President Sindikubwabo; a similar situation. Thank you, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Anything to add, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. First of all, I wish to allay the fears of counsel for the Prosecution by stating that I fully understand -- the Defence fully understood -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Speed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Much obliged, Mr. President. 
I have fully understood the objectives aimed at by the Prosecution through this witness. We have clearly understood that the purpose for the Prosecution is to provide evidence supporting mens rea, which, on the basis of evidence -- let me repeat, sir -- which are, in fact, factual elements. And in the case of your Trial Chamber, which I quoted, Mr. President, there was a similar case which you were to deal with. In your decision in paragraph 50, reference was made to the exclusion of the planning of guerrilla -- in August of 1994, to which Mr. Ntabakuze had allegedly participated. And in the motion for exclusion of such testimony filed by the Defence, since the Prosecutor had not understood the nature of my motion -- it is a motion for exclusion of testimony -- the Prosecutor responded by stating that the Goma events, and even though they were new elements constituting crime, they were only aimed at being provided as proof of the mens rea for the facts mentioned in the indictment which had nothing to do with the events in Goma. 
However, in order to deny or to sustain the motion of the Defence on this matter, you looked at the notification element of this evidence in conditions that would enable the Defence to organise itself in order to cross-examine the witness, and it was on that basis that it was accepted that even though those were factual elements, they could indeed be used as evidence supporting mens rea. 
We are exactly in the same situation, and in our case, Your Honours, Mr. President, it is clear that the conditions of notification were not met so as to enable the Defence to organise itself, and when the Prosecution wishes to bring confusion in the minds of the Judges by claiming that through this motion, the Defence is seeking certification -- or, rather, is appealing the decision you have already made --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can't we agree on two things? Don't speak so loudly, and don't speak so fast. Because it's very difficult to hear the interpreter when you are so engaged, so we get "inaudibles". 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That is true, Mr. President. I am much obliged. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I have a question for you. The question is the following: You have, as an argument, in response to the Prosecution's submission based on the Appeals Chamber case law referred again to our decision of 29th June 2006. This time you did not refer to paragraph 10, which you read out before the Prosecution response, you referred to some other paragraph. It is not clear which paragraph you referred to. Can you repeat the number of that paragraph? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I was saying that in light of the principles set forth in paragraph 10, you looked into a case of exclusion contained in paragraph 50 of your decision of the 29th of June 2006. Paragraph 50 deals with the submissions of the parties among which is the submission of the Prosecution whereby the Goma event -- events are not provided so as to seek conviction of the Accused Ntabakuze, but rather in order to establish the mens rea or an accused's intent. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But isn't the conclusion concerning paragraph 50 to be found in paragraph 51? And in paragraph 51, the Chamber cannot categorically exclude the relevance of this event and will defer consideration of this question until closing submissions. Isn't that the operative paragraph in that area? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, this is indeed the contents of the paragraph, but the Chamber reached that conclusion when examining the submissions of the parties on the basis of the principles as set forth in paragraph 10, which require either the presence of these new factual allegations in the indictment, or the cure through adequate notification, which was the case regarding this piece of evidence and which led to the decision as rendered by the Chamber in paragraph 51. The question at hand is to determine whether -- the present matter, Mr. President, Your Honours, is to determine whether, in our specific case, it was possible to cure the defect through notification so as to have admitted this evidence as evidence supporting mens rea. I already demonstrated that that was not possible. 
May I conclude, Mr. President, Your Honours, by stating that in that same decision -- in a paragraph I am not able to locate -- and on the subject of notification in order to reject -- or, to deny the motion of the Defence on this issue, submitted that the Prosecutor had provided in due time a motion for exclusion of evidence and that the Trial Chamber had handed down a decision favourable to the Prosecutor, and the notification or disclosure of such elements to the Defence was carried out in due time so as to enable the Defence to cross-examine the witness correctly. And your conclusion was that the adjournment of the proceedings without any request having been made by the Defence on a long period was a de facto way of enabling the Defence to organise itself. 
In the specific case in point, the last disclosure we received was dated 1st of March 2007; that is to say, yesterday, which means that we did not at any time have the opportunity to move from here so as to carry out any investigation whatsoever when the reliability of this piece of evidence is in question. So the fairness of this trial would be endangered if your Bench were to admit this piece of evidence. This -- these are my submissions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comment, Prosecution, on that 1 March submission? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That was a translation of something which was filed several weeks ago. It was a -- so the English version was filed more than three weeks ago and I will just try and find out exactly what it was that was provided to the Defence yesterday, as to -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
According to Rule 6, "avoid asides". 
@MR. MOSES: 
I apologise, Your Honour. There was a French translation of a statement made on the 14th of February of this year. I believe that was a will-say and a reconfirmation of an earlier state of which the French had originally been given. So I don't know if my friend is asking for a short delay in order for him to be able to -- having read the will-say whether they are in any doubt as to what this witness was going to say. I don't believe that is the case, and it seems to be a red herring, to be blunt. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has heard oral submissions in connection with the Defence oral motion to exclude the evidence of this witness. The motion is denied. The reasons for that follow partly from our decision of the 16th of February. However, in view of the fact that both parties have referred to case law, and the importance of this issue, we are going to hand down a written decision in addition to this oral ruling which will explain the reasons why we reached this result. 
It's now time for cross-examination. 
We will deal with all the requests for admissions after cross-examination. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I am obliged, Mr. President.

@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning, Witness. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Good morning, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, this recording that you are attempting to recognise before this Trial Chamber today, could you tell the Trial Chamber, more specifically, when it was that this recording was made? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, I would be hard pressed to do so because the conditions under which such tapes were recorded did not truly enable me to put labels on them, but I am almost certain that it was between the 14th and the 18th. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Of which month? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Between the 15th and the 18th of April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And during your examination-in-chief, Witness, you stated that Mr. Alain Sigg was the first person to whom you provided a copy of this tape. Am I correct? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, it is the first person from your jurisdiction I gave the tape to. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What do you mean? Witness, does this mean that there was another first person to whom you gave the tape outside of this jurisdiction? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, indeed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you be more explicit and tell us to whom you submitted such a tape and on which date?
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
$(Microphones overlapping)
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I do not know what is wrong with me this morning, but I shall make sure that I do so.

@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you hear my last question? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, I did. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you please answer that question? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
When I left Rwanda after my news report and at the time I was going back to Switzerland, the leaders of the RPF who had given me the authorisation to report in the territories that were under their control, asked for a copy, which I provided. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And when was that, Witness? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, it must have been around the 26th or 27th of April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. And Mr. Alain Sigg from this Tribunal to whom you provided a copy, when was it that you gave him such a copy? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
If my memory serves me well, it must have been in 1995, probably in November. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, when you listened to the recordings in the walkie-talkies of the RPF soldiers, were you able to identify the people who were having a conversation? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, apart from those who would introduce themselves in the time, because it sometimes happened. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did RPF leaders ask for a copy of the report? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
I said that it was when I was about to leave Rwanda from Mulindi, so it must have been around the 26th or the 27th. It would be difficult for me to give the exact date, but I would have to check in order to provide it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I remember your testimony. Here follows the next question: When did you provide that report to RPF leaders? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Let me repeat that I believe it was when I was about to leave Rwanda; that is to say, around the 26th or the 27th. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Sometimes, Mr. Witness, it's important to ask questions in a very neutral way. This was one example. One thing is when the request is being made, something else is when the request may be honoured; with other words, when you gave it over. These were two different elements. That's why there was a need to be absolutely certain, because this is relevant. Thank you. 
Next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, who were the RPF soldiers whose walkie-talkies you used in order to make this recording? Do you remember their names? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Absolutely not. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And who was this RPF leader you gave a copy of the recording to when you were leaving? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I believe I gave a copy to the person who was my guide during my report in the area under RPF control. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you do not recall the name of that person at all? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I do recall his name. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you give his name to the Trial Chamber, please?

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, since you were able to follow this conversation while it was taking place, and since you speak and understand Kinyarwanda, I believe you were able to understand what was being said. Could you tell the Trial Chamber what that was? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, it was a recording that lasted more than one hour. But, from what I remember, it was a conversation on the killings that were taking place, mostly. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Was the conversation on the killings or rather on the attacks with the two armies that were in conflict? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, let me say that I remember two things. There was a gentleman who was trying to get evacuated, if I remember well; and he was at the same time describing the situation. I remember quite striking sentences such as "the Tutsi matter, we are solving it, for 100 years" such statements. I remember being struck by them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are too fast again, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
My apologies, I shall make an effort. Should I repeat the answer I just provided? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes.
@WITNESS KAGAME:
I was saying that I was able very rapidly to understand that those who were talking were talking about their -- about massacres and were at the same time trying to be evacuated or were trying to get an escort, at least put themselves away from the conflict. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, was it one single telephone conversation that you recorded for more than one hour, or were you referring to something else? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, if I remember correctly, there were three tapes, because it was not one continuous recording. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So for how long did you record that conversation? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, on the basis of the transcripts, I realised that it was more than one hour, but while I was there, I must say that I did not calculate the time which was covered by the conversation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you listened to that conversation recently; am I correct? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes and no. I listened to it when your investigator asked me to authenticate the recordings and to determine whether these were indeed the recordings I had made. But I must say that this is not something very pleasant. This is not what I listen to before going to bed, not at all. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Regardless of what it might mean for you, Witness, the purpose for your testimony today before this Trial Chamber was to authenticate this recording as well as its contents. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, regarding the contents, I listened to the tape but I cannot tell you that I would be able to tell you exactly what was said, as if I were taking an exam. But I did listen to it, especially when I made copies of the tapes recently. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, in your evidence in chief you stated that during your stay in Kigali, you had at opportunity to interview General Dallaire; is that right? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, indeed, that was the case.

Yes, I read it when it came out, when it was published. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
May I forward to you a copy of some excerpts of that book that I would like to draw your attention to?

Very well.

@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is the case, Mr. President.

Are there any other documents that you would wish to give to this witness which the witness may need to look at before the questions are posed? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
There are some, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If that is the case, would it be a convenient method if we now had our 11 o'clock break, and during that break you will make sure that the witness, and all of us, receive those documents. He can acquaint himself with them, and then when we come back, the question and answers will run more smoothly. What that be all right?

@MR. NEKUIE: 
To add on to this general statement of General Dallaire in his book, Witness, I have distributed a document and it might not be necessary -- if you don't insist that a copy be given to you, I can give you the content of what I intend to refer to. These are reports that the services of Mr. Dallaire -- reports that were being -- that were made to the headquarters of the United Nations dated 8th April 1994. These are the documents that I have had distributed to all the parties. The first page, at the top right-hand side, has the date "8 April 1994," and the fifth page of that document, which has the Prosecution reference of K0086890, is dated 9th April. The date is mentioned at the top right-hand corner. On the fourth page, Witness, we have the daily reports, as I said, in which it is said in paragraph 9, "Telephone communications are out of order since 8 -- 08-09 April -- April '94. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and we agree that there is one additional word in that sentence which we didn't hear because the mike was not switched on, and that word is "rural". So it is "rural telephone communications". That's what you read into the mike.

Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:

In the last-but-one page of that document, the same reference is made at the bottom; that is, in paragraph 9, exactly the same report stating that telephone communications had been out of order since 8th April '94. These are reports from General Dallaire. 
Now, I am going to put the following question to you, Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you refer to now? First, you referred to paragraph 9 dated "MICS Arab 1", and that is what we read into the record, but you are also referring to another quote. Where do you we find that, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I made reference to the last-but-one page, Mr. President -- last-but-one page of the document, as it were. And that is -- has the K0086893 Prosecution number, and that is the last-but-one page of the bundle of documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is the one which I thought you read out in the first place, but is there another sentence in this document which you have read out to us. We have noted that your quote relates to the page with the last three digits being 893. Now, where is the other sentence which is relevant? Can you help us, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
What I read out initially was that sentence contained in the report of 8th April 1994. The two documents are linked together. But these are two reports referring to two different dates, and that first one was on page 4 of the document; page 4. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. So you have, in fact -- even if that is not clear in writing, what you have done is, first, to refer to a document dated the 8th of April and then to the document dated the 9th of April. And in both documents we find under "9", the same sentence, namely, saying that the telephone communications are out of order. Thank you very much. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That indeed is the case, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And these are reports emanating from General Dallaire which confirm the portion that I had you read out a while ago. Now, I would like to ask you this question following this presentation: Whether Bikumbi commune was in the rural area or within the urban section of Kigali? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
It appears to me that Bikumbi is in the rural section of Kigali, even if at the time I was from outside Rwanda and I had not been in the country for 30 years and I did not know the commune as such, but I think it was public knowledge that Bikumbi is part of the rural section. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. How do you explain, given that telephone communications had been out of order since 8 April '94, how could there have been a telephone conversation from that commune and for that conversation to have been intercepted? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I do not explain it; I just record it. I just recorded that conversation, which appeared to come from a telephone in a -- coming from a rural area at the time I have indicated. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You will agree with me, Witness, that if in the rural area the telephone lines were down, then that cast doubt on what you refer to as telephone conversation in your recordings. Do you admit that? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, I do not admit that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know whether the telephones were down from the 9th of April to the 18th of April? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
I really do not know anything about that. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, since you were at the CND during that period, were you using a telephone from CND to call the rural area? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At the CND where you were, were you able to use a telephone with 8 as the code? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I did not have any, and I do not know. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Since it was also public notice that that code was not being used any longer and that was the code for the rural area in Rwanda at the time, how then do you think that it can be admitted that this was a telephone conversation that you had intercepted? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I am not relying on a statement that you are saying. I do not know anything about telephone codes existing at the time. What I do know is that I recorded that conversation, which from all indications is a conversation -- a telephone conversation when you listen to the recording and read the transcripts. That is all I can say. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. Witness, since those events, have you had to -- have you had the opportunity to occupy any official position in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
From 2004 to 2006, I worked as the editor in chief of an independent radio station, and I was elected by the other journalists to the council of press -- or the council of media. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you elected or appointed to the council of media? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I was elected. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I am going to pass on to you this document -- which I would like the registry to come for -- and ask you to examine that document. And, then ask you if that is the document that states your appointment or election to the council of media? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, if the registry clerk can assist me.

@MR. NEKUIE (continued):
It is also a document that I have distributed. It is a statement of cabinet. It's entitled, "Statement of cabinet". 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you recognise this document? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
It is the first time I'm seeing it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Can you read for the Court the title on page 1, and then refer to the page with paragraph 11, which is highlighted in the document that I gave to you? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
"2005, an extraordinary cabinet meeting chaired by His Excellency, the President of the Republic, Kagame, Paul, was convened at village Urugwiro."
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And here we lost the first date. With other words: "On Friday 29th July". 
Remember to wait until the mike is on. 
And the village is spelt U-R-U-G-W-I-R-O. 
Yes? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
And as you requested me, paragraph 11 of this document is as follows: 
"Mr. Nsanzabaganwa, Straton, as member" -- oui -- "as a member of ORINFOR board of direct -- of directors, Mr. -- Mr. Kagame, Faustin, as member of the press high council."
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the first name was N-S-A-N-Z-A-B-A-G-A-N-W-A. And then, Straton, S-T-R-A-T-O-N. 
Yes? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, among the names that you have just read, you have your name; is this correct? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And that is the appointment that you referred to a while ago -- or, at least -- well, your admission into the press high council? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
If you allow me to present the procedure as it happened. I was, first of all, elected as representative of the private press and, then, subsequently -- well, this was announced on radio as well. I believe this is the document that was read on radio, but I did not see it. But it is true that my confirmation was done in an official manner, but that was before I was elected by my colleague journalists. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In English, we didn't get the first sentence under 11, which was "cabinet approved:" And then followed the two names that we have on record. 
Yes? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, as you -- the document as you read it is a statement appointing you? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, but I think I have just explained to you what I know. I was elected and I believe I was then approved, and I think that is the procedure for appointments to the press high council. To be a member of the press high council, that is the procedure. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And what are the duties of this press high council in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
In summary -- or, briefly, it is a supervisory body for the media, what is -- to control what is written and also to defend journalists. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you think that the press is free in Rwanda -- ever since you were a member of that high council? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, press freedom does not depend in (sic) my membership of the press high council. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Maybe you did not understand the import of my question. What I'm saying is that since you are a member of the press high council, which supervises media activities and also ensures the protection of journalists, do you think in that capacity -- being in that capacity, do you think that the press is free in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
First of all, let me say I'm no longer a member of that body. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But while you were a member, was the press free? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
There were problems which were reported, which were pointed out in the report of the high -- the press high council. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. And how long ago did you stop being a member of the press high council -- since the election of a new team to the press high council? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
A new team was formed, and I'm no member (sic) -- a member, and that's since April 1996. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you say April '96? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, I mean April 2006 -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness. 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
2006. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you are doing it again. Can't you remember to speak one at a time and remember the first sentence in rule 3: The pause. You see, we mix up questions and answers and we get only portions, and we want to have the substance both of the question and the answer. Please observe this, it's so simple. 
This document, Defence counsel, is in English? This is, maybe, not the original document? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
It is a copy that we got -- this is not the original document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, do you have the original version of this document in French or Kinyarwanda, probably with the stamp by the government -- or is it not available? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
As far as the Defence is concerned, for now, this is what we have. It is all we have. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will ask the Prosecution to check whether they may have it, and they can come back to us on that point. 
The next question, please? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, at the time you were a member of the press high council, is it too -- or, is it far-fetched to say that you were one of the main collaborators in the area of the press with the power -- the governing body -- the government at the time? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, that is far-fetched. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And why would it be far-fetched? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I do not even see why you are making this assertion.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What shall we do with the two of you? You are absolutely impossible today. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are sorry, says the witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That will be over in a moment, Mr. President, because I'm drawing to the end of my cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But, on Monday, we are expecting more from you. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Definitely, Mr. President, because I'm taking a measure of the negative impact of this manner of proceeding. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I haven't yet concluded, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I was asking you why you were saying that the body, which starts with the supervision of this kind of activity, that members of that body will not be the main collaborators of the chief executive of the state of Rwanda. Are you able to explain that? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I say so, because the statement is yours, and that is not my vision of things. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you ever hear about Father Theunis in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, I did. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this person on a spelling list? Could we have the spelling?

No, he is not and it is spelt T-H-E-U-N-I-S.

@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I read the press -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, and what does it say? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, I heard about -- about Father Theunis. It is indeed what he said, and it is true -- I am a man of the press and I am -- and I heard what had happened to him. He was arrested when he was passing through the Kigali airport, I believe. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And at the time he was arrested, what was he doing in Kigali? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I do not know. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you aware of his official activities? Did you know whether he was a journalist, as you are, or not? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, not at all -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says witness. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you hear in the media that one of the main witnesses accusing him was the -- Mr. Ndahiro -- you mentioned during your examination-in-chief? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, I believe I heard that, but -- yes, yes, indeed, I believe I read that. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. And as for yourself, regarding the audiotape you provided to the Tribunal, when you returned to Switzerland, was it of your own initiative or following a request of the Swiss examining magistrate that you went to make statements on this matter? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
What case are you referring to exactly? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Among the documents disclosed by the Prosecution regarding yourself, there is an excerpt of the proceedings when you appeared before the Swiss examining magistrate. And the question I'm putting to you is: Whether this hearing took place following a request by the magistrate or following your own initiative? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Of course, I'm willing to answer you, but could you, perhaps, explain to the Trial Chamber which trial you are referring to exactly? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you appear before an examining magistrate on the 5th of April 1995? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
With the date -- well, I might not have guessed, because this was a long time ago. But if I understand you correctly, it was Judge Nicati who was in charge of the Niyonteze case, which was indeed tried in Switzerland. So, could you please repeat your question, Counsel? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, I will gladly do so, Witness. I was asking you whether you went to the judge following a request made by him or by your own volition? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, it was following a request by the examining magistrate. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The date was the 5th of April 1995. 
And now the witness mentioned the name of the magistrate. That last name seems to be spelt as follows: N-I-C-A-T-I. 
And then you, Mr. Witness, mentioned the case against someone. Can you give us the name of that person? The spelling, please? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
It is Mr. Niyonteze N-I-Y-O-N-T-E-Z-E. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:

Musema Uwimana is spelt M-U-S-E-M-A (unintelligible). Uwimana is spelt U-W-I-M-A-N-A. 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
As far as I know, the trial before which I was called to testify was the Niyonteze trial and not the trial of the person you just referred to. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And with regard to the person I mentioned, Witness? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Sorry -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says, the witness. 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
-- yes, indeed, I believe I made a mistake, it is indeed Mr. Musema and not Mr. Niyonteze. Niyonteze was indeed tried in Switzerland, but I was not called to testify during his trial. It was, indeed, for 
Mr. Musema and I wish to apologise to the Court. This goes back to a long time ago. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness, and you also testified in the Niyonteze trial, am I correct? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, not at all, I did not testify in that trial. I did remember that I was summoned by Judge Nicati, but it was in the Musema case and not the Niyonteze case. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And regarding the Musema case, Witness, did you have any contribution to make in your capacity as a witness? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Oh, yes, of course, I was called to testify and I answered the questions that were put to me. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What about the facts Musema was charged with? Were you able to tell the examining magistrate what you were aware of? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, in fact, I had been summoned to provide clarification. I believe Mr. Nicati summoned me because I had published my news report in the newspaper, L'Hebdo, which is the most-known weekly in Switzerland, and I believe this kept -- struck the minds of people. And it was following this report that I was summoned by Judge Nicati. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. The last question on this line of questioning: Did you know at the time -- and do you know today, the newspaper called, Hirondelle? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
A newspaper called Hirondelle, no? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know a press agency called Hirondelle? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Yes, I do know the press agency. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you ever accuse this press agency regarding its editorial line or its activities? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, I believe the word accusation is not correct. I, indeed, wrote an article on the activities of the Hirondelle foundation in the field in Bukavu, but this is journalistic work and has nothing to do with accusations of any sort. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
In this journalistic work, Witness, did you indicate that the said foundation employed genocide perpetrators? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I never wrote such a thing. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did the -- did not the -- did that foundation sue you in Switzerland for having made such accusations? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
It, indeed, sued me for libel and slander, but not for the reasons you mentioned. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And what were the accusations which led you to be sued by this foundation? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, it was the article on its actions in Bukavu, as I stated previously, which was deemed to be slanderous by the foundation, but I won the trial. So, I was acquitted of the charges of slander and libel following a procedure that lasted close to eight years, because of all the appeals that were lodged by the foundation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the date of the final decision, which year? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Oh, I would have to have my notes in front of me. This took place a while ago, but I believe it was well before I went to Rwanda to work. So, it must have been prior to 2004, but we can find the dates without much problem. This was a trial that was mentioned in the press, that is well known and it is no secret. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, could you for the benefit of the Trial Chamber summarise the specific allegations you made against the Hirondelle foundation and which led to this suit? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an objection? 
@MR. TREDICI:
Yes, Your Honour, on the basis of relevance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Credibility. 
@MR. TREDICI:
Relevance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, credibility, of course, isn't that the point, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, I am trying to impeach the credibility of the witness with my questions, and I fail to understand why the Prosecution put such a question. 
@MR. TREDICI:
$(Microphones overlapping)... Clearly --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I can't hear you. Please, start your sentence again. 
@MR. TREDICI:
I said that the witness clearly said that he was found not guilty. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a different matter. 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
May I ask -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
May I, in turn, put a question to counsel? You are saying that you're trying to impeach my credibility. Can you do so with trials where I was found not guilty? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you think you will achieve anything here, Defence counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I was merely seeking some clarification. I am not dealing with the trial of the witness with Hirondelle. He referred to the activities of Hirondelle in his article on Bukavu, and all I wish for him to do is to enlighten the Trial Chamber on what he mentioned. This is not a new trial I am carrying out with the witness. 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Well, perhaps you should have come with my article -- the one that was put in question. I believe that would have been more helpful for the Trial Chamber, rather than asking me -- just like that -- to summarise a trial for which I was not found guilty. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are losing time now. The question is a normal question. There is no requirement for Defence counsel to show you the paper or what you previously did. Just give us a brief summary in three lines, can you help us? And then we'll move on. 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, I carried out an investigation on the work of the Hirondelle foundation in Bukavu, and I -- even though I never went to Bukavu, I took an interest in the work of the foundation, and I concluded that it was not morally sound to claim to have a neutral -- neutral reporting during a genocide. In the case of genocide, there are perpetrators and victims and I believe no one can be neutral in such a situation and it is rather taking sides with the perpetrators. 
I did not state that they were on the side of the perpetrators, but I did say that from the moral standpoint such an approach was not tenable, and I was proven right by the Swiss magistrate. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for your answer, Witness, following which -- which I wish to put it to you that in your capacity as a journalist, you believe you are seeking justice for the genocide. What do you say to that? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, I believe this would be a wrong interpretation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I put it to you, Witness, that it is as -- in your capacity as someone seeking justice for the genocide that you wrote this article? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
What do you mean by that, Counsel? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I believe, Witness, that you are educated enough to know what I mean. Can you answer my question? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, I'm not seeking justice, I am a witness of the genocide -- that is clear, and it is the reason for which I'm here today. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to give the Chamber this written statement by the witness or article? It's a bit difficult now to follow the discussion -- in particular, an exchange as to whether the purpose of an article we do not know was this or that. What is your plan now, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, if this statement of the witness is in the minutes of the proceedings, this will mark the end of the cross-examination by the Defence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document are you referring to now? Something you want to show us? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I did not refer to any document. I put two questions to the witness and he answered such suggestions. I have not referred to any document to submit to the attention of the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
"I put it to you, Witness, that in your capacity as someone seeking justice for genocide, it was in that capacity that you wrote this article". That was your question. An article is usually written. 
If you do not want to pursue that, it's fine with us. We just simply want to understand what's going on. 
What is your next question? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
But, Mr. President, that was not the suggestion I put. I believe what I said was not exactly translated. I said, following the answer given by the witness, that in his capacity as a journalist, he considered himself as being -- seeking justice for the genocide. That was the first suggestion I put to him. So in his quality as a journalist, he was seeking justice following the genocide. He answered this first suggestion. And my second suggestion was that his appearance here was also being carried out for the same reason. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that shows that there was a communication problem, which we have now been able to eliminate. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
And following the answers received, I am ending this cross-examination, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Any re-examination? 
@MR. TREDICI:
No, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you left Rwanda around 1974, is that so? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Left? Do you mean, after the news report I made, which was in 1994? I do not understand your question, Mr. President, my apologies. I did not understand your question, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a mistake in the translation, I will now repeat my question. You told us that you started working in Switzerland in 1974, was that so, or which year did you refer to? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
I left when I was a student, so I was not working at the time, but it was, indeed in, 1974. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that mean that you lived outside Rwanda from 1974 until your return there in early April 1994? Or did you go back to Rwanda and continue living there before '94? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
No, I left Rwanda in 1964, following acts of persecution, and I sought refuge abroad in different countries. And, in '74, I ended up in Switzerland. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you actually left your country in 1964? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Yes, indeed, in 1964. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did you first return to Rwanda on a permanent basis then? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
No, in fact, I went for this news report in 1994 -- that is to say, almost 30 days (sic) -- day for day after having left the country. And I found myself at the heart of the war and the genocide. But, subsequently, in September of 1994, I went back to Rwanda for a news report for the same newspaper, and then I return -- I would return to Switzerland. But, I -- I went back to Rwanda on a regular basis and the longest stay I made in Rwanda was in 2003. From 2003 to 2006, I worked as editor-in-chief for an independent radio station -- between 2004 and 2006. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you return to Rwanda in 2003 or 2004? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
In 2003, I went back, but I started working with the independent radio in 2004. So I came to Rwanda in 2003 for the radio station project, and we launched our activities in 2004. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And after 2006, where have you been living? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
I went back to Switzerland. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you have an identity card before 1964? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
In 1964, I was 16-and-a-half -- when I left Rwanda. Did I have an identity card? Yes, I do believe I had one. I remember specifically that I did have an identity card, because at the time, one's ethnicity appeared on the identity card. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is exactly the point of the question: What was the ethnicity stated on that card? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Tutsi. But if I may comment on that? Those are values which I refute completely; those are the racist manipulations which have led to the genocide. My true identity is Rwandan. I speak Kinyarwanda; I'm a Rwandan citizen; I have a Rwandan passport. And, Hutu/Tutsi, there -- it's the same language. These are manipulations, those are labels, and I do not like to be labelled. So I am mentioning this aspect to answer your question, but this is something I vigorously reject. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I understood that, Mr. Witness, that was why I asked you about the ID card in '64, because I noted that you hadn't filled in that point in your personal information sheet, assuming that this was your position. 
Now, to the recording. The total recording took about one hour; is that so? Concerning these telephone interceptions or whatever? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Yes, indeed, yes, but it was not in a continuous manner. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, on how many occasions did you switch on and off your microphone to hear possible telephone conversations? How many segments does this one hour recording consist of? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
For that, I need to refer to the transcripts, because at the time, you know, we were being shelled, and each time I had the opportunity -- two or three times, I believe, I had the opportunity to get close to those soldiers who had their walkie-talkie and then I made a request. I was even surprised that it was happening that way -- that they could listen. But, for me, it was a scoop -- an opportunity to have access to this kind of exclusive information. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two to three segments amounted to a total of one hour approximately? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
It appears to me so, but I will need to refer to the transcripts and to listen to the recording to be very specific in my answer. But, I wouldn't know -- there's one thing that we can observe, that this recording sometimes contained songs, because at one point in time I had to use a cassette recorder, which contains songs that I had recorded earlier on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was exactly the next question: How do you explain that there is music on the tape? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
This was my tape which contained music -- I had music of my choice, and when the blank cassettes were exhausted, because I recorded a lot of things from the RTLM radio station, and then recorded interviews. So, finally, I had this tape with music recorded on it, so I recorded on top of the music. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the music was yours? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Yes, that is right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How many telephone conversations would you say that you recorded in total during these three segments amounting to a total of one hour? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Please, repeat the question. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How many telephone conversations would you think you recorded during that hour of tape recordings? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Two or three -- two or three, I think so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
These three segments amounted to a total of about one hour's tape recording. What was the total time span used to record that hour? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
If I understood clearly, you're referring to that one hour of recording -- well, I was recording live, so it was the same duration. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There were no stops in-between? Was this a continuing one-hour recording or were there three different periods within the one-hour recording? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
It appears there were three different periods, but the recording was bad -- there were interruptions and things like that, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly, so with other words, the total time it took you to record these three segments was more than an hour? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
Well, I must say that -- let me say it again, that I need to listen to the recording again. What is important is that I was contacted. These people, who had their walkie-talkie -- and I recorded whenever I could. But, it's possible that I am not understanding your question because the duration of the recording is the same for me as the total number of hours that that represents. But, I'm sorry if I did not understand your question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you record these telephone conversations on the same day? 
@WITNESS KAGAME:
I need to check on that. I believe -- I remember it was between the 15th and the 18th. It appears to me that it was on -- but, whether it was on the same day, I wouldn't know. It may well be two different days, but I have to refer to the transcripts. 
What I do know is that I did these recordings in -- under very difficult conditions. I did the recording whenever I could. Now, whether it was on the same day, I really cannot recall. It may well be that it was on a day -- and, then, the following day. But it was during the same period in any event. 
$(Pages 33 to 45 by Jean Baigent)
1240H 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are then not excluding that on two different occasions you were allowed to go up to these soldiers and record what was happening? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, if I was not asking them for permission, they were just ordinary soldiers who had their walkie-talkie, and whenever I thought it could be done, I asked them to do so. It was not asking for permission from a commanding officer, no, it was something that was just happening like that. That's it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The point was not asking for permission, the point is that you are not excluding then that these recordings were made over two days, not on one occasion, two occasions. That's what you've explained. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I am not excluding that -- I am not excluding that.
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, did you use this material in any way after you have recorded this? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, not at all. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Yes, according to your testimony, the RPF authorities asked you to give them these materials; am I correct? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Yes, yes, that is true, but I did not use it in any event. I did not even know that this kind of technology existed at the time, so I did not use it. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
So how did they come to know that you were in possession of this material? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
Well, because we discussed it. I was with people. I was at CND. I went to Mulindi. There were people around me. We had them listened to these recordings. It's as simple as that, and then I also said that it is the person who was my guide is the one I gave the recordings to. He was somebody who was living there. He gave it to them. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
This one year recording, is this the only recording you have carried out? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, I believe I explained to you that I recorded. I was working as a journalist so I took with me tapes to make recordings, so I recorded a lot of things. I recorded RTLM Radio, I conducted interviews, I even recorded noise from the war. Well, anything a journalist could do to record information. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much, but I meant the telephone conversation, the interception of the telephone conversation, not any other recordings. Did you do any other -- did you record any other telephone conversation? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
No, the one I submitted is the only one I did. The one I presented to your Court is the only one. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
And this is a technical question. Could you explain to us: How was it possible to listen into this telephone -- online telephone conversation through walkie-talkie? Is it possible? Can you do it? 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
I really do not know anything about that. The fact is that that is how it happened. I would imagine 
that -- I'm sorry. I would imagine that there was a possibility for the RPF people to be able to go on that frequency, but I cannot go into that detail. The fact is that that is how it happened. That's all. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness. We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and we wish you a very safe journey home. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you. 
@WITNESS KAGAME: 
It's for me to thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I just like to mention that I forgot to say that I would like to enter into evidence the documents that I presented to the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be assisted out of the courtroom, please. 
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The next witness, please. 
@MR. MOSES:
Sorry, there is the issue of the admission. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay, the next witness is Dr. Des Forges. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is she available this afternoon? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, she is. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Yes, let's then first deal with the admissions or the admission of documents. You requested the following to be tendered, Prosecution. Shall we start with you, one by one? 
@MR. TREDICI:
Your Honours, we are seeking to have the audio tape marked KT001084, and the three versions of the transcript, Kinyarwanda, French and English admitted into evidence. And for the record, I have just -- the transcript I used, as you could see, are the ones that Mr. Matemanga has in his hands now, and the names -- the references of the people of that (inaudible) were speaking there according to the person that worked on this transcript, were deleted to avoid any mistake. So, you could only find there the conversation without the names of the people that someone else has assigned, and I am giving you time to -- because I also distributed copies for the Defence and for the Judges, so you can check from there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have previously received a copy of the various versions of the transcripts in our binder. Is that still the same version? 
@MR. TREDICI:
Yes, Your Honour, that's the same version, but I deleted the references to the names that were assigned to the speakers, because that could create confusion, and that's the one I used today and I distributed copies for the Judges, for the Defence, and that's the copy that the witness used and that's the copy that Mr. Matemanga has in his hands now. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But doesn't that imply that a document which has for quite some time been presented with a mistake, according to the Prosecution, that this was Mr. Karera, now that mistake doesn't appear anymore? That is the effect of your deletion; isn't it? 
@MR. TREDICI:
That's it, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe that could cause confusion to delete actually, because this has been a big issue in the case. 
@MR. TREDICI:
Then we leave it as it is. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in other words, you are suggesting the version we have in the binders plus the tape? 
@MR. TREDICI:
That is correct, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the only exhibit on behalf of the Prosecution? 
@MR. TREDICI:
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the Defence. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, the confusion does not relate to this redacted document alone, but also on the audio recording. The witness was not able to tell us which portion of the recording contains the conversation that the Prosecutor is referring to for the Court was recorded. The witness also said that there was a lot of recording done on this tape, which we did not hear. We did not know if it refers to 
Mr. Renzaho and we do not understand how the Prosecutor can request that the totality of this recording be produced as an exhibit in the Renzaho case, whereas we are dealing strictly with the Renzaho case. The Defence, therefore, will oppose the production of the recording as produced by 
the -- presented by the Prosecutor to your Court. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You've heard the objection by the Defence. Is there any comment on the objection? 
@MR. TREDICI:
Just one very brief comment. I think that the Trial Chamber and the Defence knows what we will be relying on on this audio tape recordings, and the audio tape has been recognised by the witness in its entirety. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will analyse the totality of the situation including the submissions by the parties, the cross-examination, the examination-in-chief today and we will then make a ruling on the admission of that exhibit, in other words, the audio tape and the three transcripted versions. 
Now, to the Defence exhibits. You had the documents that you wanted to tender. Let's take them one by one. You started with the Dallaire document. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That is so, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 32.
$(Exhibit No. D. 32 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. Then, I think you proceeded to the -- to two daily reports, dated the 18th -- sorry, the 8th and the 9th of April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have that as one exhibit number? They seemed to be stapled together. Mr. Matemanga. 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 33.
$(Exhibit No. D. 33 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then there was the statement of cabinet decision. Prosecution, do you have this document by the cabinet in some more official version, or are we left with this English non-original version? 
@MR. TREDICI:
We haven't checked, Your Honour, but we can do it over the weekend or today. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be helpful, but there is no objection to the tendering of this document? 
@MR. TREDICI:
No objection at all.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Mr. Matemanga.
@MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 34.
$(Exhibit No. D. 34 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything else from the Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President. I just like to point out to the Court, without going back to your decision, in that up until now, contrary to what we believe, the French version of your decision on the amendment of the list of witnesses has still not been disclosed to us, and in spite of the request that we have made, verbal though they might be, we still do not have disclosure of this. We think that for the record, we need to make this statement so that our rights could be respected in due course. That is all I wanted to say regarding your decision on the amendment of the list of witnesses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In other words, this is not a matter of disclosure, it's a matter of translation of the Chamber's decision of the 16th of February, and that French version is not available to the Defence, and that is noted for the record. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That is so, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand then that the Prosecution did not want the pages from that little book as an exhibit. That is noted. 
@MR. TREDICI:
Not, Your Honour. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, one final point, if I can. I am not going to address you regarding it, but I am just going to ask that a decision of the ICTY of Brdjanin, a decision on the Defence's objection to intercept evidence, be given to Your Honours. I've got a copy for the Defence, and I just simply ask Your Honours to take that decision into account in your deliberations because it appears to be relevant and on point. Thank you, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this decision which is also now given to the Defence is spelt B-R-D-J-A-N-I-N. And if the Defence has any comments, they can come back to us, but very soon. But not now, because now we want to hear the next witness, please. 
@MR. MOSES:
While we are waiting for the witness to be -- 
$(Witness entered courtroom) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Good afternoon, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Alison Des Forges in English)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you with your signature; is that so? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the information in that document is correct; isn't it? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It is. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga. 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 93.
$(Exhibit P. 93 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. Is there any dispute as to the expert status of this witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
I can indicate, Your Honour, that nothing has been filed under Rule 94 bis. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's noted. So we can then simply proceed with the testimony. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That, indeed, is the case, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much to the Defence. 
Prosecution. 
$ALISON DES FORGES
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
##
$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Good afternoon, Dr. Des Forges. Can I ask that you be shown this document? Dr. Des Forges, is the document before you a copy of the report that you prepared for this trial titled: "Genocide in Kigali city"? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It is. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And I believe you got the English and the French translation of your report there? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, if I can commence by asking you by looking at pages 1 to 7 of your report, is it a fair summary of the matters contained in the first seven pages that they cover the historical background of both Rwanda and its politics, and the background as it relates to the genocide of 1994? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And can you briefly -- can you tell the Trial Chamber why you consider that the historical background is important to the other matters that you subsequently raised in your report? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Every historical event, of course, has a context in which it must be understood. An event as complex and as difficult as the Rwandan genocide, cannot begin on April the 6th. We must understand the history of war and certainly the perception of history, which are sometimes not the same thing as the actual history, but the perception of history of relations between Hutu and Tutsi. That, of course, is essential. We must understand the intensively administered nature of the Rwandan state, because it was that state and its military forces which were called into play. And we must understand also the complex and conflictual relations that existed among Hutu, because the regional partisan and economic divisions among Hutu are essential to understanding the way the genocide developed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. On page five of the report, and I think it is on page 6 in French under the heading, "Provisions of the Arusha Accords, Political Arrangements", you have referred to the division of seats in government to the various political parties which were made as a result of the accords. Are you aware, if any, of such arrangements existed in respect of the political parties as to the assignment of préfets in the préfectures? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you answer that question, you now referred to page 5. Now, what is the K-number of that document? You see, we have the copy of the report where we do not find that title. What is your K-number? 
@MR. MOSES:
K0378901. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Up until now, we've only received the provisional version of the report. We were told that the final version is similar. This is just to say that I do not have the document with the markings that has just been referred to because that will facilitate the task. So I wish that this document is disclosed to us so that we are able to better follow the discussions -- the proceedings. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this is certainly a confusion that we will wish to avoid. Can you assist us in view of what the Defence just said, please? 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, we provided a translation -- French translation in court to my learned friend, which didn't head into that stage being put into -- being disclosed through registry, and I understand that did not have a K-number attached to it. The very same report has been disclosed with K-numbers, and should have been served on the Defence. It is the exact report -- it is the exact same report as the one without K-numbers that was given to them in court. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We all remember that a copy of the French version, subject to revision, was given to the Defence in the courtroom. We were then told that there was no need for revision. You are now referring to that version. That version does not have K-numbers, but it is in the possession of the Defence. It seems to us that by you referring now to page 6 of the French version; namely, that document, that should make it clear which document we are referring to, and I see that the Defence is nodding. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I hear that, but you see that a while ago, there was a reference to a specific page with a certain reference. It is difficult for us to follow. I do not want us to create a confusing situation, because we do not have that document. So if there should be a difficulty, you will know how it happened. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted, but for the time being we are on page 6 of the French version, and the title you find 
there -- and we are all following the document. And now the answer, please. 
@MR. MOSES:
Sorry, Your Honours, I am just about to provide the Defence with another copy of the disclosure including the report. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you able to remember my question, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, I am. The question was: Was there a division among political parties of the post of préfet? And yes, there was an arrangement among political parties distributing the post of préfet throughout the country. This, I was aware of, beginning in 1992 through discussions with various préfets, including Préfet Kayishema, who was the préfet of Kibuye, and Préfet Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana, who was the préfet of Butare préfecture, and who both indicated to me that their appointment had to do with implementing an arrangement whereby Kibuye was designated for the PSD party, a party of 
Mr. Kayishema, and that Butare was allocated to the liberal party. 
Subsequently, for example, in Butare préfecture, when the préfet of Butare was changed during the course of the genocide, this required some negotiations between the Liberal party and other parties so that Butare préfecture would be allocated to the socialist -- to the Socialist Democratic party, and where other arrangements will be made to assure that the Liberal party retain a préfecture. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the conversations you had with these two persons took place when; approximately, which year? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Your Honour, the conversations took place with Mr. Kayishema in January -- with both of them, it was in January of 1993. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you aware, from any information you have received, what the situation was insofar as the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The préfet of Kigali-ville was Colonel Renzaho, who was named when the préfecture of the city was established. That was prior to the institution of this arrangement as such among the political parties, but his appointment was not changed at that time. Officially, of course, as a military officer during the multiparty period, Colonel Renzaho was not permitted to be political party member, but his unofficial allegiance was thought to be, and by all indications, continued to be, with the MRND party. So in that sense, the préfecture of Kigali would have been assigned to the MRND. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, on page 7 of your report in English, that's under the heading of, "Stepping up preparation for violence", you have it, I believe, it is on page 8 of the French, you have a sub-heading, "Militia and civilian self-defence". Why do you have that heading, "Militia and civilian self-defence" under the heading of, "Stepping up preparation for violence"? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
During the period following the signing of the Arusha Accords, the final accords, in August 1993, the war was officially ended, but yet it is clear from the historical records that preparations continued on both sides for further combat and violence. On the side of the Hutu Power group, and I carefully make the distinction not on the side of the government as such, but on the side of the Hutu Power group, these preparations included the expansion, training and arming of militia, and the development of the civilian self-defence system. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, what is the problem of having a civilian self-defence force during a time of war? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
To begin with, I will note that the preparations which I have just been referring to were taking place not during a time of war, but during a time of peace, during the period from August 1993 until April 1994. But during a time of war, of course, a self-defence force can be a legitimate exercise of governmental initiative in order to protect the nation. In this context, the force became illegitimate and, in fact, illegal because of its use against non-combatant civilians, who were unarmed, and who were defined largely on the basis of ethnicity. It was the exercise of the civilian self-defence force against that particular target which rendered it illegitimate. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, under the -- that same heading, you referred to correspondence from the army chief of staff, General Nsabimana, who was reporting to the minister of defence, that army officers had met the day before the 30th of March to plan the defence of neighbourhoods in Kigali in the tracking down and neutralisation of infiltrators in different parts of the city. 
@MR. MOSES:
I will ask, please, that the witness be given the exhibit folder number 1, and if I can also indicate to Your Honours, I am going to ask the witness to look at Prosecution Exhibit 24, it is under tab 19. 
Madam Registrar, I wonder if the whole bundle could be given to Dr. Des Forges because I will be referring to a number of those documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, because you are going to use several exhibits in that binder, so that's a good suggestion. 
@MR. MOSES:
Exactly. Not good enough. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, if you look at the document, do you recognise that? 
A. 	I do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is that the letter that you've referred to in your report? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct. It is one part of an exchange of correspondence. This is the first letter in the exchange. It was followed by a response from the préfet of Kigali, but this is the letter which was from the head of the general staff, General Nsabimana, to the minister of defence, copies to the préfet of Kigali and to various other military officers. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Briefly, Dr. Des Forges, what is the importance -- or is there -- what importance do you place on this letter? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The letter recounted to the minister of defence a meeting which had been held to further plan the creation of the civilian self-defence system. It's important to indicate the extent to which the organisation had been carried at that point that the committee which we now know had been formed originally in June of 1993, and had had activity again, increased activity at the end of October 1993, was at a state, by March 1994, of being prepared to organise the recruitment -- or the naming and identification of persons who would be implementing the civilian self-defence system, and helping to neutralise the people who were called infiltrators. It is significant ,also in paragraph 10, in indicating the kinds of arms which were to be used in this effort, and the directive or the decision of the committee passed on by General Nsabimana was that the bourgmestres were to inform the 
population -- or to instruct the population on the use of traditional arms, not simply firearms, but also traditional arms, including swords, spears, machetes, and bows and arrows, given that it was not -- it was anticipated that the firearms would be insufficient for the effort. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you have any idea why the document is labelled "très secret"? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The civilian self-defence system was at this point a highly confidential operation being carried out by a relatively small group of people. It was not at that point generally known even among some officers of the gendarmerie, for example, and the previous document from February of 1994, dealing with the organisation of this system, was notable for the exclusion of the prime minister, so that here we have -- and this is one reason why I spoke previously about the organisation of a group who can most easily be identified as the Hutu Power group, rather than the government as such, as the organisation force behind this effort, because the government included persons from political parties opposed to the MRND, including the prime minister, who was a representative of the MDR, and she was not included, for example, in the task assigned under the organisation of civilian self-defence. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, if you could be also shown Prosecution Exhibit 25, under tab 20. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't we, Mrs. Ben Salimo, place the entire folder in front of the witness? Shall we do that? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, do you see the document in front of you? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I am not sure that this is the one to which you are referring. Is the document meant to be a continuation of the series we were looking at? That's 34, you want 25? It's 25.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, a suggestion. You are now going to look with the witness at some of the documents in that folder. Could you indicate to us already now the document numbers that you are going to refer to, in other words, Prosecution exhibit numbers. The present one is number? 
@MR. MOSES:
Number 25. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES:
The next one will be Prosecution Exhibit 50; it is one of the radio transcripts. Then 
Prosecution Exhibit 62, then Prosecution Exhibit 57, Prosecution Exhibit, 16, 19, 21, 22, 51. That will take us forward. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Dr. Des Forges, there is a practical suggestion to be made now. Could you write down the following numbers please? Mr. Moses, correct me if I got it wrong, but apparently the numbers are the following: Prosecution Exhibit number 25, 50, 62, 57, 16, 19, 21, 22, and 51. And these are the documents, I think, we will revert to Monday morning at 8:45. So if you just could make sure that they are easily available on Monday morning, then we will continue at that point in time. Is there anything else of a practical nature we should address now? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour, if I can disclose, we've had three English translations of transcripts -- radio transcripts for which we only had the French earlier, to which I will be referring. I've got copies for Your Honours, and I think for the registry and for my learned friends. And so, that's one practical point. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So this means that when we are in the courtroom on Monday morning at 8:45, we will not only bring with us the present binder, but also the binder with radio transcripts plus these you just gave us. 
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely, Your Honour. In fact, most of the documents are going to be the radio transcripts that we referred to. And, to that end, Dr. Des Forges has -- we have provided her with her own copy of the bundle of documents with the same tab numbers and Prosecution exhibit numbers. So, she, I believe, has that with her. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any other documents we should make sure that we have with us on Monday? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No. Any practical issues from the Defence side? Anything we need to raise now before we adjourn for today? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, the Defence doesn't want to make any claims as such, but we would have liked to know what the pace of the extra hearings would be, because nobody has told us anything. We think that Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, that is what was indicated to us, we thought it would be a video linked witness, who was to be followed by the testimony of Mrs. Des Forges. I believe it is important for us to be aware of the pace of hearings. We are not coming here as tourists or observers, but as actors in these proceedings. This means that before we come here, the Tribunal, as you would understand, we have to be prepared. I do not know what the pace of the hearings would be, and I would, therefore, like our colleague to make a suggestion or enlighten us on this and the Bench should tell us exactly what is going to happen. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a perfectly legitimate question and I was just about to raise now how to proceed next week. Now, because of the time difference between Arusha and the country from which the witness will testify by video link, we can only start in the afternoon. I understand that that country is possibly willing to start at a time according to that country which will equivalent 4 o'clock Arusha time. Is that so? 
@MR. MOSES:
That's what I have been advised, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That means that in order to organise our time efficiently, we can then hear the expert from 8:45 to 
one o'clock, then we have the lunch break from one o'clock to 2:30, then we continue with the expert from 2:30 to 3:30, then we have 30 minutes break because of the technical need for a pause before the video link, and we start with the video link at 4 o'clock. That is the timetable which is suggested. This division of work between the present witness in Arusha and the video link in the afternoon has been followed in previous cases, and it has shown to be a good way to proceed. Is this all right? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. An additional question, but it is addressed to my colleague. The time lapse provided for the video conference, would we begin at 4 p.m., when will it end, the video conference? Can you give us an estimate of how long it will take please? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
One issue is how long your examination-in-chief shall be, and you may answer that. Another issue is how long the Bench thinks, in view of staff welfare, that we should sit in the evenings. Now, let's start with the first question. 
@MR. MOSES:
I will estimate, approximately, one hour to one-and-a-half hours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That should mean that the examination-in-chief will go on from approximately four to 5:30 on Monday, and then we will not hear the Defence on Monday. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, sir, I am enlightened, Mr. President, and I thank you for that clarification. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That brings us to the end, and at least of this Friday, and we wish you a good weekend. The Court is adjourned until Monday morning.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, at the break on Friday afternoon we were trying to locate a document which is Prosecution Exhibit 25. It is under tab 20 of the first volume of documents. Do you recognise that document, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, this is a letter from the prefect, Colonel Renzaho, to the chief of general staff of the army. It is subsequent to the document which we examined on Friday pertaining to civilian self-defence. And this document forwards to the chief of staff a list of several hundred persons, along with the -- their location in the city -- persons who are to be relied upon in the civilian self-defence programme. 
I would note that if you turn overleaf after the first cover sheet, where the list itself begins, that you will see under the initial heading the listing of commune, secteur, and cellule, indicating that the standard -- or the usual Rwandan administrative hierarchy is being put into play for this civil self-defence system. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Dr. Des Forges, on page 9 of your report in the English version, it's under -- it's on page 11 of the French, under the heading "New government and the genocide", you say that, "The new authorities hurried to dispel these concerns in a meeting of préfets on April 11 and through radio appeals for Hutu unity broadcast by the minister of defence and influential politicians on April 12. They stressed that partisan interests must be put aside in the battle against the common enemy, the Tutsi." 
What I would like your comment on, Dr. Des Forges, is whether that was a theme which was a common theme during the early days of the genocide; namely, that interests -- self interests had to be put aside in the battle against the common enemy, the Tutsi? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Indeed it was a repeated theme in radio broadcasts and in popular meetings as the authorities and political leaders attempted to ensure that the tensions, which I spoke of originally in the historical section -- the regional tensions, the partisan tensions, and even the economic class tensions -- not distract people from what was the essential concern: The battle against the Tutsi. And here I would recall a phrase in the document -- in the September 1992 document, which is commonly called "The definition of the enemy document," in which there is specific reference to the distraction of people from the ethnic conflict by other concerns such as partisan and regional concerns. So that was a major issue for authorities and political leaders at the start of the genocide, and then again at the end of the genocide where we begin to see substantial amounts of violence among Hutu. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Was it made clear by persons in positions of authority at the beginning and during the genocide that it was, in fact, the Tutsi who were the enemy? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It was made clear in a variety of ways by the use of coded references in general, and by, on occasion, more blatant and straightforward language, particularly on the part of certain political leaders, less so on the part of the administrative authorities, and then again particularly through the mouthpiece of RTLM. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, I would like you, please, if I could, to turn to Prosecution Exhibit 57. It's under tab 11 of the radio broadcasts. It's the broadcast of the 11th of May 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, my apologies, but I was not able to hear the reference of the document my learned friend wishes to refer to, especially since I cannot locate it in the list of documents which were given to us by him on Friday. What is the specific document, if you please? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's Prosecution Exhibit 57. It's found under tabulation 11 in the folder of material of radio broadcasts. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you have that document in front of you, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you found it, Defence? This is probably, in English, K number, K0271979. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am there. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just for my friend, I will be referring to, where applicable, the French transcripts and the page, paragraph, and the line reference for both English and French to assist all parties. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
First of all, just in passing, Dr. Des Forges, do you note on, I think, pages 11 to 13 of the English -- and it's pages 13 to 16 of the French -- in that transcript there is an interview with the Accused Renzaho? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I see that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And then starting on page 14 of the English and page 16 of the French, is there an interview on Radio Rwanda there with Rwajekare, spelt R-W-A-J-E-K-A-R-E? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That's correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know who Mr. Rwajekare was, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
He was a member of parliament and a bureaucrat in the administration. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Looking firstly on page 16 of the English, the second paragraph, commencing on the fifth line -- and in the French it's on page 23, the first paragraph commencing at line 5 -- it states that:
"The people have understood that and are getting to face them and conquer them, for the problem is now clear. It is the Tutsi who want to take over power again using manoeuvres. The people cannot allow the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi to take over again by force the power that they lost through elections. If they do so, they will exterminate the majority. The people are therefore determined to fight relentlessly against these Inyenzi with all their might and resources." 
Dr. Des Forges, are you able to comment on that passage and how it fits in with what you have just said regarding what persons in authority had to say about the common enemy? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
This passage incorporates a number of significant references; first of all, the distinction between the people and the Tutsi. It is frequent during this period for both authorities and political speakers to use the people as a term equivalent to "the Hutu", thereby excluding Tutsi from the circle of description -- from the discourse referring to ordinary Rwandans. The -- it is the Tutsi and not the RPF referred to here in the first line as "those who want to take over", and again "to take over again". The link between present events and the previous monarchical regime is an important theme throughout this period and here it is found again. And then again the equation between Tutsi in that sentence and the parallel structure in the following sentence where the phrase is Inyenzi-Inkotanyi instead of Tutsi. So, once again, underlining that Inyenzi-Inkotanyi equates to Tutsi. Then, again, the warning that if the RPF wins, they will exterminate the majority. 
Beginning in 1991, there is the reference to genocide used by Hutu propagandists as meaning a genocide against the majority to be carried out by the RPF and/or the minority. So, here again, that theme is struck with the idea that the minority will, in fact, be able to exterminate the majority. The emphasis upon protection, self-protection, protection against an eventual risk of extermination, is the essential foundation of the system of self-defence; people are called to protect themselves against the danger of extinction. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. If I can ask you to look at page 19 of the English, in the second paragraph commencing at line 7; and in French it's page 25 in the fourth paragraph, commencing with the words, "The only remark, perhaps, is that the conseillers and the heads of cellules should show greater enthusiasm and collaborate with the people. For, if you are teaching people to defend themselves, to face the enemy, if it is a government decision, it means that it has force of law at the local administrative levels, préfets, bourgmestres, conseillers, leaders of cellules and heads of ten households, youth leaders, and political party representatives; indeed, the defence problem is an issue that is of interest to every honest inhabitant of Rwanda, especially the Hutu, since he is the one facing the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi at the moment." 
@MR. CANTIER: 
If I may, I -- the page you provided does not correspond to what you are reading out. My learned friend, perhaps you could give me the reference per K number, which might be easier to follow than with the pages. So, can I have the K number in the French version, please? 
@MR. MOSES: 
My friend is quite correct. I apologise. It is page 23 not 25, commencing on the fifth line; and the K number is K0247765. I apologise for that. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, are you able to comment in respect of this passage in regard to the matters you have been commenting on? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Again, the distinction between "people" and "Tutsi"; the idea in the final line that it is the Hutu who are facing the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, in other words, that Tutsi have no right to be -- to feel themselves at risk, that it is only the Hutu who need to feel at risk. And then the reference once again to the complete administrative structure from the préfet down to the level of the heads of ten households, the involvement of the political parties, as well as the administrative system, through the youth leaders -- that means, basically, militia and Interahamwe leaders -- and political party representatives. And then, perhaps, most significant, the reference to this self-defence effort being a government decision, meaning it has the force of law, and administrators are those who have the authority, the force and the duty of enforcing the administrative regulations, and that is why the civilian administration is called upon -- is implicated in the execution of this civil self-defence programme. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. The next portion I would like you to look at please is on page 21 of the English version. It is the third paragraph, which commences, first point, and in particular from the sixth line downwards commencing, "Moreover, the people". And, in the French, it is on page 23 -- I am sorry. This time it's on page 25, the fourth paragraph commencing, "no interpretation" and, in particular, from the sixth line down. Do you have the passage in front of you, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I can just quickly read it: "Moreover, the people must understand that there is only one problem now, the problem between the Hutu and the Tutsi. Every Hutu, wherever he may be, must fight this war in collaboration with his brother, his sister, and his neighbour. This is not a war between political parties. There have been political parties, and I believe in multiparty politics, but for the time being, the general problem is the fight against the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, against the Tutsi". 
Once again, Dr. Des Forges, are you able to comment briefly in respect of that quote? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It simply reinforces the earlier references to the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi and to the need for all Hutu to join together in fighting against the Tutsi, who are the problem. 
What I was doing, when I looked back at the beginning, was to check the date, because the -- it's very interesting that this excerpt is broadcast on the 10th of May, which is an indication of the continuing importance. I am actually surprised that it is so late in the sequence of events, and indicates then a slight change in my own interpretation to find something this concerned with partisan -- possible partisan conflict at a period when the genocide itself is already well advanced. So it's an indication of the continuing importance of this theme throughout the events. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now in the English document. Where do you find that this was transmitted on the 10th of May? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, I was referring to a table at the start of the index to these documents; this is tab 11. It is identified as a transcript of a Radio Rwanda broadcast on 10 May, tape 970; and on the cover page of the transcripts it's identified as tape 970 with the month of May, although no date in the month of May is given. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So even if the date 10th is not in the document itself, it follows from the front page of the binder? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
That is correct, Your Honour. That was my reference. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This document we are going through now contains several interviews; two on side A and two on side B. And we have so far concentrated on the interview by Mr. Rwajekare. Do we know whether these interviews are for separate interviews or interviews during the same transmission? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I do not know, Your Honour. It is not indicated. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But we do know that all four were transmitted on the 10th, or is it only the front page which gives us that basis? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, I have not read these with an eye to confirming the date from the content, but I will, during the pause -- or perhaps at lunch time, look for indicators within the content itself to see if that can help us to establish that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So far, it doesn't follow from the evidence that the interview with Mr. Rwajekare took place together with an interview, say, of Mr. Renzaho. That we do not know yet, or is that something we will be informed of later? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, the only point, perhaps, that I could direct Your Honours and Dr. Des Forges to is page 13 of the English, and I don't know the corresponding -- it seems to be the commencement of side B, which commences -- or recommences with a continuation of an interview with the Accused, and then there appears to be a journalist who comes in and commences interviewing Mr. Rwajekare. There is nothing to indicate that they were together when the interview was conducted. But it does appear that they are -- it is a continuation of the radio programme or broadcast. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
At least what we seem to possibly know now is that on side B we find a reference both to the Accused and to this gentleman. But whether side B is a continuation of side A, we do not know yet. 
@MR. MOSES: 
No. I think that's a fair comment. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I had not raised any objection because I was not aware of what my learned friend wished to achieve when referring to the interview of this gentleman, Rwajekare. But it was clear in my mind, as is often the case with radio programmes we have in our files, people who were being interviewed one after the other. Sometimes there are dialogues, but in my mind, it was clear that Mr. Renzaho was interviewed, and that subsequently -- and I don't know how long afterwards -- Mr. Rwajekare was interviewed. That is how the Defence understood those transcripts. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. We may have further submissions on this later on. 
Do you want to continue on to this document or move on to the next one? 
@MR. MOSES: 
One more point in respect of this document. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And, Dr. Des Forges, if you could please look at page 22 of the English, the second paragraph, which commences with the words "The first". And, for the French, it's on page 26 and it's the third paragraph, commencing, (French spoken). Dr. Des Forges, if I can just briefly read it. It says:
"The first thing that Rwandans must understand is that they must fight in this war, that they must not always put their belongings on their heads and flee from the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi who do not even number one million, whereas the Hutu number about six million". 
Now the question I want to ask you is approximately how many soldiers were there in the RPF? If you could tell us that, if you are aware. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The figure being used at the time of the Arusha Accords was less than 30,000. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So the reference to Inyenzi-Inkotanyi "not even numbering one million", what in your opinion does that refer to? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Once again, that is a reference to the Tutsi as an ethnic group rather than to the combatant force of RPF. 
I would simply, on the question of -- from the President earlier about the date, I would say here that the phrase telling people "not to put their belongings on their head and flee" would at least, in part, confirm that this was a reference to the month of May, rather than earlier, because it was beginning at that time there were massive population movements that concerned the authorities, late April or early May, I would say, at least. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, Dr. Des Forges, looking at your report on page 10 -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you leaving this document now?
@MR. MOSES:
I am. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Now, this Mr. Rwajekare, you said he was a member of parliament and a bureaucrat. And that also follows from page 14 of this transcript. It is stated on page 14 that he was a resident of Kigali town, a member of parliament, he came from Rushashi, he had worked in the ministry of foreign affairs, the ministry of justice. Now, why is the statement of this Mr. Rwajekare of importance, a small apparatchik?
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
It is important for a couple of reasons, Your Honour. The transcriptions of the radio broadcasts, which have been preserved and are available to us for analysis, represent only a small part of the total corpus of what was broadcast during this period. That makes it sometimes difficult to evaluate the tenor of the entire range of what was said at this time. Finding a statement like this, which is so blatant in its ethnic overtones and in its incitations for violence against an ethnic group, is relatively rare. It is of significance that it was broadcast on Radio Rwanda, rather than on Radio RTLM, because the national radio was Radio Rwanda; that was the voice of the government as opposed to RTLM. And although many listeners did not make that distinction, it is still an important distinction to be made. In addition, Radio Rwanda was the radio, because it was the authoritative radio. It was the radio used by the prefects, not simply the Accused but other prefects, and other authorities at the national level, to deliver government orders to the population. 
So, here, yes, this is a minor apparatchik, in a sense, but he is a member of parliament, and he is speaking on the national radio. It is certainly imaginable that a significant number of listeners, hearing a member of parliament expressing such ideas on the national radio used by authorities to deliver government orders, would easily assume that such statements did in fact represent the position -- the official position. In addition, it is significant because this person, who ranks relatively low down in the hierarchy, probably, can help us to understand what was being said and thought by people who were not in the highest circles of authority. And to the extent that his voice represents one line of thinking common at the time, it has significance. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
Is Your Honour happy for me to continue? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, looking at page 10 of your report, and it's page 12 of the French under the heading "Military", you say in the final sentence that "the military also provided arms, usually with the assistance of local civilian officials who passed on the firearms to individuals whom they regarded as loyal to the government and Hutu Power". What, if anything, is wrong with passing -- the military passing on firearms to civilian authorities for them to pass on the weapons to other members of the population in a time of war? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The distribution of weapons and ammunition, and the dissemination of training needed to use those weapons, carries with it a responsibility to ensure that the weapons are used appropriately. In a time of war, this means being used against combatant forces, armed and posing an imminent threat to the person in possession of the weapon about to be used. When those weapons were being used, and it was clear they were being used at roadblocks, in massacres; for example, at Gikondo church and elsewhere in the city of Kigali, it was certainly clear, beginning as early as the 9th of April or even the 7th of April, that the firearms were being used against civilian targets chosen on the basis of ethnicity, then it was the responsibility of those who had distributed the arms to recall them or to discipline the people who were making use of them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, further down on page 10 under the heading, "The administration" -- it's on page 13 of the French -- you say that "administrators were charged with establishing barriers and organising patrols to prevent Tutsi from fleeing". Can I please ask you to look at Prosecution Exhibit 50; it is a radio transcript under tab 4, which, from the schedule, says the 12th of April 1994. I believe this is the only transcript that I will be referring to for which there is no French translation, and for that I apologise to my learned friend. 
Looking at page 9, and commencing on line 2, this is the Accused speaking, where he says:
"We request of them to make patrols within their quarters like usual. But it's all right in other areas. We request" -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we are sorry, but the interpreters are unable to locate the document Prosecution are referring to. 
@MR. MOSES: 
If I give the K number - it's somewhat unclear on the -- K0216044. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you still in the transcript binder? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are saying that that is tab 4? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Tab 4. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, tab 4 -- if tab 4 comes after the green page called 4, it is K02-something, and if it comes before the green page 4, it's K0357179, 11th of April. But you want to go to a document dated the 12th of April. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's the first set of K numbers you just referred to, Your Honour, after the green tab --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the page? 
@MR. MOSES:
It has more easily recognisable a number and handwriting 632 bis on the top. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The document following after tab 4 is entitled, "Name of translator". 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then date of translation, 30th of July '96. And you referred us to page 2 of that document? 
@MR. MOSES:
Page 9, line 2. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
"We request". 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you all found it, page 9 of this? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently the French booth has not yet found it, but they say it's all right. Prosecution can continue. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. All we have is the English version. Please go ahead. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
If I can just read a portion to you, Dr. Des Forges, and ask you to comment on it. It commences: 
"We request of them to make patrols within their quarters, like usual. They ought to come together and look for their traditional tools they are used to and defend themselves. I would like to request of them now, each quarter should try to organise itself and make a -- communal work within quarters by cutting off branches" -- sorry, "bushes" -- "searching empty houses, check out in the nearby swamps if no Inyenzi hid inside. They ought to do all this so that they can get the hope that nobody hid inside. They must cut those bushes, check in gutters and houses overgrown with weeds." 
And then the last sentence commencing four lines from the bottom of that page: 
"I wish them to keep on being courageous. They should not listen to those who said that the town has been captured; instead they ought to be strong in their own areas. Then they shall do the communal work so that no Inyenzi can hide there. That's my message to the population." 
Are you able to comment at all in respect of that passage which I have just read? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Here on Radio Rwanda, the prefect of Kigali city is directing the residents of the city to unite and to look for their traditional tools. I have remarked in my reports and elsewhere on the use of certain words which are found throughout the country with specific references to the genocide. One such word is "tools", which means, in fact, "weapons". And in speaking about traditional tools, the speaker means machetes, spears, bows and arrows, clubs and so on. So we are not speaking here of an ordinary household tool, but rather of an implement to kill. People are asked also "to cut off bushes, to search houses, to check swamps and to check gutters". At this time, Tutsi who felt threatened were seeking to hide away from their homes in exactly such places: In wooded areas, in gutters, and so on. The effort to track down Tutsis in neighbourhoods was meant to lead to their killing and elimination in the city. The reference to "communal work" is also significant because this was a standard practice in previous times; itself a benign practice for organising the people of a community to do physical labour. And, here, that work is being used to clear brush and places that could offer potential places for hiding. 
The instructions were carried out. Certainly, in several cases we have reference, for example, in a written document produced by a priest who kept a diary, and the same document was published in a journal called Dialogue, after the genocide, in which he refers to people coming to cut the bushes in the area surrounding the religious buildings where Tutsi were taking shelter. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And the other point I omitted to read, which is on line 10 of that same page, commencing: 
"On the streets leading to their quarters, it would be a good thing to block them with roadblocks. They can look after them, choose people they really trust and who have papers and put them there." 
How does that fit in with your comments that the administrators were charged with establishing barriers? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Here we see the directive carried down to the most local level, to the street itself, where people are called upon to put up roadblocks in order to impede the passage of passers-by and to check their identity papers. There is a call to people to choose who they really trust, meaning those who share the ideas of the government, to be in charge of this effort to control the movement of the population. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, if I could ask you, please, to look at Prosecution Exhibit 62. It's a radio transcript under tab 16. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What we just read was from Radio Rwanda, according to the table of contents. Can you confirm that? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, I can confirm it only by saying that I have always seen it referred to as a broadcast from Radio Rwanda. I do not have any independent verification, but I believe from the journalists -- I don't know if the journalists are identified in this one -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Bamwanga? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
B-A-M-W-A-N-G-A. Where did he work? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I believe he was a Radio Rwanda journalist. Also, if you look at page -- it's hard to read the K number, but what is in -- and handwritten at the top, 638 bis, or the typewritten number 3, you will see an extract of a notice from the head of Cyangugu prison informing the wardens that they must come back to work no later than "today, 12 April". 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's where we find the date, the 12th of April. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Yes. And then the fragment below that, an announcement of a meeting also 12 April in Butare signed by the prefect of Butare préfecture. And then, just below the extract we were looking at on page 9, or 632 bis, you will see that there is a directive -- a partial extract of a directive, also April 12, signed by the minister of interior and communal development. Actually, that -- he was not actually the person who signed it, but it was signed for him. And, again, an announcement from the prefects of Kigali préfecture. So I think there is no doubt that these broadcasts are from Radio Rwanda rather than from RTLM because of the official nature of these notices. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
You wanted to move onto a new document? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. It's under tab 16 of that same bundle of documents. And this is where there was a new -- some new translations that had come through. I don't know if they have been entered into your folder by your associates. We delivered them on Friday. 
The English passage is on page 4, commencing on the second paragraph; the K number is K0377212. And for the French, it is page 28, and the second paragraph -- 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And if I could read this passage to you, Dr. Des Forges, and ask for your comments. The Accused says:
"Thank you, up to now we have given enough directives on identification documents, and I have repeated them on many occasions. The identification document that is requested at the roadblocks is the identity card. The inscriptions on our identity card are prescribed by law, and this has not been amended. I would like to inform members of the population that there is a method the Inyenzi use to camouflage themselves. They send spies to the zones that are not under their control. They often use Hutus or other persons who have identity cards bearing the Hutu ethnic inscription because they know that persons labelled as such will not face problems during the checks." 
What relevance or importance do you see in that statement, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
First of all, the statement by Prefect Renzaho that he has given many directives on identification documents. Second, the statement that persons carrying identity documents bearing the Hutu ethnic inscription will not face problems at the barriers, leading one to conclude that, obviously, those persons bearing Tutsi identity documents will face problems at barriers, and this coming directly after the statement by the prefect that he has many times given instructions to the people at the barriers on what to do with identity documents. So, I would say, a clear recognition on his part that people attempting to cross barriers with Tutsi identity documents will indeed encounter difficulties. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Dr. Des Forges. Moving, if I can, onto page 11 of your report. It's also under the same heading of "Administration" -- "The administration". You talk about orders being handed down from the government to préfets and down the chain to other officials who read instructions from the government. What's the importance of that, in your opinion? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The use of the administrative system to implement the searching out and killing of Tutsi is indeed a central part of the analysis of the genocide. Here is simply a summary of the importance of the use of the administrative system to disseminate and enforce orders having to do with the location and the slaughter of Tutsi. The orders were such orders as creating crisis committees, cutting down bushes, setting up barriers, and all of these things we know from the factual evidence were, in fact, implemented. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Right. Have you seen during the course of your research and reading of matters such as transcripts, any indications of the structure in the Kigali-ville préfecture operating during the periods of the genocide? And what examples would you bring to the Trial Chamber's attention, if you have so noticed? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
There is evidence from many sources. Of course, there is the evidence of photographs, of testimony concerning the creation of barriers, the existence of barriers, people killed at barriers. There is written documentation indicating the distribution of weapons being carried out by administrative authorities, the training activities being carried out in the civilian self-defence system. There are accounts by outside observers from the International Red Cross, as well as from clergy, about such things as people being removed as they attempt to traverse the city at various barriers, about the cutting down of bushes. So there is ample evidence of the execution of those orders, also, of course, the creation of the crisis committees or the security committees to carry out and implement these instructions at local level. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Right, thank you. Now, if I can refer everyone, please, to -- and you in particular, to Prosecution Exhibit 51. It's under tab 5, it's a radio transcript. In the schedule, it's dated a radio transcript of 14 April. And for the English, I am looking at page 10, line 21. And in the French it's page 21, the -- commencing on the final paragraph. And it's -- in the English, it is K0111163. It commences with the words:
"I wanted to tell you that about improving security, especially in fighting, lootings, thefts, killings, I held a meeting with the officials of political parties at the préfecture and communal levels. That meeting was successful because we shared ideas and we found that those in charge of the citizens' problems must do their best to try and make citizens understand that those criminal actions are not ones that will allow us to win the war." 
Then I think we can perhaps leave the next sentence and recommence with the words:
"Then killing each other will not cancel the problem of Inyenzi-Inkotanyi. We must, rather, unite our efforts since we are facing the problem of war in order to win that war. That is why I thank very much the representatives of the political parties for the constructive ideas they gave us during the meeting. And they were determined to submit to the instructions (sic) of their authority, which will submit them to the citizens under their authority. But they told me that they do not replace the administrative instructions (sic), they just -- that they just want to help them in order to bring back the peace for which they are looking forward in their areas." 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have now read "instructions" twice instead of "institutions". 
@MR. MOSES:
I must put some glasses on, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We just note that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, subject to the quite proper correction that the Judge made, do you have any comment regarding the structure of the -- or operation of the authorities in PVK? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The civilian self-defence system as sketched out in the February 1993 document "Organisation of civilian self-defence," and as formalised later in the May 25th directives of the prime minister and minister of interior stress the importance of collaboration between the administration and political parties representing the defence of the republic and democracy -- or some phrase similar to that. 
There was a recognition that the political parties in and of themselves could be useful in doubling the effect of administrative action, and so the political parties were regularly involved by the administrators at various levels. This was particularly important because the political parties often had the most direct channel to those young people, militia organisations, that had been created by the political parties. But it is interesting here to see that the political leaders want to make clear that the administration is really in charge here, and that it is the responsibility of administrators to be operating this system, to which political parties bring their collaboration, but not the lead role. Whether that is true or not, it is an interesting reflection of the dynamic at the time between those two groups of occasionally overlapping groups of leaders from the administration and from the political parties. We see here, of course, the prefect serving as the locus, as the linchpin in those interactions between the circle of political parties' leaders and the circle of administration. We will see him later serving a similar function as the linchpin between administration and military. 
@MR. MOSES: 
On that note, Dr. Des Forges, perhaps if I could refer you now to Prosecution Exhibit 58. It's under tab 12; it's another radio transcript. It's dated on the cover page, K0267606, as being from the 19th of May 1994., And in particular, can I refer you, please, to page 3, starting on line 5. And for French, it's page 2, second paragraph commencing on the last line. And I am reading -- starting with the words, "The authorities should use the structures". Are you there, Dr. Des Forges? It's on K0267608. 
"The authorities should use the structures put at their disposal and, in case of difficulty, they should seek assistance from the gendarmerie, because we must seek its assistance. If that turns out to be ineffective, we have at the camp an army unit which helps us to disarm tough people who are like wild animals, who kill the population and engage in looting and are fearsome outlaws. You can seek the assistance of this unit and it will disarm these people and arrest them so that they can be punished in accordance with the law. At the present time, as you said, in considering the reports that we have been receiving from the neighbourhoods, we are forced to acknowledge that these criminals really exist." 
Are you able to comment in respect of the structure and the role of the préfet in that structure in relation to that passage? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Before we address this passage, I wanted to remark in regard to the previous one, because I believe we didn't make it exactly clear that the passage we were discussing was an interview with Préfet Renzaho. So that should be reflected in the record. 
Here, indeed, we see that the prefect is pointing out that the resources of the armed forces, the gendarmerie, and if necessary, the army, are available to supplement the efforts of the administrative hierarchy, if that is essential, and of the population as well, if that is essential. That's the first point. 
The second point is his remark that he has been receiving reports from neighbourhoods -- an indication, again, of the functioning of the administrative system, which was in ordinary times very busy with reports going up and down the administrative hierarchy. Here, obviously, somewhat less organised than in ordinary times, but still functioning. And it is that which I wish to stress: That just as orders are given out from the top and passed on down, so reports are made and passed back up. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In the English version of this document, the person speaking is called "speaker". And then on page 5, suddenly the journalist says to the speaker, "Very good, Mr. Prefect". But then follows a continuation of the exchange, and the person is suddenly identified as Prefect Renzaho. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I had noted the same thing, Your Honour. I can ask -- I think Dr. Des Forges is aware of this -- that very point that Your Honour raised. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, at the bottom of page 5, where the journalist says, "Very good, Mr. Préfet, apart from this security problem" what were the previous paragraphs or pages which were referring to journalist and speaker, what were they talking about? Did it have anything to do with security? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, although it is unexplained why the speaker is not identified in the first pages and is identified in the later ones, there is a continuity throughout in terms of both the content and the status from which the speaker is expressing himself, which would indicate that it is, in fact, the préfet who is speaking. If you look, for example, at the bottom of page 2, that is, K0267607, the fourth line from the bottom, middle of the line: "I am requesting the communal leaders, the secteurs and the cellule officials, to do their utmost to protect the people by arresting these criminals -- these criminals". This, I think, is a clear indication that the speaker has the authority of préfet, because he would not otherwise be in a position to give orders to those persons being listed here, including the leaders at the level of commune. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But even assuming that this person is a prefect, there is no link to Kigali in that sequence. Kigali is only introduced on page 5, by the journalist saying "Here in Kigali". 
Defence, is it disputed that the speaker here is the Accused? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, but I simply wish to inform the Trial Chamber that Mr. Renzaho was indeed endorsing those comments, and it was indeed he who had made such pronouncements at the very beginning of the interview, if that can be of any assistance to the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
In addition, I would just point out, Your Honour, that there is a reference to the army unit -- the army unit which is there to oppose looting activities; and, to the best of my knowledge, it was in Kigali that that unit was effective. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Dr. Des Forges. On that point, perhaps, Dr. Des Forges, can I refer you to Prosecution Exhibit 61; it's under tab 15. And from the -- from the schedule, it is dated the 8th of June 1994. And I am looking at page 7 with a K number of K0377854. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is the additional translation we received on Friday. 
@MR. MOSES: 
One of them, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's correct. And for the French, it's page 27, commencing on line 5 -- or it may commence shortly before that.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, I think you referred just before, in the last answer, Dr. Des Forges, to the unit for fighting looters. And three lines from the bottom of that fifth paragraph, it says, "a unit in charge of fighting looters has been put in place. As you know, if we had not taken these measures, this city would have been completely destroyed. Some people have been killed in the course of these operations, including soldiers, gendarmes, and civilians. Here in the city, some people who wanted to loot shops were shot dead, but this movement has diminished. Then three lines later, "I have requested a report on the setting up of roadblocks and on the persons charged with protecting the shops in the business district, so that in case of an accident such persons will be the ones to give explanations". 
Following on from your previous answer, Dr. Des Forges, what comments would you be able to make in relation to what steps were taken or what processes were put in place? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The problem of looting became increasingly serious in the course of events, to such an extent that a unit was in fact created by the armed forces with orders to shoot. And, in fact, looters were shot -- or so we have been told -- and the result was that looting diminished. So it is an example of, first of all, of cooperation again between civilian and military authorities. Second of all, it is significant to note that the activity chosen for effective action was looting, rather than some other action, such as the killing of Tutsi. And, third of all, once put into effect, the action had -- once implemented, the action had an effect, which was to diminish the undesirable activity of looting. And, finally, again, the request for a report, the indication of an administrative system functioning. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you aware whether -- sorry. In your report on page 11 of the English version, and on page 14 of the French, under the heading of "Political leaders", you referred to the numbers of militia increasing when they saw the riches that could be won through looting. Was this a nationwide phenomenon? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It was indeed, and it came to constitute a major issue for authorities, particularly in May and in June. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What was -- or what problems were caused by looting? And, during the course of your answer, can you comment on who was being looted? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Looting was directed against various targets; of course, first of all, Tutsi. Tutsi who had been killed -- the property of Tutsi who had been killed was distributed, often among its killers, either through some formal mechanism or informally among themselves. The Tutsi who fled and attempted to go into hiding, their property was also looted. We have seen, in some cases, even the administrative receipts for various Tutsi property and how it was disposed of. This activity was -- became viewed as potentially disruptive, because the goods could form a source of dispute among the killers. So, throughout the period, there is an effort by authorities to attempt to control the distribution of loot in such a way that this not become a cause of conflict among the participants, but also in order to assure themselves of a substantial part of the take, which was an accusation leveled against a number of senior authorities. 
In addition, looters also attacked Hutu. And this formed a double threat to Hutu solidarity and to the carrying through of the government programme because, of course, there would still be the question of the distribution of the loot and the potential conflict as to who was to get what share. But, in addition, by attacking Hutu, the assailants called into question that fundamental essential of Hutu solidarity, because the need to build alliances, particularly among people of different social classes and political parties and regions was, as we have said several times, an important preoccupation. And to the extent that militia could use their weapons and their presumed authority from the government to carry out attacks on other Hutu, this constituted a real risk to the implementation of the government programme. 
Thirdly, particularly relevant for the city of Kigali, less relevant for other urban areas, but particularly for the city of Kigali, this looting or pillaging or unauthorised appropriation of goods discouraged merchants and traders from bringing needed supplies into the city. So this becomes a theme repeatedly returned to by the prefect and others: The need for people at roadblocks not to use those roadblocks as an opportunity to fleece people bringing beer and food into the city. And that becomes a very important concern because there were times of food shortages, which was one of the reasons why people chose to leave the city. And the departure of people from the city was seen as facilitating, as making it easier, for the RPF to take control of neighbourhoods that had been vacated. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Dr. Des Forges. And one final reference, if I can, in respect of this issue, if I can ask you, please, to look at Prosecution Exhibit 63; it's radio transcript under tab 17. It's also one of the new English translations. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We may have touched upon this, but from when did then people choose to leave the city? Coming back to the third element of your answer, approximate time? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
The largest wave of departures was during the month of May. There had been some departures already in April, but many residents, that is to say, residents who were not afraid to move around, decided, nonetheless, to stay in the city with the hopes that the situation would improve. But, as the combat continued, more and more were tempted to flee. And, in fact, by early June, we see repeated efforts by the authorities to get people to come back to the city, indicating that, in fact, the displacement of population had been substantial by that time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I said P. 63 and tab 17. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Tab 17. Thank you, sir. And, in the English, it's page 5, the fifth paragraph, commencing with the words in English, "Let me come back to the issue of discipline". And, in the French, it's page 27, line 5, but I may -- I hope I am not misleading -- may not -- I am sorry for my friends, I may not have the correct French passage for that. The passage I want -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's in French, page 7, K0368736. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Correct, Your Honour. Fourth paragraph. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, there -- and once again, if you look at the previous page, it's the Accused speaking. He says:
"Let me come back to the issue of discipline. One must abide by the orders given by the competent authorities whether military or administrative. But I would also wish to come back to some acts of violence I deem shameful, notably, thefts and looting." 
Why would thefts and looting be deemed notable as opposed to other forms of offending that was going on at the time?
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Because thefts and looting were destructive of Hutu solidarity when carried out against Hutu, or even, arguably, when carried out against Tutsi. And here I would suggest we look also at the next line as further indication of the reasoning that I am using here:
"How can one possibly use the defence of the country as a pretext to unlawfully enter people's houses, perpetrate attacks or killings, cause disturbance, take away people's property in one's vehicle without the knowledge of the local administration, of the conseiller de secteur, of the responsable of the cellule and of the bourgmestre?" 
In other words, it's all right to do those things, as long as you have the agreement of the appropriate authorities. You may not do them on your own under the pretext that you are defending the country. You must not exercise that kind of initiative. You must choose the -- you must follow the orders of the authorities and attack the targets who they have designated, not the ones whom you choose. 
@MR. MOSES: 
If I can just refer you two paragraphs above that issue with the paragraph commencing, "The person in charge of civilian defence", which says, "The person in charge of civilian defence must cooperate with the authorities, but he should know that he is a technical adviser. Normally, the management of the civilian defence and the administrative organs" -- sorry -- "cooperate with the military organs." 
You had referred earlier to the link, not only between the administrative structure and the political structures, but also with the military ones. How does this comment fit in with those earlier comments you made?
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
This passage does indeed underline the need for coordination with the military, but it goes beyond that. And I think this is very interesting, because it's the 18th of June. And, by that time, the situation of the war has reached a point of serious crisis. It is generally acknowledged that the Rwandan army has been defeated, and at the same time, it is the time at which there is an expectation of French assistance. For those reasons, it's important for the civilian self-defence system to be made operational in a more streamlined and efficient manner. 
In late May, when the system is set up, it is still under that joint authority, the two-headed authority that was proposed in February and then implemented. And this is shown by the May 25th directive which establishes that it is the minister of interior, that is to say, the administrative authority at the top of the civilian hierarchy, and the minister of defence, who are to be ultimately responsible for this system. But, here, whether this is the result of an official decision or of some local initiative, I am not sure. But here, in this passage, we are told that the authority is now being handed over, essentially, to the military, perhaps as a recognition of the disastrous military situation in the city. And if you look in the third paragraph here, for example, the prefect specifies, starting at the end of the second line: 
"I must specify that the leadership of the civilian defence is not two headed. Civil defence is organised by soldiers." 
But that is clearly a change. That is not the way the system has been operating. It has been operating as an essentially civilian -- as an activity dominated by civilian authorities in conjunction with the military. Now, this simply -- is this a change in tactics or is this perhaps simply an effort to distance oneself from a system which is clearly becoming the object of increasingly negative international attention? I do not know. I simply remark that this does represent a change from the way the system had been operating up until this time. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, in your report, Dr. Des Forges, on page 11, and it goes on to the top of page 14, you look at the topic of double language and deception. And I want to, if I can, summarise some of the points you make and ask some questions in respect of those -- the matters you have raised. 
You have said in the report that you refer to negative press reports which were shaping international responses following the slaughter from April 6th onwards. And you refer to the fact that President Sindikubwabo declared a few days after he took over that troubles and killings had ended with the new government installed, and that leaders recognised the need to muster international support. It may be an obvious question, but why did they need to muster international support? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
From the start of war in 1990, Rwanda had been heavily dependent upon external assistance, initially a coalition of forces, French, Belgium and Zairian. But after the end of November 1990, essentially, the French played a very significant role in providing training, weaponry, ammunition. It was increasingly important after the 6th of April for the Rwandan military to be able to have continuing access to such external sources of armament and support in order to carry out the war. 
$(Pages 1 to 21 by Judith Baverstock)
1030H
@WITNESS DES FORGES (continuing):
Indeed, we see after the arms embargo of May 17, which did not eliminate, but did diminish external sources of supply, which was regarded by some military, as a turning point in the war. So, first of all, there is the need to continue international -- some international support in the military form. In addition, there was a need for political support from countries like France, but also hoped for from Belgium and the United States, and from various African countries in order to use their influence to push the RPF into a ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations. And, third of all, given the displacement of population and the immediate humanitarian needs, there was a continuing need for Rwanda to receive support in terms of food and medicine in order to take care of the needs of the population. 
So, on all three fronts, it was regarded as essential for Rwanda to improve its image, to restore its good name and to revive alliances -- or deepen and enlarge alliances in order to improve their international position. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Right. Now, you -- on page 13, you refer specifically to the Accused, and you've said that he was extremely conscious about the need for a good image. And in support of that, you refer to comments from the former prime minister, Kambanda, who is -- you've recorded as saying that the Accused had said that ministers should always present a good image of the country when talking on the radio rather than what they really saw. Do you remember saying that? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, I do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, I just want to briefly show you three comments from the Accused on the radio: One in April, one in May and one in June, and ask you to comment on those in relation to your -- your -- those particular comments you've made regarding him. The first, in April, is under Prosecution Exhibit 51, which is under radio transcript -- under tab 5, and the English is on page 11, it's line 25. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, it's a -- the whole page is one long paragraph. It's approximately -- if I can say -- a little below halfway down, and it commences with the words: "I will add that our country needs to have a good image." And for my friends, it's on page 25 of the French and it commences on the last line and goes over the page. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, can I -- have you found the -- 
@MR. MOSES:
Have Your Honours located it? It's on K0111164. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And if I can read, "I will add that our country needs to have a good image. During this time when the international community seems having forgotten us, I think it is not good to commit -- continue to commit unclear and inexplicable actions because those acts make our government to lose their credibility, and the government is yours because it is a government that was settled according to the rules, and it is a government settled in a way that satisfies many citizens. 
"So we ask your assistance in order not to make things difficult for them, not to give them difficulties when they are facing urgent international problems of trying to explain what is now happening in this country, and asking the international community to take care of the problem of Rwanda for peace to be recovered in the country." 
Is that -- how does that fit in with your -- the comments you make in your report? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It demonstrates the kind of concern which I have attributed to Préfet Renzaho for the international image of the country. It also is interesting in confirming the effort of the government to try to explain what is happening. This became a major concern for the government, not so much to change its policies at home as to try to explain them abroad. So, here, the concern is not really making 
alterations -- not really stopping the killing of Tutsi, but making it understandable to people outside if they are aware of it, or if they can be kept unaware of it, to do what is possible to cover it up. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the time of this? We are now in -- 
@MR. MOSES:
The 14th of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's what appears to be the case, but are we certain about that? I just noted that sentence, "The international community seems to have forgotten us." Would that be a statement made already on the 14th of April? There are a lot of missing portions in this tab 5. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, I believe, yes, that could certainly be said -- by the 14th of April. The 14th was a Thursday, and the 15th was the debate in the Security Council about the total withdrawal of UNAMIR. It was already the 11th when the Belgians had begun to announce their withdrawal of the strongest contingent of the UN peacekeeping troops. So I think that was a clear indication and, of course, the foreign embassies had virtually all been emptied by that point. So, I think that is -- that that -- this does, indeed, fit with the date of 14 April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
The next document I'd ask you to look at is Prosecution Exhibit 59; it's under tab 13. This, I believe, is only in French. I'm looking at -- and, if I could ask you to look at page 18, which has the 
K number K0369077. And the third paragraph commencing, cependant. Rather than me reading that onto the record, Dr. Des Forges, are you able to summarise what that third paragraph says and how that fits into any concern the Accused has shown towards the image of the country? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Perhaps it would be useful if I just read the most significant sentences -- the most significant sentence in regard to the topic we're now discussing, and that begins at the end of the second line of this paragraph. 
"They should understand that everyone appreciates their efforts and is observing their acts and gestures, especially as at this point in time foreigners have started visiting our country. We must respect the law", and so on. 
It's important here, I think, to put this in the context of time, as Judge Møse has asked us to do on several occasions. The 19th of May -- on the 17th of May, there was the Security Council decision imposing the arms embargo. The -- that day, the representative -- or, the day before I believe it was -- the representative of the Rwandan government, sent from Kigali, made a special plea to the 
Security Council attempting again to explain what was happening in Rwanda. 
The 11th of May, I believe, was the visit of the first United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Lasso, who had just been appointed, and his first mission abroad, I believe, was to Rwanda. In addition, Bernard Kouchner, K-O-U-C-H-N-E-R, a very significant player on the French political scene, was visiting Rwanda at about that time. And the week after was scheduled the -- an emergency meeting in Geneva of the United Nations Human Rights Commission called specifically by Canada to examine what was happening in Rwanda. 
There had also been the visit of Iqbal Riza of the UN headquarters attempting to see what way forward for UNAMIR in Rwanda. So, the initial period of international attention, which had lasted through, perhaps, mid-April, and then had fallen off a bit, saw a resurgence from the first -- through the third weeks of May with the return of these notable international visitors. Kouchner had gone on the radio to call what was happening in Rwanda a genocide, which was certainly significant, seeing it was coming from a Frenchman, and all of these things weighed heavily upon the authorities and made them aware of the need to try to clean up the image of the country. 
One further point in -- in regards to the chronology of that period, the Rwandan army had sent an officer, Colonel Rwabalinda, R-W-A-B-A-L-I-N-D-A, to Paris where in a three-day mission he had conducted discussions with the head of French military assistance in an effort to be assured of renewed French support. He sent back to Rwanda - or, brought back to Rwanda, a report in which he spelled out very clearly and explicitly: "The French are willing to help us, only if we clean up our international image because they cannot be seen to assist a country that is carrying out a genocide." This then led to announcements on the radio about hiding corpses, not killing people at barriers and, in other ways, trying to clean up the image of the country. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in respect of the same document that you are looking at, can I refer to page 22, four pages further on -- sorry --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on, the French word you referred to was cependant, C-E-P-E-N-D-A-N-T. And of the three names, Riza, R-I-Z-A. The first name is Iqbal I-Q-B-A-L. And now, the next page. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
It's page 22 of the same document, and it's a continuation of the speech by the Accused on the radio. And can I refer you to the third paragraph, third line, with the sentence commencing, "Je voudrais ..." And, can you please just summarise those next five lines which are there in that paragraph? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you do exactly as you did, simply read it slowly in French into the record, please? 
@MR. CANTIER:
I'm sorry, the K reference -- can I have the K reference so that I should be able to locate the page because it's more helpful to have the K numbering? 
@MR. MOSES:
K0369081. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
"I would now like to refer to another -- or delicate or thorny issue. You heard it being said that at present the government is making efforts to sensitise people to the issue of human rights, especially because abroad we are being accused of committing killings, preventing people from moving about freely, and so on and so forth. 
"As a matter of fact, the government has already taken some measures and is asking the appropriate organs or institutions to implement those measures."
So, basically, the idea being that this is a delicate subject; that the government is beginning to talk about human rights to people, especially because abroad, "We are being accused of committing killings and keeping people from moving around freely". I believe this is a reference, in all probability, to the upcoming Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, because it's the basis for which Canada -- the basis to which Canada referred in -- in summoning delegates to this extraordinary emergency meeting -- was the pattern of ethnic killing in Rwanda. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When Rwabalinda sent back his report, did he use the word genocide? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
No, Your Honour, he did not. He spoke of the need to clean up our image. He talked about hiring public relations people, but he nowhere used that word, no. Kouchner used it, I believe, the day after Rwabalinda wrote his report. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Finally, on this matter, can I refer you please to Prosecution Exhibit 63, which is under tab 17, which I understand to be the 18th of June 1994, and page 7, and the fourth paragraph. In the French, I have the page reference, which is page 10 in the French and the third paragraph. And -- and, if I can read:
"They have to understand that this country belongs to Rwandans. Rwanda is under the rule of law; we cannot afford to behave like the Inyenzi because the international community is watching us. The latter is asking us to report to it on the observance of the international conventions we have signed on the protection of populations. I sincerely ask of you that you assist our government in its fight against the Inyenzi, not only on the military front, but also by showing the international community that we have a vision for our country." 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the last sentence. 
@MR. MOSES:
I'll read that:
"As a consequence, we must observe the law, respect human life and ensure the security of other peoples' property."
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, Dr. Des Forges, once again, are you able to comment in respect of the Accused's concerns regarding the international community? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, it's clear here, in these remarks, and we should point out that the remarks are addressed to the youth, meaning, the militia, basically, that the préfet is very concerned that the international community is watching, and that Rwanda has been asked to account for its behaviour now by the international community. 
The commission -- the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva named a special rapporteur, who was visiting Rwanda, and whose mandate included reporting on the situation, and particularly, the question of whether or not there was genocide being carried out. It's also again important to note as -- as I did when discussing the June 18th broadcast previously, that the French Opération Turquoise was arriving in Rwanda. There was a hope on the part of many authorities that this would lead to renewed French assistance sufficient to stop the military advance of the RPF, and that the French had made, as a condition of that assistance, that Rwanda clean up its international image. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I think it -- it also, if I could just add, it is true that by late June, some international press were travelling outside of Kigali observing the situation in Butare, for example -- or, in eastern Rwanda, but Kigali remained, nonetheless, the focus and it was a special responsibility of the préfet of Kigali to be aware of this international presence, and to do his best to assure a positive image of the country to those visiting the capital city. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you aware -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When did the special rapporteur visit Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, I would have to verify the dates. It was certainly in the month of June, but I am not positive of the exact dates. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you aware -- apart from the observations of journalists or of visitors to Rwanda -- that Rwandan officials were -- had -- were concerned in respect of their actions being observed by foreigners in any other way, apart from direct observation by people on the ground? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
A number of authorities referred to satellite observations being a source of information for the international community. When I first heard those references from witnesses in Rwanda, I discounted this as highly unlikely. But, I have subsequently learnt that there was, in fact, satellite observation, and I have seen photographs from that observation indicating that on, at least, some dates, there were photographs made available to some in the international community of what was happening on the ground. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In your -- in your report, the bottom of page 12 and the top of page 13, you refer to officials seeking to excuse the actions from a lack of capacity, or blaming the exceptional or occasional misconduct of a few badly behaved militia or soldiers. Is that something which was an excuse used by a number of officials? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, it was. Often the official line was the killings have stopped, order has been restored, and, then, if the listener possessed factual information to show this were not the case -- this was not the case, then the official position would become, "Well, yes, there are a few unfortunate and isolated incidents; we are unable to control them because we lack the resources." Or, another nuance to that, "These are the actions of a few misguided individuals whom we are attempting to bring under control." 
There was consistency in this kind of explanation beginning, actually, from 1990 forward, but it was a kind of explanation used frequently during the genocide. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And on that point, can I please refer you to Prosecution Exhibit 54, which is under tab 8? 
The K reference is K0272361. And for the French, it's page 20, in the second paragraph. And I'm looking at the second-to-bottom line commencing, "That is why."
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I'm sorry, the page number? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Page 13. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean, the last sentence on page 13? 
@MR. MOSES:
That's correct, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Have you found it, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I have. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. If I can just read it: "That is why I would ask you to commit yourselves fully to ensuring that the organisation and supervision of patrols is enhanced so that criminals do not take advantage to attack innocent people. 
"We have started noticing some of such criminal acts in several sectors where some youths are colluding with reckless soldiers to attack members of the population, extort money and loot houses." 
How does that fit in with the matters you have just commented on? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It is an example of that kind of explanation. I would point out that this is not -- this is not an explanation devoid of all reality. In other words, in situations like these, there were obviously some people who acted in an undisciplined fashion. But at the same time, to explain the slaughter of tens of thousands of people as the acts of a few misguided youths was clearly a nonsensical effort to avoid responsibility for an organised programme run by the administration. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, is this a suitable time to take the break? I'll look again over my notes. I'm -- I'll do my utmost to make sure that we can finish by the lunchbreak. I think it's -- it's possible; I'm about two-thirds of the way through, if that's of any assistance to you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good, thank you. 
We will then have our 11 o'clock break. Because of a meeting, we have to prolong it slightly. We will start again at 11:35. 
The Court is adjourned.

Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, on page 13 of your report you comment that throughout the genocide most authorities called periodically for quote, "restoring order", close quote, for an end to killings, looting and other misconduct. Many such pronouncements had no noticeable impact, suggesting they may have been meant as much for foreign as for Rwandan ears. And you then state that as the former 
prime minister, Kambanda concluded: The orders about restoring security were weak, vague and contradictory. And you go on there to refer to a directive that Prime Minister Kambanda issued on 
April 27, which in one moment he calls for an end to violence, looting and other acts of cruelty, but at another, he reminds the population to defend itself when attacked. 
I'm wondering if you could please turn to the first bundle of documents, and look at -- it's 
Prosecution Exhibit 28, and it's at tab 24. And I think there should be three documents there: One in English, French and Kinyarwanda. Is that the document that you referred to in your report? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It is -- it is. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And looking on the English -- page 3, the third paragraph under number 4, is that one of the paragraphs that you were referring to when you wrote your report? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It is. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is there anything else noteworthy in that document that you would like to bring to the Court's attention to - or, is that the primary paragraph? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I believe that's the primary paragraph. You will see that the prime minister calls for the authorities to punish severely any person found guilty of these acts. And yet, Kambanda himself has admitted that on the rare occasion when persons were arrested for killing Tutsi, that he personally ordered their release. So, I think that makes clear, in real terms, what is meant here by the call to restore order. Order means order for the Hutu; it means providing the security necessary for the Hutu. The Tutsi fall outside the circle of order, and it is not necessary to punish people who kill them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but is it a fair assumption -- from what you have told the Trial Chamber 
earlier -- that it would have been obvious to civilian authorities that Tutsi were being targeted? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Indeed all testimony from every source, whether it's authorities, victims, onlookers, foreign visitors, the press -- everything is clear that it is Tutsi who are being targeted. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And how soon, in your opinion after the 6th of April, would it have become abundantly apparent that Tutsi were being targeted? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
If we're speaking of the city of Kigali, my own conclusion would be that that was clear from the 
7th of April. But if one wished to contest that in any way, there would certainly be the date of the 
9th of April, when there was a massacre at the Gikondo church, where the persons gathered at the church were selected on the basis of their identity card, and where the massacre was carried out as a result of joint activity by the army, the gendarmerie, and the militia, for the purpose of selecting and killing the Tutsi civilians -- men, women and children, who had taken shelter in that church. From that point forward, there certainly could not have been any argument about what was happening. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How often have you seen, read or heard a report of any leader in Rwanda -- military, civilian, political, stating on radio or elsewhere simply that, "Not all Tutsi are our enemy. Don't kill Tutsi people just because they are Tutsi"? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
There were, on occasion, such remarks made, but often then immediately contradicted by other -- other statements, which showed the real intent of the speaker. For anyone who had any question about the true meaning of the message, the reference would be then, not the words, but the actions. And given that authorities did not arrest or punish people who were, in broad daylight, searching out, identifying and killing Tutsi, the real intent of the authorities was clear. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Have you ever seen any such simple statement having been made by this Accused -- namely, that not all Tutsi are our enemy? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do not recall a direct statement of that nature. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now you've already just referred to the issue of the lack of follow-up by authorities when offences were being committed in broad daylight. And, also on page 13 -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you moving on to a slightly different topic? 
@MR. MOSES:
It's related, but -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I just interject something there? 
We are still at double language, and what Mr. Moses did was to ask you to refer to the directive of the 27th of April and to identify the paragraph where the message was to stop the violence, and that's what we just did. But, if you look at the footnote and read the last sentence in that paragraph in context, I have a question. First, you say that there is a need to stop the violence, and then after the comma, "But at another moment, he reminds the population to defend itself when attacked", and that's where we end up in footnote number 34. 
Now, we have identified the first limb of that sentence -- namely, stop the killing, but what about the second? Does that follow from this directive or some other source? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, if you would refer to page 2 at that same tab, paragraphs 1 and 2, and paragraph 3, in fact, as well, you will see the prime minister calling for the organisation of security meetings, and then in paragraph 2, at all levels, including representatives of the political parties, representatives of religious denominations, representatives of the administration, of the national army -- in other words, all these groups are to be involved. And, then, in paragraph 3, the lines at the bottom of the page: 
"Nonetheless, the population must remain watchful in order to unmask the enemy and his accomplices, and hand them over to the authorities and get the national army to assist them where they prove incapable of doing so." 
And then, he calls upon the authorities to set up roadblocks -- officially recognised roadblocks, and a system of patrols. So, all of those would be the kinds of references which I meant. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the point then is that the double language occurs in the same document? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Yes, Your Honour, ordinarily it was the case. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You make the comment on page 13 that with murderers, looters and rapists continuing their activities unhindered and with increasing levels of profit, the public pronouncements about restoring order were not -- not surprisingly, lacked all credibility. And one of the footnotes you've referred to -- footnote 37 is a Radio Rwanda -- I'm sorry, initially, if I can ask you to look at footnote 36: UNAMIR notes of 
Radio Rwanda broadcast, 24 April. 
I'm wondering if you could please look at Prosecution Exhibit 27, which is in the first bundle under 
tab 23. Do you see that -- that document? And the front page is a UNAMIR cable that's from Dalliaire to Annan. And on the following -- and it refers to their ability to monitor news broadcasts, and on the following page, it's L0002096, in the third paragraph, it says the following: 
"The préfet of Kigali town held a meeting with the youth of the parties which form the present government. In this meeting, he urged the youth to take weapons and defend the sovereignty of their country. He called them to help the RGF to identify the enemy. In the same way, he asked them to stop all the stolen vehicles in order to use them on the battlefield. He proposed that everyone who wants to use his car for one's private affairs must apply for a circulation licence. He encouraged the youth to arrest all the deserting soldiers, to disarm them and to kill them. With the help of the youth, a crisis committee was created, whose job is to defend the integrity of the country."
How does that fit in with your analysis of double language in one document? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The document indicates, first of all, that the head of the administrative structure in Kigali town is meeting with the militia -- he's meeting with the Interahamwe. Basically the phrase, "The youth of the parties which form the present government", means the Interahamwe and the militia associated with them. And he urges them to take up weapons and defend the sovereignty of the country. He talks about identifying the enemy. All these are phrases which point directly to -- to the Tutsi. And I would draw your attention also to paragraph 1 of the -- on the same page, where it -- there is a call by the ministry of defence to the population to point out any suspected RPF sympathiser, or any RPF soldier to the Rwandan government forces -- again, equating a sympathiser with a soldier in -- in pointing to the Tutsi as the enemy. 
And then, beyond that, the -- to return to paragraph 3, the préfet has encouraged the youth to arrest deserting soldiers, to disarm them and kill them. Presumably, if this is an accurate quote, giving the militia the authority to kill soldiers, would -- one presumes -- create in their mind, an expectation that they also had the authority to kill others, whom they were to target by their activities -- namely, those who were referred to in the first part of the paragraph, and all of this under the rubric of defending the integrity of the country. 
So, these are activities which are seen as legitimate activities for young men basically recruited through political parties, dressed, armed and trained by soldiers in order to help implement the defence of the integrity of the country. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Can I now, in a same vein, ask you please to look at Prosecution Exhibit 54, under tab 8. In the English, it's page 15 -- 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
This is the binder of transcripts? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, you're quite correct, yes. And in the French, it's page 22, the final paragraph. And the English K number, K0272363. Now, it's said to be the 22nd of April that this happens. You will see from page 14 that the speaker is Renzaho. The top of the -- and which may assist you in putting a date to it, the -- on page 15, the second paragraph, commencing: "15 days ago, to be precise, the RPF resumed hostilities here in the city of Kigali." So, does that correlate to it being approximately the 22nd of April? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It does. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, on that same page, if I could ask you to look down to the third paragraph, the 
second-to-bottom line, and I will read down there, and the following paragraph. He says, "Go and get these -- those looters. You have the means and the necessary strength as well as the support of the population. These people who come to rape children and women in the quarters must absolutely be thrown out. Chase them away. Besides, in times like these, do not bother yourself with too many questions. We are saying that you should shoot those who want to interfere with the security of the people. Anyone with a gun should shoot; that is it." 
Now, in a similar theme to the previous quote, what -- what would you take from that quote from the Accused? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
If I could take a moment to put this in context. This appears to be a broadcast of an actual meeting -- a security meeting between the préfet and the bourgmestres, and no doubt other people, at which the préfet introduces a military officer who will be responsible for helping to implement civilian self-defence, and this on the 22nd of April. 
At the end -- towards the end of April, there was an increasing effort to regularise, formalise and -- and direct the activities of civilian self-defence, so that the violence would be channeled towards Tutsi and would not spread around to affect Hutu as well. This is clearly a meeting in the context of that effort. The préfet is telling his listeners that they actually have the authority, they have the means, they have the strength to do what has to be done without asking too many questions, and this involves dealing with looters, but it deals also with any who want to interfere with the security of the people - meaning, those who are said to be supporters and accomplices of the RPF, people identified by their ethnicity. And the directive is very clear here: Anyone with a gun should shoot. Presumably those lacking guns, should use other weapons. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. The next passage I would like you to refer you to is under Prosecution Exhibit 56; it's at tabulation 10. And for the English, it is on page 12, K0365211, and for the French, it's on page 18, the final paragraph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The point in the previous quote was lack of cohesion; unite the forces? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
As always, Your Honour, I think there are several points. The first is, "You have the means and you should use them." The second is those people who use the means against other Hutu are using them inappropriately and should be brought to order, including by shooting them. And the third point is that the ultimate concern here is to deal with those people interfering with the security of the country. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
And now the present document, you want to address us on what, please? 
@MR. MOSES:
Has Your Honour --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We found it. 
@MR. MOSES:
You found it. All right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it the quote by Tharcisse Renzaho? 
@MR. MOSES:
It is. And in particular, looking at the -- the third paragraph in the English on that page, where he says: 
"It is therefore necessary that directives adopted in this regard are complied with. It is for this reason that we have decided to arrest those who rape, and want to commit criminal acts so as to punish them. For example, we punished about three people. It means that we have started to check whether these directives are complied with."
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Once again, you had commented in your report on the lack of action in the face of what was being done throughout the country by the civilian authorities. What would you comment in respect of this quote from the préfet, which, we understand, was around the 10th of May? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
We see the préfet giving an example of the use of authority to arrest people -- or, in fact, punish people. We are not told how they were punished -- persons who have committed such criminal acts as rape and -- and looting. It is significant, of course, that the number he refers to is three people. There could have been many more -- obviously, for the crimes of rape and looting. But it does indicate a willingness to use authority and resources to bring some people to account -- to hold them to account for their crimes. 
But, significant in this regard is no mention of any attempt to arrest or punish people who are singling Tutsi out to kill them, because they're Tutsi. And the distinction is certainly not lost on his listeners and on the population as a whole. That there are some things you do which may get you in trouble and, indeed, lead to your being arrested, but killing Tutsi is not one of them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And if you could briefly look at Prosecution Exhibit 58, under tab 12. The English, if you could first look at page 2, and the second paragraph, commencing on line 6. In the French, it's also page 2, the second paragraph, line 6. It's on -- the English is K0267607. This is the same --
@MR. MOSES:
Just for Your Honours' benefit, this is the same transcript that Your Honour referred to earlier that was on page 5, that there was mention of the Accused, and Dr. Des Forges I think -- I think the Accused accepted it was him speaking. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Commencing with the word, "However". 
"However, there is no choice but to admit that some individuals who are hungry for violence have taken advantage of the activities of the population with the view to ensuring their own safety, and controlling the Inyenzi infiltrations -- have given away houses of third parties and committed acts of looting there. 
"Similarly, they harass people saying, 'So-and-so is probably an accomplice or else we have the presumption about so-and-so, causing him prejudice'. Similar acts, if they should persist, would be very dangerous. That is why many meetings are currently being organised, and we have decided to punish these people. I am requesting the communal leaders, the secteurs and the cellules officials, to do their utmost to protect the people by arresting these criminals -- these criminals." 
Once again, what -- what type of offending is the préfet directing his comments towards there, 
Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
He's dealing with crimes regarding property; the allocation of houses to persons other than their owners, and the looting committed in these houses, and, I suppose, elsewhere. It's significant that he calls into question the looting and allocation of property committed under the pretext of ensuring the safety of the population and controlling Inyenzi infiltrations. That is to say, he does not call into question the overarching pretext itself. That remains legitimate. There is no question that this is the right thing to do - meaning, to search out Tutsi. But, that kind of looting of property, which takes place under the pretext of looking for Tutsi -- namely, in the homes of Hutu, is not approved activity and could lead to destroying Hutu solidarity. 
The -- it is remarkable during the genocide, the rapidity and the extent of popular appropriation on the pretext of anti-Tutsi activities as an excuse for, simply, acts of common criminal activity: Thieving, looting and raping. And it is not uncommon to find instances where Hutu are identified as Tutsi in order to make it possible to loot them. Where people, approaching barriers, who are identified as immediately wealthy have their identity cards destroyed -- if they are Hutu identity cards -- in order to kill them, pretending they were Tutsi. And where persons who have some political status or economic status in a community are attacked by others in their community as being someone who has, for example, changed his identity or had a parent or a grandparent who changed identity in order to label that person Tutsi, and make legitimate the attack against him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, finally on this point, if I could ask you, please, to look at Prosecution Exhibit 63, which is tab 17, on the 18th of June. And in the English, it is on page 4. It is somewhat difficult to read all the K numbers, I believe, it's K0375474. And in the French, it's page 5, the third paragraph. 
And at the top of the page, Dr. Des Forges, do you see it commences -- and if we -- sorry, if we look at page 2, initially there is a speech from the préfet, Renzaho, which goes on up to the first 
two paragraphs of page 4, where he says: 
"To answer your question clearly, we ask for the support of the population and the local authorities, because it's not normal that acts of violence should be perpetrated at these roadblocks, when the administration at the level of cellule" --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes -- 
@MR. MOSES:

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
"When the administration at the level of the cellule, the secteur, and the commune is in place. If these authorities were mindful of what happened in their jurisdictions, such anomalies would be promptly corrected." 
Are you able to comment on that paragraph, Dr. Des Forges, and in particular, if you are able to focus part of your answer at least in respect of the administrative set-up as it was still existing as of that date in 18 June? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, before we do that, we are now in tab 17? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The binder contains the French version, and then you have the English translation in addition recently, is that so? 
@MR. MOSES:
Sorry, Your Honour, I -- I have it now in my binder. I had hoped it had made its way to yours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And these three additional translations we received on Friday, we have two 18th of June transcripts, and you are now referring us to --
@MR. MOSES:
The last one and, in particular, page 4. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the K number which was difficult to read out, wasn't it? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you just read it once more for me, please?
@MR. MOSES:
I believe it's K0375474. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. All right, so now we have the document, and the question and then the answer, please? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
The préfet makes a very important statement that it's not normal -- meaning, it's not acceptable for this kind of violence to go on when the administrative system is still in place. And says that if the authorities know what's going on, then this kind of violence would be promptly corrected. That is, I think, a very powerful statement -- given that the administration was clearly aware of what was going on, that reports were made frequently. Indeed, we have seen references to the préfet calling for reports. Therefore, the administration was indeed aware of the nature of violence, and yet one part of that violence -- namely, the violence directed against Tutsi, is not stopped, is not punished and, in fact, is encouraged. 
I would draw your attention to the paragraph underneath the heading: "Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho", on the same page, where he thanks the youth for their commendable actions carried out within the framework of their self-defence and the defence of their country. And this is not the only instance. 
In fact, many of his public pronouncements begin with thanking the youth and the population for their activity. It's also worth noting that he is not the only one to commend the youth of Kigali, but that the prime minister, Kambanda, himself, as well, commends both the préfet and the youth of Kigali for their energy in implementing self-defence activities. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And just to place that in context, the anomalies which would be corrected if one looks at the previous page, and in particular, the bottom of the final two or three paragraphs, are you able to tell the 
Trial Chamber what -- what was he -- what was he showing -- expressing concern about in that regard? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
This is one of the places where the préfet draws attention to the use of roadblocks. The -- the use of roadblocks to fleece passers-by, to rob and to pillage, and loot traders and merchants, and food producers who were bringing goods into the city, and he comments that this, of course, is very negative for the wellbeing of the city and for security.

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. I think earlier in your testimony you had referred to the effect of actions taken by the authorities, including, I believe you said, shooting people, to stop or at least reduce the level of looting in the city. It may have been that you covered in your earlier answer, but can I ask you what that would suggest to you regarding other forms of criminal activity and the authority's desire to stop it, particularly the killing of innocent Tutsi civilians?
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It appears that the prefect and others, including some in the military, were willing to use lethal force to stop looting and other common criminal acts but were not willing to use such force -- although they had it at their disposal, were not willing to use such force to stop the killing of Tutsi. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, in respect of your report, which comments on the use of -- of doublespeak, how does that fit in with -- with two documents I want to show you? The first is Prosecution Exhibit 22, and it's in the other bundle of documents. It's not a -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now leaving the present document? 
@MR. MOSES:
We are. We are, Your Honour. We're -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Look at, kindly, page 3, last sentence, "keeping in mind that such controls are intended mostly to prevent infiltrations." 
It's the page before the one the Prosecutor read out and before the one you drew our attention to about commanding the youth. And then the context was the roadblocks; reference was made to the two last paragraphs, and the last one there stresses that the purpose is primarily to prevent infiltrations, which is legitimate. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, yes. Of course, preventing infiltrations in and of itself is a legitimate activity, provided it is carried out in an appropriate fashion to identify persons who are, in fact, part of a combatant force. But that phrase, "controlling infiltration" or "preventing infiltration," is the language used to cover the activity of singling out Tutsi on the basis of their identity cards or on the basis of their apparent physical appearance in order to prevent them from passing the barrier and then, in most circumstances, handing them over to be killed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. You wanted to go to Prosecution Exhibit 22? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour. It's at tab 17 of the -- 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you have that in front of you, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Tab 17, yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's a memo dated the 27th of January 1994, and on page 2 it's signed by General Dallaire. Do you see that? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Have you seen this document before?
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, I have. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I wanted to draw your attention to paragraph 2. And, in particular, the first half is relevant, but second half of that paragraph, commencing, "For example, it came to my attention that the préfet of Kigali stated on the Kinyarwanda radio station the RPF is sheltering the persons in the CND who committed recent murders in Kigali. This type of statement is inflammatory and untrue but can only be refuted by UNAMIR if we know about it in an accurate and timely manner." 
How does that comment, as reported by General Dallaire, fit in with your -- with your report on -- on doublespeak in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The assertion by General Dallaire is that the prefect is using the radio to inflame hostilities, to aggravate hostilities against the RPF by alleging that murderers have been housed in the CND, which is the quarters where the RPF troops have been housed. He was citing this as an example of the use of radio by the authorities to increase ethnic tension and asking for support so that he could monitor these broadcasts and react to them in a timely fashion. It is an early example of what General Dallaire has identified as the use of the radio to inflame tensions. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And next, if I could ask you to look at Prosecution Exhibit 29, which is at tab 25 -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. And before we do that, these murders took place when? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, there were several people killed in the month of January in the vicinity of the CND. And although I am not certain, I would suppose that this is a reference to those killings, which would have taken place not long before the 27th of January 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the murders took place in January, the statement on the radio was in January, and this is dated the 27th of January, so this all happened in January. 
All right. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Correct, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Next is at Prosecution Exhibit 20 -- 29, which is at tab 25, and is an interoffice memorandum to FC, which I -- am I correct in assuming stands for "force commander"? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And it's from Major MacNeil? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct. He was identified here as CHO, or chief humanitarian officer. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that is dated the 28th of April, and it's a report, is it not, on a meeting between Colonel Yaache -- spelt Y-A-A-C-H-E -- and the Accused? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Actually, if I could make a correction, MacNeil is not the CHO. He was, rather, the translator. He has -- he is the person who authored the report, but the official covering authority for sending the report is Colonel Yaache, who is the CHO, rather than Major MacNeil, who is his translator. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have identified FC. Now, CHO, which means? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, that would be chief humanitarian officer of UNAMIR. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And "MacNeil" is M-A-C, capital N-E-I-L. 
Which portion? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
It's paragraphs 3 and 4 that I wanted to draw your attention to, Dr. Des Forges. It's reported there that "Colonel Yaache explained to Colonel Renzaho that the ICRC had suspended operations in the camps within the Kigali area due to the fact that militias were stealing the food from the recipients. In addition, they reported that, in the case of the sick and wounded, militias and Interahamwe were pulling patients from ambulances and killing them." 
Paragraph 4, "Colonel Renzaho replied that the ICRC was perhaps exaggerated somewhat in this report. He indicated that he was in charge of forces within his area. He indicated that, due to a lack of trust in UNAMIR, neighbourhood militias had formed to protect themselves from the RPF and that they were defending their neighbourhoods in concert with the overall aims of the government." 
Now, are you aware of -- through any interviews or other reports that you've seen, as to whether what the ICRC were reporting was, in fact, accurate or whether such a description of those activities are exaggerated? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I have seen a press release from the ICRC, the International Committee of the Red Cross, referring to incidents where the sick and wounded were pulled from -- from ambulances by militia. 
I would also draw your attention here not just to the description of the ICRC complaint but to the acknowledgment by Colonel Renzaho that he is in charge. But an interesting distinction: He is in charge of forces within his area. But look at the sentence following: "Neighbourhood militias had formed to protect themselves," as if this is a spontaneous and independent activity that has nothing to do with him. 
In contrast to that, I would draw your attention to -- in the binder of transcripts to the broadcast on 
May the 19th at K0267608, where he says, "This is Prefect Renzaho speaking. In fact, by setting up the crisis committees, we entrusted them," "we" meaning the authorities. So there is an acknowledgment here. And, of course, going back to the 12th of April, we have looked at a transcript where the prefect calls upon people to set up barriers and to create these neighbourhood organisations. So rather than this being something that happens because people distrust UNAMIR, it is something that has been directed by the prefect over the radio. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, at the bottom of page 13 of your report, in the English -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two documents dated 19th May in the transcripts binder. Which one did you refer to now, P. 65 or P. 66, with other words, tab 12 or tab 13? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Tab 12, Your Honour, at page 3, the very first line. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now -- thank you, Dr. Des Forges. 
You contrast at the bottom of page 13 in your report the ineffectiveness of orders calling for the restoration of security to specific orders which were given to facilitate the hunting down, capturing, and killing of Tutsi which had, you say, an immediate impact. 
You also referred to Renzaho's directives for people in Kigali to take up traditional arms to defend themselves and to search houses and other places for the enemy and to cut down bushes which may hide the enemy, which you say seem to have been carried out promptly. My question for you is, what does that contrast suggest to you? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The contrast suggests that the subordinates of the prefect and the population in general understood that orders having to do with the hunting down of Tutsi were, in fact, orders to be followed and implemented. 
Second of all, it suggests to me that the prefect and others in authority permitted and, in fact, encouraged this interpretation by taking no effective action to counter that interpretation of their orders. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Dr. Des Forges. 
Can I now move on to the next heading of your report. I think the part from the brief paragraph at the end. It's the final heading, which is "Civilian Self-Defence and Operation." It's on page 14 of the English and page 17 of the French. 
And at the top of page 15 in the English report, you say that administrators sometimes spoke of militia and self-defence groups as if they were the same. My question is to you, were they the same? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
They were not identical in the sense that the militia were a part of, but not the sum totality of, the civilian self-defence effort. The militia were the, for lack of a better term, cutting edge of civilian self-defence. They were the elite. They were those who had had the opportunity for more military training. Their special status was often indicated by their access to firearms. They were more likely to be armed with weapons and more likely to have more sophisticated weapons. As opposed to simply grenades, they might have Kalashnikovs, for example, that required more training in their use. 
In addition, they were more likely to have military uniforms because it was those who had had some training in the use of firearms, who had firearms, who often were also given access to military uniforms. I had seen photographs of barriers in the city of Kigali where it is remarkable the extent to which there are young men wearing some portion of military uniforms. 
The significance of this is very great, first of all, indicating the cooperation of the military with this effort and, second of all, underlining the impact on ordinary people in assessing the legitimacy of what the militia were doing. The privilege of wearing a military uniform was, in ordinary circumstances, highly restricted. Civilians could not wear military uniforms, and soldiers on leave, at least in the period before this immediate period, were not permitted to wear uniforms when they were on leave because the wearing of a uniform immediately conveyed a special authority to the person wearing it. This, in combination with the weapons, significantly underlined that the activity of these militia in the civilian self-defence programme were officially approved activities. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Sometimes concepts can be vague. The word "militia" used now, did you use that as equivalent to "youth groups" or equivalent to "youth organisations of political parties," or simply some armed groups not linked to those two first groups? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, I use the term "militia" in specific reference to Interahamwe, but enlarging over time, a concept which enlarges over time to encompass organised youth of other political parties because it was they who had the opportunity of access to training arms and uniforms far more readily than ordinary members of the -- what should we say -- otherwise unorganised youth of the city. It was in that sense that I wished to call attention to their somewhat specialised nature, semi-professional, shall we say, in the use of force. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Dr. Des Forges, may I ask you, we know that Interahamwe were created by the political parties' leaders. They were trained by military forces, but who really exercised control over these formations, real control? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, there is no simple answer because the question of control depends on the time and the place. It varied. And, indeed, many of the documents we have examined this morning have represented the efforts of authorities to ensure that their control be completely effective. The indication, if we refer to the comments of Prime Minister Kambanda, suggests that towards the end of April the question of the command, the control, over Interahamwe becomes the subject of discussion at national government level, that is, in the cabinet meetings, with one part of the cabinet wishing to assert national government control and even to disband the Interahamwe and others identified with the MRND rejecting that initiative. 
So the -- the -- apparently the impetus there being that the Interahamwe were engaged in activities destructive to other political parties, namely, the MDR Power, and as a result the prime minister and others in MDR Power wanted to, if not disband them completely, at least bring them under control. It is officially with the later period of May that the formal integration of the militia is finally accomplished, that is, the Interahamwe into the civilian self-defence system, that is, with the May 25th directive. But it is an ongoing process varying with time and place. Specifically in the city of Kigali, the integration of Interahamwe into civilian self-defence is -- it is probably in the city of Kigali that that happens first, and even in the early days, the very first days of the genocide, the Interahamwe become incorporated into that, quote, "civilian self-defence effort." Elsewhere in the country, the picture was different because the MRND was far less important. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
You're welcome. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, I've got two more transcripts to -- to look at. The first is Prosecution Exhibit 55. It's tab 9. It's only in French, and I'd like you -- if I could refer you to two short passages and ask you to compare and comment on them. The first is on page 2, line 5. There is one sentence there, (French spoken). You see that sentence there? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And compare that with on page 3, lines 1 to 9. And the focus of my question, if I can, is -- is to ask you what persons were being chosen to be on roadblocks and who was doing the choosing. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Before I comment on that, if I may be permitted to return for a minute, because I had another thought that I would like to add to my final answer -- to my last answer concerning the integration of the militia into the civilian self-defence force. And that is to refer to the establishment of what was called a self-defence, civilian self-defence fund in the first days of June, established by government directive. And the directive issued on the use, the appropriate use, of those funds included the -- the -- the word "militia." So, in other words, civilian self-defence money was to be spent for quote, unquote, refreshments for the militia, which meant certainly food, likely alcohol, perhaps even drugs, and were also to pay the costs of transport of militia to their zones of intervention, quote, unquote, that is, the places where they were to be active, and was to include the purchase of machetes. So they're another indicator of the integration of the militia into the civilian self-defence framework. 
Now, on the -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you comment on what you were just about to do, you referred to P. 55 in tab 9. Is that so? 
@MR. MOSES:
That's correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is only in French, and then you said page 2, second line. 
@MR. MOSES:
No -- no, Your Honour, fifth line. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Fifth line. 
@MR. MOSES:
I'm sorry. It's just one sentence there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Okay. Now we've found it. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
The first -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Would -- would you wish to read it to us, please? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Yes, Your Honour. 
On page 2, beginning at the fifth line, "I request that the people that we selected be deployed on the barriers." 
So an acknowledgment that we are choosing the people and we are asking for them to be deployed on the barriers. 
And then at page 3, beginning at line 2, "We can find people who would be able to chain the others rapidly in order to increase their numbers. And people must work without hesitation. When you have been taught to do something, you can do it with assurance. There are people who chose themselves or elected themselves in order to control the barriers, but, as a matter of fact, there is no one who can claim to love his country more than the other except for the traitors. 
"One can say that such a person is a traitor and does not love his country. But there is also something called overzealousness, and it is because of such excessive zeal that some undisciplined people kill, and we are strongly against that." 
The reference, I believe, is to choosing people, recruiting people to learn to fire firearms, if you refer to the previous page. So the acknowledgment that the deploying of people on the barriers and the training of people to use firearms are officially directed activities, carried out at the behest of the prefect and others, this put in contrast to those people who choose themselves to man the barriers and who may be guilty of an excess of zeal, arguing that they love their country more than others. So people are warned against about -- excuse me, against killing blindly. Killing is not an activity to be carried out blindly but, obviously, with discrimination. 
@MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honour, I note the time. And it's difficult to give an accurate indication. I'm thinking I will be perhaps 20 -- 20 minutes, maybe 25. I don't know whether you want to take the break now and we'll come back and finish off. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll do that, and we will start again at 2:30. And we will then continue to 3:30 and have 30 minutes' break, and from 4 we expect the video link to be established. 
The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1302H to 1432H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. 
Just a scheduling issue: If you have approximately half an hour left, then the Defence may start its cross-examination. 
Do you have any idea, Defence, it being understood that the video link takes over from 4 and that there will be limited time today for you, whether you will finish tomorrow? What is your estimate, please? 
I'm asking this question because there is a need to know because of another matter for Wednesday morning, or, alternatively, Wednesday afternoon or Thursday. It's simply a question. No pressure. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I have to say that it is difficult for me to say with precision the amount of time that I will require. Experience has shown that the time I take in cross-examination is very often the same amount of time that my colleague on the other side of the aisle takes. If, therefore, tomorrow morning we have what are called normal time and one hour in the afternoon, we ought to be able to finish tomorrow afternoon, that is, by 3:30. That being said, let me say that this is not a commitment. It is an estimate.

@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, before the lunch break we were looking at Prosecution Exhibit 55 under tab 9. There is one further matter I'd like you to look at, please, in respect of that exhibit. 
@MR. MOSES:
It's on page 4, and it's line 22 on page 4, for Your Honours to try and locate. It's about almost exactly halfway down the page, and there is a sentence commencing, (French spoken). 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you see that there, Dr. Des Forges?
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm wondering if we could ask you to read down to about two lines from the bottom, and then I have some questions to ask you -- or, a question or two to ask you about that passage. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
"I would also like to take this opportunity to remind the population to pay attention to certain things. Contrary to what we did in Kigali, there are identity card (sic) which were issued in some communes, located in the neighbourhood of Kigali town. This -- this card on its right -- top right-hand side has -- is indicated "Register of Citizens," and there are people who have said and understood that the holders of such cards were -- are members of the RPF. 
"To that should be added the fact that those people are not well known. We asked them to leave the town to settle elsewhere, but there are still some people who do not have anywhere to go, and they are suspected of being Inyenzis. 
"Pending the issuance of the new cards, which has to be done, I am requesting a check to be done into how the communes came to issue the current cards. These existing ones have to be replaced by new ones because, as you know, the RPF has issued a number of cards. This means that they have -- they have -- they can send -- they can send spies among us, and we will take them as ordinary citizens. 
"And you know that that is how the RPF proceeds. They act in a commune manner and in the manner of some people that you know. I would, therefore, like to remind the population of Kigali town not to consider people who have the ID cards, as register of population, as Inkotanyi. 
"It is the case of Rubongo, R-U-B-O-N-G-O, and Bucyimbi, B-U-C-Y-I-M-B-I, which have similar cards. You should have -- look at them carefully and let go those who do not have any problem with them. And if there is any doubt, then they should be taken -- they should be referred to the higher authorities for further investigation so as to determine if the persons concerned have committed any wrong." 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, briefly, Dr. Des Forges, are you aware of what the préfet is talking about there and what -- and what is -- seems to be happening at the -- the roadblocks and any -- any other matters that you think are relevant in respect of that passage? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It appears that at least two of the communes neighbouring Kigali city have issued identity documents with certain letters written in the upper right-hand corner, which have led to the mistaken identification that the holders of these cards are members of the RPF. So the prefect -- and here it is still the prefect who is speaking -- the prefect of Kigali cautions people to be very careful about such cases and, if there is any doubt, to bring the people in question to authorities. 
What I find remarkable about this passage is how concrete and precise it is when it has to do with necessary measures for identifying certain persons who are at risk. To me, this is a significant contrast to those vague and generalised directives issued elsewhere, which ask for people at barriers to be careful. 
It's clear that, when the prefect wants to be concrete and precise and very careful and exact in delineating certain persons, he certainly is able to do so. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that. 
Now, on page 15 -- sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We had problems with two sentences in what you read out. I am certainly not saying that these two sentences are the two most important ones, but may I ask you to read again from (French spoken) and move on to the next sentence, please, just those two sentences. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I can understand why there is a difficulty because, in fact, I didn't quite understand what these sentences were saying. So perhaps there are some words missing, or perhaps it's simply my French. 
In any case, to begin again with "You know that that is the manner in which the RPF proceeds. They act in a cunning manner, which is not known, and in the way of -- or, in the manner of some people that you know. I, therefore, want to remind the population." 
If there is a problem with those sentences -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Why -- why do we get "some people that you know" instead of "Satan"? Isn't "Satan" there explicitly? I'm not saying this is important, but we probably should have on record what is written.
So the second sentence again, please. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
"They act in a cunning manner, which is not known, and in the manner of -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, Your Honour, I said "some people," and I really cannot see the problem there.

Isn't "Satan" "the devil"?

But the text is "Satan," S-A-T-A-N.

Thank you very much, indeed. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, on page 15 of your report, in the third paragraph -- and this is the English version -- you talk of, if I could use the term, a differing strategy in Kigali from the large-scale attacks that had occurred in other parts of the country. You said that the authorities adopted a different strategy, largely to deal with the image problem that resulted from too open and horrific killing. And this was particularly true in Kigali, where foreign observers were concentrated. 
And you then go on to describe whereby the attacks, the slaughter of most were either at barriers or of those hiding in their houses. 
Is that a fair summary of what you've written in your report, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In Kigali, therefore, would you have thought it generally to have been safer for Tutsis to have been in -- together in a large group or to stay in their houses? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In those cases where Tutsi were able to assemble in large enough numbers to attract international attention, the vast majority survived. Those who did not succeed in reaching those places of safety did not survive. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How would you, therefore, Dr. Des Forges, in the context of Kigali-ville, therefore, interpret orders in April, May, and June for persons to leave such large groups of refugees and to return home? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Given the pattern elsewhere in the country, which was rather to gather people into larger groups in order to facilitate their slaughter, this appears to be an exceptional case, one perhaps that is replicated as well in Butare, where concern for reports of massacres dictated the strategy of ordering Tutsi dispersed so that they could be killed without attracting the same attention. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. You go on to say that on its face the self-defence programme was a force of citizens to protect their homes in wartime. And you go on to refer to the document that you have referred earlier in your testimony, namely, the 1992 document, which was circulated around -- amongst soldiers, whereby the enemy was defined. 
Very briefly, how was the enemy defined? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
There has been some dispute about the exact interpretation of the words, but certainly, as generally understood and used, the definition was to equate the enemy with the Tutsi ethnic group. This was a -- an interpretation which was widely encouraged and emphasised by propaganda from the period of 1992, late 1992 onward, and which was not contradicted by those military and civilian authorities responsible for the original definition. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And you say at the bottom of page 15 and then on the top of page 16, the last page of your report, that the line between the combatant force of the RPF and Tutsi civilians was blurred, and both groups were called the enemy. 
In your opinion, Dr. Des Forges, was this blurring deliberate on the part of officials? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It was certainly deliberate on the part of some officials. One could not say all officials because it was not a universally held idea, but certainly on the part of significant officials, significant in their standing, yes, it was a conscious blurring of the line, which was never corrected and which was -- which ought to have been predominant in the mind of any officials who established a system of civilian self-defence. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What, in your opinion, Dr. Des Forges, would, could, or should have an official done who had wanted to draw a clear distinction of the line that you have described in order to make the distinction clear? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
As a party to the Geneva Conventions, the Rwandan authority -- the Rwandan government and its officials were bound to the conventions, generally known as the laws of war, and in that context had an obligation to protect civilians and to make clear the distinction between a combatant and a noncombatant in a wartime situation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, the final exhibit that I want you to look at is P, Prosecution Exhibit 63, which is at 
tab 17, and the English is on page 6 at line 2 -- or, 1 and 2, and in the French that's page 8, in the first paragraph, I believe, at line -- around line 8. 
So there's those first two lines there I would like you to look at, Dr. Des Forges, and also on the same page in the fifth paragraph, the second and third sentences, which commence "Look at what happened in Kabgayi." And in the French that's on page 9 at line 2. 
If I can read both these short passages and then ask for your comment. And, once again, Dr. Des Forges, if you look at page 4, you will see that this is a speech of the Accused, Renzaho. 
The first one says, "Look, the Inkotanyi come, kill people, take away the Tutsi." So that's the first one. 
And the second says, "Look at what happened in Kabgayi and here at the Saint Paul pastoral centre, where they killed and injured many others. There they killed the inhabitants, except for their kind, whom they took away with them." 
Now, what, if anything, could be read into those comments in respect of the matter that we are looking at, namely, a blurred line between combatants and Tutsi civilians, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The speaker -- and it should be noted that the speaker here is Prefect Renzaho -- has identified the Inkotanyi, or the RPF, with the Tutsi, saying that this is their own kind. These are the people whom they are taking care of and that they kill and injure others, meaning Hutu. So it is a reference to the ethnic nature of the conflict. 
And, again, a blurring of the distinction between the combatant and the noncombatant, lumping them together on an ethnic ground. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. I have three concluding questions for you, Dr. Des Forges. 
The first, what would you say to an official who might say to you that this period was a time of war, things were chaotic, and I did what I could? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That was certainly the case for many officials. And, in evaluating their conduct, it would be extremely important to take account of the resources at their command and the use to which those resources were put. Were they, in fact, put to the effort of trying to impede and punish the killing of Tutsi, or were they put to some other use, including facilitating and assisting the killing of Tutsi. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what would you say -- my next question is, what would you say to someone who might say, "I can't be guilty of genocide because I had some Tutsi friends or relatives"? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Indeed, at the time of the genocide, that statement would have been true of many, many Rwandans. Given the interwoven nature of relations between Hutu and Tutsi, it would have been rare for someone in the elite to have had no connections whatsoever, either connections of friendship or personal links, family links with Tutsi. So that is not, in my opinion, a defining criterion for anyone. That was true of many people and is quite apart from the question of the official conduct of the person in question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
My last question is, what would you say to someone who said, "I can't --" who might say to you, "I can't be guilty of genocide because I managed to save a few Tutsi"? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
While, of course, any effort, and particularly any successful effort, to save human lives is laudable and should be acknowledged, it must be -- such effort must be balanced against other efforts and actions taken and not taken that resulted in the opposite, that is, in the destruction of human lives. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Dr. Des Forges. 
I'd now ask that your report in English and French be produced as the next -- I think the registry have a copy on the end table here of the report. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The next Prosecution exhibit number, please? 
MS. BEN-SALIMO:
P -- P. 94, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A for the English, B for the French. 
Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 94A and P. 94B admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This document we just went through had a reference on page 4 -- or, rather, page 6 to what happened in Kabgayi. That was the second quote on that page. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honour, not the report but the transcript. 
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think we have on record in this case whether anything happened in Kabgayi. Can you tell us what happened in Kabgayi? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
It is apparent to me that the reference is to killings carried out by the RPF and probably particularly not those at Kabgayi itself but of clergy, notably, several bishops and other clergy who were taken from Kabgayi and killed at a place called Byimana, B-Y-I-M-A-N-A, in early June of 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And -- and the clergy belonged to which ethnic group, mostly, if it can be established? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I cannot say for sure about each person in question, but certainly most of them were Hutu. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Good afternoon, madam. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
Good afternoon, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, my first question is to ask you whether you are still history -- you are still a historian, now whether you still stand by the assumption of the planning of genocide. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
I am convinced, perhaps I should say increasingly convinced, by the newly available documentary material of the organisation of an effort which, in the minds of some of its organisers, was meant to carry out a genocide and which, in its execution, became the mechanism for carrying out a genocide. 
I make that distinction in order to indicate that, while I see a clear plan in existence, I have no way of establishing that all persons involved in that plan had an intention of genocide and, indeed, suppose that some did not. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Madam Witness, you believe that some persons may have participated in this planning of the genocide in an unintentional manner, if I understood you clearly. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
Except in the sense that I would not say that those who participated without intending a genocide were, as such, participants in a genocidal plan. Because if the ultimate characteristic for defining the crime is a conscious intention on the part of the participant, I would not make that kind of conclusion. Rather, I would say that there were participants -- that it was possible that there were participants in the planning of the civilian self-defence programme prior to April 6th whose intention was not necessarily genocide. Because I have no way of knowing or of proving that there was a genocidal intent on the part of each and every one of those persons. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, madam, up until now you've not been able to put together an organisational plan of the -- a diagram of those who planned and executed this genocide? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
An oranogram (sic), an organisational chart, I think that the closest we can come to an organisational chart is the framework suggested in the February 1994 document, which assigns duties under the civilian self-defence programme that eventually become implemented in the course of the genocide. I'm sure that you understand that an activity of this nature did not lend itself to the bureaucratic formalisation of an organisational chart, and I doubt that one would find such a chart for any genocide in history. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I understand, madam, that this kind of document is not published in official newspapers, but here I'm referring to the researchers -- research activities that you've been able to conduct as a historian. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
The significance, for me, of the February 1994 document is clear. And, as I have indicated, it, along with the prior indication of planning within the army and other simultaneous activities, whether in propaganda, distribution of weapons, organisation and training of militia, all are significant proof of the organisation of this plan. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
At the time that the country was at war, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
The country was not at war in 1994, February. In fact, from August 1993 until April the 7th, or April the 6th, arguably, it was a situation of peace. This is not to exclude that there were preparations on both sides for resumed combat. That is clear. But it is not correct to say that this planning is going forward in a time of war. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I understand that there was no war at the front at that time, but there were attacks. There was an extremely tense situation. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
As I have said, it is clear that there were preparations on both sides for renewed combat. There were assassinations. There were killings of Tutsi in the streets of Kigali. But to describe that as a situation of war is not accurate. A peace treaty had been signed and continued to be in effect, and all of the major participants continued, in public, to adhere to that treaty. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But, madam, it is public knowledge that you've written that everybody was preparing for war. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
That is exactly what I have just said. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, are you able to tell the Chamber, since in the first portion of your report you made reference to this text, what is your latest development of your view on the planning of the genocide? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
The information which -- of which I have become most recently aware included the military telegram announcing a meeting of a civilian self-defence committee in June of 1993. Prior to that the confirmation in the documents written by former Prime Minister Kambanda concerning civilian self-defence, concerning the integration of militia into the civilian self-defence programme, and remarking on the importance of the February 1994 document and how it conformed and was conformed to the May -- May 25 directives and how this same document formed the basis for discussions at a cabinet level concerning the civilian self-defence programme. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, in your report, on page 4 of the French version -- 
@MR. CANTIER:
My apologies to my colleague and the Bench. I do not have the English version before me, but the reference is easy to find. 
Mr. President, in the French version it is on page 4, and it is the chapter entitled, quote, unquote, "La guerre," "The War." In the English version I believe that should be on page 3. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, in your report you wrote -- that is, at the end of the first paragraph, you wrote, "This war was a reflection of the events that happened between 1994 -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are sorry, Mr. President. We are not able to locate the sentence being read by counsel. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Can you please explain that assertion, please? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
$(Microphones overlapping)...so what he read now was on page 4 of the English version, and the quote was, "This war formed both the larger context of events from 1990 to 1994 and the more immediate framework of the genocide itself." 
That was what you read, wasn't it, Maître? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That is it, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the answer, please. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
At one level, this is a simple statement of fact requiring no further explanation, it seems to me. The assessment of events beginning in October 1990 must necessarily take account of the fact of the beginning of the war. Whether one looks at the development of multiparty political life or other aspects of the economy during these years, certainly the war is of great importance and of particularly great importance, of course, after April the 6th. The war and the genocide were intertwined, and that basically is what I meant to say by that sentence. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Who started that war of 1990, madam? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
The war began with an invasion of Rwanda by the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What was the aim of that war? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
According to the published programme of the RPF, there were, I believe, eight objectives, the most important of which were to assure the possibility of a -- an unrestricted and unconditional return home of those Rwandans living at that point in exile and, secondly, the establishment of a more open democratic system. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
You just remind us -- reminded us of an objective stated by the RPF. But your view as a historian on the aim or objectives of the war, what were they? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
Counsel, I have not had the opportunity of conducting historical research with those persons who were making decisions for the RPF, nor have I had the opportunity to read information, documentary information exchanged among them. 
I am not a historian of the school who believes that it is possible to read history backwards and to conclude as a result of the present situation what may or may not have been the existence many years ago of the ideas of RPF leaders. 
So, in short, what I can tell you is that there is considerable speculation that the ultimate objective was to take complete power in Rwanda. But I, myself, have not investigated that and do not have access to the information which would allow me to either substantiate or refute that assumption. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, that war, was it international in nature, in your opinion? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
I assume you're asking me as a layperson, seeing that I have no legal background to allow me to make a -- a judgement on technical-legal grounds. But, speaking as a layperson, it is clear that there were international aspects to this conflict, in that the RPF drew substantially upon assistance from Uganda, and the Rwandan government drew substantially upon assistance from France, as well as from Zaire and Belgium for a brief period of time, Zaire longer than Belgium. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, I'm only asking questions to the historian that you are, and my questions are not on legal matters. 
You said at the time the war broke out the countries involved were France, Belgium, Zaire. Were there no other countries that had drew strategic interest in that region and who, therefore, supported the RPF? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
I'm sorry, Maître. I don't know if perhaps you missed the first part of my response. The first part of my response referred to Uganda. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That's correct, madam. I forgot to mention Uganda. But were there no other countries, regional or world powers, who had drew strategic interest in that part of the world? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
In the immediate region, Tanzania had certainly an interest in attempting to limit the conflict and played a generally useful role, I believe, in attempting to bring the parties to an end of violence. 
I suppose, perhaps, your question is meant to elicit a response concerning the geo-strategic interest of the anglophone world, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. I'm familiar with the assertions of such an implication, but both as a result of my own observations at the time and as a result of my study of the record, I have not yet found any convincing evidence. In fact, most of the assertions made about US implication, for example, result from a highly selective use of information, for example, citing the fact that Paul Kagame was in the United States at the time the war was launched and was receiving military training from the United States. Indeed, he was, as a member of the Ugandan armed forces at that point. Such an interpretation fails to take account of the number of Rwandan government army officers, far in excess of the number from the RPF, who received training from the US government. So that kind of evidence does not convince me at all. 
In addition, if one follows the diplomatic correspondence at that time, one sees a remarkable effort, rather, on the part of the United States to cooperate with France in bringing about an end to the conflict. 
My own experience in dealing with persons involved in the US government at that time, to the best of my recollection, also confirms the impression that the sympathies of the persons with whom I spoke, although my discussions were obviously very limited, being an outsider, but that those discussions indicated rather a sympathy for the Rwandan government than a sympathy for the RPF. 
As for the United Kingdom, I think at that point their interest did not extend beyond Uganda. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Uganda wasn't highly implicated in that conflict? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
Indeed, and one might reproach a diplomat of the United Kingdom with either negligence or ignorance, but I do not believe that one can establish any active intent on their part to assist the RPF in launching this war. At least, if there is such documentary evidence, I have never seen it presented by anyone in any context. It is all supposition. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, what were the foreseeable effects of launching or starting those hostilities on the relations between the two ethnic groups in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
May I ask, the foreseeable consequences, foreseeable to whom? Are you speaking of Tutsi inside the country? Are you speaking of RPF leaders? Are you speaking of Rwandan government officials? Foreseeable to whom?
@MR. CANTIER: 
Foreseeable by those who started that war and also foreseeable with respect to the relations between the two ethnic groups, namely, the Hutus and Tutsis, within Rwanda itself. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
At the time these decisions were taken, I had no contact with the RPF, so I do not know what was their state of mind and their assessment of the situation. It would be my supposition as a historian that they should have been able to foresee a deterioration, a worsening, of relations between Hutu and Tutsi as a likely consequence of launching the war. 
On the question of what were foreseen as consequences by persons inside Rwanda, with that group with whom I had contact, which admittedly was a relatively small group, but a multi-ethnic group, the consequences expected were, indeed, very serious, and on both sides, Hutu and Tutsi, there was a fear that the military activities would lead to a situation of considerable risk for Tutsi inside the country. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you think that RPF leaders could overlook, or be unaware of, those consequences? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
I said, Maître, that I would have expected that they should have been able to anticipate the consequences, but given that I was not in touch with them and have not subsequently had access to documentary or oral information concerning the period, I cannot say with certitude that they were aware. But from my understanding of the past history, it should have been foreseeable to them that there would be such a consequence. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That first war was interrupted following a military failure suffered by the RPF, then the war resumed. Can you briefly describe the two episodes during which the war reigned in that country once more? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES
In brief, the opening military combat for approximately a month involved classical -- classic military warfare with set battles and organised forces. Following the defeat of the RPF by Rwandan government forces and their allies, including particularly the French, the RPF withdrew most of its men, in any case, to Uganda and reorganized to conduct a guerilla war, which began in early 1991. 
And this guerilla aspect of the war continued to be the predominant activity until, arguably, June of 1992 when, once again, there was substantial, large-scale, organised military combat in northeastern Rwanda. This was followed by a subsequent ceasefire, and then again in February 1993, the launching of a wide-scale military offensive, which more closely approximates classic warfare than guerilla warfare.

It was on that day that my children and my husband were taken away.
@MR. MOSES: 
I want to ask you a little more about the events of the 22nd of April. At what time -- 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
At what time of day were your children and your husband taken away? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
It was around 10:30, probably 11:00. It was at that time that the Interahamwe came to the centre. They had cleared the bush around the centre, such that one could clearly see into the centre. There were gendarmes, as well, and the Préfet Renzaho. They called out these children and others and took them further away. I did not see them again.
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, Witness, you say they came with Renzaho? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear me? 
@WITNESS ACK:
I haven't finished yet. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
@WITNESS ACK:
They were calling out people and asked us to get close to where Mr. Renzaho was standing, and then when they found my husband, he came down, together with the children, and then my husband told Renzaho -- he told him that he comes from his neighbourhood, and I came down and asked him where he has taken my children. I asked him to take me together with my husband away and to leave our children. And he said he was going to bring back the children later on, but they did not come back. I'm referring to my two sons and my husband.

I and their cousin were asked to join the others.

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You've referred, Madam Witness, to Renzaho. Had you ever seen Renzaho prior to the 
22nd of April 1994? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I used to see him.
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know whether your husband knew Renzaho, and, if so, how? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Renzaho is a native of Kibungo; my husband was also a native of Kibungo. And we used to meet him at Mr. Rwagafilita's house when the latter invited people from -- people who were natives of Kibungo to discuss certain issues.
@MR. MOSES: 
Madam Witness, we are going to have to ask you to spell, if you can, Rwagafilita's name onto the record. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I did not quite understand. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you spell Rwagafilita as follows: R-W-A-G-A-F-I-L-I-T-A, or in some other way? 
@WITNESS ACK:
I think it would be best for that name to be spelt out by somebody who speaks Kinyarwanda for the President. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Your spelling was correct" says the Kinyarwanda booth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is fine. That is fine. We got it. Yes, Madam Witness, here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you recall what Renzaho was wearing? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
He was wearing a military uniform.
@MR. MOSES: 
Were your sons and your husband the only people to be taken away? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
It is Renzaho who knows the place where those people were taken to. The fact is that they did not return.
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know how -- approximately how many people were taken away that day? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I do not know the exact number of people taken away, but there were 20 or more. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we are not sure that we got exactly what the witness -- or the figure that she gave. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you kindly repeat the figure, approximately, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS ACK:
Which name? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asked the witness. 
@WITNESS ACK:
Or rather the figure of what? Which figure are you referring to, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You were asked to give an estimate of how many persons that were taken away. Can you kindly repeat that, please? We didn't hear you clearly. 
@WITNESS ACK:
After those people were taken away on the road there were two minibuses. One was a Nissan and -- a Nissan Urvan, but I do not know the number of people who were taken away. However, there were many. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
More than 20 or less than 20? 
Did you hear the question, madam? 
@WITNESS ACK:
I did not understand or hear the question clearly. Would you want me to repeat, Mr. President?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I will now repeat the question originally posed by the Prosecution. And the question now is, simply, do you think there were more than 20 persons taken away or less? What is your estimate? 
@WITNESS ACK:
Those people were transported in the minibuses -- the Nissan Urvan minibuses. At that time we were told to return home; however, we did not return home. Rather, we went to the Sainte Famille parish. So they stayed there and we were not present when they left. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Has anyone -- 
@WITNESS ACK:
Instead of returning home, I went to the Sainte Famille parish. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Please hold on now, Madam Witness. 
Has anyone understood the word after Nissan?

Now, Witness, you told us that you had been told to go home but that you did not go home and that you rather went to Sainte Famille. Why did you not go home?

There was no security. There were Interahamwe militia everywhere. Furthermore, people who were better informed advised me, for example, a young man who was called Bitega, so those people told me that it was better for us to go to Sainte Famille parish.

Witness, taking you back briefly to the CELA centre, you say that your husband spoke to Renzaho. What exactly did he say to Renzaho? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
He said, quote/unquote, "mukwetu." 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what language is that? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
It is Swahili. What he meant was "you, from our place." And it is at that time that I asked Renzaho the following: "Where are you taking my children? Why don't you take me and my husband along?" He told me he was going to bring them back.
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, are you able to indicate in Kinyarwandan or French what mukwetu means? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
A person who comes from our place. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we get the spelling? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, I believe it is in documents, Your Honour. It is M-U-K-W-E-T-U. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, at the point that you -- sorry. Who was it who told you to go home? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Pardon me, Counsel?
@MR. MOSES: 
You said that you were initially told to -- when you were at CELA to go home. Do you recall who it was that told you that? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
After they took away those they had selected, they told us to return home.
@MR. MOSES: 
And when you say "they," who do you mean? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
There was Renzaho, gendarmes, Interahamwe, militias, and it was later on that the priests returned and told -- or, said that those who were afraid of returning home could go to the Sainte Famille parish. That young man, namely Bitega, told me that we should go to the Sainte Famille parish.
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, at the time --
@WITNESS ACK: 
He told us to go to the Sainte Famille parish because there was no security in our homes.
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you have said that you went to Sainte Famille parish. 
Did you go with any members of your family? And please don't give any names.
@WITNESS ACK: 
Could you please repeat the question, Counsel? I did not hear it clearly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you go with any members of your family; yes or no? No names, please. 
@WITNESS ACK:
Yes. My daughter, my daughter's cousin. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you.

@MR. MOSES: 
How long did you remain at Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I left CELA on the 22nd. I left Sainte Famille on the 24th of June.
@MR. MOSES: 
Just so I am clear, you went to Sainte Famille on the 22nd of April and you left on the 24th of June. So you were there, am I correct, for a period of almost exactly two months? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Yes. Yes, that's correct.
@MR. MOSES: 
And who was -- were you -- were there other people who had taken refuge in Sainte Famille church who were there with you?

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Were there other refugees staying at Sainte Famille together with you and the members of your family? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
We were many at the church. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And who was in charge at Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And how were you treated during the time you stayed at Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
There were many Interahamwe militias who entered the church. We were always afraid of them. There were many people. We were not at peace because the Interahamwe always came to insult us whenever they wanted to. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did the priest or anyone else at the church take any steps to prevent or stop the Interahamwe from coming in to the church? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Whenever necessary, we spoke to the priest, or father, but he did not do anything. He always allowed the Interahamwe to come in. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you able to observe what sort of relationship that the priest had with those Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Did you ask a question? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'll repeat the question; there's no problem with that. My question was whether you were able to observe the -- whether there was any kind of relationship between the priest and the Interahamwe who were coming inside the church. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
They cooperated very well. One would even say that they were friends, and they always talked together. But on some occasions, they would even go into the priest's office. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, during the period that you were at Sainte Famille church, did any television reporters come to the church and interview any of the refugees who were there? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Canadian journalists came to the site and the priest took with him two young men and two young girls. They talked with those journalists. They repeated what the priest had asked them to say in the presence of the journalists. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know the names of any of the girls who were spoken to by Canadian television? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I know at least one name. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Don't give us the -- 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Should I give the name? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Don't provide us -- don't give the name, but if you could describe what -- how you knew that person. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
All I know is that I knew -- or, I know that girl very well. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How did you know the girl very well? Was the girl related to you in any way? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I told you that I know the girl well -- well enough. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Was it a relative of yours? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Do you want me to give you the girl's name? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, that girl, was she a relative or a friend? Just answer that question, please. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
She was a relative. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you know -- well, you say that the priest had told these people what to say. What was it that the priest told these people to tell the journalists? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
That they had no problem at the church, and that they did not need the protection of United Nations forces. That is what they had to tell the journalists, even if that did not reflect the reality. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did your daughter have any problems with Father Wenceslas? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I noticed that she had had problems with Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, even if she herself did not clearly tell me so. I say this because the father hid the other people, but she did -- he did not hide my daughter. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is your daughter -- is your daughter still alive today, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Please, could you repeat the question? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is your daughter still alive today? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
She died. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When did she die? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
She was killed inside the church, even though she had asked the father to show her a place where she would hide. The father did not want to do that; he hid other people but not my daughter. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you remember the date that your daughter died, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
On the 17th of June. It was on that date that I saw Mr. Renzaho again. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, we'll come to that. My first question, however, is: You say that she died on the 17th of June. Had anything happened during the previous day which -- of any particular note? Either during the day or during the night before -- 
@WITNESS ACK: 
The Inkotanyis came to look for refugees from the Saint Paul centre, but our group stayed inside the church. The day after that operation, there was a killing of a large number of people at the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, I will ask you some questions about those killings. Did you see Father Wenceslas that morning? That's the morning of the 17th. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I saw him, and it was on that same occasion -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The Kinyarwanda booth says that the witness actually did not complete her answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you complete your answer, Madam Witness? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The Kinyarwanda booth says that the witness completed her answer. She added the following: That it was on that same occasion that once more she asked her daughter to talk to the priest, or father, and asked the father to provide her a place where she could hide. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And what, if any, response was your daughter given by Father Wenceslas? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
The father replied her that nothing was going to happen to her. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did Father Wenceslas say anything to you or other refugees in your presence regarding the RPF removal of refugees from Saint Paul's? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
The father said that RPF troops had taken away the Tutsis, but that the Hutus had died. He added that all that was going to follow as a consequence would be the result of what our kinsmen did. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How long after your daughter had spoken to Father Wenceslas was it that there were problems in the church? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Other Interahamwes arrived at about 11 o'clock. They were shooting indiscriminately, and it is at that moment that some people told me that (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover) had just been shot, or killed. I ran to go and see what the situation was, and I noticed that (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover) had been hit by a bullet and that she was bleeding profusely. I almost lost my mind; I even tried to go out of the premises. When I was a few metres away from the gate, I would say when I was about 30 or 25 metres away from the entrance to the church, I saw Renzaho once more. He was standing near the water tank. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What, if any -- was he doing anything other than standing? Or only standing? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
He was standing there surrounded by many Interahamwe. But later on there was a whistle that was blown and the Interahamwe stopped their activities. In any case, this was simply because they had ended their operations. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I just wonder whether the name that's been mentioned can be removed and put into -- under seal, as it might identify the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will do that. On both occasions. Even if there's no explicit link, if follows from the context. 
Video booth, please do not transmit that sequence. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Did the bodies of those people who had been killed remain in and around the church? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Is it to me that you are putting that question? The bodies were placed on stretchers and hidden in the garage. But I did not want -- I did not want my daughter's body to be taken along -- or, taken away together with the other bodies. I told them that even if they had not granted me the favour of sparing her life, they would not refuse to give me her body. I then buried her body in the garden of the parish. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Witness. Now, you've told us, I think, that was the 17th of June. Did anything out of the ordinary happen the following day, that you recall? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Subsequently some young people were able to jump over the fence, and then they came -- they went inside the church building. Two days later, the one -- the person called Angeline, who was an inspector of education -- and here let me add that the young people were 12 in number -- or, rather, it was the following day that Angeline Munyakazi (sic) and the priest came to the office. And even if I don't know the content of their discussion, they nonetheless called the young men, and Munyakazi took them with her, and those young persons did not come back again. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you have told us that you left on around the 24th of June. How did you leave Sainte Famille church? How was it that you were able to leave the church? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
United Nation vehicles came to the site, and they asked us to get on board and they took us to Kabuga. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you very much, Madam Witness. I know it is not easy doing this at a distance, and that we were also dealing with very difficult matters for you, and I want to express my appreciation for you assisting the Trial Chamber. Thank you. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I also thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will then hear the cross-examination tomorrow. 
May I ask Mr. Diallo, can we start 8 o'clock Canadian time, or is it the preference to start 8:30 tomorrow morning? I noticed that we opted for the last alternative this afternoon. 
@MR. DIALLO: 
Mr. President, as far as we are concerned there is no problem. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, 8 o'clock tomorrow will be fine in your end; is that so? 
@MR. DIALLO: 
Mr. President, just to say that the witness is requesting that we start at 8:30. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. We will do that. So then the connection with the video link can be switched off. Thank you very much, Madam Witness. Do not discuss your testimony with anyone, and we will see you again tomorrow morning, your time. Thank you. 
The Court is then adjourned to 8:45 tomorrow morning, when we will continue with Alison Des Forges's testimony. 
Would you think, Defence, that it is at all possible to finish the video link cross-examination tomorrow, or should we make preparations for continuation on Wednesday morning -- or, afternoon, this time? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
No, Mr. President, I believe we should be able to finish our cross-examination tomorrow. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's very helpful. 
If there is nothing else, we will then adjourn for the day. Thank you.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
Madam Witness, yesterday I -- we stopped at the point when the hostilities resumed in 1992. You did say in your report that when the negotiations were being carried on seriously, the RPF decided to resume hostilities. Can you confirm this to the Court, please? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I would say, rather, that when negotiations were about to begin -- because to say that negotiations were proceeding seriously at that time is not quite correct. There had been various initiatives, and it looked likely that negotiations would, in fact, begin some time after, but it was not the case that the parties were in the midst of serious negotiations. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But you were optimistic -- since you wrote in your report that the two parties were preparing for negotiations that appeared to be more serious? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It's always a good idea to be optimistic. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
From the military standpoint, what was the consequence of the RPF attack in June 1992? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The June 1992 attack permitted the RPF to establish control over a portion -- a small portion of 
north-eastern Rwanda in a more permanent way. They had had forays into territory and had perhaps briefly controlled smaller areas, but this was the first substantial success they had in establishing a foothold in the north-eastern part of the country. At the same time, the combat -- not simply their advance, but the threat of combat as well -- caused the displacement of a very large number of people, hundreds of thousands of people, who fled to the south and who, many of them, took up residence in refugee or displaced-persons camps. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Madam Witness, let me suggest this to you, if this is possible, even though what you always tell us is interesting, but give a more concise answer to the questions that I put to you. And my next question is: What was the impact of this resumption of hostilities - and, these hundreds of thousands of displaced persons on interethnic relationship in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Assuming that the first part of your question is necessarily related to the second -- that is, when you asked me what was the impact, you mean, what was the impact on interethnic relations. Certainly, it caused a deterioration of those relations, but one that was not universally felt or was not -- was not felt in exactly the same fashion throughout the country. That is to say, obviously, it was the people in the north-east who suffered most, and for whom the question of relationships between Hutu and Tutsi suffered most immediately. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. The third offensive of the RPF was in February 1993. What were its consequences at the level of the national -- at the level -- at the national level and also in terms of displaced persons? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The immediate term, in the short term, the result in terms of territory controlled, was that the RPF acquired control over a much larger part of not just north-eastern Rwanda, but also north central Rwanda. These territorial gains were reversed at the time of the ceasefire when the RPF agreed to return to its original territory, and where a buffer zone was established between its territory zone of control and the rest of Rwanda. 
In terms of interethnic relations, the blow was far more serious and called into question for many the ultimate intent of the RPF -- that is to say, whether the RPF meant to reach a solution to the conflict through negotiations or whether its intent, rather, was to pursue a complete military victory. The long-term effect of this was to push forward -- to -- to increase the reasons for distrust, particularly in the heart of several parties of -- parties opposed to the MRND that had previously been more or less in agreement with the position of collaboration with the RPF, so that the opening wedge had been driven within these parties -- a process that was to lead eventually to the division of the MDR and the PL, in particular. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And Madam Witness, in terms of displaced persons, what was the figure then? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In the short term, the number increased to approximately 1 million. Some of those people began returning home after a number of months, so that I'm not certain for how long the figure was at 1 million, or whether it varied slightly or significantly before April 1994. That figure of 1 million is ordinarily quoted as representing the population of displaced persons from February 1993 through April 1994, but as far as I know, it was a figure established early on, and I do not know whether, subsequently, it may have decreased slightly. But, in any case, the impact, of course, was enormous because the number of displaced persons represented on the order of one-seventh of the Rwandan population. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And Madam Witness, you wrote in your report that -- and these people lived in miserable conditions in the camps at the northern portion of the capital. What was the state of mind of these people who had to flee and abandon everything? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The persons with whom I spoke in those displaced-persons camps seemed to me to reflect a spirit of distress, fear, sorrow, rather than outright anger. Certainly, there were some, particularly young males, who were angry and who wished to take revenge. Perhaps it was simply that the ones I spoke with were ordinarily older and often female. But, in any case, it is likely that there was a portion of that population that was angry and ready to strike out against the RPF -- should they be given the opportunity. I would not say that was true of the entire population. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
These people were fleeing from their normal traditional contexts, since they were fleeing from their villages and their houses; would that be correct? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In fact, no. There were, of course, some people who ended up somewhat isolated from their usual units of population, but at least, within the camps I visited, I saw people organised -- for example, for food distribution according to their former places of residence. So I believe, in general, the effort was made for people to retain their original residential organisation even in the camps. Of course, that was not completely 100 per cent possible. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, you told this Court yesterday that the various episodes of war were followed by the implementation of some war tactics by the RPF; can you confirm that? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The RPF also used the techniques of infiltration; is that correct? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It appears likely, yes, there has been some evidence provided. The extent of that infiltration remains, however, subject to debate. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
In your book, Madam Witness, I read that in Kigali there were 147 cellules infiltrated, and you estimated the number of infiltrators -- the range was between 700 and 1,300, if my -- if I recollect rightly; is that correct? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, you are not correct, and I speak not of the numbers -- which I don't have in my head either, I have to say -- but, rather, of your characterisation of these people as infiltrators. In fact, I take a great deal of care in my text to distinguish between civilians who are supporters of the RPF, and to the best of my recollection, the passage to which you refer, does indeed deal with persons who are political supporters of the RPF -- that is to say, Rwandans resident in Rwanda, long term, who have chosen to espouse the ideals or the objectives of the RPF. This is very different from the word infiltrators, which to my mind, and I believe to minds of most people, implies a person not resident in a community who comes from the outside with the specific purpose of in some way serving a military objective. There is a very important difference and that difference, in part, is the one we have been discussing already in this Court in terms of what represented or did not represent a legitimate target for a civilian self-defence effort. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, there may be a difference between the English and French version of a previous question you posed, and in order to dispel any doubt there, I will ask you to confirm whether you said:
"Madam, you told us yesterday that episodes of war was followed by implementation of tactics implemented by the RPF; can you confirm that?"
Was that, indeed, your wording in French? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Oui, Monsieur le Président. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And again, with other words, you referred to the word guerrilla tactic, wasn't that the point? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, that's what we are losing now twice in the English version, and I just wanted the question to be precise and I think that's what you answered to. Thank you. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Yes, Your Honour, I'm listening to the -- to the French directly, so I am not hearing the translation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I know that you are listening to the French original, but when we read later your response in English, there was not a total similarity between the question and the answer. Thank you very much for this clarification. 
Do you want to proceed, Maître Cantier? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Madam Witness, I want to be careful about avoiding any confusion between the infiltrators -- that is, the persons that were placed by the RPF military establishment in Kigali town -- I do not want to confuse them with civilian members of the RPF. So when I referred to infiltrators in my question, I'm referring to RPF members who were specifically placed there for military purposes or for guerrilla purposes in Kigali town. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I would still suggest, Maître, that you need to return to the text, which you seem to be trying to recall here. Because it was certainly not my intention -- and, I believe, I wrote very clearly in that text -- that the groups I was describing by those numbers were groups of Rwandans resident in the city who had -- or, in the country, who had chosen to affiliate themselves with the RPF. And I believe those figures date from the time when the RPF was a signatory to the final Arusha Accords, and therefore, a legitimate political movement in Rwanda. 
So, I -- I think it's really extremely important not to confuse this idea of infiltrator or even of partisans placed there by the movement, as you have just used the words, but, rather, to say, Rwandans who voluntarily chose to join a political movement which they found appealing. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But which, at that time, was at war against the legitimate authority in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
No, in fact, Maître, as I just pointed out, those figures I believe dated from the period after the 
Arusha Accords, when the RPF had signed a peace treaty, and when it was anticipated that it would become a political party, like any other, participating in a new government; it was not a time of war. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, to whom will you ascribe the killing of politicians, Gatabazi, Gapyisi and Rwambuka? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I have not myself made an extensive study of those three cases. I know that at one point, the investigations of Rwandan investigators in conjunction with the UN civilian police attributed the assassination of Gatabazi, in any case, to assailants who were not RPF. I am, of course, aware of subsequent information presented by Mr. Ruzibiza and others. I have not myself verified this information, but I recognise that the allegations have been made and made with a significant amount of supporting detail. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Gatabazi, we have. Could you just give us the spelling of the two other names, Maître? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Gapyisi is G-A-P-Y-I-S-I. Rwambuka is R-W-A-M-B-U-K-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, these killings were the cause -- constituted the cause of the pogrom against the Tutsi? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping)... Maître, the killing of Rwambuka and the killing of Gapyisi had no immediate impact. Are you referring after -- are you referring to the killings that took place in Kigali after the assassination of Gatabazi? Or, are you referring to something else? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Madam Witness, more specifically, the killings that took place following the killing of Gatabazi. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It appears to me likely that the killings of Tutsi in February 1994 were the immediate result of the assassination of the head of the CDR party, Mr. Bucyana, who was killed in Butare immediately before the killings of Tutsi took place. It is accurate that Bucyana was killed by a mob in Butare -- that apparently was motivated by a desire for revenge for the death of Gatabazi. So in that sense, one could trace the killings of Tutsi in an indirect way back to the assassination of Gatabazi, but one could not establish an immediate and direct one-to-one relationship. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Bucyana is number 31 on the spelling list. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, are you able to confirm if the killing of these Hutu politicians -- moderate Hutu politicians further contributed in deteriorating the interethnic relationships? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I am unsure why you have introduced the term moderate Hutu. In any case, Mr. Rwambuka was the bourgmestre of a commune in Bugesera notable for abuses of Tutsi, and for the killing of Tutsi in fairly large numbers. I do not know that the label moderate Hutu is appropriate for someone against whom there exists a significant amount of information concerning abuses of Tutsi. That label aside, it is certain that the assassination of politicians of whatever ethnic group contributes to destabilising a society and to increasing tensions. 
I would point out, however, that the general attribution, or the more -- shall we say -- the more widespread assumption that it was the RPF guilty of those three killings, is a more recent phenomenon, and to the best of my recollection at the time, was not one that was widely held. It was alleged, but it was not -- to the best of my recollection -- a widely held conclusion that the RPF was guilty of those assassinations. And in that sense, one could not conclude that it was the killing of those three men that contributed to an increase of hostility against the RPF or against the Tutsi as an ethnic group; that would be reading history backwards. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, I shall not take that risk. But those opinions, were they -- they were opinions of the observer, but the people themselves, don't they ascribe these killings to the enemy, the RPF, with all its possible assimilations? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, it is always a matter of speculation what "the people" are believing at any given time. I do not know that there was any attempt made to sample population and find out what people believed about these killings. All I can tell you is that certainly there were some people, notably those associated with the MRND and the CDR, who believed that the RPF was guilty of these killings. 
It was not in my experience a conviction held by large numbers of people. But I cannot say that I have carried out the studies necessary to confirm that. It is simply my recollection from having been in Rwanda for certain periods of time during that period, and I do not recall it being the case that people were madly incensed against the RPF because of these killings. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, what was the impact of the killing of the Hutu or to -- the democratically elected Hutu president in --

That was correct, Mr. President. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
There, the case is much clearer for several reasons. First of all, Melchior Ndadaye, N-D-A-D-A-Y-E, had been a refugee in Rwanda for several years, and was well known to many Rwandan political figures. So he had the -- his -- his killing evoked consternation, anger, sorrow among people who were personally acquainted with him. 
Secondly, unlike the other cases you have mentioned of assassination, Ndadaye had been chosen in a generally acknowledged to be free and fair election, after a campaign which was run relatively free of ethnic connotations, and this was a cause of considerable reassurance and pride to many Hutu. 
Thirdly, the impact of his assassination was considerably increased by a deliberate propaganda campaign of distortion and exaggeration carried on by propaganda organs associated with the MRND and the CDR, in particular, Radio RTLM, which, in effect, told its listeners that Ndadaye had been castrated. This was a message of enormous emotional impact because of the historical practice of Rwandan kings of castrating their defeated -- castrating defeated enemy rulers against whom they had fought. 
Fourthly, the -- and I -- I would -- it is important to point out that Ndadaye was not castrated; that a medical autopsy was done by a highly respected forensic physician, and the results of his examination showed that Ndadaye had been killed by several blows of a sharp instrument, most likely a bayonet, but that his body had not been in any way mutilated. Fourthly, it was apparent that Ndadaye had been killed by Tutsi military officers. So the combination of those four elements necessarily increased the impact, one reinforcing the other, so that the killing of Ndadaye did, indeed, push much further the polarisation of the political scene within Rwanda.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Was the assassination of President Habyarimana planned, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping)... against to that is clear. One does not go out on a hillside with weapons for shooting down an aeroplane on a whim. Obviously it required planning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It has happened on a couple of occasions now, since you are listening to the original, that we lose the first part of your answer. Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
In the first analysis, from mainly historians, this assassination was part and parcel of the planning of the Rwandan genocide; am I correct? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
There were some historians and other commentators who reached that conclusion. There were others of us who took a position of simply not knowing, and saying that regardless of who committed that crime, that the genocide itself put into effect a plan for violence against Tutsi. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, do you deem this event to be the event that triggered the genocide? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That has been my conclusion for many years, and I have published that position beginning, at least, in 1999. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, according to you, who were those behind this assassination? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I have no special sources of information beyond what is available to the general public. I have, of course, read the accounts of Ruzibiza and others. I have followed Ruzibiza's testimony here and his interview subsequently. I have read the decision of Judge Bruguière. Based on that information, it seems to me likely that it was the RPF that carried out that attack. I would stress that in my mind it is of ultimate importance for this Tribunal or another recognised international body to issue an appropriate statement based upon serious investigation in order that all doubt may be removed as to the author of that crime. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, and since I am addressing an historian, did you read Mr. Ruzibiza's book which refers not only to the RPF strategy for the conquest of power, but also the assassination of the president of the republic? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
As I indicated in my previous answer, Maître, I have read Ruzibiza's book, I have followed his testimony at the ICTR, and I have read subsequent statements by him as reported in the press. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Still addressing the historian that you are, you have observed that the book written by Mr. Ruzibiza came with a foreword by Mrs. Claudine Vidal, a researcher at CNRS -- Vidal being spelt V-I-D-A-L -- 
a foreword which covered 52 pages, and this same book is also concluded by your colleague, 
Mr. André Guichaoua; am I correct? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, did those who plan this assassination -- or, rather, were those who planned this assassination aware of the consequences this would have in Rwanda from the interethnic standpoint? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, as I have replied to your previous similar question concerning the beginning of the war in October 1990, I have myself no inside knowledge of what may or may not have been the discussions. However, in this case, we do have the testimony of General Dallaire recounting conversations which he had with General Kagame, and which appear to substantiate the conclusion that the RPF was well aware of the likely consequences for interethnic relations of the -- of an eventual assassination of President Habyarimana. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I note, Madam Witness, that you expressed the wish that this Tribunal or any other international body investigate on the circumstances under which two presidents of the republic were assassinated. How can you explain that such a request was not made earlier and supported by international organisations working for the defence of human rights? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, the demand for an international inquiry by an appropriate judicial body has been made repeatedly over the years, not just by international organisations, not just by various Rwandan parties, but by organs of the United Nations itself, including the Security Council. 
In the light of all that, it is certainly difficult to understand why such an inquiry has not taken place. And, I can say only that I myself -- I find myself in accord with the original prosecutor of this Tribunal, Richard Goldstone, when he says, in his point of view, this crime falls within the mandate of the Tribunal. 
I know from discussions with various lawyers that there are technical points of international law which can be used and have been used to explain why it is not appropriate for this Tribunal -- or why this crime does not fall within its mandate. However, it appears to me, as a layperson, that these are technical issues which can be read one way or the other -- depending upon considerations that have nothing to do with the law. And it appears to me that it is those considerations which have determined the result thus far. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have your sentence repeated: "I find myself in ..." and then I think we lost something with the original prosecutor of the Tribunal. Can you just repeat exactly what you said? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I believe I said I find myself in accord - or, perhaps in agreement. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President, my assistant was, in fact, giving me the transcript of a statement to read with regard to what the witness has just stated. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, if those who ordered that such an assassination be committed were aware of its consequences, why did they not hesitate to perpetrate it? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, that is a matter of speculation. I have, as I pointed out, no sources of information on that topic. It is something which persons other than myself are best able to answer. If I am to speculate, I would perhaps conclude that although it was imaginable -- and on the basis of information that they probably had, even highly likely, that there would be violence against Tutsi as a result of any such attack. But it is my understanding now that it would have been highly unlikely for anyone, whether from the side of the RPF or the side of the MRND, CDR to have imagined the full scale of the violence that would develop. 
In other words, they may well have imagined -- and, again, I insist that this is speculation -- they may well have imagined a somewhat briefer period of killing with far fewer casualties, and perhaps also imagined or even believed likely that there would be an international intervention to cut short any such killing. 
In that sense, if that, in fact, were the train of their thought, they obviously must have been -- they were mistaken, and have perhaps since had cause to understand how very seriously mistaken they were about any willingness on the part of the international community to intervene to protect civilians. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, could the RPF not be aware of the plans that were being hatched by the powers? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Given what is generally acknowledged about the extent and quality of the information gathering apparatus of the RPF, it would appear to me highly unlikely that they were unaware of the plans for violence against Tutsi. To what extent they were aware, of course, is not clear. But that they were aware of some such plan, yes, I believe that would have been the case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Your question, Maître, referred to plans hatched by those in power in Rwanda at that time. Wasn't that the question, and that was the answer given by the expert? Can you just confirm that that was your question? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, indeed, it was exactly my question, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, did you know Mr. Renzaho before the events of 1994? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping)... it is not impossible that I met Mr. Renzaho briefly during one of my times in Rwanda prior to 1994, but I must say I have no recollection of having met him. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Had you heard about him, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
At what period, Maître? Do you mean did I know of him by reputation prior to 1994 or since that time? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Madam, I had given a time frame in my first question, I'm referring to the period prior to April of 1994. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I recall having had conversations in which his name was mentioned, yes, where people spoke of him before 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
During such conversations, were you told whether he was a political activist? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
To the best of my recollection, yes. The remarks which I recall concerning him did, indeed, speak of his political engagement. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you hear about his participation in the installation of the democratic process in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In fact, I must say that that is not what I recall, but I stress again that my sources of information were limited, and that I am myself working here on the basis of -- of limited recollection of those conversations. I have not reviewed my notes recently from that period, and so I am reluctant to go far in drawing any conclusions. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
How is Mr. Renzaho considered today by the regime in power in Kigali? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I have no knowledge of that question. I have never discussed Mr. Renzaho, to the best of my recollection, with anyone currently in power in Kigali. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, what was the military and security situation in the town of Kigali on the 7th of April in the evening? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I assume by the evening of 7 April, you mean, after 4 p.m. in the afternoon? If that is correct, then the situation was that combat had resumed, that the RPF forces -- already present in the city -- were engaged in combat with Rwandan government forces. At the same time, there were active in the streets groups of militia, mostly Interahamwe, sometimes accompanied by members of the 
Rwandan armed forces, active in setting up barriers and in locating and killing civilians. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
On the 7th of April, in the evening, had the administration already lost control of part of the city? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do not know in detail what was the effective situation of administration throughout the city, but to the best of my knowledge, there was not a part of the city at that point that was not under -- that was no longer controlled by the administrative hierarchy. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did the situation evolve during the weeks that followed? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, of course, it did, with the -- particularly with the arrival in the city of RPF troops coming from the north, the city was under military attack from troops outside, as well as from those troops already resident in the city, and various portions of the city came under RPF control. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, regarding Mr. Renzaho's trial, you must be aware that our concern -- the 
Trial Chamber's concern has to do with the situation prevailing in the city of Kigali, and this is why I asked you whether this state of war led to any population movements within the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, there were movements of population -- we touched on that question yesterday. There were various kinds of movements of population. In the first days, there were people who fled to churches, to mosques, and to other places where they hoped to find safety -- the stadium, hospitals and so on. Subsequently, there were movements of population as people fled the city, particularly once the government itself had fled or had displaced its headquarters, shall we say, to Gitarama. Others followed and this -- and an increasing stream throughout the month of May. It appears that by late May, substantial portions of the city had been emptied of population. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, what were the consequences of this war situation on the security situation in the city, according to you? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Obviously a place that is in a war zone is a place of insecurity. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did not -- did that war situation not contribute to unleashing passions? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It would be unreasonable to suppose otherwise, particularly, the emotion of fear which, in my interpretation in any case, was the predominant motivating force for many people. But, in addition to that, other forces -- hatred, greed, opportunism -- yes, obviously, in such a situation many emotions are let loose. That is one of the reasons why the responsibility on authorities is so great. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And perhaps also, Madam Witness, of those who contributed to such a situation? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In any conflict, each party must take responsibility for its actions. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, in the course of your research, were you able to assess the forces that were available in the town of Kigali for law enforcement purposes? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, I did an analysis of those numbers based on the information available to me, which was published in Leave None to Tell the Story. I must confess to a poor head for figures, and I don't have the book in front of me, so I would venture -- I would not venture to discuss them. Perhaps, if you wish to deal with specific numbers, we could wait until after the pause, and I will bring a copy of the book and then I can speak with more certitude about this matter. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
My apologies, I trusted you to -- I trusted your memory too much, because I read your book and I must say I did not bring it with me. 
Madam, you explained to the Trial Chamber -- you stated that in Rwanda, the role of the national police force was, in fact, carried out by the national gendarmerie; am I correct? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The gendarmerie served the purpose of the national police force, yes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, was the gendarmerie also mobilised to engage in combat in the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct, the exact date, I believe, is subject to some debate, but certainly several days into the conflict, I would -- I believe in the -- the week beginning the week of April 11th, the forces of the gendarmerie were put at the disposition of the army. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Further, in the early days, were the camps of gendarmerie -- the two gendarmerie camps in Kigali, were they not shelled by the RPF troops? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The RPF attacked one gendarmerie camp, I cannot say for sure that it attacked the second, but it did definitely attack one, yes, and was, as I recall, repelled. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
In those conditions, Madam Witness, what approximately was the number of troops that the gendarmerie -- the national gendarmerie should have in order to be able to carry out the task of the national police force? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping) ... Kigali or nationwide? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat what you just said, please? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I asked for further precision in the question, whether or not the question referred to the city of Kigali or to the entire country of Rwanda. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'm always focussing my questions on Kigali town, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, with -- always with the reservation that I would wish to consult my book to be absolutely sure, my estimation would be 2- to 300. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, still giving an estimate, what was the population present in Kigali between the 
6th of April and the 5th of July 1994? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The population in early April would have been approximately 250,000 persons, and then, obviously that diminished. How fast it decreased, I could not say, but obviously by July, it would have been a much smaller number of people, presumably under 100,000 -- perhaps closer to 50,000, but that I have no sure basis for -- for going beyond that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
In those figures, would you include refugees coming from all over the place, particularly from the neighbourhood of Kigali? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
No, the estimate of 250,000 is based upon census figures, which would have been -- which would have reflected the residents of the city, not persons there temporarily seeking refuge. If you are referring to the population, including those -- those numbers of persons, it would have been beyond 250,000, but exactly how many, I cannot say. Were there 10,000 refugees, were there 20,000 refugees? I don't know. I doubt that there were many more than that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, Witness, are you able to tell the Court the number of communal policemen who were available to Kigali town? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I don't know the number of communal police, but as I recall, there were 34 communal police for 
Butare -- assuming that there was something roughly proportional there, that would make the number for Kigali between 100 and 150. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, would you know how the communal police was deployed in Kigali town? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The communal police were deployed generally at the instruction of the bourgmestres. Do you mean were they employed in traffic control or some other duties? That, I do not know. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Madam Witness, what I'm seeking to know, if you can answer, is whether they were available to the bourgmestre -- to the conseiller de secteur and how they were deployed? Centralised in Kigali-ville or whether they were distributed in the communes and the secteurs making up Kigali -- Kigali-ville préfecture? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the answer, please? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
As I said, in general, the communal police were at the disposition of the bourgmestres. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Where were they physically posted? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, I believe that most were at the communal offices, but it is likely that there were some as well in the central préfectoral office. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, do you know -- but, I'm all the same afraid that you might not be able to answer this question -- the fate of these municipal police force on the 7th of April, were they able to mobilise the entire force or were there deserters? Have you conducted any research into that area? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I have not done research on this within the bounds of Kigali city. Again, based on information from other parts of the country, communal police decreased in number during this period, at least, initially. Some were killed because they were Tutsi; others fled because they were Tutsi. But the losses, at least, in the southern part of the country represented perhaps one-fifth of the -- of the force. But I stress that this is information drawn from other parts of the country, rather than peculiar to Kigali city. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, I would like to put this to you for your confirmation: Resolution 872 of the 
Security Council, dated 5th October 1993. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have that document in front of you there? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I do not, Your Honour. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we've distributed the two versions -- the English and the French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Item 3 of that resolution decides that, drawing from the Secretary General's recommendation, UNAMIR shall have the following mandate: Paragraph A --" and, that is what I intend to emphasise for now -- "To contribute to the security of city of Kigali, inter alia, within a weapons secure area established by the parties in and around the city."
Madam Witness, you obviously must know this resolution, which was one of the enabling resolutions 
of -- from the United Nations. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now we have noted the substance of paragraph 3A, and what is the question? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, by the production of this decision of the Security Council, I wanted to establish -- and also the agreement -- KWSA, that UNAMIR had a mandate to ensure law and security in Kigali town. And then, I'll go on to ask a question -- or two questions to the witness on the presence of the UNAMIR in Kigali and the implementation of its mandate. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Maître, if I may, before we go further? The document says that UNAMIR is to contribute to the security, not to assure the security, and this in fact becomes a central point of debate subsequently when General Dallaire is informed of weapons hidden in the city and wishes to seize those weapons. He is forbidden to do so on the basis of that very distinction, which I have just made; namely, that it is not the mandate of UNAMIR to assure, but, rather, to contribute to. These are fine distinctions, but ones that, in reality, carry the force of life and death. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
This subtlety is not lost on me, but all the same, UNAMIR was to contribute to ensuring that security. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Indeed, it was to contribute to the security in cooperation with Rwandan governmental authorities, and it was the inability of UNAMIR to rely upon an effective collaboration of Rwandan authorities that was, at least, partly responsible for its failure in the city. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, I'd also like to put to you -- and the KWSA agreements on issues of security -- agreement dated 10th (sic) December 1993, which I have also distributed --

The infantry battalions and the battalions (sic) of the United Nations deployed in Kigali shall supply the troops or the personnel and will ensure control of the weapons secured area."

@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, as far as you are concerned, what is your reading of the specific mandate of the UNAMIR with regard to maintenance of security and order in Kigali before knowing the manner in which it is interpreted? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Well, to begin with, Maître, this does not deal with the larger question of maintaining security; it deals with the very narrow question having to do with the placement of arms and the movement of troops. 
In that regard, the language is apparently subject to different interpretations. My interpretation as a layperson would be quite simple: That MINUAR had the responsibility for putting this 
weapons-free -- free zone in place with the help of the gendarmerie and the communal police, that is, that they would perhaps be equal partners, but that certainly a power of initiative would exist on the side of UNAMIR. This was an interpretation explicitly rejected in New York when Dallaire attempted to implement this, based on an interpretation like that I have just presented. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, what was the number of UNAMIR troops present in Kigali as of the 6th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I could not tell you the exact number. The number in the country was somewhat less than 2,800. There were troops stationed in the north -- a substantial number of them, perhaps 2,000, but again, I would have to verify this. I believe I have the number in Leave None to Tell the Story, but I don't have it in front of me. 
In fact, come to think of it, it would have been much less than that -- now that I think about it, because the troops that were most responsible for Kigali city were the Belgians. And the Belgians, as I recall, were 400 -- I believe, 400. So, the number that we're looking at would then be considerably smaller. There were the Bangladeshis -- no, I would really -- I would really have to -- to check those figures to be absolutely sure. And I would ask perhaps for your patience in returning to this question after the break when I have the opportunity to have the book in front of me. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, if I can assist? I've just had someone go and fetch a copy of the book. If my friend is happy for me to have the book put in front of Dr. Des Forges, then it may save us time later. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very helpful, but it may still take time to find the exact page. So, maybe we could just keep it close here in the courtroom and move on for the time being. 
@MR. CANTIER:
I've also had mine brought, the French version. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, what was the role of the United Nations troops in the maintenance of security and order in Kigali? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In the first days, the UN forces attempted actively to save lives, rescued some people, assisted in the evacuation of others, provided protection at various points in the city. That would have been roughly from April 6th or early April 7 through April 11 -- shall we say. 
Then, the retreat began with the announcement that the Belgian forces would leave, and with the decision in New York that the UN troops should play a much more restricted role. In fact, they had been told as early as 8 April, I believe, not to allow civilians seeking protection to enter their quarters. Some continued to allow such persons to enter their quarters, nonetheless. But, the general account of their assistance was a very limited one and one which declined -- which became increasingly restricted, except for a few notable points. 
For example, at the Hôtel Mille Collines, where UN protection was actually increased after international attention was drawn to the plight of Tutsi who had sought shelter there, but in general, you could summarise it by saying precious little -- and even that decreased in time.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. 
Let me move on to another line of questioning. On the issue that concerns us, the issue of Kigali préfecture and its préfet, Madam Witness, have you examined the tasks that in a general manner are to be discharged by the préfecture and its préfet? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I have a general knowledge, yes, of the tasks of the prefect and the work done by the préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Are you able to recall these, briefly? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Speaking of the prefect, his task would have been primarily to implement government programmes; to assure the delivery of mandated services; to ensure public order; to assist the authorities of the judicial system in carrying out the implementation of laws; the -- to oversee the provision of various bureaucratic measures, having to do with the keeping of records and the registration of population. In short, he was the chief executive authority for the administration within his jurisdiction. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The maintenance of cleanliness and hygiene, was that part of the duties of Kigali-ville préfecture? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes. That would be encompassed, I would suppose, in the category of delivering services, necessary services, to the population. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
As of the 6th of April 1994, and in the light of the events, what were the specific tasks that were carried out by the préfecture? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I'm sorry. I don't understand that question. Could you be more specific, please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
From the 6th of April 1994 onwards, and given the situation prevailing in Kigali, did the -- was the préfecture not entrusted with other tasks to carry out? And I'm thinking more specifically of the problems of supply and foodstuffs and water. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Judging from the concerns reflected in the prefect's public pronouncements on the radio, the provision of food certainly was among his concerns. In addition was, of course, the implementation of the programme known as civilian self-defence. I would say that those two perhaps -- and controlling looting and -- and pillaging, would have represented areas of activity that consumed the major part of his attention, if one is to judge from the kinds of comments available to us from radio broadcasts. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. 
Were you able to carry out research on the fate of the préfectoral administration after the 
7th of April 19 -- after the 6th of April 1994, or was there a reduction in the number of staff? Were some of the staff members killed? Do you have a specific idea of the situation that prevailed at the Kigali-ville préfecture on the 7th of April in the morning? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping)...precise knowledge but, rather, a general -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now -- and now the answer, please. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I do not have a precise knowledge of the numbers involved, but, in general, certainly there would have been a reduction in the numbers of persons available, in part because some had been killed, in part because others had fled or were in hiding. This conclusion is based upon the radio announcements, for example, calling for people to return to work, seeking particular persons who were needed, all of which suggests that it was a situation where not all members of the administration were present and fully functioning.

Were you able to determine, Madam Witness, whether the administration of Kigali-ville préfecture was able to operate in a satisfactory manner and provide services to the citizens during that period? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Clearly, the administration was not functioning normally. Nothing functions normally in a wartime crisis situation. Was it performing satisfactorily? That, I think, must be judged by the objectives which were given priority and how resources were used. In any time of crisis, persons in authority must make choices, where to invest their personnel, where to invest their petrol, what to do. 
In the -- in considering the objective of searching out and eliminating Tutsi, in that perspective, I think one would judge this administration as having performed satisfactorily, according to the objectives of those who established a desire to eliminate Tutsi. 
According to other objectives, were the objective to be, for example, the protection of all civilians resident in the city, regardless of ethnicity, then, obviously, one would have to judge its performance as unsatisfactory. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What was the role of the préfet in the Rwandan administration, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
As I said, Maître, the préfet was the chief executive officer, the implementer, the head administrative authority in the préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you not write and regularly state before this Tribunal that the main role in the administration was entrusted to the bourgmestre? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do not recall having made such a statement. I recall having said that, in terms of the ordinary life of people, the bourgmestre was the authority closer to them and more directly and intimately concerned with issues of their daily lives, such as admission to schools, provision of land, questions of that nature. I do not believe I have ever said that the bourgmestre was a more important authority than the prefect. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That was not my suggestion either, but I had taken note of what you just confirmed to us, that is to say, that the bourgmestre was closer to the population and had regular interactions with the population. 
Madam, was it the case of the bourgmestre of the main commune of Kigali, Nyarugenge? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I'm sorry, Maître, I didn't understand the question. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
My question was to determine whether the bourgmestre -- the bourgmestre of the main commune of Kigali town, the Nyarugenge commune, was also very close to the population and whether the population would go to him first when it had problems. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The urban situation is obviously different from the rural circumstances in which well over 90 per cent of Rwandans lived. My conclusions having to do with the proximity of bourgmestres to the population is based, rather, upon the rural model than the urban model. Whether this was equally true, that is to say, the importance or the proximity of the bourgmestre in the daily life of persons in his area of responsibility, whether that was equally true for the three communes of Kigali city, I do not know. 
I would suppose that, yes, in many circumstances the bourgmestre would have been the authority to whom people ordinarily turned first, but perhaps the existence of the préfecture in near proximity somewhat changed that relationship. That would have been very different from the rural communes, where a trip to the préfecture ordinarily meant a considerable displacement. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And, Madam Witness, in this organisation, the link with the lower rungs, that is to say, the secteur, the conseiller de secteur, the conseiller de cellule, the nyamukubi (sic) -- nyambakumi, was it also -- was that link also through the bourgmestre? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In ordinary circumstances, Rwandans are very scrupulous about observing hierarchical lines. There are occasions, however, and we have seen that in one of the radio transcripts we have looked at in this trial, where the prefect is apparently speaking directly to the conseiller. So I would suppose that, in certain circumstances, particularly in a situation of wartime where the prefect is himself resident in the city, that there may have been some deviations from usual practice, and the prefect may have, in fact, been more directly in contact with conseiller than would have been normal bureaucratic practice in situations of peace and in the countryside. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, did you know the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do not know either the current bourgmestre or the person who was bourgmestre in 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, you stated in your testimony, as well as in your report, that the appeals of the préfet to put an end to the killings, the lootings, the rapes, were not complied with. And, for that purpose, you quote -- or, you mention a testimony -- and I'm looking for the reference -- so it is taken from your report, and it's French version on page 17 under the heading "Double Language and Deception." And the quote I'm about to make is in the last but one paragraph of this chapter. 
@MR. CANTIER:
In order to enable you to locate the excerpt in the English version, Mr. President, it is, in fact, the chapter on operational civil defence, and it's two paragraphs prior to that one. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything you want to read or highlight to the witness? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. Mr. President, I have already stated the beginning of my statement, and it was merely to say that that sentence, "In spite of the -- despite Renzaho's call for arresting and prosecuting wrongdoers, one of his subordinates has testified that Renzaho failed to act when he indicated persons who should have been arrested for such crimes as murder."
And then there is a footnote, footnote number 38, and we see under footnote 38 "Radio Rwanda broadcast, May 19th, ICTR document --" I won't mention the K-number -- "and testimony of Witness BU in the trial of Karemera, et al.," March 8th, 2006, pages 35 to 38 in the English version. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
And my question, Radio Rwanda, the programme of the 18th of May, was looked at during the examination-in-chief, at least excerpts of it, and I would like to insist on Witness BU.
Madam Witness, did you meet with that witness, BU? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Can you please slow down. 
So let's take that question again. What was the question? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, did you meet Witness BU? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Before addressing the question, I would like to say that, in your preamble, you said that I had asserted that measures had had no effect. And you listed a series of measures, including pillage. In fact, I have testified based on -- on radio broadcasts that measures against pillage did have an effect. And I drew the contrast between that and measures against killing of Tutsi, in particular. 
On your specific question, I do not know who Witness BU is. I know him only by his protected code, BU, and by the content of his testimony, which made clear that he was, in fact, **************************. Beyond that, I know nothing of Witness BU. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So you did not interview him yourself and simply relied on his statements before the 
International Criminal Tribunal? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The footnote is clear. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But this was a protected witness, madam. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Indeed. That is why I said I have no knowledge of this person other than his coded initials. I do not believe I have met this person, but I do not know that for a fact, since I do not know the person's identity. But, to the best of my recollection, ************************** of Prefect Renzaho in 1994 whom I did, in fact, know and interview, is deceased. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Are you aware that this person was sentenced to death, for perpetrating a genocide in Rwanda, on one first occasion in 1997, a death sentence which was confirmed by the Kigali court of appeals in 1998, and that since then that person has appealed to the supreme court, an appeal which to this day has not been reviewed? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
As I have said, Maître, I know only the pseudonym of this person. I do not know the details of his judicial history. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when reading the transcripts from the Karemera trial of Witness BU, this issue was not covered. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, it may have been discussed, but all I can say is, if I read it, I did not retain that information. I recognise that it is frequently the case that witnesses appearing at this Tribunal have a judicial record of one kind or another. And if there were -- unless there were something particularly to draw my attention to that fact, I may have read it and not retained it. But what I can say now is that, to the best of my recollection, I do not know his judicial history. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, I was wondering about the reliability of your sources, on the basis of which you made a serious statement concerning one individual. 
My next question deals with the means available to the Kigali town préfecture and its préfet to face up to the events as of the 7th of April 1994 in the morning. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I'm sorry. Is the -- is there a question there? Is the question you are asking me to comment on the reliability of my sources in assessing the comportment of the préfecture on April the 6th or after? I'm sorry. Was that -- was that your intent to ask me that? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Madam. I was moving on to a different matter. I made an observation and then went to the following question: Would you be in a position to assess what were the means available to the Kigali-ville préfecture to face up to the situation that prevailed in Kigali on the 7th of April in the morning? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It is only reasonable to acknowledge, and I believe I have already acknowledged, that resources were limited in the face of a situation of dire crisis. The issue is not whether or not the administration was fully equipped. That clearly was not the case. The question is what did the administration do with the resources that were available. And for this I have already given my answer. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, to revisit the issue of impunity that you underscored, and for which you levelled accusations on Mr. Renzaho and relying on BU's testimony, what was the situation of the judicial apparatus in Kigali from the 7th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In April and for the best part of May, as far as I understand it, the judicial system was not functioning, at least not in a normal sense. This did not make it impossible, however, for authorities to detain persons, particularly those caught in -- in flagrant commission of crimes as serious as murder and rape. It would have been possible under those circumstances, and, indeed, in some places it did happen, that authorities arrested people for such crimes. And, in fact, Prefect Renzaho, according to his own statement on radio, was able to act in three cases having to do, I believe, with the crime of rape or pillage, but not killings. 
So his powers may have been -- and his resources, rather than his powers, may have been restricted, but they were not in -- nonexistent. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But, Madam Witness, when Préfet Renzaho wished to have somebody arrested and arrested that person, what was he to do with that individual? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Are you asking what would have been the physical facilities available for detention, or are you asking what would have been the legal procedure to be followed? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, the préfectoral authority could arrest individuals and was then to refer such arrested people to the judicial system. That was the purpose of my question. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
You are correct, Maître. And, as a person professionally involved in the defence of human rights, under ordinary circumstances the failure to present a detained person in appropriate ways and an appropriate time period before a magistrate would be a cause of serious concern. In the midst of a genocide, I think even the strictest among defenders of human rights would be prepared to make exceptions in order to bring genocidal killers to a halt. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, what were the measures that should have been taken? Imprisonment? Of course, no summary execution, but imprisonment? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Influencing the behaviour of large numbers of people, particularly once they are engaged in killings and other conduct which is bringing them profit, is obviously difficult. In such circumstances, ordinarily the arrest of several leaders can have a singularly beneficial effect on the conduct of others. Had the prefect wished to control these killings and had he arrested Interahamwe leaders instead of sitting down to discuss with them, it might have been possible to bring the violence against Tutsi under relatively rapid control. 
Of course, we do not know that that would have been the result, and we cannot know now because that was not the choice he made. The choice he made was, rather, to continue discussing, collaborating, thanking, and encouraging those, quote, unquote, youth leaders for their activities. And because of that we do not know whether he could or could not have effectively stopped their killing. Certainly refraining from congratulating them would have been a first step and would not have required any resources. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could this be a good moment for the break, Maître? 
@MR. CANTIER:
$(Microphone not activated)...yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And during the break we will partly look at the book. And then I noted the discussion about footnote 38 between Defence counsel and the expert witness, and there there are two references: One was the testimony of Witness BU, which we discussed, and the other one was a Radio Rwanda broadcast dated May 19th. 
Now we have in our transcripts binder two 19th of May transcripts. It appears that the closest one will be possibly P. 65, but it seems to me that the K-numbers there starts after the reference in footnote 38. So if that could be clarified during the break as to whether we have that documentation available in the file or whether we do not have it. 
And now the 20 minutes. The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1100H to 1129H)
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. That was my last question in this line of questioning. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Des Forges, what was the situation of the prison administration during that period, since we've been talking about arrests and imprisonment, detention? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
If I might first take the opportunity to clear up the question of the footnote, the reason the page didn't correspond is that I was using it -- that was the Kinyarwanda page of the transcript. The corresponding K-number for the French would be K0369077. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, are you referring to the transcripts of the radio programme? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping)...I was responding to Judge Møse's question before the break, where he had asked me to verify the K-number of a footnote. So I was simply responding to that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's very kind of you. Thank you. I now just didn't want to interrupt Defence counsel. But since we are here now, if we then look at tab 13, where we find this document, does this then mean that the passage that you are referring to in the footnote is included in the binder? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
So now I have an answer to my question before the break, and then there was the issue from Defence counsel. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Which, I must say, I have not had time to discover. It took me a while to do the other. So perhaps we can postpone that one till after lunch. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when it comes to the penitentiary situation? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
The -- within the first day or two, the prison -- the main prison was opened, and some, if not all, of the prisoners were released or fled. In addition to the main prison, however, which may or may not have been officially guarded, each commune, and, in fact, each secteur, has a lockup in which people can be kept, so that having at his disposition communal police and gendarmes, surely a very small number of them, perhaps four or six, would have sufficed to turn almost any locked, or lockable, location into a place of detention for killers. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
And now, regarding the Kigali-ville préfecture, do you have any specific information to give the Chamber regarding that? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
About the number of lockups, apart from the central prison? Is that your question? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes. More specifically, in Kigali-ville préfecture. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
There would have been certainly detention facilities, or holding cells might perhaps be a better way to express it, at the communes and at the secteur level. I have myself been in a number of these places, and they did not have the appearance of being constructed prior -- after 1994. So I assume that they were in existence at that time as well. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, you told the Court a while ago that the bourgmestre also had the authority of policing and maintaining law and order. To your knowledge, did they exercise this? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I don't, in fact, recall having said that, but I would not make it a point of contention. 
Certainly bourgmestres, in association with OPJ, could locate and detain persons accused. I have not followed the conduct of bourgmestres. I have not had the request to do that nor the resources to do that for Kigali-ville. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, could they also require -- or, call on the gendarmerie? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping)...the bourgmestre requisition the gendarmerie? Is that the question? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is the point. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
To the best of my recall, a bourgmestre could, for a short period, subject to later written confirmation. But, in any case, his power to do so was certainly less than that of the prefect. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, yesterday you elaborated on the issue of double language and ambiguity of statements and assertions made by Mr. Renzaho in radio programmes. Yesterday the Prosecutor used excerpts, and Mr. Renzaho dwelt extensively on issues that were current. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It was clear to me from reading the transcripts available, which I suppose do not represent the totality of broadcasts during this period, but certainly, to judge from the number that are extant, the prefect did indeed express himself at length on many occasions. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Madam Witness, this is more of a discussion than a speech? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
There were several different contexts, as I recall. On some occasions it was an interview situation. On other occasions it appears to have been a more formal speech. And on at least one occasion, which I believe I indicated yesterday, it appears that it -- his -- his discourse was recorded as part of a meeting being held, I believe, with the counselors. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
You seem to base your assertion of double language on the fact that the préfet, most of his speeches was at this -- one and the same time inciting to violence, while mobilising the population against the enemy. Is that correct? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is one basis. Another basis has to do with the difference between what he said and what he did. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, was it not a situation of war, a de facto situation of war, that prevailed in Kigali that led to this kind of language? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Certainly we must understand the speeches, or other expressions, as words said in a context of war. It would not be fair to do otherwise. But those words must also be understood in the context of massive slaughter of unarmed civilians, chosen on an ethnic basis, slaughter which was well known to authorities. So if the context of war is to be considered, the context of genocide must also be considered. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But, nonetheless, Mr. Renzaho, without interpreting his speeches, could legitimately mobilise the population to fight the enemy. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, we have already discussed this point. To the extent that the prefect mobilised resources, human, armament, other resources, to enable citizens to confront armed combatants, part of an enemy force that threatened imminent danger to those persons, this was a legitimate activity. 
To the extent that he provided resources, offered encouragement, gave orders which led to the use of those resources to hunt down and kill unarmed combatants, chosen on a basis of ethnicity, persons who deserved under international law the full protection of government authorities, to the extent that he permitted and encouraged the use of resources under his control for the killing of Tutsi civilians, that is not a legitimate activity. It is a violation of international law. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, your reading of these speeches, or these statements, was it not been -- were you not looking at them through your own conviction -- or, your own initial conviction of a willful and planned genocide? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
My reading of his words is in the -- or, through the prism of the reality of events. It is through the -- and in light of the fact of the massive slaughter of innocent civilians in a jurisdiction under his administration at a time when some of the resources of that administration were being used to carry out those very killings. It is in the light of that which I interpret his words. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But then, Madam Witness, are you not running counter to the principle that you stated yesterday, that is, not to read history backwards? In other words, are you not starting from the results to proceed to the intentions? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That could, indeed, be a legitimate criticism if my judgement were one formed after the fact, based on knowledge after the fact. Such is not the case. The effect of his words was immediate and visible, not simply to me as an outside observer, but to him and to his associates. 
And if I make an interpretation, it is not that of a historian imposing a retroactive judgement. It is a conclusion drawn from the situation that existed at the time of his discourse and with his full knowledge. It is not my judgement from the past, but it is my conclusion based on what he was doing, given his own knowledge of the situation in the city. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And yet, Madam Witness, you told the Court yesterday that your current analysis has evolved and that you relied on recent discoveries that you made, more specifically through the study of a document of February 1994 on a civil defence system. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Of course, my understanding of organisational aspects has developed with the availability of new documents. But that is a question quite apart from evaluating what was known by the actors at the time and establishing a judgement about the possible courses of action open to them and the actions they did take. It is not necessary to know of the existence of the February 1994 document in order to reach a judgement about the way the préfet used his resources, including his words, his authority, and his legitimacy, at the time. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, that leads -- takes me to the issue of civil defence system. Was it a new concept which was implemented for the first time in 1994 in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I am not a student of military history, as such, but I am sure that the strategy of what could be called civilian self-defence is one well established, even centuries or millennia in the past. There is nothing new about the concept. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very concisely, Madam Witness, what did it involve, concretely? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I would define it as the mobilisation of civilians, their training, and their -- the distribution of necessary material, including arms, to them in order to enable them to combat a -- an enemy as defined under international law, that is to say, a combatant force, armed and posing imminent threat to their lives. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And do you think that the recourse to such a system from 1992, 1993 will be illegitimate, taking into account the prevailing situation in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, we have addressed this question several times. Do you really want to hear it again? I'm quite happy to give you, once again, my explanation for exactly why this was an illegitimate and illegal use of the authority of Rwandan officials. But do you really want to hear that again? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, my question was specific: The idea of having recourse to the civilian self-defence system from the beginning, was it legitimate? I'm aware of what you said subsequently. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
For those who engaged in the planning and organisation of this effort, with the intention that it be used against an armed combatant force, as properly defined under international law, it would not have been illegitimate. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Was it a very covert operation, that is, the establishment of the civil self-defence system in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The documents I have seen relating to the organisation of this programme are, indeed, stamped "very secret" or, in one case, "confidential." Prime Minister Kambanda asserts that he, himself, did not have possession of the February 1994 document until well after he had lost power. 
Officers of the national gendarmerie requested to be informed of the plan, because they understood that such a plan existed, in February 1994, and they were refused, that is, officers of the general staff of the gendarmerie, so, in other words, very high-ranking officers. To me, this would suggest -- as well, of course, is the fact that apparently the prime minister was not to be informed -- this would suggest that the planning was held within a very circumscribed set of people. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you know who was the chief of the intelligence service in the years 1993-1994? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Are you speaking of the military intelligence service or the civilian intelligence service? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Military and civilian intelligence services, but, more specifically, the name of the chief of civilian intelligence who worked under the prime minister. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes. Well, that would not have been the person in charge of military intelligence, which was quite a separate operation. The person in charge under the prime minister's office was, I believe, Augustin Iyamuremye, I-Y-A-M-U-R-E-M-Y-E. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Which party did he belong to? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I believe he was a member of the MDR, possibly the PSD, but I think the MDR. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I put it to you, Madam Witness, that he was a member of the PSD. Are you ready to accept that? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, actually, come to think of it, I think you are correct. I think it was the PSD and not the MDR. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And you believe that the established -- establishment of this system from February 1994 could have gone on without the knowledge of the intelligence service? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I don't know the quality of the intelligence service attached to the prime minister's office and whether it would have been reasonable or unreasonable to expect them to be aware of this plan. My speculation would be that they should have had a general sense of what was happening, but I have no particular information about that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, the letter addressed to Major-General Déogratias Nsabimana to the minister of defence, December 1994, that is, Exhibit P. 24 of the exhibits of the -- Prosecution exhibits. I'm referring to Exhibit P. 24 -- I shall be referring to Exhibits P. 24 and P. 25. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Unfortunately, Mr. President, I have only one copy of the original document written in French. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
My question, Madam Witness, is to know if this letter is the follow-up of this document of 
February 1994. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I believe it would have been, yes, the -- the natural follow-up because the concern with the arms to be distributed, the concern with the listing of reservists resident in the various neighbourhoods, would have been exactly in line with what was called for and requested in the February document. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, and I'm referring to items 4 and 6 of this correspondence -- 
@MR. CANTIER:
Which I shall read out again, Mr. President, item 4, "The operational cells set up will receive the mission of the OPS commander town (sic) for the defence, first of all, of their neighbourhood and then for the hunting down and neutralisation of the infiltrators in the different neighbourhoods of the city." 
Item 6, "For people to know one another and be aware of their mission, the OPS commander of Kigali town shall organise meetings of the civilians and soldiers concerned in the camps that will be closer to the places of residence and will provide operational directives to them."
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam, does that not clearly mean that the civilian defence system came directly under the responsibility of the army? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is obviously a question of great importance, and I must say I was surprised to find in the transcript of 18 June a clear statement that the civilian self-defence system is to be under a single head and it is to be a military officer. That is the 18th of June, and I believe was likely subsequent to a later decision, confining the civilian self-defence system under exclusive military control, probably as a result of the critical situation of the city at that time. 
Certainly throughout otherwise, the emphasis is on a joint effort between civilian and military officers and officials. Such is the clear description in the February 1994 document. Such is the clear description in the May 25th documents, that is, the order of the prime minister and the order of the minister of interior, where they describe a joint system of control between ministry of defence and ministry of interior. 
And here you will see in the paragraph 4 that you read, and as well in paragraph 1, which you did not read, the emphasis upon the cellule. And if I may read the paragraph 1, "The cellule was selected as being an organisational entity, which is the equivalent of a section. On the basis of such a criterion, the OPS town commander will organise -- will set up a plan for the organisation of the soldiers who live outside, cellule by cellule." 
$(Microphones overlapping)...that it is the civilian zone of residence which is to be the basic unit of the system. And it said clearly that the cellule, a civilian category, is to be the -- the equivalent of a section, a section being a military category. So there you have, I believe, clearly encapsulated the nature of the effort. 
In addition, if you look to the facts of how the system is carried out, the crisis committees established at the order of the prefect are civilian committees, and they are given authority over the local operation of the system. It's only later on, when the military situation becomes critical, that is to say, in the month of June, that the military hierarchy apparently has said, "Enough of this. We're going to take control completely and run this as an integrated part of our military operation." But by the 18th of June when that announcement is made by the prefect, of course, the vast majority of Tutsi have been killed. 
And just as a point of interest, in response, again, to your earlier question about how secret the system was, you will see this document is stamped at its bottom "very secret." 
There is also the point that the response to this letter comes from the préfet. If this is a militarily run system from start to finish, why do we need the préfet involved in helping to provide the organisational apparatus?
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, were the préfets not involved simply because they were required to refer to the chief of staff of the Rwandan army -- or, sent to the -- to them the lists of the people who could be integrated in the civilian defence system? Was that not their specific role? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The préfet appears, through the radio transcripts and through the facts, as the linchpin of the system. He is the point of interface between military officers and the civilian administration. He tells the civilian administrators in one of the radio broadcasts, "I have been meeting with the military chiefs, and here is what has been decided." 
On the other hand, he is the linchpin between the administrative system and the political parties. And we see -- through the transcripts of the radio, we see him meeting the heads of the political parties and conveying the conclusions of that meeting to the civilian administration. So he is a person at the locus point, upon which the rest of the system turns. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, that is what you stated yesterday, and it's your own analysis, but in the specific case in point, we are referring to the setting up of the civilian defence system. And the answer provided by Mr. Renzaho, to be more specific, to the letter that was sent to him by the chief of staff, with the assistance of the administrative apparatus consisted in addressing -- 
@MR. CANTIER:
And this is Exhibit P. 25, Mr. President, Your Honours.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So Renzaho addressed a very brief letter to the chief of staff: "Dear sir: Within the framework of popular defence, I have the honour to transmit to you the list of persons, reservists, and others chosen -- selected per cellule for the purpose of civilian defence. Other lists will follow." 
So this is what I note. What do you say to that, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
You are correct, Maître, in summarising this letter and in indicating that it demonstrates the role of the prefect in this instance, this single instant, as being that of providing assistance in organising the operation of the civilian self-defence system. But I certainly do not believe, and I don't expect that even you believe, that his activities ceased on the 31st of March when he wrote this letter. This is but a very small part of what we're addressing. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, I'm referring to the documents that were entered into evidence by the Prosecution on the specific subject of the setting up of civilian defence, or popular (sic) defence, in Kigali. And I note you gave your opinion on the matter that the préfet, because he is the link between the military authorities and the population, was entrusted with this role as a recruiter, which he executed by sending lists to the military authorities. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Absolutely. We're in agreement that he plays the role of helping to recruit and organise for civilian self-defence as a result of an exchange of correspondence 30 March and 31st of March. There is no question about that. The question is what did he do afterwards. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And, Madam Witness, do you believe that, in the light of the events that occurred in the days that followed, the setting up of a cumbersome and complex system was possible? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I don't know how heavy or complex the system was. It was certainly effective, however else you want to describe it. It was there, and it worked. It did what it was supposed to do. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
You testified yesterday that at a given point in time there was a merger or a confusion between the militia groups and civilian defence. When exactly did this merger take place? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
As I answered yesterday in response to Judge Egorov's question, the command and control varied from place to place and from time to time. It appears that the integration of Interahamwe into the civilian self-defence system happened earliest and most thoroughly in Kigali, which is, of course, not surprising because Kigali was the place where the Interahamwe were the largest in number and the best organised. 
Certainly it appears, I would say, within the first few days and certainly within the first week of the beginning of the violence that the Interahamwe are incorporated into this system. It is, however, a progressive incorporation because, as I believe you wish to suggest, the system was not perfectly organised on the 6th of April, and it required a progressive building of connections through a system of orders, sanctions, and rewards in order to integrate the Interahamwe thoroughly. 
Later points of note would be at the end of April when the préfet calls the Interahamwe to the préfecture and sits down and discusses with them the terms and modalities of their incorporation and then the -- the progressive implementation of that in the weeks that follow. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, do you know whether Mr. Renzaho sent other lists to the chief of staff since this is what he states in his letter dated 31st of March 1994? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping) 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, just one question, which might be deemed simplistic, and I wish to apologise for that, but do you believe -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What -- what was the answer in English, please? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I was asked if I knew whether Prefect Renzaho had sent other lists, and my answer was I do not know. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Madam Witness. My question, my simplistic question, is as follows: Do you believe that such an organisation was necessary for the purpose of killing people when presenting their identity cards or killing people simply because of the way they looked? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Rwandans are, in my experience, a highly organised and -- a highly organised people with a great capacity and taste for organisational complexity. It doesn't surprise me that they chose to create an organisation that in the end is almost baroque in its levels of intricacy and sophistication, if you look at the May 25th documents. 
Are you suggesting that it wasn't necessary to have any organisation and that one needed simply to say to the population, by radio or otherwise, "Go kill Tutsi"? Surely that would have been a little too gauche and probably ineffective. It would have had significant disadvantages on the international scene, and it would have resulted in even more killing of people for personal reasons and for reasons of greed and common criminality than actually did happen. 
And I'm sure that it was in the intention of those mounting this system to ensure that it worked effectively and with the least amount of damage possible to those not included in its target. Even the protests of the préfet, for example, on the question of the people at the barricades fleecing the merchants who try to go through, is an indication of the kinds of problems that result when authorities provide arms and the authority to use those arms to citizens who will then have no responsibility for what they do. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, but, Madam Witness, if we are to follow you, double talk was not enough to convince the citizens of what they were to do. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
If I could point you, Counsel, to the portion of the transcript we examined yesterday -- where deputy -- the deputy, Rwajekare, insists that this has the force of law, this system, I think that's an -- a useful indicator of the importance of being able to cover this activity with the legitimacy of an official, and premature, if you will. 
Unless you subscribe to the doctrine that Hutu are either necessarily blood thirsty or necessarily the born enemies of Tutsi, doctrines which I find abhorrent, then you are obliged to look at an organisational structure which motivates, pressures, and obliges people to act in ways that they know to be immoral and illegal. This kind of pressure can best be brought to bear on ordinary citizens by their own government because it is the government that is supposedly the legitimate authority, particularly in assuring questions of order. And it was by putting the directives into the mouths of the authorities, known and recognised by ordinary citizens, that this system was able to achieve the massive killing of Tutsi civilians. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And, as we remember, the word referred to was R-W-A-J-E-K-A-R-E. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, we are here before a Tribunal which is judging men. And, as you stated previously, the Accused would have to be judged on a case-by-case basis. The utterances of this gentleman, Rwajekare, are not utterances of Mr. Renzaho. 
Madam Witness, one question: And still, in order to answer the question put to you by Judge Egorov yesterday, Mr. Renzaho conveyed to the chief of staff one first list of individuals, reservists, and others, who might participate in the civilian defence system. Were you able to establish that some of these people were Interahamwe who were known, or militiamen? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I -- I have not attempted to identify the members of this list. 
And I would comment also, in response to your initial remark, that, of course, you are correct in drawing our attention to the fact that the statement I spoke of was not made by the prefect himself. But we have seen many other cases where the préfet says, "We entrusted people with this authority," where he gives the orders to set up the barricades and to search for people who are hidden, so that it is not just to one quote in isolation that we are referring here. We are describing a pattern of behaviour by officials, and notably by an official in charge of the city of Kigali, that conforms to and substantiates the assertion by this member of parliament that this system has the force of law. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, you testified yesterday that, regarding Kigali town, the large-scale killings had not taken place, and you attributed it to the need to present a good image of the capital city. 
Don't you believe that there might have been other reasons for such a situation? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I certainly would not eliminate the possibility that there were other reasons involved. For example, storming a stadium or a hotel requires perhaps a larger number of men and firepower than were at the disposition of the authorities at that time, or perhaps was regarded as an unnecessary use of such resources, given that the same thing could be accomplished in other ways. I would not exclude that. But when I look at the reaction, for example, of authorities to the incidents involving the Hôtel mille collines, where it is clear that potential attacks are averted as a result of international attention, that would suggest that this is, indeed, an important consideration in these decisions.

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, on the same subject, Madam Witness, were the citizens of the world unaware of what was happening in Kigali as of the 7th of April 1994, even if no one did anything about it? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Indeed, you are right, Maître, but it is easier to ignore small-scale killings than massacres of thousands. It becomes embarrassing after a while to keep turning your eyes away from massive slaughter. I'm sure that that played a role in decisions both in Kigali and in Washington, London, Paris, Brussels, and other places.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, on the civilian defence, self-defence system, I'm going to make a modest suggestion to you. Don't you think that its purpose was to play a role of an auxiliary to the army and, secondly, to fight the infiltrators and, further, to stop the killings and the looting? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
In terms of its stated objectives, I would agree that those first two were among the stated objectives. And to a certain extent, there is an argument even for the third. But the important point to keep in mind here is that those killings and pillage would never have taken place had there not been the initial call for "combatting the enemy." So, yes, I think we could make an argument that the system over time is indeed attempting to tighten control, to sharpen focus, to ensure that the wrong people are not killed, which is to say, Hutu of regions other than the north, Hutu of parties other than the MRND and the CDR. Yes, I think that certainly was the case. And from the writings of 
former Prime Minister Kambanda, he is quite specific in saying people from the MDR are coming and complaining about this because Hutu are being killed. Yes, they had to get that under control, for sure. But that's not really the point here, is it? The point is, why was the killing taking place to begin with?
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, for you, as far as you are concerned, what are the conditions of an objective recording of history? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Maître, I think this is difficult ground in that, with the current scholarship, the state of current scholarship, and the whole business of post-modernist discourse, which may or may not be familiar to a lawyer, there are those who question whether the concept of objective history exists, as, indeed, there are questions as to whether or not even such ordinary scientific activities as physics can be objective in the sense of not being influenced by the observer. So here we are really entering into virtually a metaphysical discussion which is not immediately relevant, perhaps. 
If you are asking me should a historian attempt to do honest work, drawing on as many sources as possible, obviously the answer is yes.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Madam Witness, but that is if you have to do with poor legal minds who are always concerned about getting clear and simple answers. But, to continue, do you think that, to date, the conditions are met to write the history of the Rwandan tragedy? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
History is a moving target, and we all must begin somewhere, with a modest recognition that whatever work we do may be changed, improved, corrected by others over time. But there is no point in waiting for years to pass, if that's what you suggest, because sources of information are lost. I, rather, believe it is important to begin as soon as possible, always keeping in mind that any source of information carries its risks as well as its advantages.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you think that the history that has been recorded to date to which -- in which you are one of the main actors may be reviewed? Does this history contain risks or possibilities of being rewritten? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Not only is there a chance of that happening, it is happening. It is happening sometimes in a positive sense, sometimes in a negative sense. It depends on the quality and the intention of the author of the revision and the quality of the sources being used. I have young colleagues who are now producing doctoral dissertations which are going to add to our knowledge of the field. I am also aware of political extremists who are rewriting history. So there are many ways to rewrite history. Some are more legitimate than others.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, do you believe that justice may be exercised in a historical context which is not yet fine-tuned? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
From my observations as a novice in the field of justice, I would say that the execution of justice always carries risks, perhaps particularly in situations involving the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and competing versions of the truth from multiple actors. It is obviously a risky undertaking but one that must be done. We cannot wait a generation until the actors are dead before we begin to consider who was responsible. It must be done now.
@MR. CANTIER: 
You will observe, Madam Witness, that I'm not stating an opinion; I'm only asking questions. 
Now, for the historian, Madam Witness, who, by assumption, is a scientist, is there no danger of seeking to rationalise decisions or conducts, whereas human beings are affected -- human beings, by nature, are imperfect? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Historians may draw the wrong conclusions, subject to their own misinterpretation of information. But, again, we must accept our own limitations as human beings, but that cannot be the paralysis. We must act as morally and seriously as we can in the circumstances. That is not to claim that any of us will ever render a perfect judgement.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Regarding what happened in Rwanda, there is the assumption of planning, which you have always supported, the assumption of a chaotic situation borne out -- spontaneously borne out of a situation leading to anarchy. Can that be excluded? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
On the 9th of April, before the interim government was sworn in, there was a massacre at Gikondo church in Kigali. According to the written account by unarmed UN observers, passed through General Dallaire, the observers who were of Polish nationality were lodged with Polish priests at that church. The army soldiers surrounded that neighbourhood, and the population, Hutu as well as Tutsi, took refuge in the church, gendarmes entered the church, and, on the basis of identity cards, selected the people who were to stay, who were Tutsi, and then after the Hutu had left, called in the militia. As the slaughter progressed, the unarmed observers attempted to look away, and the gendarmes used their rifle butts to force their chins up so that they would be obliged to observe the carnage which they could not stop. When the report was made to General Dallaire, he found, as did the persons observing the incident, a convincing example of cooperation between army, gendarmerie, militia, and civilian administrators. This was on the 9th of April. This is not a situation of chaos; this is not anarchy. This is highly organised slaughter, genocidal slaughter, because the victims are chosen by virtue of their ethnicity.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Madam Witness, but in this specific example that you are giving, did you obtain any evidence that this was an order from the government or the chief of the army or the gendarmerie, since you yourself said that there were several cases where civilian authorities, military authorities, disobeyed orders and went ahead to commit killings? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I have no proof of orders, although I think the development of the event itself should suffice as proof of organisation. As to the source of the orders leading to the implementing of the organisation, as I said, I have no proof. However, the event was well known, and there were, to the best of my knowledge, no arrests, no sanctions, not even any scolding, no reproach over the radio or otherwise to those who had participated. Were the authorities not responsible for giving the orders, they were surely responsible for holding the killers to account, and this they did not do. Having done nothing, at the very least, having done nothing to sanction this massive, visible slaughter on the 9th of April, they had, at the very least, opened the door, if not provided the model and the incentive, for further killings. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a moving example to everyone, and it makes the point that it is difficult to see how the chain of events over the 100 days' period can be explained as anarchy or chaos. But does that answer respond to the first limb of the question, namely, the planning selection? Based on ID cards is a very simple method, deeply rooted in the Rwandan society? And cooperation between military, gendarmes, and civilians, leaving aside a possible civil defence initiative having been worked out for some time, that too could in a reasonably organised society be arranged in three days following inflammatory statements that the Tutsi shot down the president. 
Can you elaborate on that first limb, please? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
It is true that the incident, were it isolated and the only such incident, could be interpreted as the private, quote, unquote, initiative of a group of angry army officers who meet with angry colleagues from the gendarmerie, and perhaps with Interahamwe leaders as well. But the major part of the killing is done by Interahamwe and other members of the local population who are armed and ready to go. 
Now, it would not be impossible, I suppose, to organise the distribution of weapons in that three-day period as well. I cannot exclude the possibility, but given that this is not the only such incident, it appears to me the likelihood that this was a single, isolated incident, quite different and apart from what else is happening in the country and in the city, is considerably reduced. In other words, I spoke of a single incident because, to me, it symbolises some very important points, but it is one of many points of factual information which support the existence of planning and organisation.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Madam Witness, regarding this terrible event that you have recounted, a factual clarification. I want to believe that the situation in that neighbourhood does not exclude that there was fighting between the troops of the RPF and the Rwandan armed forces around the same period, between the 7th and the 9th of April.
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I do not know that for a fact. I know that there was fighting in Gikondo after that date. Whether there was, in fact, before that date, I could not say, and whether it represented actual military fighting as opposed to other use of firearms, I do not know. And, as you say, even if it were the case, it is no excuse for gathering together a civilian population and slaughtering them.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, a rather more personal question, which is not intended to be unpleasant towards you. But do you think that your closeness to that country, Rwanda, to persons who lived there who were killed during that event is not such as will negatively impact on your objectivity? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It would be unreasonable to expect that my views were not influenced by my contacts with Rwandans. In fact, had they not been influenced by my contacts with Rwandans, one could conclude that my work was stupid and in vain, because what is the point of trying to understand a society unless one is open to its influences? However, my contacts were not with one side of this conflict. My contacts were with people who killed and who have been condemned for killing, as well as with victims. Has this diminished my objectivity? Perhaps so, but I have attempted to establish a factual basis for my conclusions, and it is for others to evaluate the accuracy of those facts and the extent of the logic displayed in the conclusions drawn from them.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, when one is faced with such a dramatic situation, is one not tempted to explain and does that also not involve a risk for the historian that you are? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It is the objective of most historians, as I know their work, to understand and analyse events. Contemporary history goes beyond the recitation of facts and the amusing narrative to attempt to understand the more basic forces which drive events. Whether this activity results in the end in any greater understanding, I suppose, depends not just on the author of the history but on those who read it. There may in the end be certain events that are simply not comprehensible.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, don't you think that this polarization of historians that we are witnessing partly on account of the establishment of the ICTR -- and I'm not criticising the Tribunal -- don't you think that this could negatively impact on history and on justice? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
One could say the polarization of history, the growing extremism and interpretations of these particular events, as other events, is not conducive to accurate, well-established history. Yes, of course, one could say that. But, deploring the growth of extremism does not remove it from existence, and it is simply the obligation, I believe, of historians who are serious about their work to attempt to find the solid ground in the middle of many conflicting and sometimes illegitimate claims.
@MR. CANTIER: 
And how do you explain, Madam Witness, your solitude today as an expert -- as a 
Prosecution expert witness? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I'm sorry, Maître. Do you mean -- in what sense? 
There are certainly other expert witnesses presented, both by the accusation and by the Defence. Although sometimes I'm not in agreement with them, I don't know that I feel terribly in solitude. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, I believe I have observed that for now, you are the only historian listed by the Prosecution. What explanation do you give to this situation?

Is that a question to the witness or to the Prosecution team, which decided to call its witnesses?

And what does this situation -- what impression does this situation give you, the situation that I may refer to as solitude or isolation? 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, once again, I simply want to raise the objection, which is really the point that Your Honour made, which, namely, it's the Prosecutor who decides who they are going to call and decide on which experts we do or do not use. It is not a matter for this witness to comment on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But let us cut this short and simply ask you the following question: Do you consider yourself lonely, in the historic environment, amongst the experts on Rwanda? That is the key question, I think. And what is your answer? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honours, as has been suggested by counsel's questions, there is a polarisation in the field of scholarship regarding Rwanda. I cannot say that I feel myself in great sympathy or solidarity with historians of -- historians of another conviction, but I would say that there are a number of us who share a similar conviction about the facts, and, among those, I do not feel in solitude, and even among the others, I often have a basis for discussion. 
I believe counsel was interested in trying to elicit the -- and, in fact, said that Reyntjens and Guichauoua had refused to come and, basically, I was what was left. That may be accurate for Reyntjens, but I don't believe for Guichauoua, because he is certainly still scheduled to appear in a number of trials. And, of course, there are other persons appearing as expert witnesses, like Binaifer Nowrojee or various others. That is spelled N-O-W-R-O-J-E-E; first name B-I-N-A-I-F-E-R. 
But in any case, it's -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It is 1 o'clock. Where are we? 
@MR. CANTIER:
We are not far from the end, Mr. President, so I can confirm right now that I will be done by 13 -- 15 -- 1315 (sic) hours if we have a break. I think I will need about half an hour maximum.

@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I have two primary occupations: One is historian; the other is a defender of human rights. In the capacity of historian, I would not comment, in all likelihood, on whether this is or is not a democratic government, simply because that's not the kind of question that I would find relevant to my work. In the domain of human rights, we also, as a general practice, avoid such terms as "democratic" or "not democratic" simply because they are so often the cause of rhetorical proclamations that have little meaning. Instead, we prefer to confine ourselves to concrete demonstrations of violations of human rights and attempts to correct them. In that regard, we have documented a number of human rights abuses carried out by officials of the current Rwandan government.

It is a question relating to the charges and the testimonies that have been adduced before Gacaca courts, and we also know that several witnesses who have come here have also testified before Gacaca courts. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the answer, please? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
This report is not an evaluation of Gacaca. We are far from being able to do that, and when we do, it will be considerably more than 15 pages long. The references indicated by counsel have to do with explanations given for killings recently in Rwanda, rather than the Gacaca process itself. If I were to answer the question about is justice possible under Gacaca, the answer, of course, would have to be it is possible. If the question were does it happen, then the answer would have to be sometimes, but not always, which is true in most judicial systems. Perhaps we will, in the end, conclude that it happens less frequently in Gacaca than in many judicial systems, but we are not yet at a point to be able to say that. We have documented a number of abuses; we have also sometimes documented cases where it worked surprisingly well. It depends on the community, it depends on the local power structure, and it is a very complicated situation to assess in a short summary. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Are you aware of the assessment or -- of the Gacaca trials that was carried out by the association called Lawyers Without Borders? In French it is (French spoken). 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
$(Microphones overlapping)... I don't know to which one you are referring, but I have read many of 
them. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, this is the second document I would like to tender into evidence. It is entitled, "Monitoring of Gacaca Courts, the Judgement Process, Analytical Report No. 2," dated October 2005 to September 2006. I regret I was not able to obtain a copy of the document in English, but the witness understands French, so I believe there will be no problem. 
Registry staff, please, could you hand this document over to the witness, please, the second document dated October 2005, September 2006? 
To be brief, I would like to mention an assessment of the association, and that assessment, Mr. President, Madam Witness, Your Honours, is found on page 43 of this report. It is on that chapter A -- rather, it is the second paragraph. There are three paragraphs in that part of the report. It is entitled, "Giving priority to effective participation of the population by clearing impediments to freedom of speech." 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have all found it, so what do we do now? Should we read something? 
@MR. CANTIER:
If you allow me, Mr. President, I will read the third sentence of that passage. 
"It is, therefore, important that measures be taken to clear all that seems to be obstacles to freedom of speech. This is all the more important as the collection of testimonies during the investigation phase by the Gacaca courts in cellules overlooked, in violation of the law, the exculpatory testimonies."
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, what do you gather from this passage? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
This observation conforms to observations done by Human Rights Watch and others, in that in the initial stages of information gathering, persons accused were not provided an opportunity to answer the accusations against them but were told that their opportunity to respond needed to await the formal trial phase itself. What we have here is a recommendation by an international, non-governmental organisation that has been conducting monitoring of Gacaca, a recommendation that in the trial phase that the accused be, in fact, afforded the opportunity to call witnesses to prove that they are not guilty. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The third document -- and after presenting the document in question will follow -- the third document is an Amnesty International report. It is dated November 2002. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Registry staff, could you please give that document to the witness? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I think this is not it. This is not the document. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. The Defence counsel said:
@MR. CANTIER:
The document was dated in 2002. The English version, 2006, paragraphs 3 and 4. The English version will be shown to you, Madam Registry Staff. This is the English version. It is being held up by co-counsel. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, I wanted to read to you two paragraphs that I have taken from this long document. The -- or, it, rather, deals with justice in Rwanda. I will read the paragraphs taken from the document. 
"The government" --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now -- 
@MR. CANTIER:
Page 36, Mr. President. Page 36 of the English version, paragraph 3. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, perhaps -- it begins about four lines from the top of that paragraph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We start with the French version now. Are you in the Amnesty International document dated November 2002 and which is entitled, in French, "Gacaca" (French spoken)? Is that the document? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That is entirely correct, Mr. President. And on the French version, it is page 33. And the second paragraph -- I will be reading from the second and third paragraphs. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. We don't find the English here, but we have the French. Please go ahead. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
"The government is extremely intolerant of dissenters or those dissatisfied with its performance to readily accusing such individuals of genocide or treason. Critics of the government, including members of the national assembly, prominent members of civil society and independent journalists, have been intimidated, detained and ill treated or forced into exile; some have disappeared or been killed." I will skip one sentence and go on to the next sentence. "Some Rwandese fear that they would be arrested if they provide evidence in support of the defendants' innocence or if they demonstrate too much knowledge or information about the genocide." 
Now, I will move on to the sentence which I have selected in the fourth paragraph. In the English version -- in the English version, this is still on page 36. "Amnesty International has received several reports of individuals who were persecuted by the Rwandese government by refusing to testify against genocide suspects, either because they had not witnessed the crimes committed or because they felt the accusation was untrue. Some of these individuals were told that, as Tutsi, they knew they were targeted for genocide. Refusing to give false testimony was effectively regarded as treason. One wonders how many individuals succumbed to government pressure." 
Now, my question is as follows: Do you think that witnesses living in Rwanda enjoy freedom of speech or can speak freely? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
We have documented cases where witnesses have been afraid to speak. In some cases, those witnesses are survivors who have hesitated to speak in defence of accused persons, including those that have protected them. In some cases those witnesses are survivors who have not accused people of whom they know, of whom they have good reason to know those persons are guilty. They have not spoken because they are afraid of reprisals, either from the accused person or from others among his family or friends. We also have documented cases of persons who have refused to speak from fear, either for or against an accused person, who are not survivors. 
So I think it is clear that there are situations where witnesses are reluctant to speak, perhaps one could even say increasingly reluctant to speak, and the killings of persons involved in Gacaca, including witnesses and judges, documented in the report we looked at briefly by Human Rights Watch no doubt make it even more difficult for witnesses to agree to speak. Nonetheless, there are many who are courageous enough to speak, even in the face of either popular disapproval, threats from individuals or, in certain cases, threats from officials. It is, I would stress, an extremely variable situation, depending upon local conditions.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, you had the experience of the trial against Father Theunis, spelt 
T-H-U-E-U-N-I-S (sic) -- T-H-E-U-N-I-S. Was that not an example of false accusations levelled against an individual? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The testimony which I heard presented, and I believe that was the only testimony presented, was certainly unconvincing and in some cases obviously distorted the facts. Whether in some cases the testimony was also outright lies, I cannot affirm for sure. I can say, having been a witness in that proceeding, that I was myself, if not threatened, at least disagreeably warned after having spoken in his defence.
@MR. CANTIER: 
I knew that you had had such an experience and that you had shown great courage, Madam Witness. 
Do you recall the name of the main accuser of Father Theunis? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I am not sure whom one would identify as the principal accuser. As I understand it, the case was developed by the prosecutor's office, although it was then presented to the Gacaca rather than to a conventional -- if you wish to use that word -- to a conventional court. Certain names have been mentioned to me as persons who participated in the elaboration of that file. And, of course, I am familiar with the names of some of the persons who spoke publicly, but I do not know which one one would choose to identify as the principal accuser.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Among the prosecution witnesses, was there not a person who is a commissioner for human rights in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I believe that one of the witnesses was a person who was at one time a member of the 
Human Rights Commission. Whether he was still a member -- I believe he was still a member, yes.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Madam Witness, before I conclude, I wish to know whether this situation does not confirm what 
Orwell -- the sentence, "Whereby those who control the present control the past." 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Orwell, O-R-W-E-L-S (sic), says counsel, the author of the best seller "1984."
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
It is a question of time perspective, is it not? Those who control the present may control the past for the present, but at some point those in control are no longer the present and at that point the past may be corrected. Perhaps that is the duty of the historian. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we agree on the spelling of George Orwell? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
I believe that Orwell is spelled O-R-W-E-L-L. 
@MR. CANTIER:
This marks the end, Mr. President, Your Honours, of my cross-examination. 
Thank you, Madam Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. We will come back to three additional documents concerning Prosecution exhibits and then the documentation used during the Defence cross-examination in a moment. 
Now, the question is, is there any re-examination? 
@MR. MOSES:
Four brief matters, Your Honour.
##
$RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Dr. Des Forges, you were asked in cross-examination regarding the -- those who might be in charge of communal police, and I think you gave an answer which indicated that bourgmestres were in charge of communal police. Is that correct? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
That is correct.
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you aware, Dr. Des Forges, of the -- what has been described by some witnesses here as the unique situation in Kigali-ville regarding the structure of the -- that particular commune whereby the police were, in effect, under the direct authority of the préfet? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I was not aware of that.
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay. Now, the second issue I think you were going to try and find -- locate in your book, and I don't know if you were able to, the numbers of either gendarmes that were in Kigali city, and perhaps if you could refer us to that.
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
At page 194 of Leave None to Tell the Story -- and, I'm sorry, I don't have the French corresponding page -- but if you look at footnote numbers, it would be the page that has footnote numbers 47, 48 and 49. I have written that the gendarmerie units present in Kigali and the immediate vicinity would have been 1,000. That was an estimate based upon conversations with several officers of the gendarmerie, as well as upon testimony in a Belgian judicial file. Although, in fact, I think the reference to the Belgian judicial file has to do with the information in that sentence about the heavy weaponry of combat soldiers and battle experience lacking for gendarmes. So, in short, the number I estimated was in the vicinity of 1,000.
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. You were also asked a question regarding the chain of command, if I can put it that way, in terms of how contact might be made and who it might be made with within the communal structure. And you referred to the fact that there was some comment during one of the radio broadcasts regarding that issue and that you had made reference to it. I don't believe, in fact, that we did look at that particular issue, and I'm wondering if you can please look in volume 2. It's Prosecution Exhibit 54; it's under tab 8, and in the English it's on page 16, the second paragraph, which has K0272364; and in the French, it's on page 23 in the third paragraph. 
And if I can just read that paragraph and ask you to comment on it, Dr. Des Forges. It says -- and this is the meeting -- sorry -- this is the broadcast which you had yesterday described as being what appeared to be a broadcast of a meeting with conseillers. And the Accused says: "During the meeting that may perhaps be held this evening, I will come back to this issue to ask that one more telephone line be made available to the public, which will then make it unnecessary for them to call me directly. When I am called, I immediately inform headquarters, which then contacts the person concerned." 
Is that the passage that you were thinking of when you gave your answer, Dr. Des Forges? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, I was thinking -- yes, I was thinking of the -- of this meeting with the conseiller. And as I look at it, I see also the -- probably the responsable of the cellule and the invitation by the prefect to use an additional telephone line rather than apparently bothering him with certain calls.
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
Now, the last point I wanted to cover in re-examination has to do with the organisation of the civil defence. And in your answers to one or two of the questions, you had referred to the directives of the prime minister, Kambanda, that were issued on the 25th of May, and which I think -- I believe you indicated in one of your answers was a good indication of the joint governance of the civil defence system between the civilian authorities and the military. 
Is that a fair summation of what you had said? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, except that I was referring to both the directive of the prime minister and the directive of the minister of interior.
@MR. MOSES: 
In particular -- looking, if we can, at the directive of the prime minister, I'm wondering whether you could, please, look at volume 1 of your -- of the bundle of documents. It's Prosecution Exhibit 37, which is in -- under tab 2-A, 2 capital A. Now, that is, for everyone, after number 31. It goes 31, then 1-A, and then 2-1. 
I'm wondering if you could look at that document, please. Is that the directive that you have referred to in your answer? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
It is.
@MR. MOSES: 
And are there any particular points in that document that you would be able to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to which would support your conclusions that the system was being run jointly by the communal authorities and the military? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
On page 2 of the French -- I don't believe I have the English -- is there an English version in here?
@MR. MOSES: 
No, there's not. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Okay. Page 2 of the French, which is marked K0242387, the third paragraph speaks of a close collaboration between the territorial administration, political parties defending the principle of the republic, and the democracy. That was, if you recall, one of the points that I made concerning the interface between the administrative structure and the political party structure. And then at the -- there may be others, but simply to save the Court's time, one further example on -- at paragraph 8.9, which is on page 4 of the document, an indication that the coordination committee at the national level includes -- includes the following people: The minister of interior and communal development, who is the president of the group, or the chair; the minister of defence, who is the vice president or vice-chair; and then an officer of the Rwandan armed forces chief of staff -- or, the chief of staff, rather -- I misread that -- the chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces, who is a member of the committee; a coordinator, who is a high-ranking officer; an assistant coordinator, who is an experienced civil servant; and then it goes on, jurist, a major, and so on and so forth. 
So the committee, in its very composition, is an indication, as well as the positions of chair and vice-chair, being allocated to the minister of interior and the minister of defence, with the minister of interior given priority.
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And just one -- on that same document, if -- looking at 8.7, on page 4, and, in particular, the second and maybe third points there, does that give you any indication as to whether or not this system is to be run by the military or any other body? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes. In fact, paragraph 8.7 establishes a préfectoral committee for coordination. And the next paragraph establishes that the prefect of préfecture is, by his office, necessarily a member and plays the role of supervisor -- or, one could call -- could say chief executor of the civilian self-defence activities within the préfectoral circumscription or territory. He also is in charge of the meetings.
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you very much, Dr. Des Forges. Those are the only matters I wanted to raise in re-examination. 
Do Your Honours have any questions for the witness? 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Dr. Des Forges, I have a few questions on different matters; the first question about so-called infiltrators. To your knowledge, how many people in Rwanda were arrested and tried on the ground that they were infiltrators and carried out relevant activities? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Your Honour, before April the 6th, I'm aware of, perhaps, several dozen cases, at the most, of persons who were charged with that crime. Whether they were rightly charged, I do not know, because I did not follow the judicial proceedings. After the 6th of April, I do not know of anyone accused in a formal judicial sense of being an infiltrator, nor in most of my interviews in most of my gathering of information have I found cases where authorities could say and present substantial information confirming that infiltrators had actually been arrested or captured in their areas.
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
And as far as private property, before 1994, a great deal of Tutsi fled the country and left behind them houses, lots of land, cattle and so on. What happened to that property? As well as after the events of 1994, the same happened to Hutus. So, is there any difference with -- if we compare the legal and the factual fate of their properties -- maybe, in general? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
In the years before 1994, as well as during the period April through July, the property of Tutsi who were killed or who fled was treated in several different ways. The major pieces of capital equipment, shall we say, automobiles, computers, whatever, were generally allocated to the most important of the assailants and/or to the local administrative authority. The land, including residences, were allocated by the administrative authority generally to people in his circumscription, in his territory. Crops and farm animals and smaller property, like pots and pans, would be divided among the assailants, either on the spot or soon after when the crop became ripe for harvest. This was a cause of some administrative concern, because in some cases, and I believe also in Kigali city from the broadcasts we have read, groups of assailants left their own domain, so to speak, and went to other parts of the city or into other regions to carry out these killing and pillaging activities because it was profitable to do so, and occasionally you find administrators scolding these groups, saying, "You must stay at home and confine your -- confine your activities to your home turf." 
For the question of the property of Hutu who fled the country, I do not know of a formal, legal order in the early months, that is to say, from April or May, in those areas where the RPF had taken control or ultimately from July through September or October. In practice, what happened was that, particularly the residences in the city and in some cases property in the countryside, especially the east, was occupied by either military or by Rwandans, most of them Tutsi, returning from outside. 
After September or October, I'm not sure of the exact date, 1994, the government publicised -- in the refugee camps -- publicised a policy guaranteeing that those people who had fled would have their property restored. In fact, a substantial number of those who returned did have their property restored. In some cases, it took a long time. In some cases, it required judicial action. I would not say that it has been 100 per cent effective, but, certainly, in many cases property was restored. In other cases, because there was official pressure to vacate property for persons returning from exile, those then, in occupation, would make accusations against those returning and particularly accuse them of participation in genocide in order to be legitimated in their holding and in order to avoid having to relinquish or give back the property to those returnees. That also happened. 
$(Pages 34 to 50 by Leslie Todd)
1530H 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. And the last, I think, very simple question: To your knowledge, who was the first, after the 6th of April 1994, to come up with an idea that what was going on in the country in Rwanda fell under the genocide convention? States, governmental, or non-governmental organisation; who, and when? If -- yeah. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Human Rights Watch wrote to the Security Council, I believe it was the 19th of April, raising the question -- not affirming, but raising the question, "On the basis of the current evidence, this appears to be a genocide". I believe the next affirmative statement was by Oxfam, on perhaps the 21st of April. Privately, among diplomats and in diplomatic correspondence, the term was in use at that time, but was not publicly enunciated. The Pope used it in early May -- I believe the 3rd of May. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you very much. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You kindly came back to us and referred to page 194 of Leave none to tell the story concerning the number of gendarmes in Kigali. Does it follow from the book how many police officers there were, communal police, in Kigali in the same period? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour, my research was not headed in that direction. I was dealing with the national -- with the gendarmerie in another aspect, and I did not pursue the question in terms of communal police. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You mentioned a political agreement to distribute the préfectoral posts according to the parties. If you look back to the period in 1994, how would you describe the party affiliation of the prefects during that period? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Both at the level of the préfet, and at the level of ministerial appointments, there continued to be a conformity -- the arrangements continued to conform to the notion that the spoils should be divided in a certain proportion. And, as far as I know, that was the same agreement as had been in effect since 1992. In fact, what was happening, of course, was that the MRND was becoming so powerful that it pulled into its orbit other political figures, regardless of party affiliation. So we were moving into the direction of a one-party arrangement, regardless of the fact that other parties maintained their nominal existence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, what does this mean in practical terms? There were how many préfectures? Eleven? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And how were the seats distributed? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Oh dear. The one that was new, that is to say a party which had not previously shared spoils at préfectoral level, was the CRD, the coalition -- the CDR, the coalition for the defence of the republic, which received the préfecture of Byumba. Kayishema continued to represent the Christian democratic party. Gisenyi was allocated eventually to the liberal party -- that was after the préfet of Butare was changed. Kibungo went to the -- hmm. I'm sorry, I would have to sit down with pencil and paper and work it out. The -- the major -- the -- the biggest force, the party which had the predominant number of préfectures would certainly have been the MRND. The PSD was given Butare after the 19th -- after the 17th of April. Gikongoro was MRND, Cyangugu was MRND, Gitarama was MDR. Beyond that, I would have to do some research. I'm sorry, I don't recall. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When was the préfet of Butare changed? 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
The announcement appeared on the radio on April the 16th, I believe -- 16th or 17th. I think the government meeting was the 16th, and whether it was actually on the radio the 16th or the 17th, I do not recall. But it was that weekend. And then the actual installation was the 19th of April -- the installation of the new préfet. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was the end of your testimony. Thank you very much for having come the long way to testify before the Tribunal. We wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you very much. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
$(Witness excused) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, you very kindly, last Friday, provided excerpts of three previous French Prosecution exhibits, namely, P. 61, P. 62, P. 63. We have them now in our binders, but they should be formally entered as exhibits in the other language. So, do we then agree that the English version of P. 61 will be, Mr. Matemanga, P. 61B, whereas the previous version was P. 61A; the English version of the 18th of June transcript becomes, then, P. 62B; and the English version of the second transcripts, dated 18th of June '94, becomes P. 63B. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 61B admitted)

There are no other outstanding Prosecution exhibit issues, to my knowledge.

Absolutely, absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@MR. MOSES:
That's the only other one.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes. 
Now, Defence counsel, please. You started with resolution 872 from 1993, adopted by the Security Council. Do you want to start with that as your first exhibit? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I understand that that document is also available in English; was that so, Defence counsel? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. We have it in both French and English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could we make sure that the registry has both versions. That seems to be the case. A for the French, B for the English. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 39A and D. 39B admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you want to tender anything concerning Father Theunis, T-H-E-U-N-I-S, or was this your last exhibit? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
If my colleague of the Prosecution does not have any objection, I would like to do so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It wasn't actually used. 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, it wasn't. Therefore I wouldn't be in agreement. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, you will have to wait for another opportunity, then, even if we have a nice picture of Father Theunis here now. Maybe some other time. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I will find that opportunity, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any other exhibits? That doesn't seem to be the case. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President, for the time being that's all we have. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will recall that the witness in the other country that we will be hearing through the video link asked that we start at 8:30 that country's time. That means that we will start in 45 minutes with the video link, and that will give ample time for the technicians to install the video link. 
Anything of a practical nature we need to address before we take the break? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honour, other than it might, at the -- I don't know, at the conclusion of the video link testimony, whether that's a suitable time for Your Honours to address any other issues regarding the continuation of the trial, or whether -- I'm in Your Honours' hands regarding that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will see how much time the cross-examination requires, but one way would be maybe to have a brief session tomorrow after the finalisation of this video link, which will probably spill over after normal working hours in the Tribunal. Would that be agreeable, Defence counsel? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Of course, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, we will then adjourn to 4:30.

Madam Witness, before I start, may I, first and foremost, on behalf of Mr. Renzaho, express our most sincere condolences and our deep compassion for the personal drama you were affected with in this sad year of 1994. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. Madam Witness, I simply wish to deal with a number of details with you. First of all, regarding CELA. Yesterday you referred to a young man called Bitega. 
Can you hear me, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Yes, I can hear you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I was saying that yesterday you referred to a young man called Bitega who allegedly advised you to go to the Sainte Famille parish. Do you recall having made such a statement? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Yes, I do. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Tell me, Madam Witness, when he was advising you, was this done in the presence of Father Munyeshyaka? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Father Munyeshyaka was present. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
According to you, Madam Witness, why was it that this young man was not among those who were selected on that day? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
In any event, this young man had also gone to Renzaho, but I do not know how it was that he was next to the gate. And then after we were told to go back home, he whispered to us that we should not go back home, and Father Munyeshyaka told him, "If you are afraid, go to the church." And it is why we went to the church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. And you went to the church in the company of that young man, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Madam Witness. Madam Witness, to conclude on this matter of CELA, do you recall having testified in the trial of one Macumi, Alphonse, in Rwanda, regarding the disappearance of your kin? As a civil party. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
It is true that Macumi *********************************. He was the one who kept all the weapons that were distributed to the Interahamwe, and he was a nyumbakumi, he was the head of ten households ******************************. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I shall spell out the name Macumi: M-A-C-U-M-A (sic). 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And the first name is Alphonse. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, do you thus confirm that you were a civil party in the trial against Macumi in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Yes, I testified against Macumi, and I'm also accusing him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, is the last vowel I or A? Macumi, or Macuma? Can you help us, madam? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
His name is Macumi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, I have before me the judgment which was handed down following your testimony against Macumi, and with the Trial Chamber's leave, I would like the Kinyarwanda booth to read out an excerpt of this judgment -- at least two paragraphs of this judgment. And then I shall request from you that you comment on the contents of this paragraph. Did you understand me, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I have already provided the said documents to the Kinyarwanda booth, which is the first document in -- of the bundle of documents I provided to them, and the part to be read is underscored in blue on the first page of the document, and the last paragraph of the second page, which spills over on the third page. If the Kinyarwanda booth could be authorised to read out the parts that have been thus underscored. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please do that. Thank you. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel, do you wish us to read out the text in Kinyarwanda, or do you want us to translate it into French? A question put by the Kinyarwanda booth. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Perhaps it would be better to read it out in Kinyarwanda for the witness, and then the translation should be made according to what we customarily do. I don't know whether this is the best formula. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Shall we try that? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, it's not possible to read it out in Kinyarwanda and have it translated into French at the same time. Since this comes from the same booth, the Kinyarwanda booth, it cannot be done simultaneously. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Why don't you rush directly into French, in view of the fact that the witness is fluent in French. 
Shall we start? 
@THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
Paragraph 11: "Regarding Alphonse Macumi, also known as Kigomeke, while he was in Rugenge, Nyarugenge commune, Kigali-ville préfecture, in the Republic of Rwanda. As a perpetrator, co-perpetrator, or accomplice as provided for under articles 89, 90, and 91 of the penal code, booklet 1, he killed Tutsis after having taken them out of the place of refuge, that is to say respectively the CELA centre, Sainte Famille, and the Saint Paul centre. The victims are, amongst other people, Charles Rwanga and his children, Ngarambe, Charles Gahima, as well as many others. It is a crime which is provided for by article 312 of the penal code, booklet 2." 
End of translation of paragraph 11. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do the court reporters have this excerpt? French court reporters, you have not received this Kinyarwandan excerpt? You will see the spellings there. So we start with paragraph 11, and Kigomeke is K-I-G-O-M-E-K-E, and the other names are spelt with capitals. 
What is the next portion then, Defence counsel? Still marked with blue, isn't it, the next page? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. And may I specify that the court reporters also have been given folders where all the documents are contained. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excellent, thank you. 
Dear booth, shall we take the next portion? 
@THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
"Since the floor is given to the public prosecution for it to expose the accusations against Macumi, as well as the evidence on these accusations, and that the following person has stated what follows: Macumi was a nyumbakumi" -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is too fast, this is too fast. Can I ask you to slow down a little bit. Let's start again. Yes. 
@THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
"The floor has been given to the public prosecution office in order for it to mention the accusations against Macumi, as well as the evidence against him, and that the public prosecutor stated what follows: Macumi was a nyumbakumi. He started carrying out criminal acts as early as 1990 when he had people arrested under the pretext that they were accomplices. Subsequently he was a member of a crisis committee, along with Mukandituye, Nyirabagenzi, and Telesphore. He would hold meetings in his residence during which leaders would be given instructions in order to kill people. He had Charles Rwanga and his children killed, as well as Emile Rukundo, Bicinoni, after having taken them out of Sainte Famille. There are a number of witnesses who have provided such evidence, and they are the following: Rose Murorunkwere, Pierre Nkusi, Mathieu Muvunyi, Alphonse Gisagara, Béatha Mazimpaka, Pierre Gatete, Donatha Niragire, Sylvie Barakagwira, and Gisèle Mukamfura. Aluwa, Joseph, states that Macumi burnt down Mukamazimpaka's house." 
End of the translation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
My thanks go to the Kinyarwanda booth. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, after having heard these paragraphs, I wish for you to comment on the allegation of the prosecution, whereby the persons killed were abducted from the Sainte Famille parish without any reference being made to the CELA centre. What can you state regarding this situation, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Could you please repeat your question, Counsel? And briefly so. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Madam Witness. On the basis of the allegations made by the prosecutor, the people who were killed were allegedly abducted from the Sainte Famille parish, and a number of people are mentioned as being witnesses testifying to that effect. My question to you is as follows: Why is reference made to Sainte Famille rather than to CELA? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Most of the people who are mentioned, such as for example Gisagara, Mukamazimpaka, are people who testified on members of their family. And I also told you about members of my family who were killed. My impression is that this is a summary of the testimonies that has nothing to do with the statement -- or, the testimony I made. Because there are other people who are being referred to in this paragraph. Alphonse was nyumbakumi and he had weapons. Yesterday I testified that my husband had stayed at home, and when he noted that the situation was serious, he joined us at CELA. All the bushes had been cleared, which means that we could even see our houses. 
So the nyumbakumis were those who organised the community work, during which the vicinity of CELA was cleared, and the nyumbakumis were those who wrote the lists in the different neighbourhoods. And they conveyed those lists to their superiors. This is the answer I can provide on the matter. But if you are referring to what has just been read out to me, it is a summary which deals with the cases of several different people. That is what I can say. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. Madam Witness, let us now move on to your stay at CELA. While you were -- Sainte Famille, rather. My apologies. While you were at Sainte Famille, do you remember a meeting allegedly held by General Dallaire with the refugees within the grounds of Sainte Famille in early May 1994? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I did not attend that meeting -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know --
@WITNESS ACK: 
-- and I'm not aware that such a meeting took place. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Adds the witness. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, did you know the UNAMIR officer who was responsible for the organisation of evacuations from Sainte Famille and Saint Paul at the time? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I know that a given point in time, members of UNAMIR came to see us. Some might have spoken to them and told them about our problems, but I would not move around. I would stay sitting in the same place, because I was extremely sad. But, apparently, they wrote a letter. I heard that refugees who were at the Sainte Famille parish wrote a letter to UNAMIR. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Merci -- 
@WITNESS ACK: 
But I was not an eyewitness to this. I simply heard about it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, with other words, Madam Witness, you do not know the UNAMIR officer who was responsible for the organisation of evacuations from Sainte Famille and Saint Paul at the time? Isn't that true? Can you answer that with a yes or no, please. You do not know, do you? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Non. But I would see that person come and go. But I would not be able to recognise him. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. Madam Witness, during your stay in Sainte Famille, did the complex undergo any shelling, in your presence? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Yes, I was there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. Madam Witness, this UNAMIR officer you would see stated that he had posted four of his observer officers, who would remain there all day, and would only go back to UNAMIR in the evening. He also stated that following the shelling, a meeting was held with refugees. Does that not correspond to what you experienced? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is this based on testimony or a document? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
This is a proposition I'm putting to the witness, Mr. President. It is not a document I wish to have entered into evidence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you have a prima facie basis for that proposition? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, I do, Mr. President, but I fear that I will not be given leave to have it admitted into evidence if the witness refuses to discuss it with me. It is the second document, the minutes that I had distributed and which are in the folder. And it is entitled "Minutes of witness testimony". So if I'm not in a position to have this document admitted into evidence, I would at least wish to put its contents to the witness by way of suggestion. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was asked simply for everyone in the courtroom to understand what was going on, since we didn't know the basis. You have now referred to your basis for the question, and the question is -- is there any objection? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I can't locate -- 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
It is the second document, Counsel for the Prosecution. It's the part that is underscored in blue on the second page of the said document. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is allowed. 
Do you want it repeated, Madam Witness? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Yes. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, I'm going to repeat the question. I was saying that the officer in question stated that at Sainte Famille, he had posted four UNAMIR observers who left Sainte Famille only in the evening, because they stayed there the whole day. He also stated that, with General Dallaire, they held a meeting with refugees following the first shelling directed at the church. Now, my question is the following: These allegations made by the officer, do they correspond, or reflect the reality that you experienced at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Be it the meeting held by Dallaire or whatever, I did not participate in it personally. I did not attend such a meeting. As regards the said UNAMIR soldier who moved about, I have the impression that you do not know Sainte Famille. The Sainte Famille church, or parish, is very big. There were people who were so sad there. There were people who'd had killed members of their families. There were also young people who tried to gather information. As for me, I told you that I stayed at a specific -- I stayed, or was sitting at a specific place. I sat at that place because I had even fallen ill. I could not go out. 
As regards the allegation that there were UNAMIR soldiers at that place, and that Dallaire came there, that was information I received and which you yourself can locate in the document you are reading. But I did not see them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam Witness, for those explanations. Now, I would like to refer to a last document. That document has been given to Mr. Diallo. It is entitled, quote/unquote, "Transcript of one of the parties". 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Diallo, please show that document to the witness for identification. Once the document is identified, I can ask my question related thereto. 
@MR. DIALLO: 
Counsel, I have a question. I received three copies of minutes, or transcripts? Which one are you referring to? Is that the one of **************? And there is another one of 5th March, and yet another one. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
It is that of ************* 1995 (sic) relating to the witness. 
We are in open session. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says Defence counsel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are very fast now, all of you. Have we identified the document? 
@MR. DIALLO: 
I just want to say that I've given the document -- shown the document, or given the document to the witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I think so, Mr. President, I believe it is the third document in your binder. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I have it, I'm just about to remind you of the speed. Shall we observe that? ***************** 1996; isn't that the one? Not '95. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That's correct, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I do not know whether the document has been shown to the witness and identified by her. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is something in front of her, and we have said -- or, heard that Mr. Diallo said that he has given the document to the witness. So let us try now. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well. To avoid going too fast... 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, do you recognise that document? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I realise that I signed this document, which means that I am aware of it. Nevertheless, I have not had time to read it.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, it will not be necessary for you to read it in order to answer the question I'm going to ask you. 
In this document, when you give an account of the events which happened at CELA, you expressly mentioned the name of Préfet Renzaho. And curiously enough, when you give an account of the events which happened at Sainte Famille, you do not at all mention his name. And the question I want to ask you is simple, and it is -- it is as follows: Is it an omission, or did you think that it was not necessary to mention Renzaho's name? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
In this document I was talking about Munyeshyaka. Therefore I did not have to talk about Renzaho, given that I did not know where he was. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I thank you, Madam Witness. Madam Witness, you talked of the events of 5 June 1994 -- or, rather, 16 June 1994, which happened at night at the Saint Paul parish. Do you know whether, before these events which happened at night, UNAMIR officers visited you in the company of Préfet Renzaho on the said 16th of June 1994? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
If you please, Counsel, I would kindly request you to repeat the question. I did not understand it clearly. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I will do that, Madam Witness. On the 16th of June 1994, UNAMIR officers, in the company of Mr. Renzaho, did they visit you at Sainte Famille before the occurrence of the incidents that -- before the events of what happened on the night of 16th June occurred? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I'm not aware of that. I told you the state of my health -- I told you about the state of my health at that time. Once more, I woke up when I learned that my child had just been killed. It was when I went out that I saw Renzaho very near a water tank. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you very much indeed, Madam Witness. The following day, that is, on the 16th (sic) of June 1994, during the sad event that you are talking about, did you see Colonel Munyakazi at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
On the 17th? No. I rather saw him after the 16th (sic), but it is likely that he came to the priests' office, and it is those who were quite close to that office who saw him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, we have two different versions of what you just said. When was it that you rather saw him? After which date, please; can you repeat that? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Who is speaking? Or, who are you talking about? What is your question, please? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, can you hear me and recognise my voice now? Can you hear my voice now, Madam Witness, and recognise who is speaking? 
Mr. Diallo, is there anything wrong with the witness's headset? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. Diallo seems to have said: 
@MR. DIALLO:
Yes, Mr. President -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Or, rather, he says: 
@MR. DIALLO:
No, Mr. President, there no problem with the witness's headset.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. The question is as follows, Witness: You just said, as an answer to a question by Defence counsel, when you saw Colonel Munyakazi. Do you remember that you just answered a question? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Are you asking me if I saw Colonel Munyakazi? I did not clearly understand your question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You saw Colonel Munyakazi after the 16th or after the 17th? That's the question, in essence. We have two versions. What did you say? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
After the 17th, that was when Munyakazi came to Sainte Famille. He came in the company of the inspector, a female inspector. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
He also came with Nyirabagenzi and his escort. But I do not think it is necessary to give all these names, because you did not ask me questions relating to the names. The -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. You have answered the question, thank you very much indeed. Now here follows the next question. 
$(Pages 51 to 65 by Kirstin McLean)
1715H
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, a Prosecution witness, nevertheless, testified that on the 17th of June 1994, it was indeed Colonel Munyakazi who evacuated the last people who were still at Sainte Famille, and that he was the same person who dispersed those who were demonstrating at the Sainte Famille parish. 
What do you say to that testimony? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Please, can you ask your question again? I did not clearly understand it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Madam Witness, I'm going to do that. A Prosecution witness who appeared before this Court testified that it was Colonel Munyakazi who, on the 17th of June 1994, evacuated the last refugees from Saint Paul and dispersed those who were demonstrating at Sainte Famille. What comments do you have to make on that testimony? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I told you that Munyakazi showed up after the 17th, and that he was accompanied by Angeline. They said that some people had shot at them the night before. But, as a matter of fact, they were referring to the 12 young people who had scaled the wall. Munyakazi immediately arrested them after the priest brought them or showed them to Munyakazi. That was the last time I saw Munyakazi. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Madam Witness, I note that according to you, Munyakazi was not at Sainte Famille on the 17th of June 1994. 
Now, I would like to ask you a last question, Madam Witness. Do you know a certain Vincent Mugiraneza? Mugiraneza is spelt as follows, M-U-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A, Mugiraneza. 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I know Mugiraneza. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, do you know what happened to him in 1994, and in what circumstance that happened? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Mugiraneza was a Tutsi, and it is Renzaho who took him along. It is Renzaho who knows where he put him. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well. Madam Witness, that was my last question and it will be followed by a message from 
Mr. Renzaho. 
Mr. Renzaho hopes that it is a sincere testimony that you are giving against him. As far as he's concerned, he asks me to tell you in Kinyarwanda, ubuzima bwiza. In other words, good health -- have a good wealth (sic).
U-B-U-Z-I-M-A -- further away -- B-W-I-Z-A? 
I thank you, Madam Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Any re-examination? 
@WITNESS ACK:
I thank you.

$RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness ACK, there's one matter that I would like you to answer -- one or two questions arising from the cross-examination. You were asked about a young man, Bitega, who you told us had whispered in your ear to go to Sainte Famille, by the gate of CELA. Am I correct when I summarise what you have said in respect of that part of your testimony? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
Could you please repeat your question? And, please, be more precise. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. You told us that you -- that Mr. Bitega had whispered something in your ear. Is that correct? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
That's correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And where was this? Where did this take place? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
After he told us that Father Munyakazi told us that those who were afraid -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness did not complete her answer. 
@WITNESS ACK:
-- those who are afraid, go to Sainte Famille. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And where were you when Mr. Bitega told you that? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
We were about to go out of the CELA centre and were wondering where we were going to go from there. However, most of those who went home, died before us. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, if you could listen carefully to my next question: At the time you left CELA and went to 
Sainte Famille, had your husband and children been taken away from CELA at that point or were they still at CELA? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
They had been taken to a place below, and they were being beaten up, but they had not yet left the place, as such. As for us, we left before. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And after you left, do you know where or what happened to Mr. Bitega? 
@WITNESS ACK: 
I know that Mr. Bitega is still alive, but I do not know what happened to him in the meantime. In any case, I know that he met Renzaho, that he met him very often. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, thank you. Those are the only matters I wanted to raise in re-examination, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this was the end of your testimony. Thank you very much for making yourself available to testify before the Tribunal, and we wish you all the best. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Thank you. 
@WITNESS ACK:
I also thank you, Mr. President. 
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you to everyone far away for having facilitated this video conference. And we can then switch off the link with the country. 
We will then look at exhibits to be tendered. 
You wanted to start with the excerpt of the judicial document, K0377662, 757, 758, and for completeness that continues to 759, 760 and 817, but those three last pages were not used. 
No objection? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honour, perhaps as a matter of clarification, what this document, in fact, is -- because I suspect it may in fact be an extract from the judgement of BUO, I -- I'm not entirely sure, but if that is the case, I understand that the document has already been entered, in which case, it would seem superfluous to re-enter it. But, as I've only got a partial extract, I'm not entirely clear. I -- I do see, I think, BUO's name mentioned in one of the paragraphs, which has alerted to -- me to that fact, but not being a -- being fluent in Kinyarwandan, I'm unable to say with any certainty whether this is the same document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you help us with this, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not know where the Prosecution is obtaining his information. What I know is that this document is an excerpt of the judgement of several persons. And all I did was adopt what relates to the murder of the witness's family. And I would like the portion that I tendered should be considered differently, otherwise there will be confusion, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question now is whether this is, indeed, a judgement, including Witness BUO, with other words, a document which has already been tendered, or whether this is a separate document, different from the previous one. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I cannot say anything to that. I did not have an excerpt from the judgement rendered in the BUO case. So I found this excerpt in the course of my research, and I did not see the name BUO in the bundle of documents that I had before me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the exhibit number of BUO's judgement in this case? 
@MR. MOSES: 
We don't have the Defence exhibit list with us, Your Honour. We -- we are just going to do a quick search of the K number to see whether or not it is -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The next document --
@MR. MOSES:
It does appear, Your Honour -- if I can just indicate, I am sorry -- it does appear that this does form part of the same series of K numbers in that it relates to BUO. And I do note that BUO's name is referred to on -- I don't want to identify him -- but it is referred to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the judgement in hard copy there? Mr. Matemanga has it. Let's hold this for the time being. 
Your next document was the document of 5th March 1996? Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problems with that document? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I am sorry, Your Honour, I was being slightly distracted. I was probably breaching one of your rules, but -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now at the transcript dated 5th March '96, which is an excerpt from a judicial proceeding in a foreign country. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I do have a problem with that, Your Honour, because it's a statement from a person not the witness. The witness hasn't recognised either -- hasn't been asked to recognise the name of the person; and the contents contained, which were put to the witness, she didn't agree with. And so there seems to be no linkage or basis for that document to be entered into evidence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It is clear that you will have to look at Defence Exhibit D. 16 to make up your mind as to whether your first comment concerning BUO's judgement is indeed included in that document or not. 
Mr. Matemanga has this judgement here. Could you confirm -- with other words, we are backtracking now to the first question. Can you confirm whether you maintain that the document now being tendered, K0377662, the first document sought tendered, is indeed BUO's judgement, Defence Exhibit 16? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, it appears that the judgement is 100 -- at least 168 pages long. It is the same RMP number, the extract which has just been referred to, which would indicate it is from the same case. But, to date, there are only, for some reason, four or five individual pages which have been tendered, none of which are the ones which have been referred to. So whilst, yes, it does come from the same document, it -- they have -- those pages have yet to be tendered; in which case, we have no objection to the passages which my friend has referred to being introduced as a Defence exhibit. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Will this judgement become a complete exhibit at some stage in this case? Should we enter the entire judgement in this context as D. 16? Would this be a way of doing this? The problem is that D. 16 only contains about five pages, excerpts from the judgement. Now you are coming up with four new pages. Would it be a possibility that the Defence says, "We will now consider all pages of that judgement to form part of D. 16 from now on," or do you prefer only to have these excerpts? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not understand why the Prosecution would not enable us to choose the simpler solution. This judgement deals with 58 people. I do not believe the whole document should be admitted when we are only interested in excerpts of this document. I have dealt with the excerpts that are interesting to me within the framework of this testimony, and I believe it would be easier to have that portion admitted into evidence, instead of having a whole document, portions of which would not have been translated and which would cause problems to the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. You are the master of your own exhibits. We have now established that the pages you want to tender now are different from the ones previously tendered, presumably from the same judgement. We will admit the present five-six pages as the first Defence exhibit number.
Which is, Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 40. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a need to do this under seal? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It depends, Your Honour, because I don't know whether the passage which my friend has highlighted for the parties is also highlighted on the document being tendered. If it's an -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Since there has been a link in court between BUO and the name in this document, we will place this under seal. That was the first issue. 
You have now tendered that document, Defence. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 40 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The next document was this document 5th March 1996. And, there, the Prosecution had the objection that the witness really didn't recognise the document or offer a sufficient basis. That was the remark made by the OTP. 
Now, what is your response to that, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Trial Chamber will appreciate this was just a piece of material which was used for the purpose of cross-examination. So I leave it to the Trial Chamber to determine whether this document is admissible or not. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it the view of anyone in the courtroom that the information given to the witness in any way contradicted the testimony of the witness? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I don't know if you want -- who you want to go first, whether you want my friend to. I will wait and see if my friend has any comments, and then I will comment. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. It is the view of the Defence that the allegation of the witness, according to which UNAMIR was not present at the church, is contradicted by these testimonies. But I believe that the witness, in the final analysis, admitted this afternoon that she had seen members of UNAMIR there. So this is our submission. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We cannot see that it is sufficiently established that there is a basis for admitting this document which comes from a different person than the witness, and where it is not clear that there is really a contradiction which could affect the credibility of the witness. So that was the 5th of March '96. 
Then you had -- what is your next document, if any, Defence that you want to tender? Maybe the document of ************* '96? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That should be unproblematic. Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 41.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
$(Exhibit No. D. 41 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What remains now is to discuss the progress of this trial. It is 5:40. It may take more than five minutes, maybe, to discuss this issue. The question is whether we should do this right away and get it done or whether we have to meet very briefly tomorrow. I think the preference of Bench would be to do it immediately, if it meets with the accord of the parties. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Certainly, Your Honour, I have very little to say. I think it's really -- the ball is in the court of the Defence. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, what has been done is no longer necessary. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was a very profound remark. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
As usual, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have provisionally indicated that May would be a good time for Defence to start its case. Would Monday the 14th of May be a good starting point? I am suggesting that date because of courtroom availability. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the evaluation we had carried out to this day enables me to tell you that this is a date that is likely, without it being any commitment on our part. And I will give you the reasons why. 
Immediately after the first session, we went to the WVSS in order to further investigate this technique we were not cognisant with. We were first told -- and this was what I conveyed to the Trial Chamber -- that two months would be necessary for the section to be able to mobilise the witness as soon as we would bring them the complete list of our witnesses. And I recall, Mr. President, that you had stated that this was the worst-case scenario, so we tried to improve on that scenario. 
In practical terms, the problem of that section is linked to those witnesses who do not have any travel documents, witnesses who not have any identity cards, and mostly refugees, and the section cannot locate and bring these persons here in a short period. So, Mr. President, what we have envisaged, and apparently the section is ready to comply, is that we should provide one first list to the section with witnesses who have travel documents so that they can be mobilised more rapidly; and this seems possible without keeping with the two-month delay. If -- or, were we to give to WVSS our list of witnesses around mid-April, I believe we would indeed be able to have witnesses who would be available to testify as -- in -- as early as mid-May. However, I wish to respectfully submit to the Trial Chamber that, for that purpose, we would need your decision regarding witness protection. A motion was filed in this regard during the course of the month of January, and most of our witnesses consider that their protective measures are a prerequisite for their coming here. So this is what I can tell the Trial Chamber at this stage. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So there is an undecided motion in our Chamber? 
All right; we will decide it right away. I have overlooked that one. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed. It was a motion that was filed, unless I am mistaken, on --
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I believe we responded to it, agreeing to it in principle, although there are two or three paragraphs I think that we were not in agreement with, but, obviously, in general terms we were in agreement. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Such motions are absolutely routine and will be decided extremely fast. I can -- you can rest assured. It's simply an oversight that this has not been done earlier. 
@MR. CANTIER:
This is a motion that was filed on the 17th of January. We have been able to find the date, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. So that will be taken care of. Thank you very much. 
How many witnesses do you think will be on your total list, and what will then be the distribution between, on the one hand, witnesses with, and, on the other hand, without travel documents? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I cannot give you any specific answer on the spot, Mr. President, because we will need to meet the witnesses. And as you will well understand, we were not in a position to do so, up to now. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We were very pleased to hear, Maître Cantier, that you think that provided that certain steps are taken that we could indeed start on the 14th of May, and we will do so then. And we will then follow the development and see how the progress is. We understand that you may come back to us and say that there are problems in relation to witnesses without travel documents. But the situation may also be that, miraculously, problems are less than anticipated. But that's something we will probably see later. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, the situation is beyond my control. Some witnesses -- for most of the witnesses we need to go and see them and look into the matter of travel documents. We do know at this stage that there are a number of witnesses who are in Europe and who do not have such problems. So, what we thought, in order to share with you our reflections, is that perhaps we could start with these first witnesses, and if there were any specific difficulties that might crop up, those who would have difficulties could come subsequently. The objective of the Defence, taking into account the wishes expressed by the Trial Chamber, being to end our session before the end of June or early July at the latest. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. Let us do this. Let me simply say in all fairness that there is a problem because of a slight possible postponement in the Military trial for the closing arguments, and there is also some problems connected with courtroom space. But we do not have to go into that now because we do not know exactly how this will develop. It is still a good thing now that we, in this case, decide to start on Monday the 14th with the very best intentions, and then we will see how far we can get. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, this is indeed our objective, and we are staying on that track, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is then the decision: To start on the 14th. And the specifics will be more difficult to work out. In a provisional draft, we have put aside from the 14th of May to the 8th of June for this case. That is four weeks. I do not know whether that will be sufficient for the Defence case. And it's half days. So it's a bit short. But much can change until June. And, as I said, a complicating factor is closing arguments in Military I, which may steal a week here. But this is as far as we can get today. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, flowing from that, just looking at Rule 73 ter, which is pre-Defence conference. I am not sure whether this falls in that category or not. But there are obviously matters in terms of pre-Defence briefs and dates for the disclosure of statements and summaries of fact -- of other material, which I won't go through, but Your Honour will be aware of, contained in Rule 73 ter. Now, I don't know whether Your Honour wishes to address that now or issue a written ruling, as I believe Your Honours are capable of doing under the rules, subsequent to this evening. I don't want to delay things unnecessarily, but obviously it is important for the Prosecution to know -- and for the Defence also to know if we are starting on the 14th of May. The normal practice is, without obviously Your Honours being bound to it, is as I understand it, 21 days prior to the commencement of the Defence case that the -- a pre-Defence brief and details of all witnesses would be given to the Prosecution. It's one of the issues, if I can say in passing, that is in dispute in the -- the Defence application for protection of witnesses. They were wanting a rolling disclosure, whereas we were wanting what Your Honours had indicated for us, namely, that all documents should be disclosed 21 days before the commencement of the Defence case. But that's just to indicate one of the issues. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The Defence is making calculations, Mr. President. 
Yes, indeed, if we take into account the date of May the 14th, and if the deadline for disclosure to the Prosecution is fixed at 21 days by the Trial Chamber, this will take us to the 23rd of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a correct observation. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Let me continue, Mr. President. I am thinking aloud because I must say that I do not know whether everything will be in order for us to be able to make such disclosures at that point, and there is also the matter of the pre-trial brief -- pre-Defence brief, sorry. Can the Trial Chamber rule on this matter and mainly on the deadline for the filing of such pre-Defence brief? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This Chamber has a very established practice when it comes to these matters. We generally lay down a deadline of 21 days before the commencement of the Defence case and we go for en bloc disclosure and not rolling disclosure. So we could rule that right away now. That will be the position of the Trial Chamber if we were to rule now. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, are you referring to the disclosure of testimonies? To the Prosecution? Am I correct? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. With other words, the deadlines in Rule 73 ter. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Of course, Mr. President. I was wondering whether we had the obligation or whether the Trial Chamber would envisage requesting that we file a pre-Defence brief, because if my memory serves me well, it is not compulsory, but an order to that effect can be handed down by the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The concept "pre-Defence brief" is maybe not absolutely concise in nature. What matters to the Prosecution is that you receive disclosure of unredacted witness statements; with other words, all the information, particularly enumerated in Rule 73 ter, (iii) A, B, C, D and (iv). That's the core; that's what the Prosecution needs. Isn't that so? 
@MR. MOSES:
And I think (iv), also, Your Honour, which is a list of exhibits that the Defence wishes to introduce. The other matters, I agree, aren't essential, though I would comment that I think it would assist the Trial Chamber and all the parties to focus on what the defence is and what they intend to be contesting. Because there have been examples in the course of the Prosecution case where my friends have stood up and indicated such -- so-and-so fact is not in dispute. And, had it been admitted at an earlier stage, it may have saved everyone some time in terms of us having to lead matters. So I think it focuses everyone. Whether that be can done at a later point than the 21-day -- that might be a compromise which could assist everyone. That if the matters contained in (iii) and (iv) were done 21 days beforehand, and the other matters at a later date, then perhaps that would assist everyone. And, of course, a notice of alibi, if my friends intend in any way to rely on an alibi. I don't know if that is the case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The easier solution would be that we decided that the deadline for the requirement of Rule 73 ter is the 23rd of April, generally. That would be a clear deadline for everything. Would that be possible, Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We are going to make every effort to comply with that deadline, Mr. President. That is a commitment I am making. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's most helpful. Experience has shown that sometimes it is difficult to be absolutely precise as to information of witnesses. With other words, sometimes Defence teams provide less information to WVSS, alternatively, less information to OTP than they need. 
So a good rule of thumb here is simply to take one of the Prosecution's personal information sheets and, for each Defence witness, fill in exactly the same elements of information. Otherwise, there will be disputes between the parties later, and the OTP will say we do not have a sufficient basis for investigating. And, if you could, in addition to that kind of rudimentary information, sometimes give, say, relatives, for instance, parents, which would further indicate the identity of the person, that would facilitate matters. 
If there is a need for any pre-Defence conference before the 24th -- or 23rd of April, that must be indicated. But if we do not hear anything, we would assume that everything is ready on Monday, the 23rd of April -- sorry, the 14th of May. The 14th of May, we will assume that we can move directly into the Defence case. 
But, the Defence, if you want a pre-Defence conference, or if the Prosecution thinks that there is a need to sort out problems, then you can address the Trial Chamber. 
If there is nothing else to be said, may I then again thank both parties for their professionalism, efficiency, and elegant way of conducting the proceedings.
We have also concluded the two-three remaining minor issues during the Prosecution case. 
Again, a heartfelt, warm thanks to our registry staff, our interpreters and our court reporters for all you're doing in order to assist us in everyday life. It's a tremendous teamwork in this courtroom. Thank you so much. 
And then we meet again on the 14th of May. Is there anything else to be said before we leave the courtroom? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President; but just to also thank all the staff who assisted us during our proceedings. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. The Court is adjourned.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning. The Court is in session. I understand that we are in open session. 
This is the beginning of the Defence case. Will the Defence make any opening statement, or will we proceed directly to the first witness? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I have some difficulty with my headset, so I didn't hear what you said. I'm replacing it right now. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have CaseView in front of you so that you could just read what I said? 
@MR. CANTIER:
I can hear you very well now, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question was whether you intend to make an opening statement or whether we will proceed with the first Defence witness now. 
It's absolutely up to you. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we were not requested by the Trial Chamber to submit a brief, so we didn't request -- we didn't draft any such document. But, for purposes of clarity and transparency towards the Prosecution, and in order to ensure that the Trial Chamber properly follows what we will be doing with our witnesses, it might be necessary to make a preliminary statement. 
This I have prepared, and I am ready to deliver it to the Trial Chamber, except, as proposed by the Prosecution, it were better to start with a status conference to look at our current status, particularly in view of a motion from the Prosecution to exclude some evidence. 
If it so pleases the Court, I could move directly into my preliminary statement. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see that the witness is here. 
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
@WITNESS DES FORGES:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now first discuss how to organise this morning's work. Just bear with us for a moment, Madam. 
What is the estimated length of your opening statement, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER:
At the very most, half an hour, and I will be speaking slowly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then I think the best way is to ask the witness to leave the courtroom because she will be much more comfortable in the waiting room. 
Madam Witness, we will come back to you in about 45 minutes.
$(Witness exited courtroom) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
As for the choice between the opening statement and the status conference, the Bench has received the Prosecution motion, and we understand what is behind that motion.
It is clear that we do need a status conference at some stage, but the most practical way to proceed now would seem to be that we start with the opening statement, and then you can address us after the opening statement, Mr. Moses, as to whether you have any objections to hear the first witness. 
You have the floor, Maître Cantier. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. I have provided a copy of my opening statement to the interpreters and to the court reporters. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Renzaho stands accused of genocide; complicity to -- in genocide; murder as a crime against humanity; rape as a crime against humanity; killings as a violation of Article 3, Common, of the Geneva Convention of 1949; and rape of -- under Article 3, Common, of the same convention. 
Mr. Renzaho has pleaded not guilty to all these accusations. As I said a short while ago, and with a view to proceed in an atmosphere of clarity prior to various testimonies, we want to present our case and the various evidence that we will be using to support our case. 
Our case is built on two grounds: First of all, planning of the various crimes that are purportedly committed from the 6th of April 1994 and which are referred to as genocide and crimes against humanity; secondly, the involvement of Mr. Renzaho, or his participation in such crimes, because -- on the basis of his personality, his past, and his behaviour during those events. 
Those are the two pillars on which the Prosecution case is built, and the Defence will challenge the theory of premeditation of the killings, particularly in regard to the killings and genocide of Tutsis from the 6th of April 1994, as well as claims by the Prosecution that -- that Mr. Renzaho belonged to a group of extremists, as well as allegations that he purportedly provided assistance, both in his capacity as préfet and in his individual capacity, assistance which he extended to the Interahamwe prior to the events.
Secondly, Mr. Renzaho denies these accusations which appear under counts 1, 2, 3, and 5, pursuant to Article 6(1) of the statute. 
He, therefore, rejects all the accusations relating to orders that he purportedly gave to the soldiers, gendarmes, militia, and local population, as well as demobilised soldiers and other individuals, to set up and man roadblocks in the -- in the Kigali-ville préfecture, with a view to stopping, identifying, and killing Tutsis. 
Secondly, he denies the accusations, whereby, from the 7th of April 1994, he gave orders over Radio Rwanda to the same category of people to set up and to man roadblocks, with a view to stopping, identifying, and killing Tutsis. 
Third -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we get into the third prong, this is going very well, but could you just slow down slightly? Not too much, but just slightly. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Well, I tend to speed up when I start talking, Mr. President, but I'll slow down. Thank you. 
I was speaking on the third count, whereby, on the 10th of April, or thereabouts, he purportedly held a meeting at the Kigali-ville préfectoral office, during which he is said to have ordered conseillers and cellule responsable to set up roadblocks and operate them with the assistance of the same category of persons mentioned above, with a view to identifying and killing Tutsis. 
He also rejects the fourth charge, whereby, on several occasions in April and May 1994, he convened meetings, at which he ordered the administrative authorities to be vigilant at roadblocks and to ensure that Inyenzis do not succeed to hide within the population, all of this with the same view of identifying and killing Tutsis. 
On those four charges relating to the roadblocks, Mr. Renzaho will demonstrate the following: One, that he was not behind the initiative to set up roadblocks, some of which were already in place before the 6th of April 1994 and some of which were set up later on, generally, at the behest of the population.
Mr. Renzaho will also argue that he did not exercise any measure of control over those roadblocks because he did not have the resources to do so, although he had requested on several occasions that these roadblocks be dismantled. 
Still under Article 6(1), Mr. Renzaho also denies the charges relating to killings that were conducted in Kigali-ville préfecture under paragraphs 11 to 23 of the indictment. And for the roadblocks, the reference would be 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the indictment. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask you a question in relation to the third issue you raised that related to the meeting on the 10th of April, the alleged meeting? Is it, then, the Defence case that there was no such meeting, or is it that nothing reproachable happened during that meeting? 
@MR. CANTIER:
We challenge the holding of that meeting of the 10th of April. 
In criminal matters, generally speaking, and particularly in this case, it is often difficult to determine the exact date on which an event may have taken place. It is for this reason that the Defence would rather challenge the decisions that are being ascribed to us rather than systematically relate to these dates, and all of that with a view to facilitating the pursuit of justice. 
Now, let me, then, return to the killings which have been ascribed or charged to Mr. Renzaho. 
He, therefore, denies charges relating to events that occurred between '93 and '94, in which he regularly authorised and encouraged Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi groups to meet at his home in Kanombe. He will provide evidence to refute the allegations brought forth by the Prosecutor. 
Secondly, Mr. Renzaho denies having distributed weapons and munitions to members of the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, both in Kanombe and elsewhere. He will establish that the -- the Kigali-ville préfecture did not have any stock of weapons and that no weapon was distributed at his initiative or under his authority. 
Third, Mr. Renzaho denies the allegation, whereby he purportedly facilitated and provided fuel vouchers and passes, as well as food supplies, to the Interahamwe, various militia, soldiers, and gendarmes to move about and to have equipped accordingly. 
Mr. Renzaho shall establish that such documents were, indeed, being issued by the PVK, that is, the Kigali-ville préfecture, but that such documents were issued to the population at large without any discrimination, including Interahamwe, militia, soldiers, and gendarmes, who, may it be said, did not require any authorisation from him to move about or to obtain equipment. 
Four, Mr. Renzaho dismisses the accusation, whereby he purportedly went to Kajari in 
Kanombe commune on the 9th of April 1994 in the company of some Interahamwe. He shall challenge the Prosecution witnesses' credibility and state that he no longer went to his house in Kanombe at that location from the 8th of April 1994. 
Five, Mr. Renzaho denies having held a meeting on the 16th of April 1994, or thereabouts, as is purported by the Prosecution, at which he allegedly ordered conseillers to obtain firearms from the ministry of defence for distribution in various secteurs. 
On that issue, Mr. Renzaho shall seek to establish lack of credibility on the part of Prosecution witnesses. And on that issue of distribution of weapons, he also intends to show various contradictions and thereby establish the irrelevance of such testimonies. 
Six, Mr. Renzaho denies having dismissed Conseiller Célestin Sezibera on the grounds that he purportedly believed that he was hostile to the idea of killing Tutsis. 
Mr. Renzaho shall go on to state and demonstrate that -- I was saying, in relation to the dismissal of Conseiller Célestin Sezibera, that Mr. Renzaho will establish that his withdrawal did not -- cannot be attributed to Mr. Renzaho, or cannot be explained by the fact that he was not enthusiastic about the killings, as has been purported. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you now referred to number 262 on the general spelling list, yes? 
You can just proceed, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. Renzaho also denies having been present at a roadblock near Hotel Kiyovu in June 1994, particularly in the company of Colonels Setako and Bagosora. He shall question the credibility of the lone witness who has testified on his presence at that roadblock, and he shall prove that the two persons mentioned, namely, Colonels Setako and Bagosora, who were supposed to have been with him, could not have been present at that location on that day. 
Mr. Renzaho shall state that he did not issue any order on the 27th -- 22nd of April 1994 for some 
60 young Tutsis to be expelled from the CELA, who, according to the Prosecutor, were abducted and killed by soldiers and Interahamwe. However, Mr. Renzaho would like to shed light fully on this issue and also establish his own level of responsibility. And it is for this reason that he acknowledges having been present at that location on that date because of the unrest that was occurring at that location. 
He shall affirm or assert that he contributed to pacifying the situation, after which he went back. He shall, therefore, challenge those facts and would state that, even though these things may have happened, they cannot be totally ascribed to him. 
Mr. Renzaho also denies the accusation, whereby, on the 14th of June 1994, he is alleged to have ordered that 60 Tutsi boys, who were at the St. Paul site, be expelled and murdered. He shall show that no credible witness has testified against him in that matter and that the administrative document put forth, or exhibited, by the Interahamwe in order to take those young persons was not signed by him. 
Mr. Renzaho further denies having ordered soldiers, militia, and criminal policemen on the 
17th of June 1994 to attack Tutsi who had sought refuge at the St. Famille church. He shall demonstrate lack of credibility on the part of witnesses who purportedly stated that he was present, and he shall adduce evidence to the contrary. 
I have just dealt with the charges or items falling under paragraphs 11 to 23 of the indictment. 
Mr. Renzaho further challenges the charges, whereby, on the 28th of April 1994, he purportedly ordered Interahamwe to go to Nyarugenge commune to seek and kill nine Tutsi. Mr. Renzaho shall underscore the fact that Prosecution witness (sic) do not formally establish his participation or involvement in these crimes. 
Mr. Renzaho also denies involvement in the killing of André Kameya, the journalist. 
André Kameya's name is on your list, Mr. President. 
(No interpretation) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
$(Microphones overlapping)...it's number 105 on the -- of the big list. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we shall make sure that both lists are available in Court henceforth. 
I was, therefore, saying that Mr. Renzaho will deny any involvement in the murder of André Kameya, the journalist who was killed on the 15th of June 1994. He shall establish that the circumstances surrounding the death of that journalist have not been clarified and that there is no formal determination that he was the killer or an accomplice in that killing. 
Now, regarding the alleged criminal responsibility of Mr. Renzaho under Article 6(3) of the statute, Mr. Renzaho is accused of not having taken necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the crimes referred to in the indictment because it is alleged that his subordinates committed criminal acts and that he did not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the commission of such crimes or to punish the perpetrators thereof, even though he knew, or had reasons to know, that his subordinates were about to commit, or had committed, such crimes. 
Mr. Renzaho denies these charges on three grounds: First of all, and contrary to the Prosecution's allegations, Mr. Renzaho's subordinates did not include officials and members of the Rwandan armed forces; troops of the Presidential Guard; Interahamwes, including those who have been named as being his accomplices, that is, Odette Nyirabagenzi, Angeline Mukandutiye, and Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka; or, referring to the terms used by the Prosecution, his subordinates did not include members of the civil defence, militiamen, or gendarmes. 
The second ground is that the Prosecution does not provide evidence of the participation in the crimes alleged of certain persons, in particular, Father Wenceslas and Mr. Ngerageza. Neither does the Prosecution provide evidence, clear evidence, that the civil defence forces participated in the commission of the alleged crimes. 
The third ground, Mr. Renzaho submits that he did not have the means to prevent the commission of the alleged acts by the persons named in the indictment; neither did he have the means to punish the said perpetrators. Mr. Renzaho will prove that the situation which prevailed in Kigali town, from the 6th of April and until the 5th of July 1994, the date when he left the town, that that situation could not at all be brought under controlled (sic), and for various reasons. 
First of all, the war, the war which resumed as from the 6th of April, the evening of the 6th of April, between the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF; then, the population was displaced, was moving as a result of the existent war. 
There was also the presence in Kigali of thousands of refugees and displaced persons who had lost everything and sought vengeance. 
The third reason, the presence of RPF infiltrators, who contributed to the situation of disorder. 
The fourth reason -- and this relates more directly to Mr. Renzaho, the fourth reason, the collapse of the state apparatus, as well as his authority with regard to the population, as well as the disruption of the functioning of the administrative apparatus in Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Mr. Renzaho will prove that in such a situation the means available to him were ridiculous because the only forces available to him were the municipal police, who, after the 6th of April 1994, amounted only to a handful of policemen.
Mr. Renzaho will prove that, with the meager resources still available to him, he continued helping the population without discrimination. He did help them by continuing to organise the supply of food and drinking water in Kigali town; by providing persons in danger -- or, helping persons in danger; by delivering, without discrimination, those who wanted to leave Kigali town laissez-passers; by personally intervening, at the risk of his life, in several situations of grave danger, for example, at CELA on 22 April 1994 or, yet again, during the transfer of the population to Kanogo in the month of May 1994.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which location would you -- did you just refer to? We didn't get that in our two languages.
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, it's -- that's -- it's -- the place referred to is Kanogo in Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is spelt? 
@MR. CANTIER:
K-A-N-O-G-O.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
@MR. CANTIER:
I repeat, K-A-N-O-G-O. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And while we have this little interruption, you referred to, as one complicating factor, the presence of RPF infiltrators in Kigali. Is the submission of a general nature or is it more specifically alleged that these RPF infiltrators, in fact, committed some crimes with which the Accused is charged? 
@MR. CANTIER:
What we will be arguing is that RPF infiltrators participated in the commission of crimes, particularly at roadblocks, crimes which are ascribed to the Interahamwe, militia groups. And we are supposed to have authority over those Interahamwe under 6(1). We have said that we did not prevent them from committing crimes, and that is why we mentioned the presence of these RPF infiltrators who contributed to the killings and the situation of disorder.
I will continue. 
Furthermore, witnesses will come here to testify that Mr. Renzaho tried to put an end to the acts of violence perpetrated by several killers whose identity was revealed to him. He had them arrested and detained at the jail, or cell, of the Kigali-ville préfecture. We will also establish that the said persons were subsequently released as a result of the threats that their detention at the Kigali-ville cell brought to bear, on the staff as well as the refugees, and also because the judicial system, as well as the prison system, was no longer operational. 
Contrary to the Prosecution's allegations, Mr. Renzaho has never tried to conceal the circumstances that prevailed in Kigali, particularly by causing the disappearance of corpses of the persons killed. Mr. Renzaho submits that the situation required that the bodies be picked up and buried for reasons of public hygiene and sanitation and that, if the services of the préfecture participated in picking up the corpses and buried (sic) them, this was done under the supervision of the International Red Cross Society -- or, Committee, as will be testified to by several witnesses. 
Mr. Renzaho denies any responsibility relating to the rapes that are alleged to have been committed in his territory, in the territory under his jurisdiction. He condemns these heinous acts, which, unfortunately, he never had power to prevent, nor to punish. Mr. Renzaho challenges the allegations of a lone witness who accused him of having, under 16th of April 1994, incited militiamen to commit such acts. 
Mr. Renzaho will argue that the conspiracy with which he's charged is only a figment of the imagination. The Prosecution case, or theory, on the existence of such a conspiracy is based, in main -- in the main, on the fact that the Accused had privileged relations with certain persons who were well known, and such persons being Interahamwe, in particular, Odette Nyirabagenzi, Angeline Mukandutiye, and Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka. 
The Defence will submit that the first two persons named above, namely, Odette and Angeline, have never been prosecuted nor tried for having committed the crimes that are ascribed to them today. 
As regards Father Wenceslas, he's being prosecuted in France, where he's seriously challenging the charges brought against him. And, like every other citizen in a democratic country, he is presumed to be innocent. 
In -- as concerns -- as concerns Father Wenceslas, the Defence will produce evidence and documents which will establish the falsehoods of the charges brought against this priest. Better still, the Defence will establish that it was on destruction of the present authorities in Kigali that a case file was prepared against him, against this priest. 
Lastly, and this is not to be overlooked, Mr. Renzaho denies having had any special relations with these three persons, who have never been part of his circle and who, therefore, he could not give any instructions to for the purpose of committing crimes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please help me. Is Angeline and Odette still alive, both of them? 
@MR. CANTIER:
We carried out some investigation. From what we were told -- but this is hearsay -- from what we were told, both of them are dead. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you know when they passed away and where? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No. The date of their passing away is not -- was not given to us, but, from what we were told, they took refuge to -- or, they fled to the Congo, and they were amongst the hundred of thousands of people who disappeared in the Congolese forest.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
@MR. CANTIER:
(No interpretation) 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, that wasn't clear to us, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When I thanked you, there were overlapping microphones. Can you just repeat your comment or addition just now? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. Since we were talking about the disappearance of these two persons, amongst hundreds of -- hundreds of thousands of other people in Congo, from the summer of 1994 -- and I was saying that these crimes were -- were -- could not actually be explained. 
There was -- as the Chamber knows, an investigation was ordered by the United Nations. The secretary-general and the security council ordered an investigation. The investigation was entrusted to Mr. Robert Tukatuko (sic), and the investigator determined that the crimes against humanity were committed, but there was no follow-up of this report by the investigator. The international community did not follow up the report of the investigator. 
That is what I said, Mr. President, but it has no bearing on my opening -- or, preliminary statement. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But since you now referred to a surname which is not so easy, can you help us with the surname of Mr. Robert? Can you spell it, please? 
@MR. CANTIER:
The secretary-general of the United Nations set up a commission of investigation, which was headed by a Chilean citizen called Roberto -- that is his first name -- and Garreton. Roberto is R-O-B-E-R-T-O. Garreton, G-A-R-R-E-T-O-N, Garreton. Garreton, G-A-R-R-E-T-O-N. 
I believe his report is dated 1998. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. Now we have Roberto and Garreton, G-A-R-R-E-T-O-N. 
And then there was this sentence, "(French spoken)." What did you mean by that? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, the concept of loss and -- profit and loss is an accounting concept, and in accounting, as you know, there are amounts which cannot be considered as loss or profit, or benefit. So they are just considered as losses and benefits. That means that they are no longer mentioned and they do not cause any problem. The problem is shelved -- or, such losses are shelved. They are no longer taken into consideration. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So now everything is clear. 
Thank you. Please proceed. 
@MR. CANTIER:
I would like to tell the Chamber that, like (unintelligible) with our colleagues of the Prosecution team, we will be offering a defence of alibi, a single defence of alibi, regarding the distribution of weapons on the morning of the 7th of April 1994, which distribution was mentioned by Prosecution witness -- by Prosecution witness AFB. 
We will prove that on that morning Mr. Renzaho was attending a meeting which held -- or, which took place at the military academy, the EMS (sic), École Supérieure Militaire. 
We will have a witness who will testify to this, and, above all, if I may say so, we will have documentary evidence regarding the holding of that meeting and the participants thereof. Because the said meeting is part of the historic meetings that took place after the 6th of April. 
The Prosecution thought it had established the genocidal intent that motivated Mr. Renzaho by tendering a cassette that recorded the utterances made by Mr. Renzaho and by asking several witnesses whether they recognised Mr. Renzaho's voice in those recordings. 
The Defence denounce, and continues to do so, the use of such evidence, but since the Chamber decided, subject to its analysis and, therefore, its assessment, to still keep the cassette, the tape will have to be listened to by several witnesses who will tell the Court whether or not they recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice. 
Mr. Renzaho will also give evidence himself. He will give evidence on his career and his commitment to the service of his country. He will give evidence on how he went through the period preceding the 6th of April 1994. He will give evidence on his role and activities during the period of the events, and, of course, on -- his evidence will also related (sic) to the crimes with which he is charged on the basis of 6(1) and 6(3) of the statute. 
Mr. Renzaho will prove, with the assistance of Kent Roach, a criminologist of international repute, the grave danger -- 
I spelled Kent. The person's name, Kent, is K-E-N-T, and Roach is -- Roach, rather -- or, Roach is R-O-C-H (sic), Kent Roach -- no, R-O-A-C-H, Kent Roach. 
So Kent Roach is a criminologist of international repute. He will appear before this Court to explain the grave danger that the use of informers as witnesses poses to the Court. 
Professor Lugan, a historian, will come to challenge the theory put forward by Mrs. Alison Des Forges, theory regarding, in particular, the planning of the genocide; the setting up and operation of the civil -- civil defence programme; and, in more general terms, he will be dealing with historical facts on the Rwandan tragedy up to date and the involvement of Mr. Renzaho in this tragedy. 
Lastly, Mr. President, Your Honours -- and this will be the end of my presentation -- the Defence will subscribe to and confirm the fears expressed at the beginning of the trial on the 8th of January 2007. 
Shortly after the end of the first session, we went to meet witnesses, witnesses which we had previously contacted. Mr. Nekuie, my co-counsel, went to Rwanda. Personally, I did not have the -- the possibility of going to Rwanda. And there in Rwanda we had the confirmation of the defection of a key witness. And, in my mind, in my culture, when I say a "key witness," this witness is crucial to the Defence but also to the cause of justice. He's essential -- essential because of his closeness to the Accused during the period of the events. 
A second witness, who is also an important witness, refused to have any contact with us, even though he had told me during an earlier mission that he was available and even enthusiastic to appear before this Court in order to give evidence for Mr. Renzaho. 
Among the witnesses who, in the final analysis, accepted to come and give evidence, at the end of last April, we learnt that three of them henceforth refuse to come here and give evidence and that a fourth witness had just fled from his country as a result of the threats against him. 
As for the witnesses who are still accepting to come -- and here I'm referring to witnesses coming from Rwanda -- they are requesting -- particularly one of them, they are requesting exceptional, or special, protection measures which will be the subject of a motion we will be filing. And, for now, they refuse to have any contact with the representation of this Tribunal in Kigali. 
Lastly, several witnesses, that is, Rwandan witnesses, have expressed fears of reprisals, reprisals against they, themselves, and their families living in Rwanda. These are Rwandan witnesses who, today, do not live in Rwanda. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, we are compelled to condemn the situation, a situation in which today, nobody, and in particular the Tribunal, can afford to overlook. This Trial Chamber heard the historian, Madam Alison Des Forges, assert that she, herself, when she went to testify on behalf of Father Theunis, was threatened, even though everyone here knows how close she is to Rwanda, the theories that she defends in favour of the tragedy, and his international -- and her international -- her international reputation, her reputation both in the international community and in Rwanda. 
The Defence has already tendered in evidence reports from human rights organisations, Amnesty International, which reports condemn the dictatorial nature of the present regime in Rwanda and the attitude of this regime regarding national and international judicial bodies dealing with the genocide issues. 
Under these circumstances, the Defence is deprived of access to crucial evidence, and the Tribunal only has part of the truth. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is not the persons, the men and women, contributing to this international justice who are being accused. It is the system that has been adopted in the treaty setting up the Tribunal and the nature, as well as the conduct, of the regime in Kigali. 
Even if, today, the international community is losing interest in this situation, just as it is losing interest in the activities of our Tribunal, I cannot believe that one day, or -- that one day it may not become necessary to meticulously analyse what happened in Rwanda and what happened in this Tribunal. 
By choosing the profession of lawyer, or counsel, we chose the profession of free men and women. To begin with, we have the blessing of exercising this profession in a democratic country. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm exercising this freedom today -- or, rather, I'm putting this freedom today at the service of Mr. Renzaho and international justice. 
I accepted the assignment given to me in January 2003, but since then the situation has evolved. We became aware of a number of things regarding the history of Rwanda. The Defence wants to accomplish, go to the end of, its mission, or assignment, but it does not, in any manner whatsoever, want to give the impression that it is not aware of the situation which prevails today. 
I will give you a terrible example and which may make one laugh if it were not tragic. I heard that a number of witnesses -- because the Tribunal's work is coming to an end, that a number of witnesses are asking for compensation for them to end their contracts. I do not have evidence of this, but that is what is being said. 
But what is being said, what we know, why is your Tribunal not saying it? It is because nobody takes interest any longer in what we are doing. But in the present-day society, you do not have watertight walls. I am not criticising those who are not disseminating information. We have. This is because we are all trying to do the work assigned to us, namely, to discharge the responsibilities or duties assigned to us. 
But the advantage we, as lawyers, have -- and that is why I want to denounce the situation. The advantage we have as lawyers is that we are in an independent profession and nobody can prevent us from speaking. Nobody can prevent us from speaking and to say, loud (sic) and clearly and publicly, what we know and what we should say. 
I thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Maître. 
On that last point, have you reported the alleged threats concerning certain specific witnesses to the WVSS? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, yes. We mentioned this right from the beginning. Because, right from the beginning, as regards witnesses in Rwanda, all of them, today, do not want to contact the Tribunal's office in Kigali because they think that once they go there they will be indexed by the Rwandan courts, they will be profiled by the Rwandan courts. 
I do not want to engage in some form of confession. I'm not both a witness and Defence counsel. But I cannot keep quiet regarding what I know. 
As regards the Tribunal's office in Kigali, Mr. President, Your Honours, with a number of officials in this Tribunal, that is, people who have authority, it is not possible to talk with them in the premises of this Tribunal. 
I was a direct witness of this situation. I asked the person I was talking to whether the witnesses should come here to testify -- testify. He said no, and I understand him. 
We talked about it, Mr. President, to the section, WVSS, I suppose, and we are trying to find ways 
of (sic) means of circumventing the Kigali Tribunal's office. But, at the same time, WVSS does not have any significant resources or means of protecting those witnesses, especially if it is heard that they have testified here and -- or, rather, they have -- WVSS has no way of protecting them once they have testified here and return to Rwanda. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What you said raises two issues: The last one is about the modality for ensuring that reluctant or fearful witnesses nevertheless will testify. And that is something you are now in contact with the WVSS to sort out. 
But the first question, and that was my question to you, is whether you have indicated specifically that certain particular witnesses say that they have been threatened to the WVSS. Have you drawn the attention of the WVSS to this specific situation of those witnesses? And, if not, kindly do so. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, over the past two years, things have developed in Rwanda to the extent that there is more repression and social control, and that is the reason for which witnesses are behaving in this manner. This has been pointed out to the section, and the section is fully aware of what is happening. 
We have two categories of -- or, rather, three categories of witnesses: One, the witness whom I referred to a short while ago as a key witness is the kind of witness who has refused to appear before the Court -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not need any recapitulation now. I only want to ensure that you are now in contact with the WVSS concerning both your key witness -- or, the two key witnesses, and the three who refused, and the situation of number four, who just fled. And just make sure that the WVSS gets all the details, and then we will see further what can be done in that connection. But we can leave it at that for the time being. 
I just want to assure you that, of course, the Tribunal takes these matters seriously and always investigates such allegations. And I wanted to make sure that you have, indeed, drawn attention in a specific way to these matters, and I understand that you have. Is that so? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. However, we are in a very terrible situation because the witnesses who have refused to appear to testify before the Court, I believe that if there were an investigation to be conducted in Rwanda, I'm not sure that they will be easily identified. 
The context for the Prosecution is different from ours, and the issue here, then, would be that such an investigation could properly be conducted in the United States or in Canada. But there is a totally different situation in Rwanda, which has become completely a closed society. So we have reported to the section that which we could report. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Thank you for your introductory statement. 
Prosecution, do you have any comment on the introductory statement or on whether there is any problem now in calling the first Prosecution (sic) witness? 
You have the floor. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
A brief comment regarding the last points, and I'm glad Your Honour raised the issue also with Defence counsel. 
Firstly, I just want to mark the record by saying we don't accept the statements regarding the situation in Rwanda as set out by the Defence. There are all sorts of reasons why witnesses decide to change their mind. There are all sorts of reasons why -- that are provided to counsel why witnesses changed their mind. The two don't always coincide with each other, which is why there is a necessity, and we would strongly urge the Defence to take the matter up and have an investigation. Because, certainly, we would not support in any way threats being made to witnesses for the Defence, and we would be supporting any actions that were taken to investigate and bring such matters to light. We certainly don't want those sorts of things swept under the carpet. 
That's the only point I want to make regarding the opening statement. 
Your Honours, whilst there is no problem with the witness commencing, there are some matters of a general nature which I do think do need to be addressed. I'm happy to do that in open court now, Your Honour, if that -- they won't take long. I've only got two or three matters that I want to -- to raise. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And on your first point, you will have noted that I said investigation of "alleged threats." 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's why it's so important to clarify the factual situation. 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, please proceed. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
Your Honours may have seen that we did file a -- a motion earlier this week. I have had the opportunity to discuss some of the matters with the Defence counsel informally in a way in which, hopefully, does not cause -- to try and create the least conflict as -- as we possibly can. 
It is fair to say, Your Honour, that we are concerned at the incomplete and late disclosure that has been provided to the Court and to the Prosecution, and, in particular, I wish to put on record that the Prosecution should not be handicapped by the late disclosure that has been made to the Prosecution. We are trying to get the statements that have been provided in the last three or four days translated. There are a number of will-says and statements as well which were provided only -- we received them on Tuesday. 
I don't want that to necessarily stop us from proceeding, Your Honour, but I also want to indicate at this stage that, when we conclude our cross-examination, it will be concluded subject to any further cross-examination that may be necessary by reason of matters which have come to light late and out of time. And I simply want to place that on record. 
I don't believe, Your Honours, that the Prosecution -- the onus should be on the Prosecution to have to file an application to re-call witnesses for reasons which have occurred because of late disclosure and breach of court orders. We will attempt to conclude, and it may be that there aren't matters which are needed to be put to the witnesses who we are cross-examining. But I just want to highlight that as an issue now, Your Honour, because I don't want to be put into a difficult situation where we -- the onus was, as it were, shifted onto the Prosecution to have to justify re-calling the witnesses when such an application would not have been necessary had it not been for the late disclosure. 
Your Honours, we still do not have complete disclosure of a number of documents that are in the -- relate to the list of witnesses for whom have -- the most recent list. 
And if I can identify -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you proceed, the most recent list has which date? 
@MR. MOSES:
14th of May. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, yes. 
@MR. MOSES:
The issues, if I can just briefly go through them, Witness 16, PPO, the Defence say that there was an identity sheet disclosed on the 14th, but we haven't received one and I don't believe there was one filed with the -- with the Court. 
Similarly, Witness 21, NAZ, the Defence indicate on their sheet that the identity sheet was disclosed, but on the 25th of April, we don't have it. 
Witness 24, HIN, we don't yet have the name of that witness provided to us. 
Now, so that Your Honours are aware, I had spoken to the Defence earlier this week. They indicated that they were going to file a motion, asking for late disclosure of that witness for security reasons. With the greatest of respect, we still don't have it. 
We're about to start trial. We don't know who the witness is. No such motion has been received by the Office of the Prosecutor, and holding back that information is in clear breach of Your Honours' orders, both of the order for witness protection and the order to disclose the information by the 23rd of April. 
So that's a matter which, to be blunt, Your Honour, should have been done, or at least a motion filed some considerable time ago, asking for an alteration of -- or, variance of the witness protection motion that was granted. So that's a concern. 
Witness 26, the Defence say that a will-say was disclosed, but we have no record of a will-say being filed, or no information regarding that person. And Witness 35, PAN, once again, we have no they say a will-so -- -say was disclosed, but we have no such will-say in our possession that was disclosed by registry. 
So those -- those are the issues in relation to the factual witnesses. 
Can I also say that, having heard from my learned friends in their opening regarding the purported evidence that they wish to lead from Mr. Roach, it is of a nature, shall we say, that the Prosecution would clearly be objecting to, to talk about informer witnesses. Now, I'm not sure whether we have, in fact, had any informer witnesses, whether they are relating -- in fact, meaning -- the translation came through was "informer witnesses." Whether he, in fact, is going to talk about detainee witnesses, I don't know. 
But, in any event it's -- from what has been identified in the opening, it would seem to be sort of evidence that will clearly be objected to. 
Now, why I say that, obviously, the earlier a report is provided to the Court, the earlier an application can be made so that the Court can decide before any arrangements are made to bring -- to fly Mr. Roach from, I believe, Canada. It would seem sensible that the Court decide the issue as to whether or not that sort of evidence is to be allowed. So I would simply ask that the report be provided to the Prosecution at an early stage so that the Court can rule on that -- on that issue. 
And then the final issue, if I can say, Your Honours, is in relation to exhibits. We -- yesterday, the Defence came up to see us with a binder of documents and a list which they provided to us, but they couldn't give us a binder because they were going to make copies. We still don't have -- 
I -- I just see an indication from the Defence that they may have them, but we don't -- we don't have them in our possession. And it's rather difficult to -- to prepare where we haven't been provided with those materials. 
That's -- those are the matters, Your Honours, I wished to raise. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness 26, that is BIT, is it? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. Your Honour, there is one further -- further matter -- can I say this? 
On this last order, the last 13, I think, witnesses, 24 to 36, are all will-says. If one looks at the will-say provided by Witness TOP, which is about a page, very -- very brief, the estimated duration of that witness, according to the Defence, is going to be six hours on the basis of three hours' evidence in-chief and three hours' cross-examination. 
Now, it would seem to me, either they have got their calculations way wrong or the will-says are woefully inadequate in terms of the degree of information that the witnesses are going to provide. 
And I simply -- this is another matter which can raise its head in terms of late disclosure. It's not in the statement. It's in the will-say. We have, if one goes down there, HIN, eight hours, six hours, four hours, five hours. Now, even if one halves those amounts, they are relatively long periods of evidence in-chief, which would indicate that they are going to say a considerable amount. 
And it's a concern which I just want to flag now, which -- which is of a concern to the Prosecution. 
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Your comments are on record. 
As regards Witness 26, just so that I understand this correctly, you know the witness's name but nothing else? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, that's correct. We don't have the personal identification sheet. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. There is obviously a need to sort out matters of a practical nature, and we will do that at an appropriate moment. 
Is there anything the Defence wants to say now, in light of what we just heard? Maybe that could facilitate the situation. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. I met my learned friend to give him explanations that I had to give him. The truth is that the work that we have to do, considering the importance of the case and the circumstances under which we found ourselves, is because the time was very short. When we learnt that some witnesses will not come, effectively, we had to go to find other witnesses to fill the gaps. And that is why we came up with the -- an initial list that goes up to number -- number 23. 
There were some errors of communication, and there are other people that we are in contact with. And we note what they can testify, but we do not yet have declarations. So we are not yet certain that these other people will be able to come and provide evidence. So that is some work that we still have to do. 
I know that what is a concern for my learned friend and the Court is the respect of adversary proceedings and the fitfulness of the -- and there are representations, I -- we will make every effort necessary for them to obtain all the elements that they need for their cross-examination. 
With the 20 days we have, I think we will be able to do that. We have another witness. I think that is HIN, number 24 on the list, and we shall be filing a motion relating to him tomorrow, requesting special protective measures. He's somebody who is coming from the country we were referring to a while ago. And there are some other mistakes relating to disclosure. There is a disclosure error on the will-say, but that is a detail that we will be addressing with my learned friend on the other side. 
What -- on the 6th of January we took a -- sorry, on the 6th of March, we took a commitment to do everything possible to respect the deadlines that we had set. Mr. President, I assure you that we have respected that commitment. It was an obligation of resources for me. It was more an obligation for resources than for results. We shall be able to start today. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that explanation, and I note -- the Bench notes what you have indicated and, in particular, the fact that you will certainly be doing your utmost to ensure that the principle of contradiction is adhered to. And this probably means, then, that Witness PPO, there is a need to ensure whether the identity sheet has, indeed, been disclosed on the 14th of May. But, if not, maybe you have a spare copy to the OTP. That was Witness 16, Witness 21, NAZ. 
Similarly, we note what you said about Witness 24. The motion will be coming tomorrow. 
Witness 26, there, too, there is lack of information, according to the Prosecution. Please get in touch with the Prosecution. 
And, finally, Witness 35, PIN, there is a problem there as well, and I'm assured this can be sorted out outside the courtroom, but as soon as possible. 
So if you have further problems in not receiving this immediately, Mr. Moses, we would like to be apprised of the situation. But we expect this to be given to you very soon indeed. 
Should we, then, call the first witness? 
The witness pseudonym is?

@MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam Witness, good morning. 
@WITNESS ABC: 
Good morning, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I will start with your examination-in-chief. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
But, before that, I may want to turn to the Bench. 
Considering the special circumstances of this witness, to pray the Court to order that this examination-in-chief proceed in closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All of it or some of it? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I think that it will be the entire examination-in-chief because all the questions will be related to her person. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to give further reasons for this request. And do you need a closed session to explain the reasons? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Maybe, Mr. President. That will be more practical. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. We will then move into closed session in order to hear the arguments in favour and against closed session for this witness. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 25 to 60] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

Good morning, Mr. President.

Your examination-in-chief continues. 
Maître Cantier. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. Just one remark, a preliminary remark: We intend to have the Court listen to the recording that was presented by the Prosecution in -- in the earlier part of these proceedings. In this courtroom, according to what I have heard, we do not have the technical means, appropriate technical means to listen to that recording. Therefore, we will make do with whatever means are available; in other words, we would use our computer and the microphone. I do not know what the outcome will be, but that is the only means available to us to have these recordings listened to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's true that there is no video recording in this courtroom. As to audio, I do not know the exact intricacies of the system, but as long as you have a procedure to propose, we can come back to it once the situation arises. Thank you for informing us in advance of the fact that this will happen during this examination. 
And now the first question.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Good morning, Witness. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Good morning, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So I will continue cross -- or, rather, examining you in-chief. Yesterday, we were dealing with the duties you were performing in the post you occupied. I believe you told us that did your specialisation studies in psychiatry in Moscow. Could you tell the Court why you did your studies in Moscow? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
First of all I studies medicine in Moscow, then I did specialisation, still in Moscow and Brussels, at the Catholic University of Louvain, but I went to Moscow in 1973. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you are speaking too fast. Every word has to be interpreted and transcribed. So let us slow down all of us now. Will you do that, please? 
Thank you. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
So I will continue. When I went to study in Moscow it was especially thanks to the results which I obtained in the course of my studies, but it was also due to the intervention of my godfather who, unfortunately, was murdered. He was murdered together with almost the entire -- his entire family was murdered by Belgians. Furthermore, it was thanks to him that I completed my primary studies and the first year of secondary school. He was my instructor. He was a Tutsi and he was like my second father. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's Wednesday today, Mr. Witness, and it's an early morning. You are aware, aren't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I will try, Mr. President, but this seldom happens to me. 
So I found myself in Moscow where I did my specialisation studies, then I returned to my home country to work there. There are only a few survivors of my family, unfortunately. But talking about this once more, that reminds me of the murder of my -- two of my brothers, one by militiamen, and the other one by RPF soldiers. So is once more something that affects me this morning. I apologise for that. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, where were you in October 1990? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
In October 1990, I was in Remera in my house. I was working at the psychiatric hospital, moreover, the only psychiatric hospital in Rwanda. I was working there as a doctor, a medical doctor. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you hear of the appointment of Mr. Renzaho as préfet of Kigali-ville? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I heard of it. Moreover, I remember very well that on 1st October, we had a congress in Kibungo. That is to say, that a few days thereafter he was appointed. So I cannot but remember that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, from a personal point of view, what did you ascribe Mr. Renzaho's appointment as préfet of the capital city? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
First of all, it was a surprise, all the more so, as I'd told you, Renzaho was somebody who was devoted, competent, but very low profiled, very discreet. He was very discreet because, as I underscored yesterday, in our committee of 24 people, there was also a soldier more senior than him, and sometimes he kept a low profile, at least in relation to that senior official. I believe he was somebody very competent and we talked a great deal to him. His appointment, in my opinion, seemed to be a recognition of his qualities of being discreet. But, also, in that period, which was the beginning of the war, he was professionally competent. And leading the capital or being the préfet of the capital city was a position much, much sought after and that could be the subject or object of much covetousness. 
There was also an ongoing project with respect to multi-parties. Therefore, in my opinion, it was necessary to have someone who would be a reconciliator, somebody who would be able to manage a difficult situation. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, from what you were able to find out or what came to your knowledge, did Mr. Renzaho play an active role in the repression which took place when that war of 1990 broke out? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Counsel, I do not know but please permit me to say it. I do not know whether the word "repression" was -- is the appropriate word. I would say that there were mass arrests, many people were arrested, including even friends. Friends were arrested. They were taken to the Nyamirambo stadium, but I do not see any role that Préfet Renzaho would have played because they started from the night of the 4th to the 5th and he was appointed only on the 6th, the 6th of October. So, I think the services involved were the army, the gendarmerie, and probably the intelligence services which carried out those arrests. In my opinion, he caught the train on the move. 
What I can add -- I will try to go more slowly. What I can add is that amongst those people there were some people who were taken out and allowed to go home. Others were sent to jail because, at that very time, I, as a physician, we had a ward where we had psychiatric patients in prisons. I mean patients who were aggressive and whom we could not keep in hospitals, so we had a ward in prison for such patients. So, there were friends, there were people whom I met in -- or whom I saw in prison. And amongst those people I was able to talk to some of them. Sometimes we could bring them some medication, but which medication we hid. But they were entitled, they were entitled to defence counsel. They were entitled to legal assistance. I even remember the arrival of Professor Reyntjens and other international legal experts; quite a number of them. I can also mention amongst the defence counsel, Mr. Mbonamepka -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you are giving very many details and are still talking too fast. You just mentioned one name. Can you help us with the spelling of the second name? We know Mr. Reyntjens who is well known in this Court, R-E-Y-N-T-J-E-N-S. But the other name, please, since you brought it up. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, the name is Mbonampeka, Stanislas. He was in charge of the defence of -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's just the spelling, Mr. Witness, can you help us, of that name? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, can you tell the Court where you were on the 6th of April 1994, that is, on the evening of the 6th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
On the evening of the 6th of April 1994, I was at home. But before giving any details whatsoever, I would also like to say that throughout the forenoon I worked -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness named a place where he worked. We didn't get the name. Please, we are sorry, if he could repeat it. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
So I worked with my collaborator and -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Where did you work, can you repeat that slowly? Whenever you refer to a name or a specific institution we need to slow down to make sure that we get it. Every one in this Court knows Rwanda well, but we still may have a need to get it right. Now, please repeat. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
So, in the morning, I worked at the national radio television station in Kigali. I worked together with my collaborator -- or the collaborator in the AIDS programme. I am only going to give his first name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maybe we don't need that name. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Very well, Mr. President. 
So he was the person who was in charge of documentation. We were working on a film. We were working on an AIDS film. We completed the film. That was in the afternoon. Being the boss of the AIDS programme, we gave ourselves a free afternoon. We took off the afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This was an important project, wasn't it, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Very important project, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
It was a very important project, especially as it involved many sectors of national life. The people of Kigali -- over 30 percent of the Kigali population was concerned. In the rural areas, more than 
three percent of the people were involved. 
So, in the afternoon, as I told you, we had some rest and I went to have a drink with him at a bar that was well known by everyone in Kigali. This bar was near Total. And after that, my driver dropped me home. I asked my driver to also drop him at his home. I'd had a nap; I was resting. It was a late nap. 
At about eight o'clock, 8:30, that is when I heard explosions. My wife and my children were preparing food because the following day in the evening I had an appointment with my boss, the minister of health, who had to come and have dinner at home, so my wife was preparing food for the following day. So that is when I heard gunshots. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Maître Cantier, you are certainly authorised to interrupt your witness if you get information that is not strictly necessary to your case. Will you help us with that, please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. I will do that of course. But sometimes we do not know whether words that are unnecessary do not herald words that would be necessary.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
In any case, Witness, as the President has suggested, remain focused on answers required by the questions I'm putting to you. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The announcement of the death of the president, did you hear it on that same evening? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I heard it on that same evening. I heard it over the radio. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What did you do in the days that followed? Can you remind the Court of the place where you lived? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I lived in Remera 3. I lived in Remera 3, right opposite the airport. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Can you tell the Court what you were doing or what you did from the 7th of April and in the days that followed? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I did nothing because from that moment on it was impossible to return to work. Already, there was a curfew that was decreed and nobody could leave their home any longer. Of course except in cases of emergencies, for example, as concerned people working in hospitals and also cases of emergency relating to matters of national interests. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you receive in your home people who were seeking refuge? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I did. Well, I did not receive them as such, but there were people who were fleeing from their areas because after the 7th, the following day in the morning, fighting started. So there were -- there was shooting. You could even see bullets flying. So, I and my neighbour, my next door neighbour, were able to host up to 70 people, including women and children whom we took into our homes, while the men remained outside. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, were you able to stay in your home in Remera 3 or did you flee? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
On the 8th in the afternoon, the fighting was getting close to our homes, therefore, we had to flee. We fled with everyone in our homes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Where did you take refuge? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I fled -- well, fleeing towards the centre of town, centre of Kigali was impossible because from the 7th right up to the morning of the 8th you could not see anything. All you saw were soldiers. Soldiers came to my neighbour's home asking for money, because that soldier first of all came to house of the sister of my neighbour's wife, and that woman, in order to get rid of that soldier, sent him to her sister saying that it was her sister who had money. So that soldier found himself in my neighbour's home. We tried to put together money and we gave him money, but without opening the door to our home or homes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
To go to Masaka, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Well, I thought that we could first go towards Kibungo. We were hoping that that would be practical, that we could pass. But when we arrived at Kilometre 15, we were told that it was impossible, that after Kabuga it was impossible to continue. So I went to my friend's home at Masaka together with everyone who was with me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, now you speeded up too much again. You referred to a place called Kabuga, K-A-B-U-G-A. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That's correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Masaka is number 32 on the spelling list, M-A S A-K-A. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, Mr. President, it seems to be number 33 on our spelling list. Counsel said number 32. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are now referring to the spelling list which runs from number 1, starting with Asterie, to which number? Number 37 ending with Emmanuel; is that the spelling list you now referred to? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I don't think so, Mr. President. The name I mentioned, Kayonga from memory, I did not hear it being pronounced. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now we had a big translation issue. We have one big spelling list, that's the one we have from the Prosecution which was carried over from the last session. And then you have kindly provided us with more limited spelling lists and the interpreter in the English version drew our attention to the number you referred to was different from the version he has. And I am only trying to find out exactly which list you are now referring to. I did not refer to Kayonga. There is lack of communication between the two of us. Now, the list you referred to, do we agree that that contains 52 names and that the last name is PECO, P-E-C-O? Are we on the same wavelength? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it is indeed with this list that I'm working. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very well. And on that list, Masaka is number 32. So far we have clarified this. Shall we continue then? 
Do you have the one, Prosecution, containing 52 names? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All booths, do you have the one containing 52 names? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Mr. President, we do. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
$(Microphones overlapping) ... please. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, when did you leave Kigali? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I left Kigali on the 28th of April. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
During the period when you stayed in Kigali, did you move about? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I only moved about twice. Once, first of all, to go and look for some food in my house, but that was very difficult. Otherwise, I stayed there -- I stayed where I had found refuge, that is, in my friend's house. I also went to Kanombe in the -- to the house of a family friend. The husband of the woman had gone on mission and I had to go and pick up the family, the two daughters of the family. We stayed together with the two girls because we were afraid. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, when you went out, at least on those two occasions, did you have to go pass a roadblock? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I went passed roadblocks but it was very difficult for me to do so. First of all, there was a roadblock at the place known as Kilometre 15; there was another one at Kilometre 17; and yet another one at Kilometre 19. I also came across roadblocks during the period when I was in Masaka, roadblocks between Bicumbi and Masaka. Between those two points, I was attacked. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Bicumbi is number 33 on the spelling list. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, what was the situation at those roadblocks? Who was manning them? Who was present at the roadblocks? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
At those roadblocks you had almost everything -- or everyone. Now, with hindsight, there were young people, but not children. There were no women. There were adults; old people, no, but it was a mix of various types of people. What, nevertheless, struck me is that all these people had or were wearing the president's medal. That was very striking, because I also wore that medal during the period when the MRND party, the single party, was the only party. Everyone was MRND party until 1991. And during that period everyone had that medal. I had it also. But what struck me, indeed, was that there were members, activists of various parties, be it the MRND party, the MDR or the PSD, the PL, and other parties, they all wore the same medal or everybody -- they all wore medals. Some of them wore Interahamwe uniforms, some wore the uniforms of other parties; there were also people without uniforms who wore their normal clothes, ordinary or plain clothes. 
On those roadblocks sometimes you had the impression that there were people who were calm and others who were more agitated. That is what I can say with regard to those roadblocks. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you see corpses near those roadblocks that you crossed, Witness? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I saw corpses only on one roadblock when I was going towards Masaka. I asked the children not to look at the corpses. But on the other roadblocks, I did not see any corpses. However, as I said, I saw corpses at the Masaka roadblock. At the roadblock where I was attacked -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, please go more slowly, please. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I'm sorry. I'm speaking out of emotion. 
So, at that roadblock, that is the roadblock between Masaka and Bicumbi -- one of the members of my party who lived in Masaka had asked me -- because I had a car, I had a vehicle -- had asked me to help him go and look for his brother who was threatened. He had received a messenger (sic) who was telling him that his brother was hiding. His brother was a teacher, but that the group that was looking for his brother was looking for him in order to take away his motorcycle. His brother had a motorcycle. So -- well, he thought that it was for his motorcycle that they wanted to kill him. So I went with that person. 
Now, perhaps I would like to clarify another point, namely, that when I went to look for food at Remera in my house, together with other men, one of the people with whom I was, was killed by a soldier. He was killed at a petrol station. He was killed by a soldier that was drunk. We were refueling our car or vehicle --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Again, how many details do we need? Isn't the point where the people were killed; why they were killed; where the roadblocks were; isn't this what you really want, Maître? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, neither you nor me were present in Kigali during the events in question. What the witness is telling us is what he experienced, what he lived through. This last detail, in my opinion, is not unnecessary, because, Mr. President, Your Honours, that detail shows what the situation was, the unbelievable situation of anarchy or anarchie that prevailed in that country. It is what the witness went through, and I believe this is what the Trial Chamber needs. Therefore, in my opinion, this detail is not unnecessary. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I did not refer to that particular detail, of course; I referred to the general flow of the testimony. But we certainly realise that the fact that a situation of chaos is described can well be relevant in this case. That is for sure. 
Let us continue. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
With your leave, Mr. President, let me add that I was explaining how it is that when I was called to assist I could not do it all by myself. 
But after the person with whom I was killed, there was a major whom I knew very well, and he made available some soldiers with whom -- well, this is the point I wanted to clarify, Mr. President. So the two soldiers were given to me by the major because he also was seeking to protect these people among whom there were Tutsis as well. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, why did you leave Kigali on the 28th of April? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Because things were getting too dangerous. The fighting was coming closer to Masaka. The RPF was closing in, and so we had to flee in the opposite direction. We thought that since the government was in Gitarama, it might be best to go to Gitarama. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Witness, I am sorry that I have to revisit some details that you raised with a lot of pain, but let me say a short while ago you said that you were almost killed at a roadblock. Please exercise some measure of self-control and attempt as best you can to tell the Court in a few words what happened on that occasion. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
What happened is that when we were going to get that gentleman, we went through the roadblock. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Witness, could you be clear as to which roadblock you are talking about? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
On the way from Bicumbi to Masaka, there are some sugar cane plantations. And -- so we are going to pick up this gentleman on the other side of the sugar cane plantations. When he saw me driving towards him, he came down and we picked him up and went back. At that time, I was in the company of soldiers whom, as I said, was (sic) made available to me. When we got to the roadblock -- he knew that we had come to fetch him. So the people at the roadblock told me, "Doctor, we know you very well. We respect you, but we are not going to let you go through with that person. He will not go through." So I asked them why.
You see, I had worked as doctor at Ndera and I knew most of those people who came for treatment in our hospital, and most of them knew me very well. They told me, "You can go through in the same manner as you went through the first time, but he is not going to go through this roadblock." So I insisted, I said, "I have come to fetch him so that he can go back with me." So I tried to negotiate my way through, as always, and to try to identify who was in charge of that roadblock. There was someone whom -- who appeared to be senior and educated to me, so I tried to talk with that person without stepping out of the vehicle because I felt that there was some danger. I called him but he did not come to my vehicle.
So one of the boys who was there, it might have been one of my -- militants of my party, he came close to me and said, "Doctor, things are not going to be that easy. They will not let you drive through." So I was wondering how this could be, so I told them, "Gentlemen, do you believe that you are doing a service? Even if you believe that all of this is because our president has died, do you think that you are rendering service to him or to his party?" Then the answer I got was verbal attacks. The young man told me, "You are not going to go through. Either you leave this man and proceed, or you don't go through." So what did I have to do? I was in a position of weakness. A soldier was behind me but he couldn't do much. These people were armed with spears, they had machetes, and so the gentleman told me maybe if we give them something to drink it might work. And although we didn't have much money at the time, I said well, "How much? What can we give them?" And he said there are more than 30 in number -- indeed, there were several of them at that roadblock. So I said, "1,000?" He said, "No, that's not good enough." So I proposed 3,000 francs. And he went away waving the 3,000 francs in the air shouting that he is attempting to corrupt me. And that was rather catastrophic. 
So the other person who didn't want to come close to me attempted to do so at that point but still told me that I wasn't going to be able to drive through. So I said, "Is it because you believe that the president of your party has been killed that all of this should be okay? You know me and you know who I am." And -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Please, could you conclude, Witness? Please, could you conclude? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
So what happened is that the gentleman to whom I gave the money came back and told me that my bodyguard should give him his grenade, "And on that condition, we would let you drive through." And we said, "No, the soldier does not have to surrender his weapon." So I was wondering what to do. And I asked him to give -- so he gave it away and so this person came towards me and whispered in my ear. He said, "Doctor, I am going towards the roadblock. I will kick it with one foot and as it slides off, please drive through quickly." And that is what happened. So when I started the car, what did the others do? They threw their spears at us. And what this other person did after I drove through was that he launched the grenade into the crowd and some people died. My car was damaged, but we were able to save that individual and others died on that occasion. That is what I can say. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In your response you mentioned that you had worked as a doctor at a particular location. It sound like Ndera. Was that the reference? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I talked about Ndera. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
N-D-E-R-A. Thank you. 
Next question. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That was before 1991. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you hear any messages from Préfet Renzaho over the radio? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I did. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What do you remember of those messages? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I remember that people were asked to remain in their homes, to be calm, to remain at home, and to be vigilant above everything else, and to avoid confusing or taking neighbours for soldiers who were attacking us. What I heard, indeed, was a call for people to remain calm and to remain in their homes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, how do you explain the fact that Mr. Renzaho remained in Kigali, particularly after the 12th of April when the government had fled? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
The only possible explanation I can provide is that, first of all, he had the mandate and authority to exercise powers over the city of Kigali and, therefore, he could not abandon his own people who were being attacked from all angles. I also believe that he was a person who could not abandon people who were in misery and suffering. They needed someone to organise them and to organise the services that could still enjoy some measure of organisation. 
I also can provide some information that I gleaned through my personal consultations, whereby someone testified that in Kacyiru families that had been attacked over and over by the militia and Hutu families had tried to check these militia and had appealed to the préfecture for assistance, and they did get such assistance when the préfecture sent gendarmes to collect these people who had been under threat, both Tutsi and mixed families. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, you mentioned a name, Kacyiru, can you please spell that name? I don't remember that you mentioned that name and I therefore don't have it on the list. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Kacyiru is spelt K-A-C-Y-I-R-U, Kacyiru. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When you heard Mr. Renzaho speak on the radio, was that between the 12th until the 28th of April, or was it later? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
It was earlier than that, around the 8th. I don't remember the specific date, but it was right at the beginning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then you explained the possible reasons for him to stay in Kigali after the 12th. Did you have any conversations with him in the period between the 12th and the 28th of April? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, not between those two dates. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Has he, at any subsequent stage, indicated that these were the reasons why he remained in conversations with you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, later on he did, yes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was going to broach those similar questions, but -- 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Witness, while you were in Kigali up to the 28th of April, did you have any opportunity to meet and talk with Mr. Renzaho? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I had that -- such an opportunity when I left the place at which I was on my way to Gitarama, I talked with him. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Can you tell us the content of your discussions? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I had obtained authorisation to go about or to move about because at the time one could not travel without such an authorisation. That is what enabled me to go through the roadblocks and that was not easy. 
When I arrived Kigali, I decided first to stop at the Kigali-ville préfecture. It wasn't easy to go through, but although I had heard that some friends were there -- and I'm not going to mention their names -- I went to see him and to find out what had become of those people. So we talked, we chatted before I continued on my way to Gitarama. However, he warned me to be careful at the roadblocks because he did not have any control over the roadblock. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this was when? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
On the 28th. On the 28th, I went through his office before going to Gitarama. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, as far as you know, was it the PVK and Préfet Renzaho who ordered the population to mount the roadblocks? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I do not think so. As I already said, I never saw a communal policeman or a gendarme in Remera, but the roadblocks were there. Furthermore, let me say that the messages he broadcast over radio did not include any invitation for the population to set up roadblocks. So I do not believe that he was responsible for the setting up of the roadblocks. You see, even when I left my house to go down to Masaka, there was already a roadblock but I didn't see any policeman or gendarme. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, you have known Mr. Renzaho for several years. You have worked with him. You have talked about his personality to the Court. Would you think that Mr. Renzaho, at the time the events occurred on the 6th of April in 1994, do you think that he could have become an extremist? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I have heard that word often, but it is vague to me. Could you please clarify the meaning of that word? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, in the prevailing circumstances in Rwanda at the time, that would mean somebody who participated in the genocide. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Well, I knew and I know Mr. Renzaho very well and I think it will be far fetched to tag or label him as an extremist. Now that I have understood what your question means, I do not think that, knowing him and knowing his family, he could have been labelled as such. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, my next series of questions in a moment will touch on you as a politician. But, before that, let me ask you whether you had any special relations or links, you and Renzaho, whether you had any special links with the Interahamwe militia? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I do not think so. I would like to say that -- and this I have already said -- the préfet of Kigali-ville was supposed to be someone who upheld neutrality as far -- or who was neutral as far as politics and political parties go. So the préfet was supposed to be someone who would deal with political party rallies of any party, PECO, PSD, MDR or MRND, or youth wings. Irrespective of the political party, this individual was expected to take neutral positions. And if there was any indication whatsoever that he had special links with any youth wings -- and I didn't mention militia because at the time before the events there were youth wings -- if he had any links with such groups, he would have been dismissed. And as I have already said, the position of préfet was one that was sought after and the prime minister at the time could have easily replaced somebody who was involved in that kind of activity. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a difference between the English and French version. You, Maître Cantier, you did, indeed, ask the following question, didn't you: "As far as you know, did Mr. Renzaho have any special ties with the Interahamwe militia?" That was your question, right? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That was my question, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. Now what we have in the English version could give the impression that the question was different and that the witness only answered half of your question, but, in fact, he answered exactly the question in French. So now that is stated.
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, while you were in Kigali, did you observe the communal police at work? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I saw a few of them, maybe walking around, but I didn't see them often. Most of the time, I was in my office or I was driving. And it is only when one got to the préfectural office that one would see communal police. Maybe at the market as well, but not in town generally. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, were you politically active? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I was. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Can you tell us again, as briefly as possible, your level of political activity? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Let me say up front that I stumbled into politics. But thereafter, it became interesting to be involved in politics. I was appointed by presidential order as member of the préfectural committee as a native of Kayonza commune. And, as I'd explained, these appointments were made according to communes. And I remained as a member of that committee to the time of the advent of political -- of multiparty politics. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Kayonza is number 31 on the list. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
So with the advent of multiparty politics -- and as I said yesterday, many members of our party moved to other parties, but some remained in what could be referred to as the new generation of the MRND. Some went to the PSD. I can mention a friend, who unfortunately is also dead, and who was the vice-president of the PSD. Then we had people in the PL, and others in PECO. And when I left the committee, I also created my own political party. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Witness, that is what I was driving at, that is your political activities. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
So I split, like others, and set up my own political party. And our motto or our mission was to focus on environment and health. So the motto was a healthy environment for a healthy population. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
PECO is number 52, Mr. President, on the list, number 52. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, could you tell the Court what PECO stands for? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
It stands for Parti des ecologists rwandais, Rwandan Party of Ecologists. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This party, it split from which party, or you left which party? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
As I said, everybody was initially MRND until 1991. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I know that. We all know the period of multipartyism. What we are trying to get clearly now is whether this split or establishment of the new party took place in connection with 1991 and the advent of multipartyism or whether it happened later. That's what we haven't yet clearly understood. Can you help us, please? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, Mr. President. The party was formed by myself and other colleagues, doctors, veterinarians, jurists, and it was referred to as a small party of intellectuals. It was indeed a party of intellectuals who didn't have any previous political or financial experience. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's only one word you haven't responded to. When? That's the point. When did this happen? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Oh, very well, November 1991. 
Can I proceed? What I want to add is the following --
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, no, please hold on. Is this in relation to the party you set up? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. One month after the party was created, the MRND government was expected to hand over to a multiparty government, involving the new parties that had just been created. There were nine of them. A government was set up on the basis of those nine parties. And if I remember well, it was on the 
30th of December 1991, and it was led by Mr. Nsanzimana, Silvestre. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Can you spell the name, Witness, because the name is not in -- the name is not on our spelling list? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I spell Nsanzimana: N-S-A-N-Z-I-M-A-N-A, Silvestre. 
In the preparation of the government's programme of activities, my party participated. But, unfortunately, we were excluded on -- and that was on the decision of the president of the republic. The reason for this exclusion is that at the time the multiparty government was being negotiated, divergences in views emerged. These divergences emerged in the meeting that brought together the president of the republic and the nine political parties. At the end of the said meeting, four parties, namely, the MDR, the PSD, the PL, and the PSR, left the meeting and refused to be part of the government for -- or, on the grounds that these four parties wanted the president to appoint just one candidate to be nominated by the opposition. The other parties said no, arguing that according to the president's prerogative, several candidates had to be proposed to him and that it was up to the president to choose among the candidates proposed. There was another point of disagreement, which I'm not going to mention here, but it was -- that other difference of opinion led the four parties to leave. So, the five remaining parties, including mine, had as an assignment, the setting up of the government. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, I believe that is enough as detail. 
Witness, in your capacity as chairman of PECO, did you intervene in the negotiations, the Arusha negotiations? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No. I did not have that opportunity. I think I should remain humble, but what I know is that the said negotiations were very difficult, and the accords were signed on the 3rd of August 1993. Personally, it was an honour for me, even if there were some bitterness. I was in this -- I was in the congress -- this congress venue to sign the said accord or agreement, and I signed the code of conduct to govern the parties. That code of conduct was annexed to the Arusha Peace Accords. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you see Mr. Renzaho in Gitarama? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, once. I remember that he was a member of the delegation of soldiers that accompanied 
Minister Kouchner. Minister Kouchner was visiting at the time when the country needed humanitarian aid. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
K-O-U-C-H-N-E-R. Have you finished the sequence on the political party? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This party, Mr. Witness, for how long did it exist? Was it also in existence in April '94? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, it existed until 6th April 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Having existed from its establishment until 1994, I understand it was a rather small party composed of liberal intellectuals. Just to place it in a context, did it take position in the political spectrum of Rwanda? Was it close to a liberal wing, a conservative wing, a Hutu power wing? Where would you just place it so that we know a bit more about that party? Very briefly, please. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Thank you, Mr. President. In answer to your question which is very complex, I would say that our party came into being under the conditions that you already know, and it was more in the centre. So, as I said, it comprised intellectuals, educated people who did not have a political background. None of our members had been a minister, a permanent secretary of a ministry; so these were intellectuals who said that they would be concerned with matters related to ecology. So we were more liberal, in the central. 
I will give you an example. We were the first -- the first party to, in February 1992, visit to the war -- visit the war displaced persons at Rwebare. Those displaced persons were more than -- they were several thousands. They had been driven from their homes by the RPF. And my message over the radio was clear. I condemned the war, and I appealed for an end to the war and for negotiations so that a political situation -- solution be found to the war. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, you referred to a name. It sounded like Road bare, can you us please with the spelling? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Rwebare, R-W-E-B-A-R-E. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So your party was an ecologist party, it was not involved in ethnicity issues. That was irrelevant to your party? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That's correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Witness, following on that question relating to the party of which you were chairperson, well, you've -- was the genocide agenda part of the agenda of your party? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
All the politicians with whom I had contact, because I had several or many contacts, there is also the fact that we were a centre party, so, in fact, we had relations with many people. Nobody run away -- nobody ran away from us. In fact, we were even desired by many parties. So the contacts that I had with others, in those contacts, I never found any project or plan similar to what we saw in 1994. 
The example I can give you is that with the setting of the government, governed by the Arusha accords, the ministry of public health had to go to the RPF, that is, the Rwandan Patriotic Front. Since I was a director of the national AIDS -- or national AIDS control programme which was a very important department for -- or programme for the country, a programme which was also very important in terms of means and resources -- we should not hide that. Besides, that was an envied position. I knew that the RPF, right from the next day, will compel me or I had to do so myself, but the RPF will compel me to resign. That is why I had asked for a loan from the Rwandan development bank, the 
Banque Rwandaise de Developpement which was headed by a friend, a friend whose name was Augustin. Augustin was also -- also lost his life during the events. 
On the 6th of April, I had just been granted a loan to open my office, a loan of over 4 million. This is to say that even amongst us -- even amongst us -- Mr. Augustin was a Tutsi, I was Hutu, but we were good friends, very good friends. But before that he granted me a loan. This is to say that everyone -- well, another point: I and the minister of public health, knowing that the ministry of public health will be given to the RPF or aware that in the two years to come, given the elections that were coming up, that it was possible for that ministry to be given to another majority party or group of parties, we discussed and made provisions knowing -- or being aware of the existence of competent doctors who were treating people. In agreement, a Tutsi doctor was appointed director of public health in the ministry. That was given to the ministry -- or rather to the RPF. This is what happened after my departure. This is to show that we could not see the -- any genocide plan in the minds of the people we contacted. I could also mention members of the MDR or PL political parties. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I believe that is enough. The example you have given is enough. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes, Witness, I just want to find out since you said your party was a central party, were there Tutsi doctors or veterinary surgeons in that party?
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
There was a surgeon who was not a Tutsi but Hutu, but there was a veterinary surgeon who was Tutsi. There is also the person I mentioned to you, the person with whom I was at the radio. He was Tutsi and he was in charge of information within our party. He was in the information committee. So I had Tutsi in -- Tutsis in my party. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
How many members were there in your party, approximately? And now we really want brief answers, approximate membership. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
About four thousand. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of this four thousand, do you have any idea as to the ethnic composition of those four thousand? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I did not check the various ID cards of the members, but what I can tell you is that there were many, many Tutsis. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, we are getting to the end of your examination-in-chief. Did you know the last residence of the Renzaho family? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I knew very well where they lived. That was in Kanombe. They lived opposite the military camp. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you have the opportunity of visiting him? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I was in -- at his home, together with my family. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Was it a big house with a big courtyard? Do you remember what type of house it was? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, it was a big house. Of course, a house that was commensurate with his rank or status. It was a villa which also had a garden, a normal garden. It was about 15 acres. I'm comparing it to my house which I had in Kigali which had about 20 acres -- 23. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you by chance meet other politicians or Interahamwe militia at his residence? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No. When I went to his home, it was a family visit. I did not meet any other person there neither did I see any other one, apart from his security guard, his watchman. Of course, I saw his children too; that is logical. But there was no other person, as I said, apart from the security guard who opened the door to us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In English -- in English, we have that it was a family visit. In French we have that c'etait en famille. Now, can you clarify the position, please? Were you related to this person that you visited, 
Mr. Renzaho, by family bonds or was it simply a private visit? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, I do not have any family links with Mr. Renzaho. When I said it was a private visit, what I mean is that I was -- I didn't visit him alone. I was accompanied by my wife, so we visited him in -- as a family. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, I would like to have you listen to an excerpt of a tape record, an audio tape recording. You will hear a conversation and, thereafter, I'm going to ask you just one question once you would have listened to the recording. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we are going to carry out a difficult exercise. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And before we start, there will be no need for interpretation now. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Very well, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Because you will simply play what we've heard on several occasions and what we have in the transcripts. And the point is voice recognition, isn't it? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, it is in a language which the witness understands and speaks. Therefore, he doesn't need interpretation.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Neither do the transcripts.
@MR. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, perhaps the record should reflect the number of the exhibit before it's played. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, can you help us with that, please?

$(Audio recording played)
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Can you play it all over, please? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we possibly do that, why don't you indicate your question, Maître, so that he knows what the question is going to be? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I just wanted to be faithful and transparent. First I wanted him to listen and then I would ask him the question. But, in any case, I will comply with the Court's wishes. I do not want to be holier than the Pope. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, we think you behaved exactly as you should. We are very pleased with the way you proceeded. But since the witness now said, please play it again, I think maybe he should know what answer -- what question you are going to ask him before we really take a position as to whether there is a need to play it again. 
So what is now the question going to be? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, my question is simple. You have heard -- you've heard that excerpt. Do you recognise, among the persons who spoke, the voice of Mr. Renzaho? Or do you wish -- if you did not hear well what you just listened to, do you wish to have the recording played again? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Counsel, I would like to listen to it again. I'm trying to follow the message. So, indeed, I would like to listen to it in order to be able to answer your question. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, yes, the message may be important, but in our context -- in our context it's not the message which is important. My question is simply to know whether you recognise the voice of Mr. Renzaho in that conversation? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I did not recognise his voice, even if it -- even if I have not heard him for a long time. But I did not hear his voice, which I'm familiar with.
Now, if you can have me listen to the recording again, I would be pleased -- I would be happy. But even though I have not listened to him or heard him speak for a long time, I did not recognise or identify his voice in that recording. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
As far as I'm concerned, I think that answer is sufficient. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether the counsel has entered his question, but there is a point relating to the exclusion from my party from the Nsanzimana government. I would like to make a clarification concerning that point 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is that something the Defence would like to solicit from the witness, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'm sorry, my headset is broken down. A moment's indulgence, please. 
So, I'm with you now, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness indicates that he would like to make an additional remark about the exclusion of his party from the Nsanzimana government. I am asking, before he volunteers that information, whether this is something you solicit from the witness?
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I do not think that that piece of evidence is directly related to my case. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, I believe you've already given a satisfactory answer to my question and I thank you for that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. Then I think we can let it rest with that. Was that more or less the last question in examination-in-chief or is there a portion left? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I have concluded my examination-in-chief, Mr. President, and thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. What is the estimated duration of the cross-examination of this witness? 
@MR. MELLUISH: 
An hour to an hour and a half, two hours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness has been testifying for quite some time. Instead of having our 11 o'clock break from 11:00, we think we will today start at 10:30. And for administrative purposes, we need a slightly longer break than usual. So we will resume at 11:15.
The Court is adjourned.
$(Court recessed at 1030H)
$(Pages 1 to 21 by Gifty C. Harding)
$(Court resumed at 1127H)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The timetable needs to be reflected on for administrative reasons, the bench needs some days outside the courtroom these days. So our suggestion would be to end at 12:45 this morning and not sit in the afternoon. We will then resume tomorrow morning at 9:30. 
Cross-examination.

@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, most of the questions, if not all of the questions that I am going to ask you, don't require more than a yes or a no answer. I don`t wish to stop you giving important additional information if you have it, but I just want to alert you to the fact at the beginning that it isn't always going to be necessary for you to give us long answers. And your testimony will finish much sooner if you try to stick to a yes or a no where possible. 
Now, you said in your evidence in-chief that you were a very good friend --
MS. MELLUISH: 
I thought that was slow. I am sorry, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Still room for improvement. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said in your evidence in-chief that the Accused was a discreet man, didn't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I confirm that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
He was a man with a low profile, you said, didn't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I said that. I said he was evenly effaced. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I am not sure if I understood that last word; do you mean self-effacing? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Someone who is effaced is someone who rather likes to lie low, rather than be in the spotlight. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Would you say that he's a quiet man? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Anti-social? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, I would never say that. I knew him very well, Madam Prosecutor. I would never say that of him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said you used to visit his house in Kanombe, that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I visited him, but not ordinarily. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How frequently would you say you visited Mr. Renzaho's house? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Twice. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you ever call him at home on the telephone? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
At home, no, but at work, yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, this quiet, discreet man who liked to keep a low profile, he was the first préfet appointed to the new préfecture of Kigali, wasn't he? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That's correct. He was a very professional man. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But he had never been a préfet before, before October 1990, had he? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That's correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, indeed, he wasn`t before his appointment as préfet a high-ranking administrator, was he? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, except within the army, because he was a soldier. But that`s a different hierarchy. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
He was a lieutenant colonel in the army, wasn't he, in 1990? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Would you agree as of 5th October 1990 the new préfecture of Kigali-ville was the most important préfecture in the country? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
The most important because it was in the capital city. Paris, for example, compared to the other provinces, would enjoy the same status. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So it was very important -- so it was very important, wasn't it, that the person given the office of préfet of Kigali-ville was a powerful leader? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Not necessarily, and I can explain. It had to be someone working in a city where you had the president, ministers, so it was somebody who had to be in that position and not in other people's positions. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you knew Renzaho from Kibungo, didn't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
He is a native of our préfecture, and our communes are neighbouring communes. Furthermore, there are only a few senior staff from those communes working in Kigali or elsewhere. So it was only normal for Dr. Butera, the only doctor chairman of a party, to know the lieutenant colonel of a neighbouring commune. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, in Kibungo, when Renhazo was there, he was well-known as the protégé of Colonel Rwagafilita?
MS. MELLUISH: 
Which is on the spelling list, number 15.
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Madam Prosecutor, that expression would not be exactly correct, because to say that a lieutenant colonel of the army is a protégé of another colonel would be incorrect.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, after Colonel Rwagafilita retired, Renhazo was the senior officer in Kibungo, wasn't he? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, there were others. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And Renzaho was an expert in urban guerilla warfare, wasn't he? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I am not aware of that. I did not see his certificates in that regard. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, it makes sense, doesn't it, to appoint such a man to the préfet -- to the préfecture of Kigali in October 1990, doesn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you talked about the round up of Tutsi that occurred in October 1990, that was what could be described as repression, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I would say that these were arrests and not persecution. As I said to the Court before, Mr. President, Madam Prosecutor, I knew some of these people who were even my friends. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, are you saying that it wasn't a repression or a crack down? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, let me tell you that it wasn't only Tutsis who were involved, Hutus as well. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall the statement you made for the Accused's defence on the 5th of April this year? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I do. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Because in that statement you described what happened in 1990 as la repression. So was it or was it not repression? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
There were arrests, I would say. I will make a correction, there were arrests.
@MS. MELLUISH: 
They were arrests of people described as accomplices, weren't they? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And people who were described as accomplices in October 1990 were Tutsis, weren't they? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
But, Madam Prosecutor, you forget to mention that they were considered to be accomplices of those who were attacking Rwanda. I think that is an important significant detail. And among these accomplices there were Hutus and Tutsis. And, as I told you previously, I met some of them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Those who were attacking Rwanda were the RPF, weren't they? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, alongside Ugandan soldiers or elements. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And on the whole the RPF were Tutsi, weren't they? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Probably, but not only Tutsi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you accept that many, if not all, of those arrested in October 1990 were arrested arbitrarily? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I can confirm that. It is true that people were arrested unjustly. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
That sounds like repression, doesn't it, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, let me revisit that term again, which I think we need to clarify. There is a distinction to be made between repression and arrests. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Were these people given fair trials? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Well, I don't know what to say, but all I am aware of is that they had counsel or lawyers defending them, and we already mentioned Mr. Mbonampeka, and we can also talk about Félicien Ngango and others. So I believe that the trials were fair. Maybe some were not, but I am not in a position to say because I am not a lawyer. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Those people that --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You now mentioned two names, Mr. Witness, shall we take them one by one? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Mbonampeka. And I also mentioned Ngango, Félicien, who unfortunately is also dead. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you agree that that is M-B--O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A (sic) for the last name? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
N-G-A-N-G-O. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please listen to my question. I am now spelling Mbonampeka, not the other name. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Easy. And now the other last name, please. Spelling? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
N-G-A-N-G-O. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And there the first name was? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Félicien. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which is easy. Please proceed. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Those people that you have mentioned who acted as, you said, as defence counsel, they were volunteers, weren't they? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Volunteers or counsel, they acted as lawyers in defence of their clients. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And they are persecuted for it, weren't they? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
What I know is they were not well perceived. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And wasn't there an international outcry by human rights groups that resulted eventually in the release of many of those who were arrested in October 1990? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, that has already been my testimony. I said that Reyntjens was there. I happen to know him. And I am aware that other human rights organisations were also active in that matter. That is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So it's simply not true to say these people were given access to justice and fair trials as a result of their arrests, is it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, please kindly repeat your question? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, you said earlier, that those who were arrested were entitled to defence. You agreed with me that they were given the opportunity to be fairly tried on the basis of what they were alleged to have done, and I'm suggesting to you that that simply isn't true, yes or no? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the witness answered the question, and he was very specific in his answer. Now they're trying to put words into his mouth, different from what he has said, and with which the Prosecutor is not comfortable. So I object to that on the grounds that the question has already been asked and answered. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are free to use the words you like, Mr. Witness. But a proposition is being put to you, and it is stated that these trials were simply not fair; do you agree or disagree with that proposition? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
I disagree with that proposition. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you said earlier this morning that the Accused was not involved in organising those arrests, didn't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
It was my assertion that as préfet it would appear to me that he was not involved. I experienced what happened in the night of the 4th to the 5th. Bullets dropped in my home. I think it was the army, the gendarmerie and the intelligent services that he was coordinating. I do not see what other role he could have played as a newly appointed préfet, particularly given that the arrests were also carried out in other préfectures and other regions, not only in Kigali. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
That isn't enough, is it, Mr. Witness, to assert that he had no involvement? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Well, you have asked me whether he was involved, and what I have told you is at that time those who were arrested were presumed to be accomplices of the army that had attacked Rwanda on the 
1st of October. So I do not think that this was the business for one préfet, and there are other préfectures, not only Kigali. You see, there were many people who unfortunately were arrested in Kigali, some of whom were innocent. And I believe that the judiciary did its work. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said yourself this morning that Renzaho -- Renzaho caught the train on the move in respect of these arrests; that means, doesn't it, that he was involved? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
When I say "to catch the train on the move", it's because there had been arrests in Kigali town and the newly appointed préfet was supposed to take an interest, I presume, in that file. And it is my presumption that is what he did, because it is a matter that related to the inhabitants of his city. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
He didn't oppose the arrests, did he? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
How could that be when it was already done? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you not recall the criticism that Renzaho received for his involvement in the sale of the property of the Tutsi who had to flee as a result of the repression? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I heard about that, but I do not know whether it was Renzaho, the individual, who was involved or whether it was the préfecture of Kigali-ville. So I think there was property that was sold and this may have been property that should have been sold to pay off some bank loans. My house, for example, was sold to pay off a bank loan, although I was not in Kigali. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you told the Court this morning that on the 6th of April your wife was preparing food for a dinner on the 7th when the minister of health was due to come to your house, that`s right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Expected to come to my house, that is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
The minister of health at the time was a man called Casimir Bizimungu, is that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, that's correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
He is currently standing trial at this Tribunal for his participation in the genocide? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I am aware of that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now on the 8th of April you left your home in Remera, didn`t you, to go to Masaka? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I was going to Kibungo, but I was forced to change my itinerary halfway through. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, you spent the period from the 8th of April to the 28th of April in Masaka, that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And Masaka, if I'm not mistaken, is in the préfecture of Kigali-rural, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That is correct, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
During those 20 days that you were at Masaka, you were with about 70 others, weren't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, except that some people, for lack of food, had to return to their homes or to seek refuge elsewhere, maybe in Gitarama. But there were about 40 who remained there until the end. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you said, didn't you, that a major assisted you by giving you soldiers for protection, isn't that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Two soldiers., after he had witnessed someone shoot one of us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So soldiers were available for the protection of a group of, say, 40 people such as yours? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
70 people initially. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you said that the reason you went, or you tried to go to Kibungo rather than the centre of Kigali, was because it was simply impossible to go towards the centre of town on the 7th or 8th of April, that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That is correct, Madam. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
The reason you said it was impossible was because there were soldiers everywhere, is that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
First of all, there were roadblocks at which you could find militia. But there were also soldiers, soldiers of the RPF and the Rwandan army fighting each other. So, on the one hand, there were the soldiers who left the CND. So there was one group of RPF soldiers, on the one hand, and then there is the Kanombe camp, on the other, which is a big military camp. So everything around the airport was in fact an area of great danger. It would have been dangerous to venture into that zone. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And as far as you know, because from what you have said you didn't make that journey. But as far as you know between Kanombe camp and the centre of Kigali, there were other roadblocks -- more roadblocks? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
There were -- there were some. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And that would have been true, wouldn't it, not just on the 7th or 8th April but on the 9th or the 10th or 20th April, wouldn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, I, I -- I don't think the situation was that on the 6th. Because I went to work on the 6th. There was no roadblock on the 6th, Madam Prosecutor.
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I think perhaps you misunderstood my question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In French the question included the 6th, but English started with the 7th. So the question is simply from the 7th onwards, Mr. Witness. 
Do you agree that there would have been roadblocks also on the 7th, the 8th, the 9th, the 10th and the 20th? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yes, there were roadblocks; that's correct. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And it's right, isn't it, that the principal difficulty that confronted people at roadblocks was that if they wore a Tutsi identity card, or the appearance of being Tutsi, they were in danger of being killed? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That's correct, but I would add the following: Sometimes if one did not have an ID card, if you did not have an ID card you could be allowed to pass if you were not known, or if your attitude towards the situation that prevailed was known. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What you said in the original language was, Mr. Witness, was you could be allowed to pass if you were known, isn't that so?
@WITNESS BUTERA:
With respect to what I said. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And this is what happened to you, isn't it, when you had that difficulty at a roadblock you described in Masaka when you took -- you had been asked to help a friend to cross that roadblock, it wasn't you that was in trouble there, was it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
When I was crossing the roadblock I was not the one who had problems. It is because I had someone with me. I will also explain the following: I was unfortunate, or perhaps I was lucky or unlucky, that during the three months of the tragic events that happened in that country of Rwanda I was without an ID card. I did not have an ID card. Why? It is because, as I have already said this morning, I have taken a bank loan and on the 6th I asked my accountant at PNLS to go and look for statements relating to our loan. So I stayed for three months without an ID card. I will explain later on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you now refer to something called PNLS? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yes, I talked of PNLS. This is the national program for the fight against AIDS. PNLS is an acronym. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
P-N-L-S? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I would like you, please, to clarify some confusion I have about your testimony this morning. I recall that you said initially that between the 8th and the 20th of April when you were in Masaka you only moved about twice, firstly, to go and look for food, which was very difficult, and, secondly, when you went to visit a friend in Kanombe, that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That's correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Later you were asked whether you had any conversation with the Accused during that period and you said: No. Do you recall that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I do, Counsel. But I can explain why, because when I went to Kanombe, the purpose was not to seek Renzaho or to go to Renzaho's house. It was for going to visit a friendly family because the husband or the man of that family was not in, and the wife of that house had problems. She was afraid for her daughters. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, I understand that, Mr. Witness. What I am concerned about is that you then went on to say that in fact you had seen Mr. Renzaho during the course of that period. Do you -- 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, I did not see him. I did not see him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said you went to the préfecture office, didn`t you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That was on the 28th of April. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So it is right that between the 8th and 28th of April you did move around more than twice? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Before the 28th I went out only twice, as I told you, and the third time was when I was going to Gitarama, when I was going to Gitarama towards Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And in this period you did not see Mr. Renzaho during those two occasions when you went out nor did he visit you. You didn't see him. It was only on the 28th that you saw him. Is this the evidence? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
That's right, Mr. President. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So why is it, Mr. Witness, that in your statement of 5th of April 2007 you said: "I was able to realise it or to notice it" -- in reference to Renzaho's authority over Interahamwe: "I was able to notice it when I went to Kigali and I spoke to him." 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
When I was going to Gitarama. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You didn't see Renzaho more than on that one occasion and yet you say he had no authority over the Interahamwe, that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Could you please repeat the question? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we do that, these shifts between languages makes life difficult. Could you now read that portion of the statement in French slowly, so that we have a complete authorised interpretation of what he said in his statement? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Certainly. Okay, I will read the full passage just to make it clear what the reference is to the militia: He was not. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel continue, please? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH: 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
He was not considered as an extremist. He was not at all close to the militias over whom he clearly had no authority. I was able to notice this when I had to travel to Kigali, when I had to go to Kigali, and I spoke to him."
A. Counsel, I do not see where the confusion arises, I believe everything is clear. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the basis for that statement in your written declaration is your sighting of Mr. Renzaho on the 
28th of April? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
That's entirely correct. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall what time of day you went to the préfecture office on the 28th of April? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
It was around midday, 2 p.m., because to cross from Masaka to Kigali going past roadblocks, as I said, was not an easy task. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I wonder if the Exhibit P. 28 (sic) could be shown to the witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much time did you spend at the préfecture office on that day, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
It wasn't long, I was not there for long, I can't remember how much time I spent there exactly, it must have been between 20 and 30 minutes, but not more than that because I had to go to Gitarama and that should also be borne in mind. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you move while we are waiting for that Prosecution exhibit, please. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Certainly. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You didn't have any trouble finding the préfet on the 28th of April, did you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Difficulties? No, I wouldn't say so, because I went to the roadblock and I had to wait. I had to wait nevertheless. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
No, but I`m talking about at the préfecture office, when you got to the préfecture office you were admitted and able to see the préfet without trouble, is that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
To say without trouble or difficulties, that would not be accurate, because as I noticed, it was very busy, he didn't have much time and there were many people. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you were able to get a laissez-passer from Renzaho himself, is that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, I had my laissez-passer, which I had obtained in Kanombe and not in Kigali-ville. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps I misunderstood your evidence earlier, but I thought the reason for gong to PVK on that day was to obtain some sort of travel document, so you could leave for Gitarama, is that not correct? So what was your reason for gong there? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
My visit to PVK was, first of all, to greet the préfet and to have an idea of what was happening because I was in a remote area where I was kind of cut off, so to speak, and I went to the PVK to find out what was happening, because I knew that I also had to go to Gitarama. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Just have a look at that document that has been placed in front of you, Mr. Witness. I believe you read English, is that correct? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I read English, but my English is not that good. I'm sorry. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, firstly, Mr. Witness, this document is a memo. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Sorry, perhaps --
@MR. CANTIER: 
Is this document one of those that you disclosed to us a short while ago? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, it is the Prosecution Exhibit number 29. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
29 or 28? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
My records show it is 29. The K number at the top right-hand corner ends in 975. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You asked for P. 28 to be given to the witness, according to the transcripts, or P. 29. What I have in the English version is P. 28. What do you have there, P. 28 or 29?
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 29. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excellent, so that is only a typing error. Does that clarify the matter for Defence? We are referring to 
P. 28. Do you have it in front of you? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, it is P. 29. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's ask the first question now. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
That document is dated, isn't it, 28th April 1994, do you see that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I can see it bears that date. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And the subject heading is: "Meeting between Col. Yaache and Col. Renhazo, préfet Kigali-ville district." Do you see that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I can follow. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I suppose this is Y-A-A-C-H-E. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, below that it says: "The above mentioned meeting was held between 1130 hours and 
1400 hours." Do you see that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I have read that. I can follow you. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Then it goes on to repeat those who were present at the meeting, doesn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So it's simply not possible that you went to see the préfet whilst he was involved in a meeting with Colonel Yaache, is it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
But if you remember what I told you, this was within the period of 12:00 and 2 p.m., and it was after the meeting that I saw him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You recall this meeting, do you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I did not attend the meeting. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
It is just that I got the impression from the evidence you gave a moment ago that when you found the préfet at the préfecture office he was busy dealing with lots of people who were coming to seek his attention; isn't that what you said? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, not at all. No, that is not what I said. You asked me the time frame and I said it was from noon to 
2 p.m.. But as soon as he ended his meeting, that is when I saw him, and that did not last long since I had to go to Gitarama. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
If you look further down in this document --
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
-- at paragraph numbered 4, you will see that it says: "Colonel Renhazo replied that the ICRC was perhaps exaggerating somewhat in this report. He indicated he was in charge" -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Not so fast when we read. Start again. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
"Colonel Renzaho replied that the ICRC was perhaps exaggerating somewhat in this report. He indicated that he was in charge of forces within his area. He indicated that due to a lack of trust in UNAMIR, neighbourhood militias had formed to protect themselves from the RPF and that they were defending their neighbourhoods in concert with the overall aims of the government." Do you see that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I am with you, Counsel. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
That reflects what, to a member of UNAMIR, Colonel Renzaho was saying on the 28th April 1994. You maintain, do you, that on that one visit of yours to the préfecture office you were able to assert that Renzaho had no authority or links to the Interahamwe at all, is that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I confirm that, because at roadblocks there were places where all authorities -- any authority would have had difficulties in order to cross. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you agree from what I have just read you from that report, Renzaho was asserting that the militia were acting in accordance with the government's orders or aims? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Counsel, I could ask you whether this report has been countersigned by Mr. Renzaho. I believe it is a report prepared by someone of UNAMIR. UNAMIR had just abandoned the people of Rwanda by withdrawing the Belgian contingent. 
Therefore, if I say that Renzaho had signed this report I would have nothing to add. But I believe that this is a report of someone of UNAMIR to his boss, because if UNAMIR had remained and if they had interposed themselves between the belligerents, I believe neither my friends nor members of my family would have died. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you finished with the document? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, according to the text here the meeting was held between 1130 and 1400 hours. That`s what we read here. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And your meeting or visit to the PVK was between midday and two o'clock.
@WITNESS BUTERA:
That is what I said. But it was after the meeting ended that I saw Mr. Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you observed this meeting? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
No, no, not at all. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, when you say it was after the meeting ended, it is as if you have information that there was in fact such a meeting, whereas what we heard you say previously was that he was busy. But were you in fact aware of him being in a meeting with Colonel Yaache and other persons? Did you observe that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
I was not aware of it, I did not know that. 
Mr. President, what I said is that I was - or, rather, I did not know who was in the meeting. When I arrived his secretary asked me to wait until the end. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The end of what? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
The end of his meeting. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the secretary informed you that he was in a meeting? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
That he was busy, busy. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
He was busy, but there was no reference to a meeting. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
No, no. Mr. President. I was in charge of the AIDS program, when I gave orders to my secretary that -- when I told my secretary that I was busy, I was busy. So I was told that he was busy and that I had to be patient. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that is a virtue for all of us. You have clarified. Thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said this morning that you heard Renzaho talking on the radio, and that he was always calling for calm and asking for people to stay at their homes. As far as you recall, you never heard him calling for acts of violence to be committed, is that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Not at all. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you would say, wouldn't you, that would be most unlike the Renzaho that you knew? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I did not quite understand the meaning of the question. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You've told us that in your opinion Renzaho was appointed préfet because of his neutrality, because he was likely to be an appeaser amongst opposing political groups, isn't that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I confirm that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, in your opinion, Renzaho was not the kind of man to call for acts of violence on the radio, was he? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I confirm that, in my opinion, he would be unable to do that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You didn't hear him on the radio on the 21st of April when you were still in Masaka? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I didn't hear him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You don't recall him saying -- asking the population to consider whether a stranger in their neighbourhood was untrustworthy, and then, and I quote: "You inform the population. You surround him. You attack him and you neutralise him." You don't recall hearing that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, I don't. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which radio station? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Radio Rwanda. That extract, for the benefit of anybody, is from P. 53, page 30 in the English. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You don't recall, Witness, on 22nd April, similarly on Radio Rwanda the préfet, Renzaho, said: "Besides, in times like these do not bother yourself with too many questions. We say that you should shoot those who want to interfere with the security of people. Anyone with a gun should shoot. That is it." 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, I didn't hear that. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Again, for the benefit of anyone in the courtroom, that it is P. 54, page 15 in the English. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said in your examination-in-chief this morning that so far as you were aware Renzaho never called for the establishment of roadblocks, is that right? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Could you kindly repeat, because to be honest I didn't quite understand. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you remember that this morning you talked about Renzaho on the radio, and you said that he didn't ever call for - he didn't invite people to erect roadblocks? Do you remember saying that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I said that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You don't recall on the 11th of April the préfet through a communiqué on Radio Rwanda, saying: "Roadblocks may only be set up at night"? You don't remember that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, I did not hear that communiqué. But, Counsel, I would also like to point out to you that when I escaped from my house I had only three minutes to land. So I didn't even take on a radio set which would have enabled me to listen to announcements. I was even -- even unable to pick up my certificates. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But I understood from your evidence this morning that you heard the préfet -- can you hear me? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I heard him, but this was during the first days when I was still home. He said: "People stay indoors". Then he also talked about days when we could go to market, but because -- before this we could go out. People would ask to go out and get food. I was not all the time glued to the radio to listen. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So you left Kigali-ville préfecture on the 8th April, and you left Kigali-rural préfecture on the 28th April, so you had no radio after the 8th April, if I understood what you just said correctly, you can't possibly assist the Court with what the préfet Renzaho did or did not do in respect of the genocide, can you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Counsel, I told you that I listened to the radio, but I was not all the time listening to the radio. And this because of the responsibility of those with whom I was. So I had a radio in my car -- in my vehicle, but I could not stay in the car all the time in order to listen to announcements. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You were asked to listen to a tape recording this morning, and you said that you did not identify either speaker as the préfet. Do you recall now the contents of the discussion on that tape? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I do. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you hear one of those speakers asking to speak to the préfet? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I heard that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you hear that same speaker talking about the situation in a place called Gahengeri? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Counsel, that is why I also wanted to listen for a second time to the message, so as to clearly understand. But the voice of the speaker is unknown to me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The location was G? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
G-A-H-E-N-G-E-R-I. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last letter being I, thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Gahengeri is in Bicumbi, is that correct -- isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Avenger (sic), I'm not very sure, but perhaps it may be so. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you agree that the person who answered to the title of préfet spoke about a Kigali unit being sent? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I repeat that I did not clearly understand the entire message. I want -- I listened once, but I wanted to listen a second time, and that is what I am repeating. I say I do not recognise the voice of the speaker or speakers. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
When you heard this tape played in court this morning, that wasn't the first time you had ever heard it, was it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I heard it once, but I can assure you that I don't remember. I do not remember all that was said in the tape and that is why I wanted to listen to it again. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you hear the man who was referred to as the préfet saying that he checked with the military headquarters and that the Kigali unit was on its way? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
No, don't remember that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Please forgive my Kinyarwanda, but do you recall hearing the words "mubakinbagure rwose"? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps I should spell that for the record. M-U-B-A-K-I-N-B-A-G-U-R-E. New word R-W-O-S-E. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And those words, Mr. Witness, mean exterminate them truly, don't they? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Counsel, unless one is being cynical, I do not see Mr. Renzaho saying that. That is, the words -- the words you just used, "Exterminate them". First of all, exterminate who? I find that cynical. Certainly he is not the one who uttered those words. Besides, the voice is unknown to me. I have already stated that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Surely, you agree that the speaker was a préfet from Kigali? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I say no to that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a difference between the English and the French version. The English question was, "Surely, you agree that the speaker was 'a' préfet from Kigali?" Would that change your answer, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yes, Mr. President, that would change my answer, because what I said is the person who passes for préfet in my opinion is not the préfet. It is not the préfet's voice. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
According to you, was a préfet speaking? Did you hear any version in that position based on your general knowledge of important Rwandan personalities, any of those voices on that tape? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Mr. President, could you kindly repeat the question, because I am unable to follow you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I am trying to understand why you changed your answer after my clarification of the question. And in order to do this in an efficient way the question is as follows: Did you hear the voice of any préfet on the tape? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yes, I heard the voice of a certain préfet. But that voice is not Renzaho's voice. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Whose voice was it, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I do not know. It is an unknown voice. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But if the voice is unknown, how can you know the position of the person having that voice? You don't really know the identity of the person having that voice, is that the testimony? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
That`s not what I am saying. I said that the person who is passing for a préfet and who purports to be Préfet Renzaho, there is a major difference between him and Renzaho. I heard mention of a préfet, but I did not hear Préfet Renzaho's voice. That is the difference.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And having listened to the various voices, did you know any of the voices on that tape? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
No. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, what is happening now is not satisfactory to me. I am afraid that we will not be able to elicit reliable answers or information from this witness. Why? Because, first of all, I had asked the witness to focus on the voice, because the Prosecution case was the subject of polemics, and this is what surprised us. You disclosed a document, and in that document there was a name other than that of Renzaho. I believe the Chamber or the Bench will recall that. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The President nods. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, the evidence adduced by the Prosecution was to have this tape recording listened to by the witness or witnesses. I am trying to -- I am trying to lay a foundation for my objection. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there an objection? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
But I am laying a foundation for that objection, so that it should be clearly understood by the Chamber, because we are now dealing with the cross-examination which is based on the examination-in-chief. Objection to questions -- I am objecting to questions relating to the substance of the message because as far as we are concerned in the testimony in-chief, I did not refer to the substance of the message. 
I questioned the witness only with respect to the issue of knowing whether among those involved in the conversation he, the witness, recognised the voice of Mr. Renzaho. Therefore, any discussion relating to the substance of the message may be biased because the witness is not familiar with the utterances that were made. 
Moreover, the witness wanted to hear the utterances once more. I said no, because I did not see the relevance of that. So I am objecting to the question that has been raised with respect to the substance of the message. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That objection is noted. We will rule on it tomorrow after having heard your response to it, and also having recapitulated what is actually in the transcripts both during chief and cross. Thank you. 
So we will then adjourn, and as mentioned earlier, we have to start at 9:30 tomorrow morning. 
That is when your testimony continues, Mr. Witness. Please do not discuss it with anyone. We wish you all a pleasant afternoon. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I heard 9:30 a.m., 9:30 tomorrow? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is true that is an unusual time for starting but that is what we said, of course. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, I just wanted to be sure. I thank you.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning. The Court is in session. 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, at the end of proceedings yesterday there was an objection raised by my learned friend. I don't know whether that needs to be dealt with before we continue with the cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We said that you would be given the opportunity to commence on that objection and that is why you have the floor now. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, it may be moot because I do not want to continue questioning this witness on that particular exhibit. If it's a matter of questions and answers being struck from the record, then obviously I would wish to address Your Honours briefly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Unfortunately, I did not get the transcript last evening, so I do not have the wording in front of me. 
Have you been in touch with the Defence and found out whether this issue is now moot or whether you need to address it? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I`m afraid I haven't, no, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now because I didn't get the transcripts, I don't remember, so could you now kindly recapitulate your objection briefly, Maitre Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as I`m concerned, I have some draft transcripts before me. 
But I would like to recall the objection that I made. I objected to the questions that were being asked by my learned friend on the Prosecution on the content of the conversation that I had -- that I had made the witness to listen to, because I was saying that in the examination-in-chief I had only asked the witness whether he recognised or not, whether he recognised the voice of Mr. Renzaho. And one of the voices of -- who was one of those who was speaking -- as one of the people who were speaking in that conversation. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, that was the objection that I raised when I asked that the questions regarding the content should not be pursued. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does anyone have the drafts from yesterday so that we remember exactly the pending question? 
Is there anything left of the objection? 
I have now read the exchange just before we left each other yesterday. Can we leave it at that? There are no further questions on this issue, according to the Prosecution. Does this mean the objection is now moot, or do we need a ruling? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That will not be necessary, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. 
JEAN BAPTISTE BUTERA,

$CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, do you accept that a genocide against the Tutsi occurred in Rwanda between 
April and July 1994? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, I will answer that question in an indirect but precise manner. As far as I am concerned, as I said yesterday, Rwandan citizens from -- of Tutsi origin were massacred by the 
Hutus -- that is a reality that nobody can deny -- in April of 1994. I told you that some of my family members were also massacred, but I would also like to add that Hutu Rwandan citizens were also massacred because they were Hutus, others were Tutsis. They were massacred by the RPF soldiers. So I would like to conclude that Rwandan citizens, part of the population was massacred by militiamen and also by the RPF soldiers, and unarmed citizens were killed for no reason. And as far as I am concerned, anybody who was involved in these massacres should answer before the courts. That is my answer, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Okay, Mr. Witness, but would you accept that there was a concerted effort to destroy the Tutsi? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I would like to say no to that because, as I said already, if I was able to go through some roadblocks even with some difficulty -- that was because since 1991, in November and in December, I had participated in some political meetings and when the president of the republic -- yesterday I talked of the exclusion of my party which also had to take part in the government of Nsanzimana, in Nsanzimana`s government. 
The main reason for that was that if the PECO party and the other three parties that were excluded from that government were to take part in this government without the MDR, the PL, the PSD, the situation in the country would have been a disaster. 
Let me explain myself, when the president received me -- I would like to continue because this is very important, Madam Prosecutor -- when the president received me he told me, "Dr. Butera, I strongly regret" --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we must show some self-constraint now, and the Prosecution, just like the Defence, will have to really assess whether they have received an answer to the question or not. And even if you always would wish to have the witness's answer in context, we think that at this stage the best thing is to proceed with the next question, which is? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said yesterday, didn't you, that you didn't think that Renzaho was an extremist? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I said so and I would like to confirm that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you define an extremist as somebody who participated in the genocide, didn't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I don't think I said that. But I said that -- I don't know if I maybe understand that. I am not sure I understand what you said, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you agree that it's possible to be an extremist before April 1994? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, it is possible, because I also know people I could also describe as extremists. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Could you describe - you, personally, would you describe Bagosora as an extremist? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I did not acquaint myself with Bagosora very much, so I can't really answer that question. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about Karamera, would you describe him as an extremist? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I cannot say that. All I know is when he gave me a letter to go ask Mr. Kajuga to escort the Tutsis who had to leave Kigali. So, if in your explanation, an extremist is somebody who has something against the Tutsis, then I would say that by his actions, for me, he was not an extremist. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about Ferdinand Nahimana, was he an extremist in your view? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, I do not see how that would concern the case in which I am a witness. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Could you just answer the question, please. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I don't know, madam. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now you told us about your political party, PECO, yesterday. And it's right, isn't it, that your motto or mission you said was to focus on the environment and health? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That is correct, madam. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you said that your party -
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The break, it is too fast now. Let's slow down, both of you. All right. Thank you. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I apologise. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yes, Mr. President. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said yours was a liberal party, didn't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
It was a centrist party. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Which had no connection with Hutu power, for example? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And in answer to a question from the President, you said that your party was not involved in ethnicity issues and that these were irrelevant to your party, that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Your party was established in November 1991, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I confirm that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Just one month before the establishment of multi-party government, that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Two months before, yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And your brand new party was to form part of that multi-party government, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
All the parties that were invited to the negotiation table for the establishment of that government, of that multi-party government, could take part, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And wasn't your party funded by President Habyarimana? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That is some news that you are just giving me, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Wasn't it founded at the behest of the MRND as a deliberately neutral sounding party? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, if you see me here, at least I have university diplomas, do you think I was not capable of forming a political party? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, you said yourself, Witness, yesterday that if as a result of this -- of the new era in politics that was dawning in Rwanda -- the ministry of health had gone to the RPF, you would have been compelled to resign; you said that, didn't you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, I had my private firm and I could have been well paid. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But the point is, Mr. Witness, that if, as you say, your party was centrist, liberal, ethnicity was not an issue and you are allied to the MRND, why would the RPF have compelled you to resign? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, if you allow me to give more details, I will do so. But if we are limited in time, then I cannot answer. But all I can say is that if the RPF had just been -- had received ministers. When a ministry was taken, taking into considering the preparation of elections, it was just logical that the ministry, or the minister of health of the RPF should give positions to members of his party, and that was logical. That is why I told you that. 
Taking into account the political situation prevailing -- we discussed, and Tutsi competent people were appointed, a competent Tutsi person was appointed in the ministry of health with the understanding that that person would continue working in the ministry. That is what I said yesterday. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Your party, PECO, aligned itself with the MRND and the CDR, didn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I would not say that we were aligned, but we had some kind of coalition, just as I could have had with the RPF. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Didn't you form an agreement with the MDR and the CDR and a couple of other parties in which you all expressed yourselves as alarmed by the anti-democratic forces that wanted to destroy the gains of the 1959 revolution? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, that is possible. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Is it possible, or did it happen at all, don't you remember? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam, I would like to say yes, but I would also like to add when the president of the republic received me he told me that we had to -- that we should not enter the government because if we entered the government we would risk a civil war and he did not want a civil war. Unfortunately, what happened, you are all aware of what happened in April of 1991 -- '94. I beg your pardon. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I wonder if this registry could hand this document to the witness? It should be the fourth document in the bundles I provided yesterday. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is a K-number? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, it is K0089892 to 3. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the question? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Have a look at the second page of that document, Mr. Witness, do you see your signature there? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you agree, do you, this is an accord between five parties including PECO, MRND and CDR? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you agree that among the objectives listed in article two on the first page of this document, is to safeguard the gains of the revolution, the social revolution of 1959? To this effect -- 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps it's safest if I read this in French and it is translated by an interpreter. "To this effect they undertake to fight all forms of feudal and monarchical systems." 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you agree that is what is written in this agreement? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
What page are you referring to, Madam Prosecutor? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
The first page towards the bottom, you see article two. And there are a number of bullet points. It's the third bullet point I am referring to. It begins (French spoken) -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Safeguard the gains".
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Madam Prosecutor, please, could you read the entire article because you are referring only to a bit of it and interpreting it differently. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We in this courtroom are able to read this in its true context. And you are right that there are many other elements there, Mr. Witness, including matters such as co-operation and the true democracy, et cetera, et cetera. But what the Prosecution is interested in now is the particular reference to maintaining the gains of the 1959 resolution. 
Now this particular formulation, do you have any comment on that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
No, that is what is written and that is what I signed. However, let me add that while I was six years, seven years old I saw how my father suffered. 
So, madam, if you did not experience this situation it is very difficult to understand it. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you deny the 1959 revolution was an ethnic revolution? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
It was based on social-ethnic inequality. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you deny that "le forces feodo-monarchiques" means Tutsi? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And for the record the sentence read out now was: (French spoken) 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Mr. President, let me say that I do not agree with the Prosecutor's assertion, because the feudal and monarchical systems were not made up only of Tutsis. But it was a group of Tutsis who took everything into their own hands and forgot about the rest of the population, be it Tutsi or Hutu, who were left to their own suffering. So this does not refer to Tutsis in general.
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
PECO was a shareholder in RTLM, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I know that the treasurer of our party had paid 10,000 francs to acquire two shares. But it was a business undertaking. And if there were to be any profits to arise from such an undertaking, it wasn't something to be overlooked. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to acquire any shares myself because I didn't have money. At the time I was involved in building my own home. But if I had had money at the time I would have taken up shares in that company as well, at that time, I must insist. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you're still denying, Mr. Witness, that PECO was, although a small party, an extremist party? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That is an unfounded assertion. I told you already that I had Tutsis as members of my party. They were friends. They were upright people and I still have Tutsi friends living in Kigali and other countries on exile. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why would a political party engage in a commercial activity? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yesterday, Mr. President, I talked about a party which was made up mainly of people who did not have any political background. I have never been a minister. I have never been a secretary general. I have never been a préfet. So we didn`t have the necessary resources to engage in politics and demonstrations and rallies, or what have you, contrary to the resources available to other political parties like the PSD or the MNDR who already had ministers in office and who had the necessary resources. So if it was possible to make some profit for the party, I did not find any problem with such an initiative. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Could the witness be shown this document, which is the third, I think, of those handed out yesterday? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, this is a photocopy of an extract from a book by a gentleman called Gérard Prunier, that is, G-É-R-A-R-D, P-R-U-N-I-E-R. Have you heard of that gentleman? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
If you have a look at the final page of those three that I have given to you, you will see an extract from a glossary of abbreviations in the book. Do you see that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you see that PECO is listed on the left-hand side? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I can see PECO on that list. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And Mr. Prunier has defined PECO, parti ecologiste, as follows: "Under its mild name, one of the worst of the pygmies closely allied with the MRND and later with the genocidal interim government." Do you see that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
What is the question, Madam Prosecutor? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is whether you see it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yes, I can see it. Can I answer? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, I was going to simply ask you whether or not you agree with what Mr. Prunier has said about PECO. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
As I have already told you, many historians have written on the event that happened in Rwanda. Prunier has his own understanding of the tragedy that befell my country, Rwanda. However, I would also like to see another document by Mr. Pierre Pean who talks about a number of issues, and in that view we might get another opinion.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness referred to a document produced by this author, which we didn't get. We didn't get the exact title. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The first name was Pierre. Can we have the last name again please?
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Pean. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Peant, P-E-A-N-T. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
There is no "T" at the end of that name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I delete the T, thank you. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you leave Rwanda at the end of 1994? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Correct, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you go to Congo? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I was forced to go through the Congo. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you end up in Cameroon at any stage? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Only when I was on mission or attending an international conference on HIV AIDS. I was never in Cameroon in `94, `95 or `96. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And in `97? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Since I was a director of the AIDS control program in Rwanda, I was able to travel to Cameroon on official mission. But, thereafter, I have never been to Cameroon. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see Renzaho when you were in the Congo? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I saw him over a period of two to four weeks. That is, in December and January. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you are aware, aren't you, that while Mr. Renzaho was in Congo he formed part of the umbrella committee of the RDR party that was set up there in 1995? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I was not aware, and I am not aware of that, because I left Congo in February 1995. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you now refer to the MRND party or the RMD party? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
@WITNESS RDR: 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you agree, Mr. Witness, that the RDR, then known as, "Rassemblement pour le retour des réfugies et la democratie au Rwanda" was created in Congo in 1995? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Interpreters, could you pick up that phrase. It is a well-known concept, please read it out again. 
@THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Rassemblement pour le retour des réfugies et de la democratie au Rwanda.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the English version for the English transcript. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is the "rally for the return of refugees and democracy to Rwanda". 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, do you agree that that was a party set up in Congo in 1995? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I do confirm that. But the president of that movement or rally is someone who lived in Belgium, the former minister of the economy under President Habyarimana. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you agree that that is a party that was set up by -- or to include ex-FAR officers and Interahamwe in opposition to the RPF? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I would not understand how a party would be created to involve the FAR and the Interahamwe, because the person who came from Belgium to meet those who were in the refugee camps in Congo, if that person had come with someone else to create such a movement for the return of the refugees, I do not see why he would have to seek to involve the Interahamwe, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Okay, Mr. Witness, do you accept that you were and are a member of that party? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Yes, I do acknowledge that I am a member and I am still a member of that party. But I only became a member of that movement in 1996 when I was already in Belgium. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you accept that you contributed to a document entitled: "UN Security Council misled about the presumed Tutsi genocide in Rwanda"? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Could you please repeat, because I did not quite understand what you said? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was: "Do you agree that you contributed to a document entitled: United Nations Security Council misled about the presumed `Tutsi genocide` in Rwanda"? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
I have no such recollection. I don't remember that document. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps the witness could be shown, I believe it's the seventh document in the bundle that was provided. There should be a copy in both English and French. That is the English I see, no, the one below, the one on the table. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
There are two copies. And if you flip through it you see the typeface changes after about 30 pages and perhaps you will find it easier to look at the French version. Would you like assistance in finding the French version of that document, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Just tell me the page, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is the front page. The front page contains the title and 12 persons contributing to the document. Do you see that? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
The French page? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The French page is the first page of the French part, after page 37 of the English version. So it would then be the 38th page, but there is not any number there, no pagination. Have you found it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Yes. I am there. The introduction. Yes. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now you see it in French, do you recognise that document, and do you accept that you contributed to it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I heard mention of this document, but I did not contribute to it because I was in Belgium at the time. And if you look at the names of the people mentioned who were in that location, I do not see how we could have met to draft this document. And at the time, I had no computer and I wasn't on the internet at that time. 
Now for greater clarity, Madam Prosecutor, let me say that you must remember that I am not the only Jean Baptiste Butera. I am Dr. Jean Baptiste Butera, not just Jean Baptiste Butera. This has been an issue in my life for several years. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So you are saying that name we say on that front there, number 5, that`s not you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Now I understand your question when you asked me whether I was in Cameroon. I was not in Cameroon. This must be referring to another Jean Baptiste who probably was in Cameroon. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness, the document doesn't say it was written, or contributed to, solely by persons in Cameroon, does it? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam, I am a politician and I gather information. I have documents and I have seen this document elsewhere. If you look at the list of the names of these people, you should be able to know and have information as to where they were in 1996. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Objection, Mr. President. This document before us refers to the movement for the return of refugees and democracy to Rwanda, RDR Cameroon wing. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is true and then the word "contribution" is mentioned. So that is a matter of interpretation. Yes. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you deny then, Mr. Witness, that you are the head of the RDR Benelux section B-E-N-E-L-U-X? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I am not the head, I`m the co-ordinator. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now you've said you've seen this document, although you deny you had any involvement in its drafting. Could you have a look, please, at page 34? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I am referring to the English page number. I will find it in French in a moment. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
What page, please? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Around 37 or 38 in the French version maybe. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Page 38 in the French. I'm sorry about the delay there. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Have a look, Mr. Witness, at the final paragraph on page 38. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I am waiting for your question, Madam Prosecutor. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You accept, do you, that that paragraph denies that the Interahamwe conducted into ethnic massacres is described as a genocide, a Tutsi genocide? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
As I already said, I know that there was genocide of Tutsi and Hutu who were killed by militia. But I also told you that there were other prevailing situations which you did not allow me to delve into and which all contributed to the results which we are all aware of. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And have a look, please, at page 33 in French, page 30 in the English, where in this document is it denied that the Interahamwe were a trained militia? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, can I also ask you, because I didn't contribute to preparing this document, maybe you may want to also see the document that was prepared by the Benelux section in Belgium. I am not the author of this document, why should I be answering questions on it? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I suggest to you that you are the author of this document; you are the Jean Baptiste Butera named on the cover, and you know that perfectly well. 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Mr. President, I would like the Court to take note of what I am going to say. There is a 
Butera, Jean Baptiste who was a sous-préfet and who was in Cameroon and who is today a refugee in Belgium. There is also a Dr. Butera, Jean Baptiste, chairman on the PECO party who is also currently in Belgium, a member of the RDR and of the FDU. 
I would like the Prosecutor to take note of this once and for all. There is Jean Baptiste Butera who is mentioned in this document, and that Jean Baptiste Butera is not I. Thank you. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So you, as the head of the Benelux section of the RDR, disagree, do you, with the conclusion in this document that what occurred in Rwanda was a genocide against the Tutsi? And you will see that written clearly in the conclusion at page 39 in the French, and page 36 in the English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And she meant the co-ordinator, because you corrected that. We have noted that. You were not the head, you said. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
That is correct, Mr. President. But I have underscored, this document belongs to its authors, and I did not participate in drafting this document and I cannot take any responsibility for what is written here and I have no opinion to express on this particular document. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I am asking for your opinion on the conclusion that no genocide against the Tutsi occurred in 1994. This is a document produced, you say, by members of your own party, if not by yourself? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Madam Prosecutor, I have expressed myself clearly on the question that you have put in relation to the genocide of Tutsi. My answer remains the same, and I do not need to change it. I told you right from the beginning that I lost members of my family. I lost Tutsi friends and brothers. And my position, my explanation has been very, very clear. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Isn't it right, Mr. Witness, that the reason you live in Belgium and not back home in Rwanda at the moment is because you are accused there of crimes committed in Kigali-rural? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
That is news to me. That is actually bad news. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you are considered by the Rwandans to be what they call a Category 1 suspect? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
I would like to repeat that. That is some news to me. And I would like to see the number of that list and see on what list my name is indicated. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
All right, Mr. Witness, perhaps you could be shown this document. It is the second document in the bundle I handed out and I apologise for the smallness of the type. 
Mr. Witness, this is a public document available on the Rwandan government website. It forms part of a number of lists of -- as we see on the first page, Category 1 genocide suspects. If you please turn to the penultimate page, four names from the bottom, do you not see Butera, Jean Baptiste, three columns to the right: "Director, president of the PECO party, medical doctor, director of the national AIDS control program, PNLS."
Now, surely you agree that's you? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Butera, Jean Baptiste, president of the PECO party. I think that concerned me. But when a government is established and I am addressing -- when a government leaves power, a document like this one, people don't know my parents, people don't know where I live. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slow down, Mr. Witness. 
Yes, please, continue. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
I was saying when a government which is worthy of the name and has legal experts, legal officers, comes up with a list which accuses somebody, and the names of the parents of the person are not indicated nor the place where the person is born or where that person is living, no case number, Madam Prosecutor, I am surprised that you are endorsing such a document. 
But what I would like to add is that you will see the number here is 1,144. I have already seen this document several times. There is Butera, Jean Bosco and there is Butera. I don't know who else. 
It is unfortunate, but I know that I do not have any case concerned by this list. So I would like to ask the Court to avoid considering this document as an official one because it is something that you could go to the market and find on any piece of paper. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness, I have no further questions for you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
Any re-examination? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, on the last question that was asked by the Prosecutor.
##
$RE-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, were you prosecuted in Rwanda? Are you aware of any legal action that was taken against you in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
Never. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, to conclude on that: Were the object of any legal action for any events that were committed between the 5th April and the 31st December in another country other than Rwanda? 
@WITNESS BUTERA: 
In another country other than Rwanda I was targeted by the media on the grounds of information found in documents that were produced by my detractors, detractors that I will not name here. These are the people who took part in the preparation of this list. Some media broadcast this wrong information that was manipulated and I even had to wait for seven years to have my refugee status granted because of all this. 
Lucky for me, in democratic countries there are services that work or function and that do not come up with papers like this, especially when we are talking about a government that comes up with documents like this one and have them printed in official documents. In the country where I live, I took legal action, I sued against the person who was -- who came up with this information. Not against the person who produced this information, but against the newspaper who published this false information. 
And, Madam Prosecutor, I could tell you that now I have a case pending at the court of appeal against the newspaper that tarnished my name and you know that when the name of a medical doctor is tarnished that hurts. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What did the court of first instance come to? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
The journalist and myself, the court said that we had shared responsibility. I was considered a politician, but they said my name could be tarnished without serious damage. So I went to the court of appeal. So the person who was behind that information who had manipulated the media took legal action as a civil party. But his case was not considered in 1996. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when did you leave Rwanda? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
I left Rwanda -- I left to Kigali, I went to Gitarama; I went to Kibuye. And as I said, Mr. President, even us and everyone else chose itineraries that we considered less dangerous. And from Kibuye, I went to Gisenyi, from there I went to the Congo, and from there, from the Congo, I went to the place where I currently live. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was when, not your itinerary. Can you please answer that question? 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
I left Rwanda on the 17th July 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No further question, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Nothing to be tendered? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. President, yes, there are four documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Will we start with this list of documents which you first referred to? 
This document about collaboration between parties, K0089892, will then have which exhibit number, Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 97. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 97 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:

MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 98.
$(Exhibit No. P. 98 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then the document about the United Nations Security Council? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 99. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
There is an English and French, perhaps it should be A and B. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Coming to that, so, Mr. Matemanga, you make note of that as always. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 99A and P. 99B admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then finally the list of Category 1 genocide suspects, Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 100. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 100 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
This marks the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness. We would like to thank you for having come a long way to the Tribunal to testify and we wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Thank you very much, Mr. President. Could I ask you a favour, Mr. President? I would like to greet the Accused. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is no objection against that, and the witness protection unit will make sure you can do that during a break or at some other suitable moment. 
@WITNESS BUTERA:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Perhaps we could have our 11 o'clock break right away and then the necessary arrangements can be made to start with the next witness after the little break. Would that be a good way to proceed? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is fine with me, Mr. President. I think he's ready. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we received an email from the Defence team indicating the correct pseudonym of the next witness. Could you just place that on record, please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there's been a change again. So the next witness will be UT, Witness UT. 
There was a problem bringing the witness that had to be here. He did not receive his air ticket in time so we informed the Prosecution. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Uniform, tango. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, the Court is adjourned for about 20 minutes.

Thank you. 
Defence, please. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we would like to have the testimony of this witness taken in closed session, in view of the danger to which he may be exposed through this testimony and also considering the names of persons he will be mentioning in the course of his testimony. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it, then, your submission that, in view of the position this witness held in April 1994, it will be very difficult for you to conduct your examination-in-chief without, by necessity, revealing his identity? Is that the submission? 
@MR. CANTIER:
$(Microphone not activated)...yes, Mr. President, that is absolutely correct. He held a position, and he went on various missions that would lead to his being identified almost immediately. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No problems with that, Prosecution? 
MS. MELLUISH:
No, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. We will grant the request, and we will, then, therefore, unfortunately, ask those in the public gallery to leave us. 
Thank you.

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a document, a personal information sheet for this witness? What is his pseudonym, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see. This is Witness BDC. 
I see that you have signed a document, that it has not yet been photocopied. Mr. Witness, you have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the witness told me that he had some additions to make to the document, which he had already signed. I therefore think that it, perhaps, may be better to put the question to him regarding that document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I will do that, as always, but only after we have sworn him in. 
$(Declaration made by Witness BDC in French) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have your identification sheet in front of us. Is that a correct and complete correction of the relevant information? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Right up to the small addition which relates to my occupation, my occupation up to the 6th of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, yes. Now, your occupation up to the 6th of April, could your correction -- we are now in open session -- disclose your identity or is it unproblematic if you make this correction in open court? 
@WITNESS BDC:
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I asked the question alternatively in English, but realise that in French it was interpreted in the alternative that you think that it may reveal your identity. Why don't you simply make the necessary changes on the document, as you like it, and then we get it back to you? Then we do not have to do this orally and there is to need to close the proceedings. 
And with these additions can we conclude that the information in this document is correct?

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning Witness.
@WITNESS BDC: 
Good morning, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, the first question the Defence will put to you is the following, that is, as part of our examination-in-chief: In what circumstances in April 1994 did you hear of the crash of the plane in which President Habyarimana of Rwanda was found - or, was? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Counsel, I lived on a hill that was opposite the Kanombe international airport. I lived in Kicukiro. In terms of distance, the distance was about five kilometres on a straight line. The missile shots that hit President Habyarimana's plane, I saw them. I saw them live. I saw them with my own eyes from where I lived in Kicukiro. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, did you have any particular reaction following that accident? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, I was working on a document that -- I was torn between that document and watching a football match which was being shown on the television at that time. I did not have a personal reaction, apart from being afraid because the missile shot was not identified as at that time. It was later on in the evening that gendarmes brought two - rather, three persons in my house and I felt that the problem must have been a very serious problem. Therefore, we started thinking of all that was -- or all that may have happened. Much later in the evening, we were informed of what happened over the national radio. Therefore, it was a whole night that followed, a night during which we asked ourselves many questions. We asked ourselves questions personally. And the entire family was affected by widespread fear. In my family, and around the place where we lived in Kicukiro, everybody was affected by that general fear. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. And in the days that followed, did you continue carrying out the normal duties which you carried out at that time? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
It was a Wednesday. Carrying out my normal duties must have been the following day, that is, going to work, but it wasn't possible to go to work. There was a general blockade, and there was also the fact that the national radio advised the entire population - or, advised everyone to stay home rather than go out because that could be the cause of insecurity or that could expose their lives to danger. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How many days did you stay home? And during the events, did you stay home during that period, that is, from April to July 1994? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, there is the following fact. Because of the special nature of my family, my family is a mixed family, ************************************* so between the 6th and the 10th, be it at the international level or national level, there were messages addressed **************************************, which at any time told them that they had to be evacuated. So I stayed until the 10th with my wife and children, and I prepared for their evacuation, *****************************, as I just said. In fact, I was tempted to be among those to be evacuated by the French forces -- Italian forces as well, who in fact were picking up expatriates from every neighbourhood. 
But I decided to stay behind, because well before that tragedy in my capacity as *********************** at a higher level, that is, ************************************************ of the Red Cross society, I was a ********************************************************************* the Red Cross committee, which at that time was developing all sorts of strategies to intervene in the event of catastrophe. So I felt it a duty not to leave the country at a moment when one of the most -- tragedies that we had not foreseen was taking place. I had problems explaining to my wife and the entire family that I was staying behind in order to make myself available to the humanitarian action of the Red Cross movement, the Red Cross movement of which I have been a member since I was a young man. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, so you stayed. How did you go about serving that movement, the Red Cross movement, which you say you were a member of since you were a youth? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
The Kicukiro neighbourhood straddled a front line opened by the RPF rebels. The rebels had taken over the entire area, particularly the strategic areas. It happens that Kicukiro is halfway between the CND -- I think CND is already an acronym known here -- and Mount Rebero. It is at the highest and most strategic point. I am speaking in military terms here. I think the rebels intended to occupy that very strategic point. There were people going forth and backwards, that is, the rebels were moving forth and backward and that prevented me from reaching the headquarters of the Red Cross. As a matter of fact, I was unable to move until the 14th, I believe, and thereafter I was able to reach the Red Cross headquarters on the 15th of April. That is when I effectively started my work as head of Red Cross operations in Kigali town. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, can you tell the Court who you were cooperating with as a senior official in the Red Cross movement at that time? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I would right away explain that when there is war, a conflict of that nature, the International Red Cross, which comprises international Red Cross societies, the federation of these national societies, that is the federal organ, and you also have the International Committee of the Red Cross. It is the International Committee of the Red Cross which leads operations in all situations of armed conflict. This means that this modus operandi also applied to Rwanda. Therefore we placed ourselves under the orders of the delegate of the International Red Cross Committee, and that delegate was Mr. Philippe Gaillard. It is with him as well as with a team of expatriates -- expatriates in his team, that we carried out Red Cross relief operations.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, the name of Philippe Gaillard does not seem to appear on our additional list. Perhaps I will request the witness to spell that name for the benefit of the Chamber. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Philippe, I believe that is no problem. Gaillard is spelt as follows, G-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what are the first actions that the Red Cross undertook and carried out in Kigali town at that time, that is, during the period that followed the crash of the presidential plane? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Well, the situation was very difficult for everyone up to the time when the government was formed. I believe the government was formed on the 9th. So there were two days of emptiness or an institutional void. The Red Cross always operates as an auxiliary of public authorities. Now, there was no public authority under whom we could serve as auxiliary, therefore, this was a problem. The institutional void was a serious problem. 
When the government was formed -- I must specify here that I was in permanent contact with the headquarters. We had a radio communications system that was very well organised, just like you have in the army. In fact, the Red Cross is referred to as the third army. So being a member of that third army, so to speak, I was well equipped with communication radios. So we were in constant communication. 
I believe it was around the 10th that -- or perhaps the 9th when the government was just formed, that the Red Cross really started to be effective. I believe that on the 10th of April, Mr. Gaillard launched or mooted the idea of a meeting, which meeting had to determine a number of priorities, including the priority regarding the wounded. The wounded were taken in a disorderly fashion to the various hospital centres. But we also had to make decisions regarding a catastrophic situation where already there were many people who had died, people who had died here and there at the various neighbourhoods of Kigali. So it was necessary to act very fast. 
Mr. Gaillard informed the minister of public health of this danger. The minister, I believe with his colleague of the ministry of public works, convened a meeting. That meeting I believe took place around the 11th or the 12th -- I believe the 11th. So these are the specific acts which marked the beginning of our operations. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must speak more slowly. Will you do that? Thank you. Everything has to be interpreted and transcribed, and we need some more time, so please slow down. Here comes the next question. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Thank you, Mr. President. I take due note of that. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you complete your answer to the question I put to you, which question you were answering? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Well, I mentioned the three humanitarian actions that were carried out on the 10th and the 11th. They included the initiative to mobilise the ministers of public health and public works. This initiative was taken by Gaillard. Then there was a meeting, a summit meeting that had to discuss, in the main, matters related to humanitarian activities. The meeting took place on the 11th. So I was saying that with these two actions, we marked the beginning of our humanitarian operations. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, since you are a specialist of humanitarian activities, perhaps the Chamber would like to know why at that time you thought it was urgent to address the issue of the number of deaths in Kigali town? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, that was a very important issue. In fact, it is obviously an important issue. In all international resolutions, for example, the Bamako resolution or the Alma Ata resolution, these are resolutions that underscore the importance of all that is related to primary health care, and secondary health care, or public health care. These are matters that received the same priority. It is as if there is a motor accident and that those carrying the stretchers are reanimating the victims, and those carrying the stretchers sort of identify the area where the accident has taken place. These are activities that must take place concurrently. Because if you do not do any one of them, there is the risk of causing more death amongst the people. Therefore, the public health component and the relief component, providing relief to the wounded, are two components of humanitarian activities that must be carried out concurrently. So we give them the same importance. So for someone in the field this is obvious. It was therefore very urgent to address the public health issue. Because if we did not do that there was danger of an epidemic which could break out and that epidemic could be more serious than perhaps the number of wounded caused by the militia here and there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, I would nevertheless like to emphasise this point and focus your attention to the specific case of Kigali town. Which are the factors, in your opinion, which at that time made the possibility of an epidemic real? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
In some neighbourhoods of Kigali town basic facilities, electricity, for example, water, were no longer available. That was one point. On the other hand, we are here in the month of April. In April - or, April is a period when it is -- a period characterised by hot as well as cold days. These are the typical equatorial climatic conditions and they accelerate -- those conditions accelerate the decomposition of corpses, and an accelerated decomposition of corpses would mean that there is a possibility of water sources being contaminated, water sources that provide water to the population. I do not think it is necessary for me to explain further to prove that the danger of an epidemic was clear. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. From an answer you gave me, Witness, you are saying that the initiatives to sensitise the authorities to these matters was taken by Mr. Gaillard on the 10th. Is that correct? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's a very leading question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I am just reminding him of an answer which he had already given me. I do not know how that becomes a leading question because he had already said that Mr. Gaillard had sensitised the public authorities, so I am simply reminding him of an answer that he had already given. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the borderline sometimes between leading questions and recapitulating previous evidence can be blurred; you are right. But a good line of conduct in such a grey zone is simply to avoid it, then we will avoid any discussion about it. So it's always smart to choose caution instead of recapitulation, if it can be done without too much time. So here comes the next question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, where and in whose presence did the meeting of the 11th take place, the meeting that you mentioned?
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, with the greatest of respect, the witness has indicated he didn't begin his work with the Red Cross until the 15th. I wonder how the witness can give useful evidence to the Trial Chamber on a meeting which he was not present at? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you have any information about this, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, I said that I was constantly communicating with the high command of our army, that is the Red Cross. So I had internal information through the radio on the one hand. On the other hand, when I arrived on the 15th at the headquarters, I was immediately absorbed in what was referred to as the general staff of the Red Cross. So there was a briefing on all that had happened. I was not physically in the meeting, but I have an idea of all that had transpired from the 10th to the 15th when I arrived at the Red Cross headquarters. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, can the witness now answer my question? I wanted him to inform the Chamber of the circumstances in which the meeting of the 11th took place and those who attended that meeting. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you given information about the participants at that meeting when you heard of this meeting later, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, Mr. Gaillard was there. The representative of the ministry of public health was there, as well as the representative of the minister of public health. You had over 50 people -- between 50 and 80 people in that meeting. Of course, there was also the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture because it was in the conference room of the préfecture of Kigali-ville that the meeting took place. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
From the English translation we heard that the representative of the ministry of public health was there as well as the representative of the minister of public health. That's what you said. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Public works, we are sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have clarified it. In the French version you said "ministère travaux publics" the second time. So you referred to two different ministries; isn't that so? 
@WITNESS BDC:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, can you, therefore, tell the Court, since you have information on the said meeting, what was discussed during the meeting? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Well, I remembered what concerned us, that is, humanitarian issues. It was important for us to ensure that those who were wounded were transported under safe conditions. It was also urgent to bury the corpses that were scattered here and there in the various neighbourhoods of Kigali. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for those clarifications, Witness. And what were the practical activities, from what you know, actions that were carried out with respect to burying the corpses? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Concretely speaking, Counsel, the two ministries and the préfecture of Kigali town, with regard to the burying of the corpses, presented logistical difficulties that they faced -- logistical difficulties in burying the bodies. What I mean is difficulties related to fuel. The préfecture of Kigali-ville did not have the necessary fuel. The ministry of public works had vehicles, but did not have fuel either. And that is where the International Red Cross Committee made available to that operation fuel. So we supported the picking up of the bodies by distributing - or, making fuel available. By the time I arrived on the 15th, the burying of the bodies continued with the logistical support of the International Red Cross Committee. We even utilised, quote, unquote, this transportation aspect: Policemen and all the drivers who were transporting the bodies, were neutralised, quote, unquote. In other words, what we mean by this is that none of them was armed. The transportation of the bodies was carried out by people who were not armed; and the transportation vehicles bore the Red Cross flag - or, they carried the Red Cross flag. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Now, Witness, can you be more explicit, more clear on the identity of the person who was préfet of Kigali-ville at that time, if you know him? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes. I know Tharcisse Renzaho. I had known them -- him for a long time. I believe I knew him since 1986 when he came to do his higher studies or when he came to do his studies -- military studies in Germany. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) So he is someone that I know very well. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you very much, Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen. Is there a risk this last answer could reveal the identity of the witness? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Probably, Mr. President. But I do not want to request brief closed sessions. I think I have agreed with the witness that he could take some risks when providing information to the Trial Chamber on what he knows about the events of April. But if you want to put this section under seal; I think I will agree with you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will delete the sentence starting with "At that time, I was also completing my studies..." until the penultimate sentence concluding with "without difficulties". This will be placed under seal, the last sentence will remain in the open session. 
Mr. Witness, when there is a risk that answers may reveal your identity kindly exercise caution and don't be too specific. If necessary, we'll have to go into closed session when we come to those issues, or write it on a piece of paper. 
Next question, please. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Mr. President, I told counsel that I needed my own personal protection here, and I think the Tribunal granted that. But I know that any sentence that that I mix up here identifies me. I was involved with those operations at the Red Cross. I told Counsel Nekuie that what I needed here was my personal security. With regard to the truth, as regards knowing who I am, I have no problem with that, if my identity is revealed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you are now testifying under pseudonym and when you are doing that the Tribunal has according to the Statute and the Rules a responsibility to look after your protection. Are you saying that you want to testify under your own name? 
@WITNESS BDC:
That is a technical aspect that I did not understand, but I would insist, and I would like to say that I am not afraid that anybody should know who I am. I was only afraid for my personal security. The rest is not important for me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will continue to refer to you by pseudonym. And the questioning continues. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, talking about the support granted by the Red Cross regarding these operations, you indicated that the Red Cross made available to the administration fuel. How do you explain this fact that the administration is running out of fuel and that it is the Red Cross that is supplying fuel for its operations? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
My functions that I described on the identification sheet, places me in a position to tell the truth, the government had run out of fuel because, effectively, the strategic deposits of fuel which we had, the company called Petrorwanda, which had only three depots for fuel, three strategic depots. And one of the depots in the country was already under the control of the rebels, and access to these strategic depots was impossible. I know that the Red Cross would not freely give fuel. This was a situation of emergency. But the truth is that the government was cut off from its major source of supply for fuel and there was no fuel in Kigali, the Gatsata - Gatsata is spelt G-A-T-S-A-T-A -- and this was the biggest depot in the country, the Gatsata depot. And on April 10th, this was already under the rebel occupation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, for that clarification, Witness. Witness, still regarding this issue of the bodies that were strewn all over the town of Kigali, did the Red Cross know how these people had been killed? Were they killed by conventional weapons or by blank (sic) weapons? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
They were killed by both types of weapons, but basically by -- up to the 15th this was a time of military conflict and confrontation and most of the victims at that time were killed by military weapons. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In the witness's previous answer we have in English that on April 10th this depot was already under the rebel occupation. In view of what he said in French, I think we shall just add "the rebels of the RPF". That's what the witness said, just to avoid any ambiguity. 
Now, the next question, please. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you not receive information at the time stating that the collection of bodies was a manoeuvre - or, rather, an activity initiated by Mr. Renzaho with the intention of concealing the results of his activity? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No. I do not say. It was common knowledge. This meeting that I talked about was announced over radio. Everybody who was listening to the radio knew that there was a meeting that was to take place at the préfecture in Kigali convened by the two ministers that I talked about. And this was a meeting organised by the government. And there was no direct relationship with Mr. Renzaho, but for the fact that it was held in his préfecture, so I do not see my relationship between Renzaho -- any direct relationship between Renzaho and this mobilisation -- this important humanitarian activity that was mobilised. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this meeting, was it convened by the two ministers or by the two ministries? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Mr. President, I cannot recall whether it was the ministers convening or the ministries convening. I cannot recall, but it was constantly announced on radio that the minister -- ministry of public works and the ministry of public health were convening its workers for a meeting at the Kigali préfecture. Whether we are talking about the ministry or a minister, for the people in Kigali -- for the people of Kigali that meant the minister, because he was the only one -- or they were the only ones who could take that initiative. Even those who signed such a communiqué signed in -- signed for the minister. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
That's the question I wanted to ask. Who signed the communiqué that was being broadcast over the radio? Who signed it? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Your Honour, I did not see the signature for the communiqué, but I heard the radio announcement. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
But the radio announcement, it said who was convening the people to this meeting, because somebody has to invite people to a meeting. Who convened them to this meeting? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Your Honour, I believe that it might have been a bad translation. I said that I do not remember whether the term used was the ministry of public works or the minister of public works convening the meeting. And I don't remember whether it was the minister of public health or the ministry of public health convening. So I can't tell you whether it was the minister or the ministry. I do not have a proper recollection of that fact. But as I have said, in the minds -- in the normal minds of the people, people understood the minister and I presume that the person who had signed that document had done it in -- on behalf of the minister. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But it was the ministry's -- either through the minister or someone acting on behalf of the minister, not anyone else. Is that the evidence? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, I even remember that on the 10th of April -- the meeting of the 11th was prepared on the 10th. Mr. Gaillard, if I remember well, had seen Dr. Casimir, the minister of health that he knew very well, on the 10th or 11th, once his appointment as minister was confirmed. So this meeting was not convened by chance; it was not spontaneously convened. It was prepared, and the agenda for this meeting had been prepared before between the various ministries concerned, and Gaillard was part of those who had initiated the meeting. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, to conclude on that point and move on to others, could you tell the Trial Chamber, if you remember, the places where these bodies that were picked up with the help of the administration were buried in the town of Kigali? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Towards the end of April, I think, at that time already, the cemeteries in Kigali were still accessible. I think that is where they were buried. I did not accompany any truck that was transporting the bodies, so I cannot give you any specific location. All I can say is, generally speaking, towards the end of April the four or five cemeteries of the Kigali préfecture were still accessible. So that is where the bodies were buried. It is towards the end of April that we were obliged to improvise and bury people in various corners. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And this improvisation that you are talking about was this still the initiative of the Red Cross or an initiative taken by other people? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, the Red Cross could not take any initiative in designating sites for burial. This was the responsibility of the public authorities. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And was this done in collaboration with the Red Cross? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, not at all. The operation became somewhat independent. Even regarding the respect of the basic conventions we had to be neutral. This operation became independent, there was no problem. The Red Cross was no longer concerned with it because it had become a traditional activity -- the operation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. How did the Red Cross organise itself to carry out its other humanitarian activities? You talked of the wounded. Were there other operations that the Red Cross was carrying out during that period? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, there were injured people who had to be moved, on the one hand. Particularly there was also the accommodation of people who were being sought after. There was also the distribution of food sites -- food supplies in the various sites where displaced persons were. For example, the Sainte Famille church, the Saint Paul site; almost all embassies, and particularly the German embassy and the embassy of the Congo; the churches, generally speaking, including the Baptist church; schools, for example, the college Notre Dame de Cîteaux, and so on. 
For the population, these were areas that provided -- could provide some security for them and these were the areas that the people went to. But they went there only with the clothes they had on him -- that they had on them, and these were impoverished people. So particularly for the most vulnerable groups, like the children, we had to provide them with water and milk and look for firewood; in short, food supplies. And we also had to provide drugs because people were becoming ill because of the cold weather at the time. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. When you talk about the population that was moving towards these sites, who are you talking about exactly? Are you talking about the entire population of Kigali or are you talking about a specific group? Could you be more clear on that, Witness? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Initially, the internally displaced people who rushed into the country -- into the town. The Chamber knows that on the 6th of April we had more than 900,000 displaced people and one of the displaced -- one of the biggest camps that received these people was at the entrance of Kigali, Nyacyonga. It is spelt N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A, Nyacyonga. And these people had been pushed into the front line because the rebels were coming. 
On the 13th, the RPF forces had left the general command or general staff for Kigali. These rebels were meeting, and the people who were caught up between these rebels ran away from -- Kigali was full of people who were rushing in, and you had bombs falling from all over. Sometimes there was a small area that could be exposed to the bombs and everybody felt that they were in danger. So everybody was running, even ministers were running. So everybody was looking for a place of refuge where they could find personal security. So, generally, without the need for me to characterise or describe the people, I would say that everybody in Kigali, all civilians, were the ones seeking refuge. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. But could you please help the Trial Chamber by indicating the ethnicity of the population? The people you have just described as being at the entrance of Kigali and, on the other hand, those who were already in Kigali who were seeking refuge, as you had just described. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I would like to tell the Trial Chamber that I have not indicated my own ethnic group. Personally, I am against this manner of describing Rwandan citizens. I am talking about Rwandan civilians.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is a very understandable question of principle or attitude of principle, Mr. Witness, but in 1994 you had an identity card, was there an H or a T on that card? 
@WITNESS BDC:
I requested for my identity card in Kigali, through my parents, they brought me my identity card. I had given them a picture, and they came back with an identity card with the letter H. But I remember -- and this is true, I swore here that I would speak the truth -- at that time my son was six and had just started primary school, so he had trouble for an entire week and was sent back home. He was dismissed from his primary school because I had refused to identify him in this manner. So my own son, at the age of six and seven, knew; and now my children know that they should not identify themselves using these three letters. And that is my principle. My son was dismissed, Mr. President, and that was a drama. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that very well, and I commend you for your attitude of principle. May I ask you, when it came to this group of refugees, you remember the question of Defence counsel, can you still assist him to get the information he seeks, which according to him is relevant in the case? Just answer the question, please. Your position is noted. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Mr. President, to be realistic regarding the Hutu and Twa or Tutsi ethnic groups, it is very difficult for one to identify the ethnicity of various individuals. All the people who were available to me, whom I trained, the people whom I prepared psychologically every evening, I emphasised the fact that they should not think of that. I do not know why I should be thinking of it now. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I understand you. I will not seek to embarrass you any further. 
Witness, when finally you took up your duties at the Red Cross headquarters, did you personally have the opportunity of taking care of those sites where those people were? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, I was - I immediately took care of the sites at the Congolese embassy. The situation there was very grave; nobody had thought of that site. So I took care of the site at the German embassy. Moreover, I had the keys to many German cooperation staff. I went everywhere where Germans had their residences, right up to the embassy where there was a concentration of people. I took care of the site very intensely. ************************* Saint Paul and Sainte Famille sites. I participated in arriving at a decision that the person appointed by the préfet, Mr. Simpunga, S-I-M-P-U-N-G-A, he was sous-préfet in charge of social affairs, he was someone who was very active. Moreover, he was ill at the time; he had just come from hospitalisation. He just came out of hospital. He was convalescing. That person, Simpunga, was very active in the distribution of food supplies. And, as I was saying, I was the ********************************************************** in his pickup for the distribution of the various sites where you had displaced persons. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When did he come out of hospital? Do you remember? 
@WITNESS BDC:
When I arrived on the 15th, I believe he had in the meantime -- well, he was convalescing, he was on crutches, but I am unable to specify the date when he came out of hospital. All I would say was that he was convalescing, he was on crutches. I believe he was still undergoing treatment when the 6th April tragedy happened. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When you arrived on the 15th, he was already in action performing many tasks, is that so? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, I would say yes, but he was on crutches.

@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, your intervention staff, did they include medical teams, or medical staff? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I did not understand your question, Counsel. Could you please repeat it? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I will rephrase it and make it clearer. Did you have medical intervention teams within the context of your operations on those sites? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, in our teams we had doctors, surgeons, medical staff of various specialisations. Indeed, we had medical teams in those sites. At the Kigali hospital centre, which I forgot to mention, we had a medical team. Then at the Sainte Famille site, we had -- we had decentralised a small health care team. We had a nurse, a male and female nurse who were in charge of the team. But, for the other sites, it was not necessary to immobilise -- or, to assign a dedicated member of the Red Cross, and to move to those other sites it was quite easy. Therefore it was not necessary to assign a permanent Red Cross staff there -- or, medical team. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How did you operate with regard to the wounded? In other words, what did you do with them? Did you have health facilities to receive them as well? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Initially, yes. The Kigali hospital centre is a very complete health facility. At the time referred to, and I believe right up to now, it is an advanced hospital. It was our referral hospital. But in Rugunga in Kiyovu, we created a rural hospital that -- it was specific to the International Red Cross Society. We had, in that area, a rural hospital where physicians and surgeons were working round the clock, 24 hours out of 24. And those medical teams, therefore, in our own hospital, that is, the rural hospital of the International Committee of the Red Cross, provided health care, as should be the case, to everyone. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Was it the Red Cross that led patients to the facilities you just described, or was it the préfectoral administration? What happened, in concrete terms, on the ground? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
The 3,000 or more wounded who were at the Kigali hospital centre -- yes, you had over 3,000 people at that hospital centre. The patients we had came from -- or, from various areas. Some came on their own initiative, some came on their own. Because public means of transport were not available, people transported relatives. In some cases, some patients were brought by private citizens in their own vehicles. But there were also patients that we brought ourselves. So, the bringing of patients to the health facilities was carried out in various forms and manners. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. How did you, personally, transport those who were in your centre? How did you organise that? Can you be more precise? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
There was a medical team, a Red Cross medical team, comprising those bearing stretchers -- or, stretcher bearers who were trained for that purpose. They know how to pick up patients, how to treat the patient on the way to a health facility, that is, between the place where the patient is picked up and the hospital or health facility. So these were teams of ambulance workers who transported patients in ambulances. Some of the patients would be lying down, depending on the state of their wounds. Others were seated, sometimes against all the usual rules and practices. 
I am, in particular, thinking of -- at some point in time, I believe on the 14th or 15th -- in any case, around those dates, 13, 14, or 15th, particularly around the 14th, as a result of the need to transport as many patients as possible because of the danger -- well, we had to balance between the danger they ran by being packed into the same vehicle or being left on the spot, because the militiamen were taking some patients away from us and executed them. This was on the 14th. So, well, depending on the conditions of the moment, we transported sometimes in a professional manner, but at other times we transported people in a chaotic manner, depending on the urgency of the situation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. When you talk of militias, who are you referring to? Can you explain the circumstances when they created such incidents? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
It is very difficult to define the militias. They were a group of people -- or, groups of people who had taken drugs and alcohol -- alcoholic beverages, who inspired fear. Their eyes were red as a result of the fact that they themselves did not sleep. They only kept themselves awake by taking drugs and narcotics, alcohol and so on. They were armed with all sorts of weapons, bladed weapons, automatic weapons, and what have you. Indeed, they were young people. Some were even bandits. And these also were the various -- well, these characteristics varied from roadblock to roadblock. Each roadblock had the kind of people available to them. The most aggressive -- some of them were very aggressive, and at other roadblocks it was easy to cross. So it is very difficult to give them a uniform description. But this was the broad image that they presented. 
Regarding their membership of political parties, contrary to what is alleged, they were not the militia of a given political party. They were desperate youth, desperate young people who found themselves together. So it was no longer possible to relate or assign them to a given political party. Moreover, in a meeting that we organised, we thought it necessary to invite all political parties, because we felt that the militias belonged to various political parties, and the idea was to have the political parties sensitise their young people. These parties included the PSD, the MRND in Kigali town, the PDI, that is the Islamic party. The Islamic party also had an active young wing. So these were a group of young people who were mobilised for the same purpose, namely, to ensure their personal security, and also ensure the security of the republic. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Remember the speed, Mr. Witness. And much of this is known to us. Could you try to be a bit briefer in your answers, please? 
The next question. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
A question on the last part of your answer. You said this way, young people who were mobilised for their own personal security, to ensure the security of the republic. Are you saying, to ensure the security of the republic, it was necessary to remove people from the Red Cross camp and hospitals; is that what you want the Chamber to believe? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Not at all, Your Honour. Moreover, we protested in the most vehement manner against this tragedy of 1994 during which patients were taken away from us. I do not at all justify the methods used by these young people to defend themselves and defend the republic. In any case, that is what they said. I do not -- do not approve of what they did. It was atrocious, it was traumatic. I would even say it was animalistic behaviour. It was the animalistic behaviour and a devilish behaviour that was set in motion. Therefore I do not at all approve of their conduct. On the contrary, I was always in various teams that protested against their conduct, and we sought to see that our relief operations were carried out successfully. But all I'm saying is that we had great difficulties with these drugged militias, these bandits, these criminals. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, for the guidance of the Chamber, can you remind us -- or, tell us the reasons why these militias targeted the patients who were in your ambulances? There must have been some specific reason for that conduct. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
There was generally mistrust according to which all that had organised attracted their mistrust. RTLM had already started broadcasting rumours to the effect that the Red Cross was transporting the enemy. This was broadcast over the -- over RTLM radio. There is also the fact that when our vehicles moved about in various neighbourhoods in order to pick up corpses or the wounded, these wounded were survivors. These wounded sometimes were people who were about to be exterminated. So if you failed to kill someone, and you see that person being evacuated, you would want to get hold of the person. 
Also, in view of the psychological state of mind that I talked about earlier on, according to those militia, we were viewed as people who sought to save those the militias had targeted for murder or extermination. We were therefore not liked under those conditions. And this would enable you to understand that, at the various points where we passed, there was some kind of complicity among the militia seeking to withdraw patients from our ambulances. So this would be easy to understand. And this is the context in which the situation and the danger should be understood. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, do you know whether those militias had any relationship whatsoever with the préfet of Kigali-ville, that is, Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I should be very candid on this point and say no. If I have to give various reasons, I may be lengthy -- that is, reasons on which my personal opinion is based. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Can you please -- can you please give the reasons, briefly? This will be a good idea for our understanding. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
First of all I visited Mr. Renzaho more than ten times in his office. I visited him from the 15th (sic) of July -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
-- or, rather, the 3rd (sic) of July when he left in the morning -- when he left -- or, 4th -- on the 4th of July when he left the préfecture of Kigali, I believe I met him more than four times. Everyone went there to meet him. I met him more than ten times, and personally I noticed that -- well, in answer to your question, that those militias could not come -- could not have come under his authority because apparently he himself was threatened by them. All his staff, including his sous-préfets, had been molested by the militias. There were attacks organised by the most dangerous militias, and those attacks had been organised in his préfecture, in his -- or, targeted his préfecture and his office. 
There were displaced persons -- this was something that I'd mentioned -- forgot to mention. There were displaced persons in the courtyard of the préfecture, displaced persons of all ethnic backgrounds. These displaced persons in Kigali town were themselves targets of the militia groups. Personally I know, because as I said I know him very well, I know from a discussion that I had with him that he had no news from his family. His wife in particular, he had no news about her. And the wife came from the two ethnic groups -- the two main ethnic groups of our country, and she had difficulties being evacuated to safe areas because she was threatened by those militias. I do not believe -- not only do I not believe, but I -- I do not think that he had any authority over these persons who threatened him directly, and also threatened his family. 
To be specific, once more, when our operations were -- came under serious threats around the end of April, we had to unblock the situation which constituted a humanitarian emergency. I was the delegate of the International Red Cross Society who went to see Mr. Renzaho to explain to him what he already knew, in fact, the security situation had become very grave. This was around the end of April. It was around the 22nd -- the 25th of April. During that time we decided to manage the movement -- or, monitor of our relief -- the movements of our relief workers. The situation was becoming unbearable, because we thought that we should not endanger the lives of our relief workers. And the préfet said, "Well, things are not moving. Can you help us so that the militia should allow us to pass?" The manner in which -- or, the manner in which this specific question was answered when we -- well, when we asked for assistance from him, he -- he thought that was impossible. 
So I personally took the initiative to go and see those militias in their headquarters. I knew where the militias had their headquarters. I went to see him at the Muhazi garage. Muhazi is spelt as follows: M-U-H-A-Z-I. This was in a building belonging to a technical school, in the south -- 500 metres to the south of the lycée Notre Dame de Cîteaux. There I met those militias. The leader of those militias, in particular their president, Kajuga, Robert -- Kajuga is spelt as follows: K-A-J-U-G-G-A -- K-A-J-U-G-A. His deputy was Rutengwa. Rutengwa is spelt as follows: R-U-T-E -- I take that all over again. R-U-T-E-N-G-W-A. Personally I negotiated for those militias to allow us past. The manner in which Renzaho reacted -- in fact, he told us he could not do anything because he told us he did not have any authority over them. And that confirmed to me that he did not have authority over them, neither at the roadblocks nor over their command, which I have just described. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Still too fast, still too lengthy. 
Now, Mr. Witness, let us backtrack a little bit. You started this extremely long answer by referring to some dates. We agree that you visited Mr. Renzaho more than ten times; isn't that so? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
These ten visits took place from when to when? And just the dates now. What was the commencement of this period? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
The first visit took place on the 15th of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, so that goes on record. The witness misspoke when he said July a couple of times previously. Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I would, nevertheless, like us to clarify that point. Mr. Renzaho was the préfet of Kigali-ville and had under his authority the police of Kigali-ville, or town. How do you explain that police was unable to have authority -- or, in any case, could not be used to -- or overcome the militia who were causing you problems? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
There were over 20 -- did you say there were over 20 policemen at Kigali préfecture? I don't think so. I do not even know the exact number of policemen who were available to the préfecture, but I do not think that I saw more than 30 policemen in the préfecture. So this number of policemen, in the face of a huge number of organised militia who were at various roadblocks, it was impossible for that number of policemen to overcome the militia. I -- I am sorry, but the militia were better armed than the police of the préfecture. The police had obsolete weapons. They were not even properly attired. They did not have proper clothes on. They could not -- they didn't weigh much against experienced and well-equipped militia. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. During the period in question, the fuel that you had placed at the disposal of the préfecture, did you ever hear that such fuel was distributed by Mr. Renzaho to the militias? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I do not remember hearing that Mr. Renzaho gave fuel to the militia. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You never heard, either, that Mr. Renzaho distributed food to the said militia groups? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
It is a reverse situation that would have happened, it is the militia that would have been giving food to Mr. Renzaho. The militia were people who had built up stockpiles of food at roadblocks. They called them "war food supplies". They would break into warehouses and get food. Even those of us who were neutral could not give them food -- well, thinking of Renzaho distributing food to the militia, no. I visited Renzaho in his place of refuge, and there you saw poverty, whereas the -- the militias had good mattresses, good beds, and so on. So I think the militia were in a better place to feed Renzaho. So my answer to your question is no. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. How, therefore, did you negotiate your situation with these militia whom you went to meet? What was the outcome of your negotiations? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Mr. Kajuga and Rutengwa signed a document, which document was authoritative. They gave -- issued us a safe conduit which we gave to our ambulance vehicles, and they could use that safe conduit to go past various roadblocks. So the two leaders, Kajuga and Rutengwa, had authority over their men, everywhere where the militias were. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. You talked about laissez-passers. Should we understand that these laissez-passers issued by the militia leaders had more authority than the laissez-passers issued by the préfet? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
The Red Cross would not even have thought of asking Mr. Renzaho to issue laissez-passers. He was the senior authority, I know that; I had taught in the military academy and I'm well informed of the terms of the Geneva Conventions which Rwanda had signed. It is clear that a humanitarian organisation like the Red Cross does not need laissez-passers for its humanitarian operation. So we would never have thought of asking Mr. Renzaho to issue us laissez-passers. According to the Geneva Conventions themselves, it is stipulated that humanitarian teams of the Red Cross should enjoy the support of public authorities in such circumstances. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, to obtain such a document from the militia leaders, was that in agreement with the Geneva Conventions you referred to? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I said that that was an exceptional measure. Normally we do not ask for laissez-passers or safe conduits for our relief operation teams, but on that occasion we had to breach that rule, or convention, in order to save human lives. And this was a priority issue. We therefore asked the militia groups to sign -- or, issue us a document that would be used as a safe conduit on roadblocks manned by Interahamwes. We did not foresee such a -- such a situation with respect to the government forces. That would have been unthinkable. We did not even foresee such a situation with respect to the rebels. The rebels did not need to give us such laissez-passers. We had to use such an exceptional measure -- or, remedy for the specific case of the militias. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for that answer, Witness. Witness, you talked about roadblocks. At that time, didn't you learn that it was Mr. Renzaho who was in charge of control at the roadblocks? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I believe I have challenged that theory in the answer that I gave. The President said with regard to that answer that I had been lengthy, but I gave all the details which, once more, lead me to answer no. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. And, on the side of the forces you describe as rebels, that's the RPF forces, did your team -- did your teams encounter any problems with these rebel forces with your humanitarian activities? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Several times. I think I can remember four -- four occasions. First of all, when the Kigali hospital centre was bombed, where we had an humanitarian annex. And one day after that -- I think it was in May or June, I do not remember the exact date. But when the Kigali hospital centre moved following the bombings because the medical staff felt that they could no longer provide health care, the hospital moved. And some of the sick people came to our hospital, our rural hospital in Rugunga. And, strangely enough, the rebels started bombing our hospital once again. That was the second occasion. Third occasion: The headquarters itself of the International Committee of the Red Cross was bombed. And I think one or two people died -- in any case, we had some people had died, and a few others were injured. And the fourth occasion was when transportation of humanitarian aid towards Kabgayi, where there were many displaced people, was again targeted on the road between Kigali and Gitarama. So, generally speaking, the fact that sometime in the middle of May the RPF forces had occupied almost half of the country. So the section between Kigali and Katumbu (phonetic) and Rusumbu (phonetic). So it was impossible to transport humanitarian aid, and it was not possible to negotiate exceptional measures for the transportation of humanitarian aid, so we had to use the Bujumbura-Kigali road. And this also made it difficult for us to carry out our operations, our humanitarian operations rapidly. That is all I recall. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the names that have been mentioned by the witness, Rugunga is 71 on the list. And Kabgayi is 72 -- 72. Kabgayi. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I would like to come back to the sites that were responsible for, namely, the Sainte Famille site. You said that you were responsible for that site personally. Am I correct? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, I supervised that site, but I had a permanent team there. That is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, as from what date, if you remember, was your permanent team set up there, and for how long did they stay there? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
As from mid-May, I believe, more concretely. As from the time that the RPF bombarded that site on the 1st of May, we had some 100 wounded and 15 dead. The most seriously injured were moved to our rural hospital, and those who were not so seriously wounded were treated on the spot. And as from that time, the health team, the medical team was set up permanently there. And I would also like to say that, regarding the injured that we received at the hospital, the Red Cross rural hospital, once we looked at the capacity we would bring them there. And that is the -- that is what explains the need -- the obligation for us to go there on the spot to check on their health situation and to check up on them and follow them up. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Merci -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was, when was it set up and for how long did they stay there? Can we get an answer to the second part? With other words, from mid-May until when? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. Thank you. Up till the end -- I think up till the 4th of July. Even further -- further on. The centre was not evacuated on the 4th of July. I remained in Kigali from July to September, which is when I left Rwanda. The centre continued existing even though its official -- or, representative, Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, was not there. M-U-N-Y-E-S-H-Y-A-K-A. He left on the 5th of July with the people -- most of the people who were leaving the capital. But the centre continued existing and the relief workers even remained there. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, your relief workers who were there on a permanent basis, did they give you daily reports on the cases that they were working on? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, they were obliged to give me reports; that is part of the modus operandi. They had a book and every day they wrote down what happened, and that was part of medical practice in the Red Cross. And as I said, we were run like combatants, we had a general command, we were called a third general staff, and we organised ourselves in the same manner as the army. So they made reports. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
During the -- this period, were you able to see any reports on cases of sexual assault perpetrated in the sites? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I have no recollection of such specific cases. I heard about -- was it because the team was led by woman -- a woman who might have had trouble expressing or explaining that? But otherwise I don't think I was aware of any cases of rape or sexual assault. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you -- Mr. Witness, did your team ever tell you that Mr. Renzaho often visited the site, particularly to meet the official whose name you have just mentioned? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Mr. Munyeshyaka did not even know the préfet, Préfet Renzaho. He was a very discreet father. And I know -- knew him, first of all, through the media long before the 6th of April because he had refused to officiate for a son of a conseiller near his parish, Sainte Famille parish. I even remember that. This case led to a lot of controversy, or noise. But when I met him for the first time, it was somebody who was not known by the authorities. And to say that Mr. Renzaho went there, 80 per cent of the time he was in his office. 
The only time I remember when I was with him, it was I think middle -- in the middle of May or June, I'm not sure when. We accompanied a delegation, we accompanied a joint multiparty delegation composed of the UNAMIR, the ICRC, the préfecture of Kigali-ville, and he was a member of this official delegation. I think it was on the 16th -- the 15th or the 16th of June, and that is the only time that I personally saw him there. Now, to say that -- now, whether he went there without my knowledge, I have no idea. But my team never told me that Mr. Renzaho came to the site. 
I can even sketch the office of Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, because I went there very often. It was a presbytery, and I wonder how two people could have seen Mr. Renzaho there and not informed me. But, generally speaking, the person who was constantly on the move, on a daily basis, maybe five times to a day, was a sous-préfet, Simpunga. So I would respond in the negative. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, should I understand that your permanent teams working on the spot never reported to you that Mr. Renzaho carried out -- or, supervised any massacres? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, he did not tell me that. He never reported that fact to me. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And did you in any way learn, between April and July, that that ever happened? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, I never heard that. I did not understand the question. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you learn in any way -- or, through other sources, I mean, that Mr. Renzaho led expeditions at the helm of militiamen, at sites where people were being massacred? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, I never heard anything like that. I'm learning that -- I'm hearing that for the first time in this Honourable Chamber. I'm hearing that for the very first time. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
The visit that you mentioned in the company of Mr. Renzaho, and which you situate sometime in mid-June, if you remember, could you please say which official of UNAMIR was at the head of that delegation? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
It was General Anyidoho. I would have trouble spelling that name -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says witness. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Aniyidoho, I believe. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's number 38 on the Defence spelling list. 
Shall we continue? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
And he had taken the initiative because the major discussion at the time was the setting up of safe humanitarian zones. And that was the purpose of the visit. And that was the problem -- that was the problem that could only be resolved with guarantees from the UNAMIR -- from UNAMIR, that is, the setting up of safe humanitarian zones. So Sainte Famille had to be made a safe humanitarian zone. But since we were overcrowded, we also had to think of other centres that could be set up, and that was the purpose of the visit. We were part of the delegation so that we could talk about ensuring safety of the population to ensure that, during transportation, there would be no problems, and people would be placed in a safe humanitarian zone. So that is how he was heading the delegation, Aniyidoho. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And what do you think Mr. Renzaho's role was in that delegation? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
In his capacity as préfet of Kigali-ville, he was the public authority on the spot. Decisions involving displacements of the population could only be taken in the presence of people of his rank, like the préfet. Even before, in the -- early May in Kagugu, I believe -- this is Sopecya, the Sopecya petrol station -- S-O-P-E-C-Y-A. At this petrol station, Sopecya, UNAMIR definitely had some good intentions and had taken some civilians from the Hôtel des Mille Collines, and I'm sure their good intention was to move them to safer camps on the other side of the front line in the RPF zone, where there was an unfortunate event. 
People who were piled in trucks were shot at by militiamen who were shouting at them that they were stealing their people and that they had no permission to move people. And they said that UNAMIR was doing a task that was not their responsibility, but that of the government. So UNAMIR could no longer attempt any such operations without the presence of a public authority. And Mr. Renzaho was representing the public authority -- the public authorities in that delegation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And, Witness, did you know whether that safe humanitarian zone was ever established? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, it was no longer possible, because I think on the 7th (sic), in the evening, the population was attacked by a well-organised commando force that -- that assigned some commandos and created a corridor for the evacuation of people. And once again we picked up so many people who had been injured because of that commando operation. And the -- subsequently, this idea of a safe humanitarian zone died because it was no longer possible to talk about it. And the interim government no longer believed that it was possible to set up a safe humanitarian zone. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, sir. When did you pick up these wounded people that you've talked about following this attack? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Very early in the morning of the 17th. Our teams went on the spot and they brought back several wounded people to our rural hospital. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you remember how many times it took your team to carry out this operation, that is, picking up the wounded people and bringing them to the site? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, I have no idea of how much time it took. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
If I said -- or, if I suggested that they were there -- that it took them all morning, what would you say to that? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I would say, Your Honour, it's a very leading question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I will rephrase, Mr. President. I renounce the question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let me ask you another question still regarding the dates when your teams went out to pick up the wounded people. Would you know whether, on that day, Mr. Renzaho went to the site in question? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, I have no idea whether Mr. Renzaho went there on the 17th. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, you talked about meetings that you held regularly with Mr. Renzaho. Was it the same for Mr. Philippe Gaillard with whom you collaborated? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
It was not -- the telephone system in town was working and we divided our roles. Mr. Gaillard was the head, but it was also his duty to contact the rebels, and he assigned me the task of contacting the authorities on the government side. Otherwise, on several occasions, there was an official from the government who came, and Mr. Renzaho also came to our place, and we went to -- with Mr. Gaillard to his office. So he was also on -- on a regular basis in contact with him. It was our role to continue being in touch with the authorities who could, in some way, facilitate our humanitarian activity. That was the duty of the officials of the Red Cross at that time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are close to our 11 o'clock break now. How much is left of the examination-in-chief, approximately? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:

About 45 minutes or one hour, Mr. President. Or less. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. And it may be less, in particular, Mr. Witness, if you try to answer briefly. Because that's the technique in a courtroom. You can very often just say yes and no, and then if counsel needs more information, he will ask a follow-up question. So please think about this while we have this 11 o'clock break.

Witness, we were discussing the meeting between Mr. Gaillard and Mr. Renzaho. I believe this was the point we were on when we went on break. And you confirmed that there were often meetings between the two people. Can you now tell the Court whether, in the context of your high command, Mr. Gaillard thought that cooperation with Mr. Renzaho was good or not? Did he happen to give his opinion on that cooperation? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, he thought the cooperation was very good. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Do you remember a complaint that the Red Cross made around the end of April, a complaint that lodged with UNAMIR, and that complaint -- complaint was against the militia and also the Rwandan government?

Yes, a complaint launched with the Rwandan government, that is possible. But a complaint launched with UNAMIR, that would be unthinkable. We could not contact -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, Mr. President, the witness is not clear and it is too fast. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes, yes. Now, you are now briefer, but still too fast. Please begin your answer again. Will you do that, please? 
@WITNESS BDC:
(No interpretation)
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
We are sorry, Mr. President, he begins the sentence in the middle. We can't make head or tail of it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes, yes. Mr. Witness, when you start your answer from the beginning, then you must kindly also start from the beginning of the first sentence. So please start now with a complete first sentence so that we can get it in context. You have the floor. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I do not even remember how the sentence was phrased. If I was helped -- if I was enabled to continue, then I would do so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Counsel will now ask the question again, and then you will answer again. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, my question was to know whether you remember a complaint that the Red Cross lodged with UNAMIR against the militia or against the government around the end of April 1994. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
My answer is categorically no. The operational measures or modalities of the Red Cross are such that that possibility does not exist. It is even unthinkable. Because we complain -- we complain about the operational methods of the two belligerents, and in that case we would contact the belligerents themselves, that is, either the Rwandan government forces or the rebel forces. It would be unthinkable that -- to complain through a third party. That is how the ICRC operates. I think the case you mentioned is even unthinkable, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, in the Red Cross operations of that time, was it the practice for you to issue communiqués regarding your operations? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, we usually issued communiqués. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
With the permission of the Chamber, Witness, I am going to show you a document which you would please identify.

Perhaps I will spare the Chamber of a reading of this document, which would be -- which reading would be fastidious. But, Witness, at the top of the page, the page dated 21 April 1994 -- have you seen that page?

@WITNESS BDC: 
I've never yet read the content of the communiqué. But as of this date, that's the 21st of April -- why the 21st? Even before the 21st the urgency relating to humanitarian issues was already there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes. Please slow down and observe the pause between question and answer, and answer and question. 
Now the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, please move on to the next tab, that is, tab 7. There you will find another document, and please kindly identify that document as well. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
It is a photocopy, but it has the insignia of the ICRC, and I can assure you that this photocopy reflects the original. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, it is indeed a document that comes from Geneva, like the first document we just saw; is that right? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And you would note that it is dated 25 May 1994. Does that reflect the frequency of the communiqués that the Red Cross movement published regarding the emergency situation that existed? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
As far as we were concerned, we had a permanent -- we had permanent contact -- were in permanent touch with the headquarters in Geneva. Every day we could in fact publish as many -- or, issue as many communiqués. The headquarters managed its information appropriately in a manner as to mobilise humanitarian aid. And this corresponded to the -- or, rather, we could, every day -- or, on a daily basis publish such communiqués. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, with the leave of the Court, I would like you to be shown a document which we disclosed this morning to the Prosecution, and we apologise for this late disclosure. That document is referenced K0337831. That is the French version -- the identification for the French version of the document, K0337831. I would like you to look at page 6 of that document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And without identifying any of the speakers in this document, what is now the question? 
$(Pages 15 to 28 by Kirstin McLean)
1145H 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I wanted to make sure that the witness is on page 6 of the document. 
@WITNESS BDC:
I'm on that page. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
(By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted and filed under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why on Earth did you ask such a question? We'll place that under seal as well as the response. 
That is why I said, "Without identifying any speakers in this document." 
What is now the next question? Now, that should have been a good hint to you that you shouldn't identify any speakers, so what is now the next question? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I'm sorry, I apologise for that; I failed to take note of that hint. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, this statement, which is quite long -- we are not going to read it -- do you think it is minutes from its author? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Indeed, I have not read the statement, I do not even see the date of the statement. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, perhaps, to refresh your memory, you can read the first paragraph to the Court. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, Counsel I will do so. 
"It is difficult to know the assistance that Rwandans could give us because the 2 millions that I talked about were taken to areas that you know where famine already is endemic. 
"In my opinion, this would be asking -- it would be asking too much from someone from Gikongoro to provide beans and sweet potatoes to those who have taken refuge in that area. I believe that would worsen the situation of the individual from whom such assistance is sought."
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Does that remind you of the context in which this statement was made? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, I believe it was in the course of an interview over the national radio. During the interview, we had to present the situation -- the humanitarian situation in Rwanda -- that is, the prevailing humanitarian situation in Rwanda as at then. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I thank you, Witness. 
Witness, still with the leave of the Court, I would like you to be shown a document referenced K0344542, page 9 of that document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 9 is the middle of the intervention of a speaker identified on page 7 of this French version, and we note that person's identity. And which part of page 9 shall we look at? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would like the Witness to read to the Chamber the last paragraph of this page. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The one starting with, "Yesterday, Friday"? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That's correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When you now read, Mr. Witness, please read slowly. 
We are listening. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. 
"Yesterday, Friday 15 April, the préfet of the préfecture of Kigali-ville chaired a meeting of representatives of political parties in Kigali town. To that meeting, were invited the high representative of the International Red Cross Committee, Mr. Philippe Gaillard, who was accompanied by the delegate of the Rwandan Red Cross."
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Defence counsel -- 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Please do not pronounce the name that follows. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
"Were also present at that meeting, the representatives of the MRND, MDR, PSD and PDI political parties in Kigali town. 
"The officials who were absent were attending other meetings dealing with the restoration of peace throughout Kigali."
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
Witness, after that reading my question now is as follows: Is that the meeting you talked to us about, that is, the meeting with political parties -- the meeting you talked about during your testimony-in-chief? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you know whether during this meeting the militias that we talked about throughout this examination-in-chief were also present? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
There were party officials. All of them were dressed in plain clothes, so if there were militias dressed in plain clothes I would be unable to identify them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
Witness, you testified that you personally knew Mr. Renzaho. Indeed, that you had known him for a long time. Do you think that at the time referred to Mr. Renzaho had anti-ethnic -- you do not want to use terms that are against your principle -- so, as I was saying, was Mr. Renzaho an ethnicist or tribalistic? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, he wasn't. He has never been tribalistic, so to speak. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
For the benefit of the Chamber, I would like to be clearer. Did you ever notice that he was particularly hostile to the Tutsi ethnic group? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
This morning, I testified before this Chamber that even displaced persons in the premises of the préfecture were of mixed ethnic origin. And this morning, I also said that even his personal situation -- his family situation was such that the families of mixed family -- perhaps I forget to specify that he comes from an area which I know very well; namely, the eastern region where I did my secondary studies -- secondary education. And where as a young man from the north, I can confirm here that 
that -- that an ethnicist feeling did not exist or does not exist in the eastern region. It is a mixed region or area. 
For those of us who come from the north -- in fact, I learnt to live like the people of the east in that area. The ethnicist feelings do not exist in the eastern region. Therefore, by virtue of its upbringing, he could not be tribalistic and he is not. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness, for that answer. 
Witness, once more with the leave of the Court, I would have you listen to a tape recording and after listening I will put my question to you. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would like to have the witness listen to the exhibit produced by the Prosecution. 
Perhaps the registry has a copy of the exhibit? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just play it please, we know this well. 
As usual, interpretation and transcription will not be necessary. 
Shall we start? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, we -- we have technical problems. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any other questions to this witness, apart from questions relating to that tape? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
In fact, my question will deal with that -- with the tape -- with the recording. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you played this tape to the witness previously so that he knows of it? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Couldn't we then just ask the witness, "Mr. Witness, having heard this tape, where we now have a technical problem, did you, listening to that tape, recognise..." and now you can formulate your question, Mr. Nekuie. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I will ask him the same question as I did ask him when I had him listen to the tape recording. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice in the tape recording which I had you listen to when you were being prepared? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I -- I would even say what I said at that time. I said it seems rather strange that a recording of whosoever -- a recording of a private utterance would be made available to me. I was disturbed, but to be precise, I did not recognise Renzaho's voice. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I thank you, Witness. I also thank you for the trouble you have taken to come before this Chamber to say what you know in the Renzaho trial. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have come to the end of the examination of chief of this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to tender any of the four documents you asked the witness to comment on?
All right, the first document is his Red Cross news communiqué, dated the 21st April, A for the French, B for the English. Which number is that, Mrs. Ben Salimo? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 52, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 52A and D. 52B admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The next document is the communiqué by the Red Cross dated 25th of May 1994, A for the French, B for the English. 
Mrs. Ben Salimo, number? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 53, Mr. President. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 53A and D. 53B admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then follows the document which is a transmission of the radio programme. Do we know which radio station this comes from? Is it Radio Rwanda? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
It is Radio Rwanda, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And do we know the date of the programme? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That document was identified on the 15th of April 1994. The reference can be found on the very first page of the document and that will clarify us on that. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Counsel, it is the 15th of May. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see on the top of this document, on the right-hand side, the 17th of May 1994. Is there agreement that that is the date? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I was looking at another document, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It seems to be the case. At any rate, there seems to be no objections to the tendering of this document, and that will then be, Mrs. Ben Salimo? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 54, Mr. President. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 54 admitted, under seal)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then, finally, another radio transcription, this time apparently dated the 15th of May, according to the front page, at least. 
The K number of the previous document D. 54 was, as we see from the transcripts, K0337831. 
The K number of the present exhibit which we are just about to enter is K0344542. 
Mrs. Ben Salimo? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 55, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 55 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And we think that we will place D. 54 under seal. 
Mr. Witness, you said you met Mr. Renzaho ten times from the 15th of April to the 3rd of July; is that so? 
@WITNESS BDC:
I confirm, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to remember on which occasions you met him, the dates of these ten times, or is that too far back for you to recall now? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Mr. President, I cannot remember the dates, so I cannot specify on what dates I met him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is quite understandable. Now, if you look at these ten occasions, would you say they were mostly in April, mostly in May, mostly in June, or is it not possible to say that there was a dominance of meetings or a majority of meetings during a particular month. What is your view? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Mr. President, I would say that those meetings were held over regular intervals. I remember that at one time we were both victims of a bombing in his office, and we were obliged to go down to the basement where we spent the night. That is one occasion that I remember. So the meetings were held over regular intervals; they were regular meetings. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Prosecution?
@JUDGE EGOROV:
I'm sorry, Mr. Witness, what was the purpose of those meetings? Did you discuss anything? Did he invite you or it was your initiative to see him? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Once we had gone there to visit the displaced persons who were there on his site -- to whom we had to distribute food supplies. On other occasions, when people were being moved from his site, these people were being bombed, and we had to move them towards the Hôtel des Mille Collines or towards Sainte Famille. 
It would be difficult for me to explain exactly, but these were the times when we went there for some specific missions. And I went to his office to greet him when we went to his site for those specific missions. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, you told us that you got a laissez-passer from Robert Kajuga, who is the leader of the Interahamwes. Is that right? 
@WITNESS BDC:
That is correct. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
And with this laissez-passer, you passed through the roadblocks without any problem by showing that laissez-passer? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Somewhat, yes, we had a few difficulties, but we had less difficulty with the laissez-passer than without the laissez-passer. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
But earlier on in your testimony, you had told us that you couldn't say those militias were Interahamwes, and yet with the document from the head of the Interahamwes you were able to pass through the roadblocks without any molestation? 
@WITNESS BDC:
The militiamen recognised the authority of Kajuga and his deputies. Whatever the parties they belonged to, they recognised his authority. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Another question: How can you say that Father Wenceslas, who was in charge of Sainte Famille (inaudible), did not know Mr. Renzaho who was the préfet of Kigali-ville? How could you tell us -- how are you in a position to make that statement? 
@WITNESS BDC:
I must use relative terms -- I must clarify the term, they did not have any personal relationship as such; that the préfet of Kigali is somebody everyone knows and he's a public authority, everybody knows him. So in that capacity let me correct myself, Wenceslas knew the préfet like everyone else, but I just wanted to say that they had no personal relationship. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
And my last question: In answer to a question put to you by the Defence counsel, you said 
Mr. Renzaho never went to the Sainte Famille site at all? 
@WITNESS BDC:
I remember one occasion when we were all part of a delegation on that site, and the -- on the other occasions, I received no report from my teams there, nor had never witnessed him come there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour, I'm going to need to begin my cross-examination in closed session as there are some matters which will identify the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The estimated duration of the closed session? 
@MR. MOSES:
Perhaps 30 minutes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will close for 30 minutes, and then those in the public gallery are welcome back again. 
@MR. MOSES:
There are a number of documents also, Your Honour, which may be referred in the course of cross-examination, and I'll have those distributed to Your Honours and Defence counsel now. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then move into closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 37 to 49] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
$(Pages 29 to 36 by Jean Baigent)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness BDC, we are now in open session, and your cross-examination continues. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, you have told the Trial Chamber you became actively involved in the operations involving the International Red Cross on the 15th of April 1994; correct? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And just so that we are quite clear, you were not part of the International Red Cross Committee, you were part of the national association; correct? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Not the association, but the national society. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, in fact, one day prior to you becoming involved, there was -- the International Red Cross suspended its operations in Kigali after six injured persons were taken from an International Red Cross ambulance and killed by militia in the presence of government soldiers; correct? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, on the 14th, there was that incident, and the Red Cross no longer sent its ambulances outside of its headquarters. But its activities continued. Food continued to be distributed and medical attention was granted to patients in various hospitals. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And there was an international outcry in the media by Mr. Gaillard? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, yes, there was a protest. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the Rwandan government was extremely concerned about its image as a result of that incident. Would you agree with that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
That is correct, yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Because not only had refugees been taken from the ambulance, but they had been killed in the presence of government soldiers, which indicated a support from the military. That is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
That was on the 14th. And I was not there to determine whether there were soldiers at that location at which wounded persons were taken out of the ambulance -- out of the Red Cross ambulance. 
@MR. MOSES: 
But, Mr. Witness, you have told us that you -- about meetings that you weren't present at which you received daily updates in respect of. This was an incident reported through the world press, which indicated that there were soldiers present while the militia killed those refugees in the Red Cross ambulance. That's correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Well, a group of soldiers may have been at that location, but I don't know whether that is an important fact. It might be possible, if that information has been cross-checked and is correct. I therefore do not see any reason why I should challenge it. I simply take note of it, unfortunately, 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you told that soldiers were present in 1994? 
@WITNESS BDC:
I do not have a clear recollection of that specific fact. There were soldiers, but I remember that the area was mentioned, quite close to the Kigali hospital centre at a roadblock which was well known for its atrocities. We wept when we found out about those who had been taken out of our ambulances and killed. But the fact relating to the presence of soldiers is not something that stands out clearly to my mind -- or to my memory.
@MR. MOSES:
Perhaps the witness could be shown document 5 in the bundle. It's a document from the ICRC in Geneva dated 15 April 1994.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
I know from the information sheet that you can read English, Witness, and I would ask you to look at the first paragraph. This is a communiqué or update on the ICRC activities dated 15 April, written by Mr. Harald, H-A-R-A-L-D, de Gruneck, spelt D-E, G-R-U-N-E-C-K. 
Now, Witness, you have told us that you were kept informed as to what was going on. Can I suggest to you that what is described there, which was reported in many international newspapers, was that an ambulance of the Rwandese Red Cross was stopped and six wounded people in the ambulance were shot dead by militiamen while soldiers of the armed forces looked on. Can I suggest to you -- does that refresh your memory? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, indeed, it does. And I had said earlier on that if the soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces were there looking on, I do not have that detail in my memory. I simply take good note of it now. I can even say that, indeed, soldiers -- some soldiers themselves were guilty of those types of crimes committed here and there. 
I do not have details in memory, so to speak, not such that can enable me to speak clearly on these issues. What I am saying is that the facts pertaining to that situation are not fresh in my mind in respect of that particular aspect. But here and there, there were soldiers who indeed took part in those types of crimes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. If we look at your question, Mr. Moses, at 14:54:14, it was said that six injured persons were taken from an International Red Cross ambulance and killed by militia. It seems to be the correct version, according to the document you have just given us, that it was from the national Red Cross ambulance; isn't that so? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. With other words, from the same organisation as this witness belongs to. Is that so, Mr. Witness? This was actually your organisation and your ambulance; do I understand this correctly? 
@WITNESS BDC:
I said that in times of armed conflict, the Rwandan Red Cross receives orders from the International Red Cross Committee. So I think the issue here is one of identifying the type of vehicle that was used with all the relevant details. The entire infrastructure and the Red Cross transportation fleet is put under the authority of the International Red Cross Committee. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, who owned the vehicle? Do you know; yes or no? 
@WITNESS BDC:
The Rwandan Red Cross. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You see, what I am suggesting, Witness, is, in fact, that you becoming involved on the 15th of April 1994 was part of the Rwandan government's public relations exercise to try and get some goodwill back from the international community after there had been this widely publicised incident which had tainted their image. Would you agree with me? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, that is only a presumption, and I say no to it very categorically. 
Well before the 6th of April, and even before -- well before, during the times of civil war, I had worked with the international committee as an adviser on these types of issues. So my intervention at that time had nothing to do with any public relations campaign whatsoever. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, once you became involved on the 15th of April, were you told by Mr. Gaillard or others who had been involved themselves in the collection of bodies from the city of Kigali that there had been as many as 67,000 bodies picked up off the streets of Kigali by the préfectoral authorities? Were you told that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Did you say on the 15th of April? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Any time during -- let's make it broader -- any time during April were you advised that the authorities had picked up as many as 67,000 bodies from the streets of Kigali? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes. In fact, there were even more bodies to be picked up in Kigali. There were more than 67,000 bodies that were picked up, and that must have been at a period where the bodies were 67,000. But the teams that were picking up the bodies gave whatever figure they pleased. So it must have been during that period -- it may have been correct to mention that figure during that period. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you, in your role, manage to discover what the vast majority -- the ethnicity of the vast majority of those persons were? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
War-wounded victims, yes. But I do not understand your question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is something lacking in the interpretation. Please repeat your question. It is understandable that he didn't understand. 
$BY MR. MOSES: 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you manage to discover what the ethnicity was of the vast majority of those victims? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, the first victims were the Tutsis, as it was said. On the other hand, there were people who were opposed to the ideology represented by the majority of the militias who manned the roadblocks. Therefore, you had both Tutsis, as well as members of opposition parties whose ideas were opposed to that espoused by the militia. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you observe, Witness, that the killings were systematic? Persons were identified by virtue of their ethnicity and killed by reason of their ethnicity? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I noticed that clearly around the end -- or, rather, mid-June, or perhaps early June, end of June that was obvious. But during the early moments of the month of April, no, I mean, mid-May right up to the end of June, during those initial moments of the month of April, I can only refer to the declarations themselves -- the declarations of the RPF itself, which said that it is not a conflict, an ethnic conflict, but rather a political conflict and the victims were political victims. It is Mr. Dusaidi who said that -- he said that over international radio stations. And that opinion prevailed until early May when the Pope himself talked about genocide. The UN also started talking about a genocide. Therefore, it was not only us on the spot, but also the various observers. Well, the various observers had not yet agreed regarding that point. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which name did you refer to, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Mr. Dusaidi is spelt D-U-S-A-I-D-I. He was ambassador of Rwanda just after the RPF took over power in Rwanda. He was at the United Nations in charge of public relations. So if it was a way of going over all his declarations, he was categorical. He said that the massacres were not ethnic in nature, but, rather, political. 
Up to the moment when the Pope himself and France started talking of genocide, we did not have as humanitarian workers a basis to start talking of genocide. Personally, I came to know the definition of genocide later on. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree with the proposition, Witness, that in the first weeks after the death of President Habyarimana, the Red Cross were evacuating wounded people who were all Tutsi? This is in April. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I cannot be categorical on that point because it is very difficult, especially in Kigali, to make a distinction between a Hutu and a Tutsi on the one hand. On the other hand, the Red Cross had strict instructions to avoid venturing into identifying victims on the basis of their ethnicity.
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Witness, you didn't have any difficulty, did you, in identifying those persons who had taken refuge at the préfecture office as being both Hutu and Tutsi. So I am wondering why you are having trouble -- or had trouble identifying those who had been wounded as being either Hutu or Tutsi. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
If you want, very well, there were wounded persons both Hutu and Tutsi. If you please, that's the answer I should have given you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you aware that Mr. Kambanda, the Rwandan prime minister, had asked the Red Cross for assistance to evacuate the dead bodies in Kigali, but that he had -- but that Mr. Gaillard had refused, until the killings had stopped? Were you aware of that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Perhaps laying down security as a condition for us to operate, well, we were aware that we would not send our people on the ground because bombs were falling all over. So I would imagine that Mr. Gaillard laid down security as a condition. This condition must have been put to the government troops, but also to the RPF. But massacres were all about us. We could not put an end to our activities. We had to continue operating.
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I am wondering if the witness can be shown -- there are two documents, both in the bundle which have been provided to Your Honours and the Defence; the fourth and, I think, fifth document. They are both speeches of Mr. Gaillard. I think they are stapled together. 
Sorry, Your Honour, can I just approach to make sure it's the right document? 
Perhaps if that document, which the registry had, could be shown to -- 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, that is a document off the International Red Cross website, which is a transcript of a speech given by Mr. Gaillard on the 18th of October 1994 at the international museum of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Geneva. What I would like to bring your attention to is page 4 of that document, and it's the 7th paragraph -- it's about two-thirds of way down the document commencing "On two occasions". Do you see that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In that document, Mr. Gaillard says:
"On two occasions in 1994 our ambulances were stopped at militia roadblocks and the wounded were forcibly unloaded and killed before our very eyes. RTLM announced that the ICRC was transporting enemies of the republic disguised as mock wounded. We explained, protested, had Geneva issue press releases that were picked up by the western media. The effect in Rwanda was immediate. The Rwandan government and media changed tack and set out to polish their badly tarnished image by mounting an awareness campaign on the right of the wounded to take -- wounded to care, and on the role of the Red Cross. Within a few days our ambulances no longer had any difficulty in moving about freely in Kigali." 
Do you agree with the statement recorded there, Witness? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I think this was Gaillard's opinion as at then, an opinion according to which the government sought to improve its image. That is a matter of personal opinion. When we -- when we contacted the government, it was always on the basis of the Geneva Conventions that we made our requirements. We told them that the conventions that you have signed provide the following: That you are guilty of a breach of the conventions to which you have subscribed. And I believe they did that because of that. But, in any case, this is the opinion of a colleague, and I respect that opinion. I cannot discuss it. I cannot question it. It is for him to explain it. It's not for me to explain or comment on his opinion. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Say you went and spoke to Mr. Kajuga and Mr. Rutaganda; is that right. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, I did that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that is because, presumably, they were those who were in charge of the militias that were causing you problems at the roadblock; correct? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And following on from the question earlier from Judge Arrey, would you agree that those persons were not just leaders of unorganised militia, they were, in fact, leaders of the MRND Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, Kajuga was a member of the MRND, and so were the members of his team. I met them at that time. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you will agree Mr. Gaillard is saying that the -- as a result of the government intervention, there were no further problems at the roadblocks for the ICRC after a few days; correct? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I do not know whether he's specifically referring to that aspect. When I went to see the militias -- but I did not have the impression of seeing among the militias a government representative. I had before me leaders of the militias, and those leaders had sort of become independent of the government, and they had authority, because the paper they issued me was sufficient. It served its purpose and it maintained -- or, it had the desired effect; it enabled us to go past roadblocks manned by militiamen. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You will agree with me the government was dominated by MRND ministers. We can at least agree on that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, there were all political parties represented in the government. I do not have the list before me. I don't even think that the MRND had the majority of the ministers. I would be making a mistake if I venture into giving you a precise number of ministerial portfolios the MRND held. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree that the MRND was, at least, one of the most important political parties in terms of numbers in the government? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I think I just answered that question. I would be repeating myself, but I would say that I do not know the exact number of portfolios that were given to the MRND party. But I said that I do not think that they had the majority of ministerial portfolios in the government. 
@MR. MOSES: 
They were a significant -- well, we can at least agree, can't we, that they were a significant force in the interim government? Or you won't agree with that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Not only in the government, but throughout the country. The MRND was an important political force; you are right, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the youth militia of that significant party, after intervention by the Red Cross complaining about the activities of the militia, were able to control that same militia in persuading them not to attack the Red Cross. Would you agree with that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, because I said that the militia -- the militias were groups of people who were drugged. They reflected the devil or a demon coming to descend on us. Those militias, led by the young people of various parties, actually respected the authority of Mr. Kajuga and Rutagengwa (sic). Did they, by reason of that, also respect the authority of the MRND? I do not know.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last name was? Which name did you mention after Kajuga? We got it not quite clearly. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I only mentioned Kajuga and his team. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I believe the name started with an R, Mr. President. It sounded like Rutengwa. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
R-U-T-E-N-G-W-A. Rutengwa. Is it Rutaganda -- Rutagengwa (phonetic)? I'm sorry, there is a possible confusion between Rutengwa and Rutaganda. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, I am sorry, Your Honours. I'll -- no, it's okay. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you'll agree that the Red Cross was able to get food to the larger centres, such as Sainte Famille and Saint Paul's. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, that is right. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did the Red Cross, to your knowledge, ever turn down requests for food for those persons at either of those places -- or anywhere, for that matter? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
The translation talks of refusing aid. I don't think that is -- that would have been possible. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree with me that, apart from the attacks on the Red Cross ambulances, there were also problems that the Red Cross encountered with the militias stealing food from the Red Cross that was intended for delivery to other -- other refugees? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, Counsel, they blocked not only the wounded but all movement to sites that needed our assistance. We had difficulties with them, and this was on a daily basis. Therefore, if you are aware of a specific case, that case would be part of our daily difficulties in our operations. The militias blocked us, and as Mr. Gaillard says here, the militias even sought to portray us as people collaborating with the enemy. They even asserted that the people we were transporting were not wounded people but rather an enemy who were disguised as wounded people. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, if -- if a statement was put to you, namely, that -- I'm sorry, I'll -- I'll rephrase. 
Would you agree that at the end of April the ICRC suspended its operations for a while because of security issues? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
End of April, yes, yes. But indeed, as was the case always, these were mobile operations. Internal humanitarian action where we were continued. But for reasons of insecurity, we had to stop the movement of our teams at some point. And I believe that was around the end of April. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And would you also agree that it -- it was certainly not an exaggeration to -- to say that the militias had been removing patients and killing them, and also that the militias were stealing food? Would you agree that those propositions were not -- what I've just said to you doesn't exaggerate the situation? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, that's correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So if the Accused in this case had said to the UNAMIR representatives on the 28th of April, when that scenario was put to him, that he -- that the ICRC was perhaps exaggerating somewhat in that kind of report, you wouldn't agree with what the Accused might have said at that time about such a report. 
@WITNESS BDC: 
A Red Cross report, you mean? Addressed to whom? To UNAMIR? Well, the Red Cross did not report to UNAMIR. The Red Cross had direct access to all warring parties, or all fighting parties. Would that report have been to the UNAMIR, to the government, to the préfet? Well, there was no report made to the UNAMIR, as such. But if any such report was submitted, I -- I would not believe, in the -- the truth of that report within the given context. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Roadblocks, Mr. Witness. Would you agree that roadblocks in Kigali, throughout the month of April -- months of April, May, and June prevented Tutsis from moving safely around Kigali? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I am sorry, I did not quite understand your question. Maybe you expressed yourself well, but I was a little absent minded. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree that the roadblocks which were established in and around Kigali city, during the months of April, May, and June, prevented Tutsi from moving safely throughout the city? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
That is correct. You know that at those roadblocks they were checking for the famous identity cards, and the people you have referred to had more problems than other members of the population. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you say "problems", they were killed at the roadblocks, weren't they, when they showed their Tutsi identity cards? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Some Tutsi who were members of parties -- well, some also survived because they shared a common ideology with the militia or with the political parties. Counsel, let me tell you that Mr. Kajuga himself, the head of the militia, must have been, if not entirely Tutsi, was a member of that ethnic group in one way or another. The militia also included people of Tutsi extraction. That is why Mr. Dusaidi, whom I referred to, appeared at that time to be in a correct position, namely, that to the end of -- towards the end of April/mid-May, he appeared to say that the -- belonging to the militia was more relevant to survival than belonging to a specific ethnic group. But I don't have any concrete details to substantiate this fact. Mr. Kajuga himself gave an interview, as we regularly did. He said that there were Tutsis among us, and that we were defending ourselves, we were acting in self-defence. And I'm sorry if my answer is not specific enough. That is my answer to that very specific question you put. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'll put it another way. Are you saying it was safe for Tutsis to travel through the roadblocks on the streets of Kigali? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, if they displayed their belonging to the militia, some were able to survive. Some also survived without belonging to the militia in -- in real terms, but who adopted that strategy for purposes of survival, namely, embracing the ideology of the militia with a view to surviving. And that's how they survived. It -- it is a little bit complicated, you know. That problem is a rather complex one, you know. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, putting aside the militia, the vast majority of Tutsis, the overwhelming majority of Tutsis were not members of militia, were they? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, no, not at all. And not the vast majority of Hutus were members of the militia either. It was a diabolical creation of the times which, I must say, did not represent the majority of Hutus, did not represent the Rwandan people, did not represent the Hutu. So my answer to your question is yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And these roadblocks were set up, to a large extent, by the civilian authorities, namely, in particular, the Accused in this trial, Tharcisse Renzaho; isn't that the case? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I have already stated this morning that the mental status of the members of the teams of the militia at the roadblock -- or, that I saw at the roadblocks does not correspond to the image I had -- or, the knowledge I had of Mr. Renzaho at that time. My idea was that those who were militia threatened him, they threatened his staff, and threatened the whole concept of public security which he stood for. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's not the question, Witness. The question was: These roadblocks were set up, to a large extent, by the civilian authorities, namely, in particular, the Accused in this trial, Tharcisse Renzaho. Do you agree that he was responsible for ordering these roadblocks to be established? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
The overall message was for people to group themselves together as they knew themselves, and to ensure security. That, in broad strokes, was the general thrust of the message. Now, talking about the setting up of those teams as they were constituted, and whether they were under his authority, my answer has consistently -- and will consistently be no. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you didn't hear him on the radio on the 11th of April, the 12th of April, the 19th of April, the 21st of April, telling the population to establish roadblocks, telling the population to man roadblocks? You didn't hear any of those speeches by the Accused on the radio; is this what you're telling us? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
The call for members of the population to set up roadblocks was a daily occurrence on Radio Télévision Mille Collines. Within 30-minute intervals that was being done, and I think the officials also called on the population to mobilise themselves in that manner. But, referring particularly to Mr. Renzaho, I said that I do not recall -- or, that I do not have any facts that lead me to say that he organised the establishment of roadblocks or militia within his préfecture. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree, Witness, as at the beginning of May 1994, it was relatively safer for Tutsis -- Tutsi refugees to be in those larger groups of refugees, namely at Sainte Famille, Saint Paul's, than it would be for them to be in their homes? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
That would apply to everyone in the city. The overall feeling was for all citizens to move towards the places where there were groups, for psychological reasons, and even more so for the Tutsi. And, further still, for those who didn't embrace the ideology of the criminals who spontaneously surfaced from the 6th of April. 
@MR. MOSES: 
If the Red Cross had told all the Tutsi refugees, at the beginning of May, to leave Sainte Famille and go home, what do you think would have happened to them, bearing in mind your observations as to what were happening to Tutsis at the roadblocks at that time? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
That is an impossible speculation, because the Red Cross would never have done any such thing. It would never have gone to a camp of displaced persons and talked to Tutsi. So I cannot answer a question which presupposes the impossible. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Witness, let's put the Red Cross to one side. If you had gone, as an individual, to Sainte Famille at the beginning of May and told the Tutsi refugees to go home, what, according to you, would happen -- have happened to them at -- having regard to what you had been observing at the roadblocks? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I would never have done any such thing. And, furthermore, to answer your question, we were in the month of May, isn't it. At that time there were roadblocks at every 500 metres across the city. And anyone who was in a premises like Sainte Famille enjoyed some measure of psychological security. And whether they were Tutsi or not, such a person would not have done that kind of thing because they would be moving straight into death. So I think that it is understood that death would have been expected, isn't it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. You'd agree that it was -- it would be as good as sending those persons to their death? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, absolutely. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And therefore, if, as we have heard in this trial, Mr. Renzaho had made such a request in respect of the refugees at Saint Paul's, you'd also agree that such a request or order amounted to him giving them a death sentence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Objection, Mr. President. I do not know whether the Prosecutor is speculating as far as Mr. Renzaho is concerned, or is he putting it to the witness that Mr. Renzaho made any such statement? Because otherwise it would be rather insidious. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, we have heard from Witness KZ, who you will recall gave evidence that he had a telephone conversation at the beginning of May with the Accused, during which time the Accused told KZ to send the refugees home. It's based on evidence that Your Honours have heard, and I think it's a very fair -- well, it's a fair question to put to this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have had such a testimony; that's true. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. What we would like is for the Prosecutor to tell -- to state that a previous witness has made such a statement, rather than put suggestions to him without laying the proper foundation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, if it's true, as one witness has stated, that Mr. Renzaho made such an order, what would be your comment, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Well, if that witness didn't lie and the facts are true that he did so, well, that is the only thing I can say. And I would like to say that I never heard any such thing, I never heard Mr. Renzaho saying any such thing, or ordering the refugees at Sainte Famille to go back home. Which home? All the homes had been destroyed. And the problems of mobility or access were real, and they were serious, even for those of us who had the ability or resources to go about -- to move about. Now, that is the witness's opinion. Whether it is the truth or not, well, he swore to speak the truth. I have taken the oath to speak my own truth. And I don't have to make any judgement on what a previous witness has said, I can only speak about those things which I witnessed. He probably witnessed something which he has told the Court, and that is his right. It is for him to be responsible for the truth or the lie that he told. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Witness. To conclude, Witness, you've known the Accused for more than 20 years; that's your evidence, isn't it? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And can I suggest to you that you've shared political ideologies with the Accused as well? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, I don't think he was a member of a political party. He was an administrative official, he was not a member of a political party. And I have told you that I never, never, never, up till April 1995, I never belonged to any political party. So there is no way in which we can refer to any political ideology. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You told us earlier today that you had written to the Accused prior to his arrest; isn't that right? After the genocide and prior to his arrest? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, it is possible. I said that after 1995 I became politically active, and this is an open secret. I therefore would crave the indulgence of the Court not to focus on something that didn't concern the period, because this is a civic right and inalienable right that one can enjoy relating to a personal letter that I might have written to a friend. How -- how does that become relevant in this matter? 
@MR. MOSES: 
You know, don't you, Mr. Witness, that the Accused was leading armed forces in the Congo after the end of the genocide, between 1994 and the time of his arrest, and that those armed forces included the ex-militia who you have been talking about who were responsible for a lot of the killings? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Well, maybe we will talk about that when we are in a tribunal that will deal with the crimes of that period. For now we are dealing with the crimes of 1994, aren't we? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, are you aware that the Accused was leading the armed forces in the Congo during that period? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I will not answer that question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Why's that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Am I not entitled to desist from answering a question? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was that the last question? 
@MR. MOSES: 
One final question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, can I suggest to you that you know the Accused well, and you know very well that it is his voice that was on the audio tape that you listened to, who was the préfet who was speaking on that tape and who was ordering the extermination of persons -- of Tutsi in that tape? What do you say to that? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I was not able to recognise his voice, and I have said that already. If it is the same document you are referring to, I say that I was not in a position to recognise his voice. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, that's the end of my cross-examination. I don't know whether you want to have the documents tendered now, as Prosecution exhibits. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, let's do that before re-examination. The first document was Mr. Guichaoua's report? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the French, B for the English. Mr. Matemanga, the number? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 101. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you just repeat the number, please? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 101. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 101A and P. 101B admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The next document was the letter to Colonel Simba. Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 102. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Mr. President, the Prosecutor showed me this document. It is a personal letter about a friend, the story of a friend -- Mr. Simba is a friend. And since he is an elder, African tradition requires that I refer to him as my elder brother. But, Mr. President, if you read this letter, there is nothing in the content, except matters dealing with somebody for whom I have much respect, and in which I seek to know from him, issues that relate to the matters of trade representation which he was familiar with at the time. And that is what I was asking of him. I must, therefore, insist that private correspondence, I believe, should also enjoy some respect in this Tribunal. And I really want to register my opposition to the use of private mail. And this is on the grounds of the law and traditions and practice, namely, that there is some measure of protection of private correspondence. Because, indeed, it is private. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There are rules prohibiting some evidence to come in, but we have no information to see that any of those rules apply here. We note what you just said, and let me assure you that there is a difference between admitting the document and the weight of the document. 
But this is then P. 102. 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the -- there is only one language version. Simply P. 102. Is that so, Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I wonder whether it should be under seal, bearing in mind it has the -- is signed by the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Absolutely. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 102 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The next document was the meeting report of 29th March to 3rd April 1995. That was the period of the meeting. A for the French and B for the English. Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes, P. 103. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 103A and P. 103B admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then it was the statement by the FAR high command, following its meeting of 28 and 29th April 1995. Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 104, A and B. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 104A and P. 104B admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then the Geneva document of 15th April 1994 with the title "blood bath continues". Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 105. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 105 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then, from the ICRC website, a reference of somebody of a speech made by Mr. Gaillard on the 18th of October 1994. Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 106. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 106 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Those were the documents you used. 
Re-examination. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
##
$RE-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I would like to clarify a number of points with you, the points that were raised by counsel for the Prosecution during cross-examination. 
Witness, when you went to see the leaders of the militia, namely Mr. Kajuga and Mr. Rutengwa as you mentioned, did you go to see them in your personal capacity, or on behalf of the Red Cross? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
I went on behalf of the -- the humanitarian action that needed to be efficient in order to meet its objective of saving human lives. So it was on behalf of the Red Cross. I had no personal reasons to meet them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, sir. Was it on behalf of the national Red Cross, or on behalf of the International Red Cross? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Let me repeat, for the sixth time, that in times of armed conflict the national Red Cross comes under the authority of the International Red Cross. So I was acting on behalf of the International Red Cross. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. The safe passage that you were able to obtain for those people, was it for your personal use or on behalf of the Red Cross on whose behalf you conduct those negotiations? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
We photocopied that document which was like a cheque, a very precious cheque, which we distributed to all drivers of ambulances, and they would display them whenever they were stopped at roadblocks by the militia. And as Mr. Gaillard himself said, that led to the situation where we no longer faced any problems. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, there were incidents at which some Red Cross -- some wounded patients of the Red Cross were taken out of ambulances and killed. In that connection, the Prosecutor argued that it was in the presence of soldiers. Now, Witness, do you know whether soldiers in Kigali town were under the authority or command of Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, not at all. He was not even a -- a staff of the ministry of defence. A préfet is an administrative officer who comes under the jurisdiction of the minister of the interior. So, even in that respect, apart from his being a colonel, which, may I say, was a matter of chance, he had no direct links with the ministry of defence. He did not command, and he had no capacity to issue orders to the soldiers. The only security force available to him was the communal police, which I believe also falls under the ministry of the interior. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. Witness, we talked at length on roadblocks. I think the Prosecution also discussed roadblocks with you. Did you ever hear Renzaho tell you that he was the one who initiated the setting up of those roadblocks? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, not only could he not tell me that, but I am saying that the spontaneous nature of how these roadblocks came into being, the disorganised manner in which they came into being, the general aspect of drugged young people, indicates that hell had broken loose. The situation was such that -- and I continue to say no, he couldn't have been at the origin of the setting up of the roadblocks. Maybe somebody else will make allegations to that effect, but I am saying no, there are no -- or, there is no basis to confirm such an allegation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you hear over the radio -- I'm asking you the Prosecution's question. Did you hear Renzaho's message around the 10, 11, 12th of April, asking people to set up roadblocks? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
On the 10th of April, did you say that? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness. Did you ever hear messages from Renzaho, personally, messages broadcast over the radio and asking people to set up roadblocks? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
We, the senior staff of the Red Cross, no longer listened to the radio. We had staff who were specifically appointed to take down all declarations broadcast over the radio, and the person in charge of information in a meeting will come and brief us. But he would always insist on messages which were harmful to our humanitarian activities. I do not remember any briefing from our officer-in-charge of information which would confirm your question. So, unless I did not listen to that broadcast, and that would be normal because I was constantly on the ground or in the field, I do not remember, from memory, anything that would enable me to say yes to your question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, during the period of April to July 1994, did -- were you debriefed, or, did you have briefings on any message whatsoever that Mr. Renzaho may have published during the period referred to, messages that he may have had broadcast over the radio, messages of what -- of any nature whatsoever? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No. To be more precise, I noticed that Renzaho informed me of all that he was doing, of his problems. I believe that, from a humanitarian standpoint, I am aware of his concerns. So I did not need to listen to the radio. I would go and contact him. I went to his office and came out at any time I chose to. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Witness, now, I would like to come back -- and that would be the last point we'll be dealing with. I'd like to come back to the period of April, that is, from the 6th of April to the 30th of April 1994. Was there fighting in Kigali town during the period referred to? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Half of his entire préfecture -- I should be precise. Half of his entire préfecture, or even move than half of his entire préfecture, in absolute terms, because the two communes, Kacyiru, which is spelt as follows. K-A-C-Y-I-R-O (sic), that was the first commune. The second commune was Kicukiro. K-A-C-U-R-O (sic). These two communes were practically occupied. His administrative territory had reduced to almost nothing. He was reduced to Nyarugenge -- Nyarugenge which is spelt as follows, N-Y-A -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
$(Microphones overlapping). Thank you. 
Now, did this arise in cross-examination?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness's answer: 
@WITNESS BDC: 
So there was fighting -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
-- says the witness -- 
@WITNESS BDC: 
-- in Kigali préfecture. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, perhaps the question was not phrased. But in answer to a Prosecution question, the witness talked about bombs which were falling on the town, unless I am mistaken. In any case, the transcripts are there to bear me out. Perhaps I should -- I'll ask him the question, the source of the bombs. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Can you answer that question? Where did bombs that you mentioned during your -- during the cross-examination, where did they come from? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Yes, indeed, bombs were falling from all over. They came from all sources occupied by the belligerents. The Rwandan armed forces were bombing, the RPF was also doing same. I also specified that some of the bombs of the RPF army fell on us, and that we had many wounded persons and dead people amongst us. So there were bombs, and they were thrown by the two belligerents. In fact, we were victims of some of the shelling. This was at the Kigali hospital centre, the Red Cross hospital in Rugunga, and even at the very headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I thank you, Witness. Now, the victims. Were the victims -- were they people who were killed by the bombs you just mentioned? Or, rather, were they the victims of a specific ethnic group? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I don't know if this is a follow on from this question, but we've checked: The question of bombs arose in evidence-in-chief. It did not arise in cross-examination, Your Honour. And so if this is a question following from the previous one, then I'm objecting because it's not a matter arising.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have virtually exhausted the re-examination now, haven't we? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That is what I'm trying to do, Mr. President, if the Prosecution would allow me to do so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem is that according to the rules of this Tribunal one cannot venture into new areas or follow up in examination-in-chief with questions if those areas were not covered during cross-examination. That is the procedural situation we are faced with now. So the objection of the Prosecution is well founded according to our practice. 
Any other questions? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
In that case, Mr. President, I have just two more questions -- my last two questions and that would be the end of my re-examination of this witness. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, during your cross-examination, mention was made of about 67,000 dead -- and you said the number was even higher -- 67,000 dead in Kigali at the beginning of the fighting. Do you know whether this figure corresponds to the Kigali population as you knew it at that time -- that is, in April 1994? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
When I answered that question, I didn't have the necessary time. I'm saying that there were even more dead than 67,000 in Kigali, and I would've liked to be asked the dates when that figure was put forward. But that figure must have been possible at some point in time during the conflict. Moreover, the figure was exceeded in absolute terms, but the second part of the question was not clear to me -- or, rather, I do not remember it. Could you please repeat it? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I wanted to know whether that figure reflected or corresponded to the Rwandan population in 
April 1994? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
Well, Counsel, it was no longer just a matter of the Kigali population, it was just a matter of the Rwandan population. You had all these displaced people -- the hundreds of thousands of people who fled to places where they thought they would find safety. They came from several préfectures, particularly from the north in Ruhengeri, Byumba and Kibungo. They also came from the préfecture -- or, rather, the préfecture of Kigali-ville is a small préfecture in the province of Kigali. 
So, people also came from the surrounding areas of Kigali-ville, that is, from Kigali-rural as it was known. So it is very difficult to give you an exact number of Rwandan citizens who had come into the capital city. In fact, perhaps, you may even have had more victims than the population of Kigali town. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness, now my last question: When you undertook to work exclusively on behalf of the Red Cross at that time, was that a mandate of the government that you were carrying out or was it a voluntary choice made by you? 
@WITNESS BDC: 
No, I have been a member of the Red Cross since the age of 13, and as I said, in secondary school, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover), I became a Red Cross instructor. **********************************************. I was a Red Cross instructor, as I said, I had international training, and as I told you I did not belong to any other organisation, be it political or any other organisation. I belonged only to the Red Cross. 
I acted on my own volition to put my strength and energy at the disposal of the Red Cross. It was not because of any order whatsoever; it was not an obligation arising from the government. It was my own personal decision which, moreover, put me in difficulties with my family, because without this commitment to the Red Cross, I would have accompanied my family when all foreigners were evacuated on the morning of the 6th of April. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I thank you and I wish you a safe return to your place. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours the re-examination of this witness has come to an end. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- well, let me first ask: I saw there was a reference to a secondary school here. Shouldn't we place that under seal? Indirectly through the knowledge of Mr. Renzaho's birthplace, we suddenly got some information, didn't we? Do you agree, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That's entirely correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So at 16:18:08 in the English version, we will delete the words after: "As I said in secondary school..." then follows the deletion, and then we continue with, "I became a Red Cross instructor". The rest is maintained but these words are under seal. 
Then, a question for you, Mr. Witness. 
You said you met Mr. Renzaho ten times from the 15th of April to the 3rd of July. Can you recall how he was dressed during these occasions? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, sometimes he was in military uniform and at other times in civilian clothes. The civilian clothes were rare given the conditions in which he lived. He would wear a pair of trousers -- a military pair of trousers, which enabled him to feel more comfortable in the conditions in which he was. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, you mentioned that you had your team in the Sainte Famille church. What kind of team was that? How many people and what kind of work did they carry out? 
@WITNESS BDC:
I am thinking particularly of two officials who were at Sainte Famille. They had full powers to use medical staff. Amongst the displaced persons, we also had medical staff who helped our teams. The tasks which they were asked to carry out -- I think I spelt them out. As people recovered and as the hospital was being emptied -- which hospital was overcrowded, we decided to take some patients into the camps so that the ambulance health care delivery should be continued to be provided to them in those camps. 
So, we continued delivering them health care from the ambulances -- as we also provided them with food supplies, we also wanted to make sure that the food supplies were not misused. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Your two officials were busy in looking after people who needed some attention? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, yes, those who were wounded and who had to continue receiving health care. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
And they were inside the church? 
@WITNESS BDC:
Yes, each of -- each of them had a room made available to them. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
And how many hours did they spend there? 
@WITNESS BDC:
They were there on a permanent basis. In fact, it was also for security reasons that they were there on a permanent basis. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This team was a Rwandan team or foreigners? 
These two persons were they Rwandans or not? 
@WITNESS BDC:
The permanent team comprised nationals, or locals, but the daily visits were also carried out by our expatriate colleagues. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Munyeshyaka, was he a good man or a bad man during the events in '94 in relation to the refugees? 
@WITNESS BDC:
I would say that Munyeshyaka rendered significant services to our humanitarian action in Kigali town. A short while ago, we were talking about a letter written about him. I remember that he was somebody who was very efficient. He had problems with both belligerents. There was some kind of defamatory campaign that was waged against him. He was a victim of that defamation campaign. I believe he's somebody who needs justice. 
Knowing how he was committed -- before the 6th of April and after the 6th of April, and the problems he had before he fled to France -- the problems he had in refugee camps. I do not know that -- somewhere or somehow, you have been told that he was threatened by the militias before he fled. 
So, I am saying that this is a good person and he deserves some justice, and you will find much truth from him regarding what I'm saying. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this defamatory campaign, when did it start, according to your knowledge? 
@WITNESS BDC:
It started -- or, rather, it was started by the Interahamwe well before the 6th of April. I think, I mentioned this fact. He refused to -- or to mediate for a group of Interahamwes and he became their enemy. 
I've also been told that from the 1st of May when the Sainte Famille church was bombed -- in fact, that was indeed on the 1st of May, on that day 115 people were wounded and, I believe, about 
10 or 15 people died there and then. 
Shells fell repeatedly on the site, more than six shells. I do not know what happened. So on the spot, there were journalists of Radio France, I believe, who came there. They gave an interview or they conducted an interview and that was against the rebels. 
So, from the 1st of May, Mr. Munyeshyaka became a target to be killed -- a target to be killed by the rebels. So I have specified the dates when this defamatory campaign against him started. This was trivial to him; he had problems with both belligerents, and I think he needs justice, this gentleman. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. That was the end of your testimony. We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you very much indeed. 
@WITNESS BDC:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Can I be authorised to greet Mr. Renzaho? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, when the hearings are over today, then I'm sure that can be looked into by the witness protection unit. 
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the pseudonym of the next witness? 
@MR. CANTIER:
It's PPV, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
While that witness is being brought in, should we deal with a couple of administrative issues? 
You may know that this Chamber will hear a very little portion of a new trial, which we will be starting before this summer vacation. I'm referring to the Nsengimana trial which starts on the 21st of June. The purpose of this is only to hear a very few witnesses, approximately five. And the reason why we are doing this is that if we do not start this trial now, it will be difficult to ensure progress of that trial after the recess when this trial will be more or less completed. 
But the Bench is very anxious to ensure that that interruption caused by the Nsengimana trial will not cause any disruption in the flow of witnesses in the present trial, and we look to the parties in order to see how we can in a very smooth way find a way, for instance, when there is a need for a little break in-between witnesses, allow a few days for that trial, while we are ensuring the witnesses in this trial to arrive. 
So I'm just mentioning this, and we will consult with the two parties as to how to do this in the most efficient way. I am mentioning this now already three weeks before the situation arises so that you can plan, and the Bench is at your disposal so as to facilitate the situation. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm conscious of the fact that there is a witness in here. But I'm also conscious of the fact that in the last ten days we have had communicated, I think, two personal information sheets of the remaining 14 -- last 13 or 14 witnesses. We do not have any other information about the remaining witnesses, or official information as to who, if there are going to be some that are to be dropped, or whether they are still to -- all to be called. 
I raise it now, Your Honour, because we do have the pending motion. 
Now, I must put on the record, Your Honour, that it's now at least six weeks after the date in which the information was meant to be provided to us. I am gravely concerned, especially if the Accused is to testify, which from my understanding if he was to, it would take perhaps a week or so. It reduces the amount of time from today's date until that last week to a point where I am not able to assure the 
Trial Chamber that we could conduct investigations. There are, I believe, four cases in Defence mode with limited resources in Kigali and elsewhere to carry out proper investigations. We still don't have the information -- and apart from those for whom we have received it, I must say the motion which I had hoped may be moot, I'm afraid is not moot, and I wanted to draw that to the Trial Chamber's attention. 
$(Witness entered courtroom)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS PPV:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will revert to you very shortly. We will just sort out some administrative issues before your testimony starts. Please bear with us for a moment. 
Maître Cantier, do you have any comments to what we just heard the Prosecution say? 
You are saying, Mr. Moses, that you still lack sufficient basis to investigate 12 witnesses, is that so? 
@MR. MOSES:
I believe it's 11. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you indicated exactly to the Defence which 11 these are? The Defence knows that? 
@MR. MOSES:
We indicated that last time we met, I believe, Your Honour. It's from Witness HIN, who is the one who is subject to the motion for an amended amendment of the protected measures, down to number 36, HEC. 
Of those witnesses, we have now received personal information sheets for number 26, Witness BIT; and Witness 29, NAH. 
We don't have any further details or official confirmation as to whether, which of those other witnesses have been contacted, which of them are refusing or not prepared to testify, which are going to testify. So we have to proceed on the basis that they are all wanted by the Defence to testify, and yet here we are on the 4th of June and we still don't have the details. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's the question, Maître Cantier, from number 24 to number 36 only the situation in relation to number 26 and 29 is clarified. Do you any comment? 
And what is particularly interesting is not whether you are doing your very best, which I'm sure you are doing, but when there will be a result? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Well, I do understand, Mr. President, that we need to get results, and I understand what the Bench is saying. 
Let me say that we used last week to make progress, and I can say that Wednesday at the latest we should be able to know exactly which witnesses will be able to appear or able to come. 
As we have received the personal identification information sheets, we have passed them on to the Prosecution. 
Now, Mr. President, for the weeks ahead of us, and in relation to what you just said, it was my understanding that we will not be sitting next week. Is that the case? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that is not the case. We will be sitting not only this week, but also the next week and the week starting on the 18th. And in that week, we will sit on the 18th, 19th and 20th. It's only from the 21st that the Nsengimana trial may interrupt us. 
@MR. MOSES:
If I can assist my friend? I'm sure that we were advised -- and I'm sure my friend is saying that because I believe the parties were advised that there was a difficulty with Trial Chambers next week, and that there were going to be -- that we were not sitting next week. I believe that was -- the parties had been advised of that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This Trial Chamber is available. This Trial Chamber is ready to hear this trial in this courtroom. 
@MR. MOSES:
Good.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But in view of what you are now telling us, I will double check. 
@MR. MOSES:
Yeah, I -- I just wanted to say that, because I think that's the reason why my learned friend is saying that to Your Honours, because I think there was an understanding from the parties that we had been advised of that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the source of this information? 
@MR. MOSES:
I'll -- I'll have to go and check emails, et cetera, Your Honour, but I understood there were going to be three blocks, as it were, anyway. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so this will be looked into and clarified by tomorrow. 
But you had more to say, Maître Cantier, and we are listening with great interest.
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, that was my first concern, because we organised the arrival of witnesses or the flow of witnesses based on that information that came from your cabinet, Mr. President. 
So we had anticipated an interruption for next week and thought that we would resume on the 
18th or the 21st of June, as we had been informed. But, last week, we were told that we will resume effectively on the 18th of June, that is, the 18th, 19th and 20th of June. And then there would be a pause from the 21st of June -- the 21st and 22nd of June and the week following. It is on the basis of that programming that was given to us that we organised the arrival of witnesses. 
Mr. President, if that information were to be incorrect, then we would need to reschedule and work again with the WVSS to address things differently. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is probably some lack of information. By tomorrow morning, we will clarify the situation, rest assured. 
Maybe we do not possess all the necessary information here now. Maybe what you have heard is correct. Let me double check, but tomorrow we will know. 
That was the first point. Is there any other point in view of what we've heard from the other side? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Not really, Mr. President, except to restate that by Wednesday we should be able to provide a conclusive position with the Prosecutor, and we have maintained contact with them regularly in respect of the witnesses who will ultimately appear in this Court. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And could the situation be that, in fact, the number of witnesses may be less than from 24 to 26? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, absolutely, Mr. President. Mr. President, yes, less than the maximum number because we went to see those witnesses and asked them whether they would come to testify. And in our planning and in view of the information that we received, we thought that it would be possible to hear our witnesses before the 13th of July, except for the expert witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. There will be less than 13, and there is reason to believe that we can finish the exact number before the 13th of July. 
We will then come back to this on Wednesday, and we thank you for your explanations. 
The next witness is Witness PPV. 
Good afternoon, again, Mr. Witness. You are a protected witness and have to tell the truth. 
The registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness PPV in French) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document there with your signature, Mr. Witness, isn't that so? 
@WITNESS PPV:
That is very correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PPV:
Yes, very correct.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours, I'd like to request that we go into closed session for the testimony of this witness, in view of the attendant danger that may arise from the disclosures in his testimony, and the fact that he might be easily recognised and, therefore, exposed to danger. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If there is no objection, we note the particular situation of this witness and his title, so we will then move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 76 to 79] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning, Witness. 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Good morning, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, in order for us to continue, I would like you to remind me of some answers that you gave to my questions yesterday, answers relating to your positions. Yesterday you said that it was, indeed, around the end of the month of May that you found yourself in the positions you held in the Muhima sector. 
Is that correct? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
We joined the Muhima unit and we were deployed at the Avenue known as Avenue des poids lourds and that neighbourhood was known as Kiovu des pauvres. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness, was it at the end of May -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we get the spelling? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
Yes. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The spelling of that avenue, please? Do we have it? 
Was it Avenue des poids lourds? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, that is it, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's known to us. 
Please proceed. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, there was also Kiovu des pauvres. I don't know whether it's correctly reflected on the record. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Was it, indeed, at the end of the month of May that you found yourself in that position which you just mentioned? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
For how long did you hold that position? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
We held that position until the 3rd of July. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
From the position you held, Witness, can you tell the Court the approximate distance between you and the enemy forces? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Please give me some time to enable me to remember. I would say that between us and the enemy positions, the distance was about 2 to 3 kilometres. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. From your own position, that is, the position of your squad, was it possible to 
see -- or, at least, to carry out patrols around the Panafrique hotel? Do you know the Panafrique hotel? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
The Panafrique hotel was near the Sainte Famille church; I knew that hotel well. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I believe the Hôtel Panafrique is not -- doesn't pose any problem regarding the spelling. It is true that I do not have it on the spelling list, but I think there will be no difficulty in spelling that name. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when your troops patrolled around the Panafrique hotel, did you notice that the hotel was still operating or running while you were in your position? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I think I went to that hotel twice, and I was able to notice that the hotel was running. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you say it was running, does that mean that there were clients at the hotel? Is that what you mean to say? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I did not go into the rooms of the hotel, but when I passed in front of the hotel, I saw people having a drink in the bar. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. In spite of the fighting that was going on between your forces and the enemy forces opposite you, the people of that area carried out or went about their normal duties. Is that right? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
No, most inhabitants of Remera and other neighbourhoods where fighting was going on came to seek refuge in that neighbourhood. But the inhabitants of the neighbourhood in which we were, stayed in their houses, apart from a few of them who went to the Sainte Famille church in order to seek refuge there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, considering the exchange of gunfire between the belligerents, was it possible to hold meetings in that area in the front line area where you were? Was it possible for people to assemble in that area in order to hold meetings? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
That was not possible. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. Did you carry out patrols around Sainte Famille between the 16th and the 
17th of June 1994? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And during those patrols, did you notice any incident in the said area? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I think it was on the night of the 16th to the 17th of June, when we heard gunfire coming from the 
Sainte Famille area. This was at about 5 a.m. We went to the Sainte Famille church and there we met corpses. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. Witness, the gunfire you heard, which were the forces involved in the exchange of the said gunfire? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
In the morning, I went with three gendarmes and were able to notice that the inhabitants of that area had fled, but when they saw us arrive, they came to meet us and told us that RPF troops had come, and that they had shot at the inhabitants of the area. They also said that the troops had abducted some people. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Did they also tell you that -- 
@MR. MOSES:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, just the beginning of the question, "Did they also tell you", I'm afraid, is a lead-in to a leading question. Yes, the question should be phrased, "Did they tell you anything else or what did they tell you?"
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, depending slightly on the continuation, such a beginning is risky. 
What is your question then, Maître Nekuie? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I'm going to rephrase my question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When the residents described to you the attack carried out by RPF troops, did they tell you about any reaction from the government forces? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I do not clearly understand the question, Counsel. Can you please repeat it? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm going to do that, Witness. The RPF forces that attacked during that night, did they face any resistance? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
The residents of the area told us that there was no resistance. RPF troops came and shot and also abducted some refugees. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. Can you remind the Court of the exact date when you made that observation? Was it the 16th or the 17th of June? We should be clear on that. 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
We heard the gunshots at about 4 a.m., so it was on the 17th of June. So, as I said, it was at about 
4 a.m. when I heard the gunshots and it was the following day in the morning that I went to the location to find out what had happened. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. And for how long did you stay at the site in order to make that observation? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
There was a parish at that place. There were also schools, so I had to go into all those buildings. I'm not sure, but I believe I stayed there for about one-and-a-half hours. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Did you notice that there were wounded persons amongst those who were there? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, there were wounded persons amongst them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were there many? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
The wounded were many. I believe the attackers had launched many grenades. There were many wounded people, in fact, some people were even dead. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And were there many people who died -- or were there relatively a small number of people who died? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I saw a few people who died, but the residents told me that some of the dead had been buried by the members of their families. But I would tell you that I was able to see between 15 and 20 bodies. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. While you were making those observations, did you see Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho, préfet of Kigali-ville, did you see him at that location? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
After you made your observations, what did you do next? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I was with three gendarmes, so I sent two of them to the commander of the Muhima company to report to him the events. Then, I returned to my position; I left the other gendarmes at the site. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. In the course of that day, did you ever return to that same site? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
No, I did not return there, but other gendarmes went to the site in the evening. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you say, "In the evening", what are you referring to? Was it in the afternoon or was it really in the evening? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I sent gendarmes between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. to find out whether there were any residents there or whether they had all left. On their return, the gendarmes told me that there were very few residents who had stayed in the location. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
I'm sorry -- Mr. Witness, was it on the 18th of June or the 17th of June? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
It was on the 17th of June. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did the gendarmes tell you in their report that Mr. Renzaho was also at that location, in addition to the residents of the said location? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I do not know whether you're referring to the gendarmes, which I sent to Muhima, or those that I sent on patrol at the Sainte Famille church. But, in any case, no one told me that Mr. Renzaho was at that location. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness, I'm referring to the gendarmes that you sent on patrol at the Sainte Famille church. Did they tell you that Mr. Renzaho was also at that site since you had already left? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
No, they did not tell me anything of the sort. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. And in the days that followed that incident, did you continue patrolling around the Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you have the opportunity of meeting Mr. Renzaho in that location while you were on patrol? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I never met Mr. Renzaho in the course of the patrols that I carried out. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
For how long did you patrol that area? I mean, in the course of one day, for how long would you patrol in that area? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
We started our patrols at 6 o'clock, and we would return at 10 o'clock. Then, we would send another team at 2 p.m., and that team would return either at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., and then we would stay the night in our position. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. If -- during those patrols, if an authority like the préfet of Kigali-ville was in the location, would that have gone unnoticed as far as you were concerned? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
If I had met him on that site, I would have noticed him, and if the gendarmes I had sent had seen him, they would mention that to me, but they did not do that. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you very much indeed, Witness, and that was my last question in my examination-in-chief. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I've concluded the direct testimony of this witness, thank you -- come to the end of the direct testimony.

Thank you very much.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, am I correct if I summarised your position that you were a junior officer in the gendarmerie?
@WITNESS RCB2: 
That's correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you ever see the Accused, Tharcisse Renzaho, from the 7th of April through till the beginning of July 1994? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I did not move about often, so I never saw him during the period referred to. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And it's fair to say that he would have been dealing with persons in the gendarmerie not of your level -- not as a criticism of you -- but he would have been dealing with more senior officers in the gendarmerie. Isn't that correct? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, if he needed to -- or have recourse to the gendarmerie, he would have contacted my superiors, not me. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you've told us that at Remera there was -- there were more than 100 gendarmes. Is that correct? Prior to the 6th of April, three groups of 37, I think you had said. 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, that is what I said yesterday. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And when you moved to the Kacyiru camp, it was still operating, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I did not go to the Kacyiru camp, I went to the Muhima camp and it was then that we were sent to that position, which was at the Avenue des poids lourds. I never went to the Kacyiru camp. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you went to the ETO, that was still functioning, wasn't it, as a gendarmerie camp? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Are you referring to the ETO camp? When we went to the ETO, what you had there was a brigade -- the Kicukiro brigade and the brigade was still operating. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And when you arrived at the end of May at Muhima, am I correct that at Muhima there was based the Kigali mobile group of approximately 265 gendarmes? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I do not know the number of troops who comprised the Kigali mobile group. I was based in Remera, and thereafter I went to Kicukiro and later on to Gikondo. It was around the end that we were posted to the Muhima task force. Therefore, I do not know the number of gendarmes who were in that mobile group you mentioned. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, would you agree with me that prior to the 6th April there were roadblocks that had been established throughout the city or around the city of Kigali that were manned by gendarmes? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Personally, I never saw a roadblock manned by gendarmes during the war. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, prior to the 6th of April? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
In fact, those were not roadblocks, they were checkpoints for vehicles. Those checkpoints were manned by gendarmes, and the said checkpoints were at the place called, quote, unquote, 
19 kilometres. Therefore, it was not a roadblock to check people, but rather a checkpoint for checking vehicles. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You're telling us that you saw no gendarmes on roadblocks at all from the 6th of April through to 
July 1994, is that your evidence? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Gendarmes never manned any roadblock. Gendarmes were in given positions and carried out patrols. I never saw any roadblock manned by gendarmes throughout the period of the war. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you aware, Witness, that the gendarmerie had a specially trained and equipped unit to take down roadblocks, known as the Jali -- J-A-L-I -- group? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I believe that unit existed. I heard people talk about it, but I was not -- I was never a member of the said unit. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, as a gendarme were you familiar with the statute setting up the gendarmerie? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Not really. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, were you aware that the gendarmerie nationale was an armed force set up to maintain order and to enforce laws? Were you aware of that? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, I was aware of that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you aware of the fact that members of the gendarmerie could, when absolutely necessary, resort to the use of firearms when they or other persons are victims of violence or assault? Were you aware of that? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I did not clearly understand your question, Counsel. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you aware, Witness, that members of the gendarmerie, such as yourself, could, when absolutely necessary, resort to the use of firearms when the gendarmes or other persons were victims of violence or assaults? 
@MR. MOSES:
For Your Honours and for the record, I'm referring to Prosecution Exhibit P. 8 and this is from section 8. But I didn't want to show the witness -- I'm simply going to go through a number of matters, and I think it's quicker if I do it in the way in which I am. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You said P? 
@MR. MOSES:
P. 8. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, Witness, did you hear my question? Were you aware of the fact that gendarmes could resort to using firearms in those circumstances? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
In the context of their duties, gendarmes could react for self defence -- legitimate self defence. I was fully aware of that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And were you aware that gendarmes could also use firearms to disperse a crowd? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
They could not use loaded firearms. There were other means that they could use in order to disperse a crowd. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you're not familiar with the legislation which provides authority for gendarmes to use firearms in those circumstances? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Gendarmes could not use firearms that were loaded to shoot at the local population. They could use tear gas or water cannons to disperse crowds, but not bullets. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, were you aware that the legislation provided that members of the gendarmerie nationale may resort to the use of firearms without prior authorisation from authorities when the crowd or the rioters have either carried out attacks aimed at killing, acts of destruction, looting or attacks on public buildings? Were you aware that you could use your firearm in those circumstances? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
The question is too long, Counsel, I did not clearly understand it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'm suggesting to you, Witness, that the gendarmerie nationale statute, in fact, authorises gendarmes to use firearms when -- without prior authorisation -- when crowd or rioters carry out a number of things, including attacks aimed at killing. Do you agree with me that the act provides for that? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Gendarmes must be discerning in their exercise or performance of their duties. When it becomes necessary to save the life of someone who is going to be attacked, the gendarme may use all means available to him to disperse the assailant. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, would you agree also that the gendarmes -- their functions include endeavoring to arrest ringleaders of disturbances and persons who have committed criminal offences? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, they have that right. Gendarmes must arrest those who commit crimes and hand them over to the competent authorities. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Between the 6th of April and the 3rd of July, Witness, how many persons did you arrest? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I've already told you the positions which I held, and the patrols that I carried out. When I was at the Avenue des poids lourds I arrested somebody who had a weapon and handed that person to my superior; that is the only person I arrested during the period you just mentioned. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, yesterday you said that the killings were happening at night, not during the day. Is that really your position, Witness? The killings that were taking place in Kigali were only happening at night? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yesterday, I told you that I did not personally see any members of the population being killed. In the mornings, when I began my patrol I would see dead bodies, but I never saw anyone being killed; that was my testimony yesterday. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you were a trained investigator, is that right? Do I understand from your evidence yesterday, a trained investigator? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
From the time hostilities resumed, we stopped the investigations. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you didn't carry out a single investigation of a single killing that you saw? Is this what I understand? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
It is necessary to put together an entire file in order to conduct an investigation. But because we were at war, we did not have the time to conduct an investigation which ordinarily requires a lot of time and resources. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you a gendarme in October 1990, Witness? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, I was. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you take part in the arrest of several thousand Tutsis who were held at places, such as Nyamirambo stadium, without files? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I was not in Kigali at that time, I was at Rwamagana. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay. Well, even without investigating, would you agree with me that a large number of the bodies you discovered in the mornings were found by roadblocks? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Not only near roadblocks, dead bodies were found everywhere -- on the roads, in the villages, but one could not know who had killed those people. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, can we just focus for the moment on the bodies by roadblocks. You'll agree that there were bodies by roadblocks; can we agree to that? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I have already told you that I saw dead bodies everywhere. Which particular roadblock are you referring to when you talk about dead bodies near roadblocks?
@MR. MOSES: 
Just listen carefully to the question. All I'm asking you, yes or no, did you see dead bodies by any roadblock in Kigali in the course of your duties? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
No. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This answer, Mr. Witness, referred to which time period? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
The Prosecutor asked me whether I saw any dead bodies near roadblocks during the war. My answer related therefore to the dead bodies that would have been near roadblocks. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So your answer includes the period from April to July '94? You are not now referring to October '90? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
Mr. President, I have not understood your question properly. Would you please kindly repeat it? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In view of the exchange between you and the Prosecutor, I need to make sure that the communication is efficient. You have said that you did not see any dead bodies by any roadblock in Kigali. When you say that -- 
@WITNESS RCB2:
(No interpretation)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- listen, when you say that, does that refer to the period April to July 1994? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
Between April and July 1994, I saw dead bodies, but the dead bodies I saw were not near roadblocks. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, only a matter of -- Witness, only a matter of two minutes ago, I asked this question: 
"Even without investigating, would you agree with me that a large number of the bodies you discovered in the mornings were found by roadblocks?"
And you answered: "Not only near roadblocks", and went on to say where else they were discovered. 
Why did you say "Not only by roadblocks" if you are now saying that you saw no bodies near roadblocks? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
What I said is that I never saw any dead bodies near roadblocks. I said that I had seen dead bodies, but the dead bodies were not close to roadblocks. I saw the bodies all over, in the villages, on the roads, but I never saw any dead bodies near roadblocks. That was my answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have in two languages, both in French and English that you said not only close to roadblocks, Mr. Witness. Is that a misunderstanding? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
Wherever I went, I never saw any roadblocks. I never saw any dead bodies near roadblocks. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know what happened to Tutsis who went to roadblocks, Witness? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I have just told you that I never saw any roadblocks. Why are you putting that question to me? I have already answered that I never saw any roadblocks. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So that we are quite clear and that there is no misunderstanding, are you saying that during April to July you never saw any roadblocks in Kigali? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
When I left my position in Remera, I went to Gikondo and then later on, took up the position at 
Avenue de poids lourds and Kicukiro. These were times of war and I was in charge of those positions to which I was assigned, and I was not in charge of roadblocks. I've already told you that I never saw any roadblock. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Witness, were you aware that there was a civil defence programme in Kigali? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I heard mention of the civil defence programme once over the radio. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what was the purpose of the civil defence, according to what you understood? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
If I recollect properly, I believe it is Prime Minister Kambanda who talked about civil defence. He said that each member of the population should protect themselves whenever they see the enemy. But given that I was personally in charge of those positions to which I was assigned, I am not in a position to tell you how the civil defence programme was conducted. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In the positions that you held with the gendarmerie, are you aware of any infiltrators that were arrested by the gendarmes? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I have not quite understood your question, which position are you referring to? 
@MR. MOSES: 
As a member of the gendarmerie, in Kigali between April and July 1994, are you aware if any person was arrested as a suspected infiltrator? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, I heard mention of that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How many? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I told you that I personally arrested one individual who was bearing a firearm. We were at -- on duty in Mburabuturo in Nyamirambo, and some infiltrators were arrested by the Muvumba battalion. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The name -- 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
At that time, three people were arrested. 
@MR. MOSES:
I don't know if -- thank you.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So it was possible still to arrest people for certain things, wasn't it? Despite the breakdown in the system that you've described?
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I have not quite understood your question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you told us that it was difficult to arrest people because of the war situation and you need a file to arrest someone. Now, here you arrested someone in spite of the war situation. Any comment? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
I have no comment to make on that issue. All I can say is that I personally arrested one person during that period. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Apart from your visit to Sainte Famille or Saint Paul's on the 17th of June, were you aware that gendarmes went to Saint Paul's a few days earlier on the 14th of June? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I was not aware of that information. If such a thing had happened, I would have known, because I was ************************************ you have just mentioned. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Were you aware that Tutsi refugees were massacred at Sainte Famille on the morning of the 17th of June, later in the morning? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
At that time, I was at Sainte Famille. It is not only Tutsi who were killed. Tutsi and Hutu alike were among those killed. When the RPF shot at the refugees who were at Sainte Famille, both Tutsi and Hutu were killed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm talking about at a later period of time in the morning. It would have been a time after the time that you said you had left Sainte Famille. Were you made aware of an attack later that morning by militia and others, including gendarmes at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Please repeat your question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You told us you arrived at about 5 o'clock in the morning on the 17th of June at Sainte Famille, correct? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
No, I told you that I arrived at 6 a.m. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, and you stayed for an hour and a half, correct? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So I'm talking of the period after you had left -- after 7:30 in the morning, were you told of an attack by militia and gendarmes on Tutsi refugees in Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I was never given that information and such an attack never took place. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay. Have you met the Accused since you left Rwanda in 1994? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
I met him in the camps in Zaire, yes, I can confirm that I met him in the camps in Zaire. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And were you fighting with the Accused in the Congo in the years from '94 to 2000? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I think that we need to return the favour to our friends opposite, because when we raised this issue yesterday, we were reminded that they are not in any way related to the matters before the Court. So I don't think we should broach issues that are outside of the scope of this trial. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will come back to your request for admission of the document after this evidence. For the time being, we overrule the objection. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Was he one of your superiors in the armed forces in the Congo during that period -- any portion of that period? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
You know that refugees are not entitled to go to the battle front, and by the way, as refugees we didn't have the resources that would enable us to fight. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. So I take that -- your answer to that question as "no"? 
@WITNESS RCB2: 
Yes, the answer is no. 
@MR. MOSES:
I've got no further questions, thank you, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Re-examination. 
No re-examination. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, look at me, I'm asking you -- I'm talking to you. You said you went to Sainte Famille at 6 a.m. on the 17th of April 1994 and you left at 7:30 a.m., is that right? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
Yes, that is correct. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
And you were told that some of the people killed by the RPF, that the corpses had been buried by their relatives at that early hour. Is that what you told us? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
I was told that the corpses had been picked up by members of the family and relatives, and people who were concerned by that. But I do not know whether the bodies were buried. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
And the last question: Are you sure you were in Kigali during the genocide, Witness? 
@WITNESS RCB2:
I was in Kigali during the war. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness. We would like to thank you for having come the long way to the Tribunal to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home. 
Should you wish to meet with the Accused that will be arranged by the witness protection unit. Thank you very much indeed. 
@WITNESS RCB2:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then ask that the next witness be brought in. 
Meanwhile, there is a pending issue concerning the report which was referred to by the Defence yesterday in connection with the previous witness. The Defence wanted to tender it as an exhibit, and we deferred our ruling until we have had the opportunity to read this Garreton report. 
We have now done so. We see that part of the report refers to the mandate of the Tribunal, other parts do not, but still the report may provide a context. The OTP has asked a couple of witnesses about the Accused's activities in the Congo afterwards; this is arguably relevant. The witness knew of the report and there is no problem with the authenticity of the report. And we will therefore admit this document as the next Defence exhibit, which is then, Mr. Matemanga?

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness GOA, we are now in open session and your examination-in-chief continues. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness GOA, how often did you leave your home during that period to go to your parents' home? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I did not count the number of times. But going to my parents' home was like going to my home, so although we did not live in the same location, my parents' home was my home. So I went there regularly to find out how my parents were doing, but I cannot give you an exact number of times on which I went to my parents' house. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
The roadblocks that you say were erected by the population, with the collaboration of some secteur officials, at times were these roadblocks essentially or basically manned by civilians? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Let me tell you that at the beginning, the roadblocks were used or set up as a military strategy. Then later on, some of the people who were at the roadblocks took advantage of them to racketeer members of the population who went through the roadblocks, and to steal in the surrounding neighbourhoods of the roadblocks. 
As far as I'm concerned, security was being provided by soldiers, and yet those who manned those roadblocks to my mind were like bandits. And I can give you the names of some people whom I recognised at the roadblocks. However, let me tell you that there were some very well-known civilians who manned the roadblocks and committed offences at those locations and mistreated members of the population who went through the roadblocks. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Those people you have referred to, Witness, did they work in collaboration with the officials of the cellules or the responsables of the cellules whom you referred to a short while ago? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
As I have already told you, I saw one Selemani, Gatete, and one Ndanda, who were often in the company of the conseiller of Biryogo at the Gitega roadblock. I was able to recognise one Ntwari, who was there and another one known as Abdou. 
All those people whom I have mentioned were self-declared leaders of the roadblocks. But as far as I'm concerned, they were not providing security for members of the population. In fact, they were doing the opposite. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are four names. Can you help us with them, please? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, those names are not on the list, Mr. President, because we did not have much time to work with the witness. 
Gatete is G-A-T-E-T-E, Gatete; Selemani, S-E-L-E-M-A-N-I; Ndanda, N-D-A-N-D-A; Ntwari, N-T-W-A-R-I. And there was also Abdou. I heard the name Abdou, and I would suggest that the witness, who mentioned that name, should spell it.

@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you have the opportunity to notice that these people were also working or acting under the orders of the préfet of Kigali-ville? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At the time, did you already know the préfet of Kigali and were you in a position to know whether they were acting under his orders? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
All I can tell you is that at the time I was a student; I was not a politician; I did not belong to any political party. But I was interested in the things that were happening in my country, and the situation in my neighbourhood. 
Now, as far as the préfet goes, I knew him as préfet of Kigali-ville. But I cannot say that I saw him during that period or that he came to chair any meeting whatsoever in our neighbourhood. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At that time, Witness, did you listen to the radio?

Yes, I listened to programmes over the radio.

Did you have the opportunity to hear a message from the préfet of Kigali-ville asking the inhabitants to set up or man these roadblocks?
@WITNESS GOA: 
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you say that these people acted in collaboration with some officials of the cellule or the secteurs, as you said, was this an observation that came to you ordinarily, or is something that you observed only as you went on the main road, which you have described? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
You see, I never knew that I was going to answer these questions and write down any names for that purpose. But as I went often on that road from Nyakabanda to Gitega, I have mentioned the example of houses that were looted and no measures were taken to check that. But Conseiller Karekezi was present, and there were others collaborating with him. He was one of the officials who spent the entire day with members of the population. 
Apart from that person whose name I have already mentioned, I did not see any others. And it is not on all occasions that I saw him, but it was only when I went from Nyakabanda to Gitega that I had occasion to see him. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
For how long did you go along this -- undertake this journey? How many months, approximately? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I went through that road throughout the entire period I was in Kigali. I always had to go to the residence of my parents to find out how they were faring. I told you that I left Kigali on the 4th of July.

I went to the Bulinga commune at the Gitarama préfecture. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you remain in Rwanda since that date? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
No, I did not continue residing in Rwanda. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Was there any specific reason why you did not remain in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Because of the war, everybody, and particularly myself, had to move to avoid being killed. As the fighting advanced, I had to move to areas where no fighting was taking place yet. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Since you left Rwanda, Mr. Witness, have you been concerned or disturbed because of the events that took place between April and July of 1994? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Problems are always there. Even today, I still face security problems. I do not feel I am safe, as I would like to be. If that could have been the case, I would have returned to my country. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you prosecuted personally regarding these events -- in connection with these events? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That was my last question, Mr. President. The examination-in-chief of the witness has been concluded. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Is there any cross-examination of this witness? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I will be brief, Your Honour. 
##
$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, you testified for the Defence in Karera -- the Karera trial, didn't you? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And at that trial you testified that you didn't see Mr. Karera during the genocide, correct? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you testified that you didn't see the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge during the genocide, correct? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You testified that you didn't see any soldiers or policemen taking part in the looting or killing of civilians either, correct? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And today you are testifying that you didn't see the préfet of Kigali during the events of April to July, correct? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You did see policemen, didn't you, at the secteur offices? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you saw gendarmes in the area also, correct? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
As far as that is concerned, I must say that gendarmes are different from soldiers. But they all form part of the military organisation, so they could all be described as soldiers. But -- but to avoid any misunderstanding, I must say that I also saw policemen looting, and I also saw soldiers. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Good. Thank you, for that. Now, your parents left their house in Kigali in the secteur that you have told us they were living in and went to Gitarama, didn't they? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Nibyo. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the Prosecutor please repeat his question for the French interpreter? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
My question was that your parents left their house in Kigali, in the secteur you have told us they were living in, and went to Gitarama, didn't they? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Yes, that is correct. But I must specify that if my parents went to Gitarama, that did not stop me from monitoring the house, even though my parents had left. Maybe I did not explain this fact. But even after my parents left, I was still obliged to visit the house to find out how things were at the house. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When did they leave Kigali? Perhaps a month? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
These things happened ten years ago. It's even more than ten years, and I cannot remember with clarity the date when they left Kigali. All I know is that they left Kigali to go to Bulinga.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question was whether you remembered the month. Was it in April or May; do you remember? Maybe before? 
@WITNESS GOA:
I cannot remember the month for now. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, once they did leave, how often would you go and visit their house: Twice, three, four times a week, every day? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I did not write the times when I went to that place. All I know is that I went there very often, but I cannot tell you how often I visited that place. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Was it more than once a week? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you remember being asked in the Karera trial, a question was put to you by the President? And that question was:
"Mr. Witness, how many times did you actually leave your house per week? Say, in April, per week, how often did you leave the house yourself? Did it happen every day?" 
And your reply was:
"If you take into consideration the layout of the neighbourhood, there was no particular problem. I could go out and see the neighbours. But going out of the neighbourhood was more complicated. I could not go out frequently. I could do that, for example, once per week." 
Do you remember that question and that answer that you gave? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I do not remember clearly the question that was asked, and the answer that I gave, but your question did not specify the place where I had to go. But I told you that the Nyakabanda and Gitega secteurs were two neighbouring secteurs, and I do not remember the various areas where I went, particularly since I did not know that I would have to come here and answer such questions. Even if during that period there had been insecurity and everybody was afraid and movements were limited, I made an effort to go and visit the residence of my parents. That is all I can say. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You didn't stop in Biryogo secteur on your way from your brother's house to your parents' house, did you? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I had to go through Biryogo, but I was not obliged to stop because I had nothing to do there in the Biryogo neighbourhood. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You weren't from that secteur, were you? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
You are right. I was not a native of this Biryogo secteur. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In fact, you were a student studying in a different town altogether at that time; correct? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
You are right. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yet you feel able to speak with some authority about the authority that the préfet may have had in Kigali at that time? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
All I can say on this particular point is that there was a widespread insecurity, and even if we were not primarily concerned or personally concerned, since I was just a student, I had to know what was the situation in my locality. Maybe I did not take note of the details, but in my capacity as a Rwandese who was living in the locality, I was concerned by the security situation of the neighbourhood. And this was a war situation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You saw Conseiller Karekezi with policemen, correct? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How many policemen did you see him with? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I can't give you a specific figure because I was not aware at the time that I will have to answer such questions. I think I could have seen him with three or four policemen; and the other people who were with him could also have been wearing a uniform, but I could not identify them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, do I understand -- is it correct to say that you saw him addressing the population, who obeyed him? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
As I said before, this was a war situation and everybody was concerned with his or her own security. I cannot say that I took part in any of the meetings that he is reported to have organised. When I saw him, he was moving around, and the Biryogo road was a road that many -- it was a very busy road, and I saw him several times moving around. I did not take note whether, or what he -- I did not take note of what he was saying to the people nor know what their activities were at the time. All I can say is that I saw him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you provide a statement to the Defence on the 1st of April of this year? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Mr. Prosecutor, could you please repeat your question? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you sign a statement that was provided to the Defence for Mr. Renzaho on the 1st of April this year? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in relation to Mr. Karekezi, did you say in that statement that, "I saw him frequently moving around accompanied by his policemen and addressing the population, who obeyed him"? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
That is what I was saying a while ago. During such occasions I was on the road and I was going by, but I did not go and listen to his speech because I did not have time for that. I did not have time to listen to what he was saying because I was not concerned. I was, rather, concerned by the problems in my parents' residence where I was going. So I did not take note of what he was saying, but I would like to say that I saw him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
From what you observed, the lines of administrative authority had not broken down, had they? People were still obeying authorities. 
@WITNESS GOA: 
All I can say is that, at one point, some groups of bandits appeared and wanted to take advantage of the situation, and some members of the population, who were near the conseiller, could obey him. But we realised that there were some -- there were some slippages, but these were just things that I saw in passing. 
Actually, in the various secteurs, some members of the population took advantage of the situation to steal, and claimed that they were trying to ensure security. But, as far as the conseiller is concerned, I saw him moving around, but I never sat near him to follow or listen to what he was saying. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In that same statement you signed on the 1st of April, you went on to say regarding Mr. Karekezi that, "He encouraged the population to man the roadblocks erected, and requested them not to make any concession to the infiltrators who had just been discovered." Now, is that something which you recall saying in your statement to the Defence? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Could you repeat what you have just read out, Mr. Prosecutor? 
@MR. MOSES: 
In respect of Mr. Karekezi, you had also said in your statement that, "He encouraged the population to man the roadblocks erected, and requested them not to make any concession to the infiltrators who had just been discovered." Is that something you said to the Defence? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I would continue telling you that when I went through the Biryogo secteur, I realised that some stores had been looted and the conseiller, Amri Karekezi, who had been present, had taken no measures against these acts. I believe that he was in a position to do this. He could have prevented the population from carrying out these acts of banditry. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Who was the conseiller's superior in the préfecture, Mr. Witness? It was the préfet, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I have no idea. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Mr. Karekezi remained as conseiller of that secteur until July, also, didn't he? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I cannot give you the date when he stopped acting as conseiller, but all I can say is that I saw the situation I have described. And, in June, the situation had worsened. And I told you that I left the city on the 4th of July. I can, therefore, not answer your question. All I can say is that the fighting had become very serious in July, so I had to leave the town. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You were a young male Hutu and you had no problems crossing the roadblocks, did you? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I did not have any problems, but that does not mean that I was going around without any problems. Everybody who was carrying identity cards -- or identification papers, or who had nothing to fear, could go around. I was not the only one who was moving on the roads in Kigali. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The Tutsi in Kigali weren't so fortunate, were they, Mr. Witness? They were being targeted at the roadblocks and in their homes, or didn't you see that either? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
As far as that specific point is concerned, I can say that it is God himself who protected people in Kigali because everybody -- people who did not have identification papers, were known. And if you -- maybe you have not well followed up the situation in Rwanda. It's as if it is the Tutsis that were fighting the Hutus. 
There is a problem that I might not have talked about, but I will prefer to spare you the details because that may take us in another direction. But all I want to say is that Hutus also encountered problems. Tutsis are not the only ones who had problems. Bandits could refer to you as a Tutsi because they wanted to steal from you. Even if I was going around, I was also concerned for my own security. And if I did not have any problems, it's just because I was lucky. If people survived that situation, I think they were just lucky. And those who were not lucky, died. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I have basically finished my cross-examination. There is one small point I just wanted to elicit from him, the witness, in closed session. It's only a matter of a couple of questions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. We will move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 57 to 59] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera). 
$(Pages 51 to 56 by Judith Baverstock)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness KRG, we are now in open session and your examination-in-chief continues. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, please tell the Court the circumstances you experienced at the time the war broke out, the war you just mentioned a short while ago? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I have not quite understood your question. Do you want me to tell you the situation or to narrate the situation from 1990 or from 1994; that is, beginning with the 1994 war? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, I understood that your earlier reference was to the 1994 war, and my question was in relation to April 1994. So I am referring to the 1994 war, Mr. Witness. Do you now follow? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Yes, I do. The war resumed on the 6th of April 1994. We had just learned that President Juvénal Habyarimana's plane had just been brought down by the RPF-Inkotanyi. An announcement was made over national radio telling the population that a state of emergency had been instituted and the minister had announced over radio that all inhabitants should remain in their homes. This was a release from the ministry of defence issued on the 7th of April 1994. As far as I am concerned, the war officially started with the broadcast of that announcement. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you heard that announcement, Witness, did you personally comply with the instructions from the ministry of defence? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Yes, I personally abided by the instructions of the ministry of defence.
$(Page 60 by Judith Baverstock)
1645H 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. MOSES: 
So you remained at your home following that announcement, and am I to understand that all the other members of your family remained at home? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
After that announcement, most members of the population complied. However, Tutsis were being killed, and people fled their homes. On the 8th of April, my family and myself sought refuge at CELA. Later on, our conseiller said that everybody -- or, that any house that was not inhabited would be destroyed because it was a reflect -- or, rather, the fact that the homes were not occupied would be an indication that those people were Inkotanyi accomplices. So I was compelled to return home and to prepare food and take to my family members who were at CELA. 
@MR. MOSES: 
On which day did you return to your home, Witness? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I did not stay at the CELA myself. I went there to provide food to my family members who were there, and everybody was forced to go to the roadblocks to ensure security. And from time to time I spent the night there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, you accompanied your family to CELA on the 8th and then returned to your home on the same day; is that the situation, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Yes. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, why did your family choose to remain at the CELA while you returned to your house on that day? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I would like to tell you that it is not only my family which went to live at CELA. If I were to give you all the reasons for -- for the question you have asked, I am afraid I might be disclosing my own identity. So let me simply say that all members of my neighbourhood, that is, all the inhabitants of my neighbourhood went to seek refuge at CELA. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The inhabitants of your neighbourhood whom you have referred to, Witness, were they afraid of some special danger? And why would it have been so? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
I have already told you that from the 7th, Interahamwe had started to kill Tutsi, and even Tutsi women who were married to Hutus. And this did not only occur in my neighbourhood, it occurred across the country. So women, children, and young girls began to flee our neighbourhood to go to CELA. Even the young people who were opposed to the MRND party went to seek refuge at CELA. Killings within the population had already begun, and the youth who were opposed to the MRND party were being chased after, because they had been referred to as accomplices of the Inkotanyi. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that answer, Witness. Did you know the members of the population of your neighbourhood who sought refuge at CELA? Did you know any of them? 
@WITNESS GOA: 
Yes, I can give you the names of my neighbours who sought refuge at CELA. But I am afraid that by mentioning their names I will be disclosing not only my identity, but also theirs. And in that way everybody would know the person who has testified before this Court. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I understand you very well, Witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And from the witness's answers which relate to himself and to his family, I would like to apply that we return to a closed session, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have other sequences which would require a closed session, or is this the only one? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I will be putting some questions that require that we proceed in closed session, given the answers we are receiving from the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
My question was not correctly interpreted. I will try again: Do you have other portions, other sequences of the examination-in-chief which will also require closed session, or is this the only portion where you need closed session? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
My line of questioning will focus on the witness's family. And because he is not comfortable speaking about these issues in open session, I -- I believe this is the only line of questioning I have to the very end, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
To the very end -- with other words, the remainder of the testimony needs to be conducted in closed session; that's what you are saying, isn't it? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, we will move into closed session, then.

Defence, please proceed.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, Mr. Witness. Good morning, Counsel. 
Prior to beginning the examination-in-chief, Mr. President, I would like to clarify a point, because it seems that we in the Defence thought the pseudonym is AIE -- AIA. I don't know if this was a mistake on our part. Can the Court management tell us whether this is BDC or is or AIA? I don't know which pseudonym to use for this Witness, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you give us this document? 
Registry, just show this to the Defence, the personal information sheet. Can you check with them whether that document is correct? Please give it to them and maybe they can elaborate.
Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I think we have already heard from Witness BDC. He was one of the first six witnesses who testified. So I do believe that this should be, as my learned friend indicated, Witness AIA. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So this mistake simply comes from the fact that I was reading from the personal information sheet where the Defence had kept the old pseudonym and not replaced it with AIA. 
Thank you for correcting that, Defence. And we note for the record that this is, indeed, Witness AIA. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

##
$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, from your personal information sheet, you are a policeman in Kigali city préfecture. Is this correct? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When were you employed as a policeman in Kigali-ville préfecture, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
I was -- I started work in ***********. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What were your duties as a police officer, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
We were to provide security in Kigali town préfecture in communes -- that is, Nyarugenge, Kacyiru, as well as Kicukiro communes, as well as provide security at marketplaces of the préfecture. We also accompanied tax collectors to the marketplaces and shops whenever they were doing their job of collecting tax. In short, that was the mission assigned to the police force of the Kigali city préfecture. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
Mr. Witness, can you tell the Court what was the hierarchal structure of that police force, that is, if you remember? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
If my memory serves me well, the police force of the Kigali city préfecture was commanded by a gendarme major, whose name was Nyamuhimba, and the police force was placed under the orders of the three communes which I mentioned, namely, Nyarugenge, Kicukiro and Kacyiru. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What was the role of the préfet of Kigali city préfecture in the description which you have just provided us? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
The préfet of Kigali city préfecture was the authority responsible for the administration of the préfecture. But he did not have responsibilities in the mission of the police force. He was an authority whom I would describe as an office authority who had to work in an office, and therefore I would describe him as a bureaucrat. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, you were employed in ********. Could you please tell the Court what was the situation in Kigali city, security wise, prior to the events of 1994 in Rwanda? Can you please describe that to the Court, briefly? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
As a matter of fact, the emergence of the multiparty political system in Kigali city brought trouble, acts of violence arising -- or caused by the youth wings of the various political parties. Towards the end of 1993 there were even killings which targeted officials of political parties. I would say that, apart from those acts of violence, there were even landmines which were laid, as well as other explosive devices which were laid in certain places, including public transport vehicles. Some mine -- bombs were even laid at the bus station, the Kigali bus station. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, do you know whether at that time the police force of the Kigali city préfecture took measures in order to bring an end to that situation of insecurity? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
The police force of the Kigali city préfecture did not have the means to put an end to those acts. But what I can say is that at one point in time this situation was very bad, and Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho had to convene a meeting of the inhabitants of Biryogo and Nyamirambo neighbourhoods, a meeting which was held at the Nyamirambo stadium. He also convened bus conductors, as well as conductors of minibuses to that meeting. He invited officers of the gendarmerie, as well as units from the engineering company, which was in charge of determining operations. All the people invited to the meeting made recommendations to the members of the public, by telling them that they should inform security organs whenever they saw explosive devices. And, on that occasion, they advised public buses -- operators that they should check the contents of bags of potential passengers. 
People present at the meeting were invited to check -- police were asked to check on people entering marketplaces whenever we had to provide security to marketplaces. And this applied even to road -- bus stations. 
From 1993 there were joint patrols, including gendarmerie officers and UNAMIR soldiers. The joint patrols were organised in order to provide security to the city of Kigali. But that did not change much because insecurity continued to prevail in the city. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. Speaking of the resources or means of the police force, do you remember the resources available to the Kigali city police force in order for it to accomplish its mission? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
Compared to the prevailing situation in developed countries, the police force in Kigali city was not well equipped. Elsewhere, police forces have the necessary equipment to carry out their missions; they have truncheons, they have tear gases; they have even other equipment. But for the Kigali city préfecture, we only had Kalashnikov sub-machine guns which, even then, were not adequate, So we were supposed to use those weapons in our mission to maintain order and security. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When was this meeting which was convened at Nyamirambo stadium, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS AIA:
To tell you the truth, I don't remember the exact date, but it must have been at the beginning of 1993. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, the patrols carried out by UNAMIR and the gendarmerie, were they carried out in collaboration with the Kigali city police force? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
No, the Kigali city police provided security only at marketplaces, communal offices, secteural offices, head offices of some companies, such as the Utexrwa factory, which had signed a contract with the Kigali city préfecture. I have to say that the police force of Kigali city provided security to the head office of the Banque Populaire. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Apart from the police, which was under the authority of Kigali city préfecture, Mr. Witness, do you know whether the gendarmerie would also work with the authorities of the Kigali city préfecture? 
@WITNESS AIA: 
From what I know, the gendarmerie was under the ministry of defence. It was not under the ministry of home affairs and communal development. So those were two different administrative entities. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I believe that the following part of my examination-in-chief could well reveal the identity of this witness, most probably. So I respectfully request for a closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you refer to a factory which had signed a contract in Kigali, Mr. Witness; yes or no? 
@WITNESS AIA:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat the name of that factory, please, Witness or simply refer to it again as you did in your testimony? 
@WITNESS AIA:
I spoke about the factory called Utexrwa. And then there was also the Banque Populaire. 
@THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Utexrwa is spelt U-T-E-X-R-W-A. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the spelling comes from the Kinyarwandan cabin -- booth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 
We will then move into closed session, as requested. Is that for the remainder of the testimony or just for a portion of it? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
My fear is that it will be for the rest of the examination-in-chief, because he will talk to events which are related directly to his identity, and therefore could reveal his identity. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the duration of the remainder of the testimony is approximately? I am saying this so that those in the public gallery can know when they might come back. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At least two hours, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, yesterday when we were taking the break, you were explaining, in response to the question that I put to you, that the road safety company, when asked from when the weapon-free zone was established, end of December 1993, was in charge of roadblocks. I suppose that was, indeed, the answer you gave me yesterday, essentially. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
That is correct. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
(No interpretation) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, now, now. Can we observe speed and pauses, as we have mentioned a few times? So pause, Mr. Witness, between question and answer, please. 
And Mr. Nekuie will pause between the answers and the questions. 
Here comes the next question. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Very well, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you able to say who entrusted this duty to the Kigali road safety company? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
This duty was assigned by the general staff headquarters of the gendarmerie, who gave instructions for me to collaborate with the UNAMIR that, in the event that they request for troops to man roadblocks, I should not hesitate in assisting them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What was the purpose of this mission of establishment or erection of roadblocks, Witness? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
The purpose of the roadblocks was to search vehicles for weapons which were illegally in circulation. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you, indeed, have the opportunity to erect these roadblocks in some parts of Kigali city? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
They were particularly erected at the entrance to Kigali city, that is, Nyabugongo-Nychianga road and Nychibobo-Gikukinyi (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We need those two names, please. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you able to spell those two names? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Because they do not appear on our spelling list, Mr. President. 
@WITNESS RGI:
Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A. 
Nyabugongo, N-Y-A-B-U-G-O-N-G-O. 
Gitikinyoni, G-I-T-I-K-I-N-Y-O-N-I. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, during searches at the roadblock, was it -- did it happen that those who were -- did it happen that the road safety company people asked drivers to bring -- present their documents? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
That did not happen. The order to search for weapons did not include searching for or controlling identity documents. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And for how long did this collaboration with UNAMIR last? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
It started from when the free zone area was established up until 5th April 1994 and should have continued until the 6th. But on the 6th we waited for the UNAMIR troops, and they did not arrive. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you informed about the crash of the presidential plane, which occurred on that 6th April 1994? And under what circumstances did you get to know? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I got to know in a message from the general staff headquarters, disseminated to the gendarmerie units. And the title was as follows -- or, the -- it was drafted as follows: "This is to inform members of the units about the attack against the presidential plane and redouble your vigilance."
And the same telegram was inviting the unit commanders to a meeting, which was to be held at the senior military academy at 10 on the 7th. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you attend this meeting at the senior military academy on the 7th at 10 a.m.? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I went there as a unit commander. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you know if Colonel Renzaho was also present at that meeting? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I saw him there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
On this issue, Witness, because this testimony might just be a testimony of alibi, which I was not expecting -- so please be sincere in your answer. 
If you saw Colonel Renzaho on that day, say it honestly. And if you did not, then say it. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I saw him in the hall. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would like to say, for the benefit of the Prosecution, that this was not intended to be part of my evidence. But since it has come up, I might use it as an alibi, and I'd like to pray the Prosecution and tell them that it was not intended -- this information was not intended to be hidden away from them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please slow down. 
Mr. Witness, you are not observing the pause. 
Mr. Nekuie, you did not know during the preparatory conversation with this witness that this would come up? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I did not know, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, for me to keep to the line of preparation that we started, did you -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry. We didn't understand counsel. 
@WITNESS RGI:
(No interpretation) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes. Can you repeat your question, please?
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
The question was as follows: Witness, did you discuss the issue of roadblocks in the course of this meeting held on the 7th April 1994? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
No. The purpose of the meeting was different from the issue of roadblocks. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But in the days that followed the 7th April 1994, did the issue of roadblocks not become a serious issue for your company? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
You know that, following the crash of the presidential plane, the security situation in Kigali changed. Missions of gendarmerie units also went through some readaptation process. As far as my company was concerned, Kigali town was in a state of war, what is referred to as an active front, that is, that the fighting was going on at the door of the capital, and some sensitive installations had been attacked. 
So there was no need to erect these roadblocks, even though the general staff headquarters had entrusted me with the mission of erecting them to control vehicles on account of the prevailing situation. But I encountered difficulties in implementation of that mission, and I reported to my immediate superior. 
Regarding the difficulties, the -- all along the road to the main roundabout -- roundabout, all the way to Nyarutega, where I should have erected the roadblocks, there were so many roadblocks, some of them manned by civilians and others manned by troops of the Rwandan armed forces. I found it that it was improper to erect my roadblocks alongside those ones. That is why I reported to HQ that the situation on the ground did not allow me to easily accomplish my mission. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We lost something in two languages. You said, Mr. Witness, "All along the road to the main roundabout, all the way to --" someplace where you should have erected the roadblock. What was that reference, please? 
@WITNESS RGI:
I made reference to the Kigali main roundabout, and the Nyarutega bridge. The Nyarutega bridge is the bridge over Nyabarongo, between rural Kigali préfecture and the Gitarama préfecture. That is going towards Gitarama préfecture, for those who know the region. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Nyabarongo is well known, I think, N-Y-A-B-A-R-O-N-G-O, but that name of the bridge can you spell, please?
@WITNESS RGI:
Nyarutega, N-Y-A-R-U-T-E-G-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you get to know who asked the civilians to erect roadblocks and why the civilians erected roadblocks? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
To my knowledge, no one gave instructions for the roadblocks to be erected. And those roadblocks were erected by the residents, as part of their self-defence, so as to identify the RPF infiltrators and also to be able to report at the appropriate time on the advancement of the RPF so that the rest of the population can flee. Because it was normal, on account -- based on the account of those who lived in the combat zone, that the RPF was committing atrocities along the way, killings and so on. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you make reference to civilians, what kind of persons were present at those roadblocks, since you had the opportunity to see them? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
It was a mix of persons. There were young people, adult men of about 30 years old. There were even people who were loafing around because there were people who were roaming around the town. And they took that opportunity to go to the roadblocks because, very often, they would draw some advantages from that. 
Apart from the role that they were -- they were expected to play, at some roadblocks some -- the people who were manning the roadblocks were harassing road users. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you make reference to harassment, what are we to understand? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
By that I mean that they were stealing from users -- road users, taking their money, other belongings, and sometimes they would even use violence to achieve those objectives. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Given this conduct from those persons, did the authorities of the gendarmerie and the army not find it necessary to take measures to correct them? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I have told you that fighting was raging on in the capital itself from the 7th of April. The camp of the Presidential Guard had been attacked; Kacyiru camp had been attacked, and it became necessary to reinforce those positions so as to face up to the attackers. 
The personnel of the -- the troops of the armed forces was not enough to engage in activities relating to restoring law and order. They were engaged in fighting. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, do you think that activities of outlaws facilitated the fighting of the army against the enemy, as you said? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
It, rather, made it difficult. It made the task of the army difficult. 
On the one hand, these roadblocks which had been erected were often the place of refuge from -- for people who had deserted the war front, troops who had deserted from the war front, who had come to loot the population and engage in looting activities. And that reinforced the position of the outlaws, and that also weakened the front. Consequently, the command did not have a reserve unit to call upon to come and strengthen the hand of the army. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Are you able to tell the Chamber if, among those people who were so -- were perpetrating so much trouble at the roadblocks, were militiamen of political parties? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
When you make reference to militia of political parties, it will -- this was only de facto because there was no legal provisions accepting those militia organisations. Most of the parties had what we call the political youth wing of the parties. The MDR (sic) had what was referred to as the Interahamwe. MDR had JR Inkuba -- GDR Inkuba. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when you mention these names, please spell them before you move on to other names for the purposes of the transcripts. Thank you.
@WITNESS RGI: 
I spell Interahamwe. I-N -- 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is known. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Inkuba, I-N-K-U-B-A. 
The youth wing of the PSD was known as Abakombozi, A-B-A-K-O-M-B-O-Z-I. 
Not to forget that the opposition party of -- the opposition parties also had their youth wings. On all those roadblocks, one could not distinguish whether the people belonged to the youth wing of the MDR, PSD or RPF, since they had their elements within the capital. 
One could also note -- one could not also tell if these were deserters because, very often, these deserters, when they flee from the war front, would wear civilian clothes.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness. How, then, do you explain that all these persons were at the roadblocks and that the authorities did not -- the civilian authorities did not even take any measures in collaboration with the military authorities to stop their activities? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I have told you that, regarding the armed forces, the units were engaged at the war front. The troops who were -- who remained behind at the gendarmerie, apart from the defence of the Camp Kanciru (sic) and the defence of the sensitive installations, had been added to guarding the displaced -- the war-displaced persons. There was the Sainte Famille, the minor Saint Paul seminary, Mille Collines, and the Notre-Dame de Citeaux lycée. All those positions were guarded by the gendarme. 
As far as the préfecture authorities are concerned -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you are coming up with all these names again. 
Do you need this, Mr. Nekuie? We will get the names on record, but do you need these details? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Quite honestly, these were not the answers that I was expecting. But since I could not interrupt the witness, I allowed him to go on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But let me say it once again: You are absolutely authorised to interrupt the witness. We encourage you to interrupt the witness. Please stop him. 
Now, let's get these names. There was the Sainte Famille and the minor seminary of Saint Paul. And then we have the Mille Collines and the lycée Notre-Dame de Citeaux. These were the names; isn't that true, Mr. Witness? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS RGI:
Yes. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Witness. I just want you to explain to me why this passiveness in relation to the conduct of those people at the roadblocks, whereas in the town you had civilian and military authorities. But I believe you have answered it somehow, even if you went further in your answer. 
And now let me ask you, was it possible, all the same, for those authorities at least to go through those roadblocks and to accomplish the missions that you started mentioning within the town? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
It was not possible because I, myself -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I really have to insist on this. You're making the work of persons in the courtroom difficult. Can you please remember the pause? It's not because we are difficult; we simply need to ensure that everyone can perform his or her task. 
Now the answer. 
@WITNESS RGI:
I was saying that it was not possible because these people were heavily armed. Because I, myself, as a unit commander, had difficulties accomplishing the mission that had been entrusted to me when they required me to enter roadblocks. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, when you say these people were heavily armed, what type of arms are you referring to and where did they get them from? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
These were war weaponry. Now, these weapons came from various sources. You know that, in times of war, there's a proliferation of wars -- of weapons in a country, and that was the case for Rwanda. 
With this war, the Rwandan armed forces had some deserters and those deserters who go with their weapons. The civilian population itself managed to illegally acquire weapons by buying from soldiers who wanted some money. 
Further, with the resumption of hostilities, some civilians had soldier friends who would bring them these weapons upon their request. At these roadblocks, apart from military vehicles which were evacuating people who got wounded in war, evacuating them to military hospitals established in places that had not yet been hitten (sic) by the war, very often there are weapons in these vehicles. They will seize these weapons and ammunitions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, again, can you slow down? Your words have to be interpreted. You require the interpreter to talk very fast. When he speaks fast, those who are transcribing what you are saying are faced with challenges. It's really very simple: Pause and speed. Please help us. 
@WITNESS RGI:
Thank you. 
Let me repeat: The sources of these weapons, I was saying that in times of war there is a proliferation of weapons, and that was the case for Rwanda. These weapons came from various origins. There were the deserters from the war front. They leave with their weapons and ammunitions. There were -- there was the population, who buy weapons from soldiers, soldiers who wanted money, who steal weapons from their colleagues and sell them. I have a case in point where I intercepted a Kalashnikov in the boot of a vehicle which was coming to Kigali, and I reported that. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, are you able to just limit yourself to listing the sources of the weapons without going into the details regarding such -- details that -- examples that you are giving? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Then there was the procurement by civilians of weapons through their friends. There were also weapons coming from the RPF to arm their infiltrators. These weapons were also at the roadblocks. As I said, that at the roadblocks there were persons whose origins one is not able to determine. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you know if, among the these -- among the population, there were persons who received weapons from the préfecture authorities -- who received orders from the préfecture authorities? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
To my knowledge, the préfecture had no stock of weapons, and the acquisition of weapons by the préfecture had to follow a certain procedure. The préfet would make a request to the ministry of interior, who, in his turn, will make a request to the minister of defence. And the minister of defence had no stock of weapons. The weapons were managed by the staff headquarters. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Witness, but you've answered my question. I just wanted to know if, from the experience that you went through at that time, the préfecture authorities had had to give weapons to some of these persons. You answered with a no. So let's move on, if that doesn't worry you. 
Witness, these explanations that you are giving give the impression that it were -- was these persons who imposed their law in Kigali town. Is that what the Chamber is to understand from your testimony? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
That is what the Chamber could understand because they were heavily armed and they operated freely, without any problems, because no one could intimidate them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
At least the Chamber understands it now, since the witness was assisted so much in choosing that formulation. 
The next question. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I did not realise that I was suggesting the -- the answer to him. I'm sorry about that. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you said that those persons were heavily armed. Now, the regular units of the army, who had the kind of difficulties that you referred to, but they were also armed at the time that they got to those roadblocks. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Just some troops. This was just some troops and not a unit. And just these troops cannot face up to this large number of outlaws. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How many outlaws were there compared to the regular troops of the army in the town, if you are aware, during this period from April to July of 1994? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
In Kigali town I told you that there were youths of different political parties. With the resumption of the hostilities, we were added to the population from Nyacyonga, which was coming into town, fleeing the hostilities. 
The units -- as for the units that were there, there was only one unit that was entrusted with the mission of counter-infiltration on the road alongside the Nyabarongo river. 
And let me spell out Nyabarongo -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, we already have spelt that. Thank you, very much, Mr. Witness. 
But you mentioned another word in your answer. You said the population came from somewhere into town. Can you repeat that place? 
@WITNESS RGI:
Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. So it's the name we had before. 
Now, the question by counsel did not really invite an analysis. He wants a number. How many outlaws were there compared to the regular troops? Can you give us an assessment of the number or the respective size? That's what he wants. Try to answer that very briefly. 
@WITNESS RGI:
I am not in a position to give precise figures, but they were spread throughout town. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, your answer is satisfactory, as far as I am concerned. 
Could you tell the Trial Chamber what mission you were entrusted with during this period, because I -- I believe I understand that, from the 5th of April onwards, you stopped manning roadblocks. So what were your activities from the 6th of April onwards and for how long? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
From the 6th of April onwards, the unit was entrusted with the mission of defending Muhima and would receive ad hoc orders from missions from the general staff. 
************* a team to the Belgian embassy in order to strengthen the team of guards. ***************** the religious authorities, who had sought refuge at the house of their colleague of the Kigali archbishop towards Gitarama, and I had difficulties fulfilling that mission. But, with the assistance of God, they arrived safe and sound. 
I was also entrusted with the mission ************ the people who came from the Amahoro hotel to the governmental area because the area was under RPF control. And there was an exchange with people who had sought refuge in their localities I mentioned previously. ******************* the expatriates. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you need an overview of all his assignments from the 6th of April onward, Maître Nekuie? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
If the witness had merely indicated that he carried out missions involving escorting or transfers, because that is, indeed, what I understand it is, it would have been sufficient, but I believe the witness wished to provide further details. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, we shall later on deal with the details of your missions. But let me continue by putting to you the following question: Throughout all the missions you have partly listed to us, did you ever conduct missions in collaboration with the authorities of the town of Kigali? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
There is one in particular where there was an authority representing the préfecture. It was the mission for the transfer of the displaced persons due to the war, which was done at Mille Collines, and the préfecture was represented by the bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune. I believe he was representing the préfecture. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
Witness, for how long did you conduct such missions in collaboration with the town authorities, or even all the missions you listed previously? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
When I was in the company of the authorities, we conducted three trips, and the displaced persons from the Mille Collines hotel were all evacuated. There were further operations that were to be carried out, but then I was assigned to another unit. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you were assigned elsewhere, can you tell us when that occurred and what was your new occupation within that unit? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I was assigned elsewhere in late May of 1994, and I was sent to a combat unit which was defending the Kacyiru camp. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And how long did you fight in that unit? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
It was merely for the month of June because on the 4th of July we had to leave the town of Kigali, which was completely circled by the enemy. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
While you were fighting in this unit, did you ever receive reinforcements from troops from the civilian defence system? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
At the Kacyiru camp, we were not reinforced by any troops of the civilian defence. And, as far as I know, the civilian defence was only in -- at its very beginnings. It had just been launched, but time did not permit for it to be fully implemented. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for your answers, Witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the examination-in-chief of this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. If I can just indicate at the outset, by virtue of the fact that there have been one or two new matters raised, I'm not quite sure how we will be for time. I may need a brief adjournment to go to my office and obtain some other material which might be needed in the course of cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You want to come back to the break at a later stage, or -- 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. I'm in Your Honour's hands, whether you want a 10-minute break now for me to obtain that material from my office or you want me to go as far as I can without. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just start as you indicated, and the moment you need a break, you just tell us and we will grant it. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, will you agree with me that the gendarmerie is an armed force created for maintaining and restoring public order and for the enforcement of laws? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I concur with you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And yesterday you said that, however, in a time of war, defence of the nation had a higher priority than that for which the gendarmerie was created. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I stated that it was an extraordinary mission that the gendarmerie was carrying out, following the orders -- perhaps I did not specify that that mission was carried out following orders from the ministry of defence, which would ask the gendarmerie to come to the assistance of the army. So this is clarification I failed to provide previously. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You'll agree with me that nowhere in the act which sets up the gendarmes, or in any other act, does it state anywhere that the role of defending the nation is to take priority over the core role of the gendarmerie, which is to defend -- sorry, to maintain and restore public order and to enforce the laws? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I did point out that, if the number of troops permitted, such missions were carried out jointly. 
@MR. MOSES: 
With respect, Witness, that doesn't answer my question. My question is, do you agree with me that nowhere in Rwandan law, the law governing the gendarmerie or elsewhere, does it state that the gendarmes in a time of war shall defend the country and that that takes priority over their core role and the reason for their formation, namely, to maintain and restore public order and to enforce the laws? 
@MR. MOSES:
I see my friend standing. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President. Without wishing to interrupt the Prosecutor, I wish to point out that if questions deal with acts, or laws, we might end up in the same situation as yesterday when I was trying to have the witness refer to them and there was an objection from the Prosecution. So I wonder whether this is a correct line of questioning, to ask the witness whether there are acts mentioned when others cannot be. 
@MR. MOSES:
$(Microphone not activated)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are not interested in your legal interpretations, but it is now an attempt to find out the basis for your statement about priority. And do you know whether there is any legal basis for your statement that priority had to be given to defend the nation? 
@WITNESS RGI:
There are the core missions entrusted to a force, and, indeed, the defence of the territory was the prerogative of the Rwandan army. And, as specified in the laws, the gendarmerie was a force which was set up in order to maintain public order. 
But to that mission it is also added that the gendarmerie can come as reinforcement, following orders of -- from the minister of defence, if that is deemed necessary. And the chief of staff can execute, or implement, the orders given to him. 
When the minister is giving orders, he is aware of the men available to him. I did not mean that priority was to be given to the operational defence of the territory by the gendarmerie. But what I did mean was that, once the country was under attack and the gendarmerie was requisitioned, that was the first order it was to comply with. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And on what basis do you say it was the first order it was to comply with? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
There's an order of priority in the missions entrusted to you by the -- your superior, and when a mission is entrusted to you, your superior takes into account the means, or resources, available to you in order to implement such missions. For instance, if you are faced with difficulties in the implementation of your mission, then you should explain what that difficulty is. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, in fact, the basis of you saying that it was to be given higher priority than your core role was because of the orders you were given from your -- your superiors? Is that the correct understanding? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Yes, that is what I mean. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Witness, during the period of 7th of April to the time you left Kigali, you'll agree with me that you were able to regularly cross through roadblocks throughout the city? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
As I stated, I was not able to do so because the first mission I was given was to set up roadblocks. And I was not able to do that because of the difficulties I mentioned. 
The second mission, which was the -- to escort the religious authorities, during the course of that mission, I was, myself, stopped at one of the roadblocks, and the religious authorities left unaccompanied. And, thanks to God, they arrived safe and sound. 
So even ourselves, as law enforcement officers, had problems crossing through the different roadblocks for the reasons I mentioned previously. There were people who were, like, mad. They were armed, and they did not obey anyone. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just so I'm quite clear about this, are you telling the Trial Chamber that, apart from the missions that you have specified during the course of your evidence in-chief, you never crossed roadblocks in Kigali during the period of April to July 1994? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
We passed through roadblocks when we transferred the displaced persons because we tried to convince them of the interest in exchanging such prisoners. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry. I'm going to stop you. You're not listening to my question. My question was quite specific, and it was, apart from the missions that you have listed, are you telling the Trial Chamber that you never passed through roadblocks in Kigali from April to July 1994, yes or no? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I passed through some roadblocks because all the groups were not as aggressive. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You will agree with me that the gendarmerie had the right to arrest people because they were illegally armed, yes or no? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I would say no. The gendarmerie did not have enough staff, as I told you, since the gendarmerie troops had been sent to combat in Kacyiru as well as assigned to the defence of the displaced persons and sensitive areas. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see that the French translation was different than your word "right." That's why he answered as he did. Do you want to repeat your question? 
@MR. MOSES:
I will. Thank you, sir. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, the gendarmerie had the legal obligation to arrest people who were illegally armed at those roadblocks, weren't they, under such a duty? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Could you please repeat your question? 
@MR. MOSES: 
The gendarmerie had a duty to arrest people who were in possession of illegal firearms at those roadblocks; isn't that correct? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
That is correct, but we did not have enough resources to disarm these people. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You've talked of the activities at the roadblocks, and you've referred to looting, stealing and some assaults. The reality of the situation, Witness, is that thousands and thousands of people were killed at those roadblocks in Kigali during the period April to July 1994, weren't they? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I did not talk about any attacks or assaults. I talked about people being beaten up. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, let's talk about killings, shall we? Do you agree with me that there were thousands and thousands of civilians who were killed at the roadblocks in Kigali from April to July 1994, yes or no? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I was not aware of any such killing. But what I would hear was that there were killings elsewhere, in the other neighbourhoods. But at the roadblock I passed through, there were no deaths. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You say these roadblocks were set up to identify infiltrators. How was one able to identify an infiltrator, Witness? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Well, those manning the roadblock were those who would choose their mode of operation, and I had not given them any orders, so that I could not respond to your question. I do not know how they would go about it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to one roadblock or to several roadblocks that you had knowledge of, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS RGI:
I am referring to the roadblocks I was aware of, but it was probably the case in other -- on other roadblocks that might have been set up in other neighbourhoods. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Just so we're quite clear about this, are you telling the Trial Chamber that you were unaware that people, civilians, were being asked to show their identification cards at roadblocks so that those there could determine what ethnicity they were? Is that your evidence, you weren't aware of that? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I told you that I did not know how they would go about it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you aware during April to July 1994 that Tutsis were being targeted and killed on a massive scale in Kigali by reason of their ethnicity? Were you aware of that, Witness? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
As for that, I would say that it was not only the Tutsis who were killed in Kigali town. The -- there were Hutus who were also killed in the town. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That doesn't answer my question, Witness. Do you agree with me that Tutsis were targeted and killed on a massive scale in Kigali by reason of their ethnicity? Do you accept that or don't you? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I did not know. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So do we take it from that that you -- well, do you agree that there was a genocide of the Tutsi civilian population in Rwanda from April to July 1994, Witness, or was that something you are also unaware of? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
It was only through the media that I heard that when I was in exile. To say that the Tutsis were targeted and killed on a large scale by the Hutu, I do not accept this assertion. 
I've told you that this roadblock (sic) were manned by outlaws who were going around the town. And they were made up of various types of persons. I have told you -- I have made reference to the youth wings of the political parties, and that in those youth wings there were Tutsis as well. And these Tutsis, if certain reprehensible acts were committed, they did participate. 
I made reference to the RPF youth wing, or infiltrators. I did not talk about Tutsis or Hutus. But the fact that it was proved that there were infiltrators in the capital, well, I did not dwell on how the infiltrators got into the town and how their number increased overnight. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Would you agree with me, Witness, that there were at least 100 gendarmerie officers who were in Kigali during the period of April 6th to July 4th, 1994? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
You are saying about a hundred gendarme? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Gendarme officers. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I don't think so. 
Even if there were, they had been assigned to various services, various units, with different missions. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I just asked about the numbers. And would you agree with me, Witness, that during that same period, April to -- the 6th to July the 4th, there were only three gendarme officers who were killed during that period, those being Major Murekezi -- spelt M-U-R-E-K-E-Z-I; secondly, Major Burakali, spelt B-U-R-A-K-A-L-I; and the third, Captain Munayabarenzi, spelt M-U-N-A-Y-A-B-A-R-E-N-Z-I? 
Those were the only three gendarme officers killed, weren't they? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I knew them, and I can give you the circumstances under which they were killed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, that's not my question. My question is, would you agree with me that those were the only three gendarme officers killed in Kigali during that period? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
There were others who died on the war front. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm talking about in Kigali, Witness. They were the only three in Kigali, weren't they? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
There was a second lieutenant, called Mudenge, who had deserted from his unit and who was engaged in looting activities. He was killed. From what I heard people say at the roadblocks erected by the outlaws, at ONATRACOM, this officer was being sought after actively, and he was part of the -- he was in the unit to which I was assigned later on. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. We'll take into account him. 
Now, amongst the gendarme forces in Kigali, would you agree with me that they numbered approximately 3,000, or slightly less than 3,000, gendarmes in Kigali during that time? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I am not able to give you an accurate figure because I was not in the personnel office. But, if you wish, I can give you the details on the units. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, thank you. 
Now, the person you referred to, the second lieutenant, was that Mudenge, M-U-D-E-N-G-E? Is that the correct spelling, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS RGI:
That is correct. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, would you agree with me that there were less than 20 gendarmes who were not officers who were killed in Kigali from April to July 1994? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Are you able to tell me the circumstances under which they were killed? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm just asking you, Witness, whether you would agree with me, as an officer, that there were approximately 20 or less gendarmes killed in Kigali during that period. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I have told you that the gendarmerie unit -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, my question only requires a yes or no answer. You either agree with me or you don't. And, if you don't, you could give an indication to the Trial Chamber as to how many gendarmes you would say had been killed. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Let me tell you, the gendarmes that I am able to say died on the war front -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, I don't want -- I do not want that degree of specificity. I've asked you a question, namely, do you agree with me that there were approximately 20 gendarmes, or less, who were killed in Kigali from the 6th of April through to early July. Do you agree with me? I don't want to know the circumstances of any of their deaths. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
There were gendarmes who died, but I do not know their number. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And would you agree with me that, during that same period, three-month period, in terms of the Rwandan armed forces, there were only approximately 100 FAR soldiers who were killed in Kigali during that three-month period? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I am not able to say that there were no deaths or losses -- losses in the Rwandan armed forces, given the fact that they were engaged in the war. But I do not know the number because the situation of loss of men was kept by the units, which would forward it to their respective staff headquarters -- general staff headquarters. 
As an officer in a unit with its own mission, I will not know the number of men who died in one or the other unit. For my own unit, yes, I am able to say, but, for now, I am not able to say that there were X number of losses. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree with me, Witness, that the Kacyiru camp, that gendarmerie camp that you have talked about, was never taken over by the RPF during the period up until the time that you left Kigali? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
The camp was taken over. I can have said that, and it became necessary to bring reinforcement from the army to come and fight in Camp Kacyiru for them to fight off the RPF troops from the camp. These were troops of the Huye battalion who were based in Kigali. 
I don't know if that answers your question. 
And, subsequently, the RPF troops remained in the neighbourhood of Kacyiru camp. Camp Kacyiru was about encircled halfway round, and there were only the portion -- the central portion facing Kigali -- facing Kigali town remained. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did the RPF get into the camp or not? 
@WITNESS RGI:
I have no clarification on that, but the camp was attacked. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
I thought you were there during June. Is that not right? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
In July (sic) I was present. 
I told you that half of the camp was surrounded. For those who know Kacyiru, the -- the RPF troops occupied the coffee plantations of Kacyiru camp. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to be specific here. Mr. Witness, I am now reading out what you said in French, and I want your confirmation that that was your first -- first sentence in your previous answer, "I was present in the month of June." 
Did you say that? 
@WITNESS RGI:
I was asked if the camp had been attacked, and I said in the early days, but I did not continue for the subsequent days because the RPF continued with attacks, skirmishes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must really focus on the questions. Did you say that in June you were present in the camp? 
@WITNESS RGI:
In July (sic) I was in the camp. My unit was defending the camp. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, again, are you saying June or July? 
@WITNESS RGI:
If I did say July, I must have overspoke -- misspoken. My mission was entrusted to me in May, and I carried it out in June. And -- and on a daily basis we carried out combats with RPF troops. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I have now heard you say "June" three times, and that's now what we have in English. 
Now, let's move on. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree with me, Witness, that none of the gendarmes who were killed, who were on active service, were killed at roadblocks, or anywhere else in Kigali, attempting to arrest anyone? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Can you please repeat the question slowly? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree with me, Witness, that, of those gendarmes who were in active service, who were killed in Kigali during April to July 1994, that none of them were killed whilst trying to arrest anyone? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I am not aware of this information. 
@MR. MOSES: 
We have heard evidence, even during the Defence case, of killings of perhaps more than 100,000 civilians in Kigali during that period. How many arrests did you or the men you supervised make for the killings of civilians during that same period? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Thank you for that question. With the resumption of hostilities, activities of the judicial police came to a -- a stop, and they engaged themselves exclusively to combat activities. So I am not able to say that we arrested one or the other person for this or that case. 
Further, each unit was entrusted with its own mission. I have told you about the mission entrusted to my initial unit, and then the other unit to which I was subsequently posted. 
I cannot -- I can, therefore, not give you additional information because the mission of judicial police was the duty of the Kigali group, which at that time was no longer operational in that area on account of the intensity of the war in Kigali town. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is that a long-winded way, Witness, of saying "none"? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I did not carry out any arrests. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Let's talk a little bit, if we can, about one of the tasks that you had, and that was the transfer of persons from the RPF side to your side, and vice versa. 
Would you agree that the discussions surrounding those transfers also involved the involvement of UNAMIR? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
The operation was led by UNAMIR itself. They designed the operation. At the time that they were receiving requests from persons to go and fetch their -- to go and get persons who were holed up on the RPF side, seek them out and bring them, this also on the initiative of UNAMIR. And the Rwandan party accepted it, as well as the RPF side. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You agree with me that the head of the gendarmerie was General Ndindiliyimana, correct? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the head of UNAMIR was General Dallaire, correct? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you report to General Ndindiliyimana? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I was given my mission by the general staff headquarters. And what makes me say that the operation was on the initiative of UNAMIR was as a result of many requests, plus the fact that there was a humanitarian situation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the question I was asking you was whether you reported to General Ndindiliyimana. Now, did you or not? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
A report was made regularly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
To him? 
@WITNESS RGI:
To the general staff headquarters and not to the person. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he there? 
@WITNESS RGI:
On which date, please? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, would you agree with me that these transfers took place during May? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I agree. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is General Ndindiliyimana someone who you respect? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
He was my immediate superior, and I owe him respect and obedience. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you aware that General Dallaire has testified at this Tribunal in the case of General Ndindiliyimana? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I am not aware. You are telling me. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. I want you to listen to an extract which I want to read from the cross-examination of General Dallaire by General Ndindiliyimana's counsel. And I want -- well, then have some questions to ask you about it. 
@MR. MOSES:
And for Your Honours, I've distributed the transcripts, and I'm reading from page 60, and from line 7. It's a question from -- from the Defence counsel to General Dallaire. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is extremely long. 
@MR. MOSES:
I'm not going to read the entire -- entire bit, Your Honour. I'm -- it has to do with the first eight or nine lines. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Just to put this in context for you, Witness, General Dallaire is being asked about a passage in -- a book that he wrote in which he had described a meeting with General Ndindiliyimana on the 21st of May 1994. 
And General Dallaire was asked about this -- what -- what General Ndindiliyimana's counsel referred to as a confession passage, and he read out the passage which I'm going to read you and ask you some questions on. 
"Before the attack, I had met at the Hôtel des Diplomates with Ndindiliyimana, who had finally reappeared earlier in the month at a political session in Gitarama. He had approached me to arrange to meet with me alone in Kigali. And so Ndindiliyimana and I sat together, ostensibly to resolve some gendarmerie operational concerns with the transfers between the lines. He seemed terribly ill at ease, but determined to speak his mind. He warned me that the préfet of Kigali was not to be trusted."
@MR. MOSES:
That's -- although it goes on, I don't -- I'm happy to read further, Your Honour. That is the relevant part. If Your Honour thinks I need to read further to be fair, to place anything else in context, I am happy to do so.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Go down to the word "there", please. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
"He went on and confided that Bizimana, the minister of defence, was despondent due to the failures in the field, the loss of his properties in Byumba, and the deaths of his relatives there." 
Now, Witness -- sorry, I should go on to say that General Dallaire confirmed -- and that's on page 61 at line 6 -- he was asked whether that was the gist of the conversation he had had and he said, "I remember that one". 
So, Witness, here we have a description of a conversation that took place between the head of the gendarmerie and the head of UNAMIR, where the head of the gendarmerie tells the head of UNAMIR, "Don't trust the préfet of Kigali". Now, that being from one who you have indicated that you respect, can I suggest to you that was a view, namely, that the préfet of Kigali was not to be trusted, which was widely held. Do you agree with me? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for the witness, please. 
@WITNESS RGI:
I do not agree with you, because each has it -- his or own assessment of the situation, and this is the assessment of General Ndindiliyimana regarding Mr. Renzaho. He has reasons to say so that only belong to him, and I cannot make any further comment on that point. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So you were aware that it was General Ndindiliyimana's view of this Accused, that he was someone not to be trusted? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I told you that I am not able to give my opinion as to the assessment made by them of Colonel Renzaho, that was their testimony, and if -- you should, rather, ask me what was my own opinion of Colonel Renzaho, and don't ask me to make any comments on other people's assessments. They were high officials; they would meet in meetings perhaps, in different meetings, and there might have been some points of disagreement amongst them. So I cannot go into such details, and I would ask to be spared doing such a thing. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, the question was whether you knew -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, there is possibly a difference between the languages. The question was "So you were aware that it was General Ndindiliyimana's view of this Accused, that he was someone not to be trusted". Was that what you just responded to, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS RGI:
That is indeed the question I just answered. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Did General Ndindiliyimana share his opinion of this Accused with you? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Could you please repeat your question, and at a leisurely pace? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did General Ndindiliyimana share with you his opinion of this Accused, namely, that he was someone not to be trusted? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
First of all, I did not give you my own opinion, and second, I was not aware of the opinion of General Ndindiliyimana regarding this official. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Can I suggest to you that he did not do that because he saw you and the Accused as being in the same camp, the same group of people that he was trying to dissociate himself from -- in that conversation? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Well, let me point out at this stage that the relationships and the opinions of such authorities should not be the subject matter of an examination here in this courtroom. 
And I will ask the President to, perhaps, spare me from answering such questions, because I believe these are personal matters that have nothing to do with official activities. If you are asking me whether the operation -- the transfer operation was jointly organised with the general staff -- the general chief of staff of the gendarmerie and the commander of UNAMIR, I would agree. But what I do know is that there were incessant requests from UNAMIR regarding the people who were imprisoned at the Amahoro stadium, and this transfer was a humanitarian operation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is nothing wrong with that question, Mr. Witness. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
We will move on, Mr. Witness. Do you agree with me that the distance between PVK and ESM, where a meeting was held on the morning of the 7th of April, is approximately 500 metres? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Not even that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And if one was in a vehicle one could do that trip, therefore, in less than one minute, couldn't one? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Yes.
Objection. I could provide clarifications regarding this matter. If you are exiting PVK from the ESM you would not spend a minute doing that because you have to give priority to other vehicles, and you also had to manoeuvre in order to turn, but for a vehicle that would be advancing, I don't believe even one minute would be necessary to cover the distance. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, it may be that I have some matters that I want to go to in closed session, which will probably take 20 minutes. I then would like to have a brief -- I don't know whether to do that now, and then come back to the events of the 7th of April, or whether we should take the break, for me to come back, finish off this topic, and go into closed session. I am in Your Honours' hands. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's try to stick to the normal procedure. The closed session now for about 20 minutes, then you can have the break and get whatever you need. You are now requesting a closed session? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to grant that. We will then have a closed session. After the break, will you then be in open session again? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour, but it will be reasonably brief, five or ten minutes to finish off the cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So to those in the public gallery, this courtroom will now be closed from now until 11:30.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 25 to 29] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness RGI, we are now in open session to conclude your cross-examination. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, do you agree with me that the Hôtel des Diplomats is closer to PVK than ESM is? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
To be specific about the distance, I haven't measured the distance. It's easier to go to the ESM than to go to Hôtel des Diplomats. Maybe they are at equal distances. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that. Now, would you agree with me that the meeting at ESM on the 7th of April commenced after General Ndindiliyimana arrived there at ESM? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
We were invited to that meeting, and there was -- there were those who had to lead, and the general -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We didn't hear the end of the witness's answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat your answer, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS RGI:
I said that I was invited to the meeting. I took part, and General Ndindiliyimana was present. Maybe I can give clarifications. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
That's sufficient at this stage. 
Do you agree with me that General Ndindiliyimana arrived at 10:15? That's when the meeting started. 
@WITNESS RGI: 
I did not talk about the timing. I talked -- I said that meeting was to start at ten. It may not have started exactly at ten, but the fact is that the meeting took place and General Ndindiliyimana was there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Just to summarise what you have said, you agree that it may have started some minutes after ten? 
@WITNESS RGI: 
Yes.
@MR. MOSES: 
With that answer, Your Honour, I think that's the end of my cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Any re-examination? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
No, Mr. President. 
@WITNESS RGI:
May I address the Court, Your Honours? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do. 
@WITNESS RGI:
I wanted to give some clarification regarding the cross-examination of the Prosecutor. He asked me questions on the number of -- numbers, that is a technical term. We are talking about numbers, but in terms of operationality, if each commander was asked how many gendarmes were operational on such-and-such a day, that is what will lead to taking account of the gendarmes, because people may fall ill, and there are those who are in charge of common services for the survival of the unit and so on and so forth. So you have to count the operational troops and not the number on the battlefield. 
Secondly, he asked me questions on my activities while I was in exile. He asked me whether I was in contact with Colonel Renzaho. That is within his rights. If he organises a resistance, whether I am entitled to participate. That is why I answered (sic) the question that he put to me. 
Thirdly, you did say that this was -- the proceedings were in closed session, but let me draw your attention to this, Your Honours. I am the one involved -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but now we are in open session. 
@WITNESS RGI:
Yes, but I want to point out that my security, where I live, will be more affected than ever. And at the end of this session, I am requesting from Your Honours to meet the accused person who asked me to come and testify. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
As for the meeting with the accused person, that will be arranged by the witness protection unit. No problem with that. 
When it comes to your security, we have endeavoured to ensure it by having the sensitive parts in closed session. 
As regards your additional information, in view of the cross-examination, the question goes to the Prosecution. Is there any follow-up based on what he just said? 
That's not the case. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, I just have two questions to ask you. Were the Tutsis targeted in Kigali between April and July 1994? 
@WITNESS RGI:
To say that the ethnic group was targeted, no. There was killing on all sides. There were killings and these killings were directed against either the Hutus (sic) or the moderate Hutus -- or even Hutus who were killed because of their properties because others wanted to appropriate their belongings. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
And the next question: Was there a genocide in Rwanda from April to July 1994, and if so, were the Tutsis the targeted group? 
@WITNESS RGI:
I refuse the term "genocide". People killed each other. There were killings. There was not -- the killings did not target one or a single ethnic group; it was against many or various groups. There were Tutsis who died, there were Hutus who died. So, not only the Tutsis were targets. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness. We would like to thank you very much for having come the long way to the Tribunal to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you very much indeed. 
@WITNESS RGI:
Thank you. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
During your cross-examination, Mr. Moses, you first referred to the transcripts in Military II for Wednesday the 6th of December, English version, page 60 and 61. Is that sufficient or do you want this as an exhibit? 
@MR. MOSES:
Those relevant pages are all that are required. 
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The reference is enough; you do not need an exhibit, or do you want to have it as an exhibit? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I don't need it as an exhibit, Your Honour, I don't need to clutter up the record any more. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. There is no request. 
Then, the ICG document, does that require any follow-up? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I would ask that it be tendered, obviously, only an appendix was specifically referred to. It may be that it is going to be referred to again, but I leave it in Your Honours' hands as to whether Your Honours consider there was sufficient cross-examination on the other parts for that to be tendered. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comments on this? The question is whether the front page, plus that page called appendix E, should be tendered. You are making a request, are you? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, I am. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Any comments on that? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, if this document will be entered, then the Defence will wish the entire document to be entered, because we may have to use it subsequently. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Defence did not really object to the tendering of the document but wants a complete version. Do you have any comment on that, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, if one looks through the table of contents, I had printed out -- apart from the appendixes that I have provided, pages 1 through to 17, which you will see on the -- under the table of contents, includes the topic "The Rwandan patriotic army versus ALIR". One then goes on to the Burundian armed forces, Ugandan situation, a section about Mr. Kabila, Angola, Zimbabwe, which I didn't consider at all relevant. So, I have no problem at all -- I am happy to produce up until page 18. If my friends want further matters included, again, I have no problem with producing other parts of it. I am not trying to hide anything, I am just trying to focus on the matters which I thought were relevant. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you have no problems with this document in its entirety -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
No. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- as produced by today? And with other words, not only the front page and E; you have no problems with that entire document being entered? 
@MR. MOSES: 
None whatsoever, and, in fact, it may, to be honest, save some problems in the future if we refer to witnesses who are prepared to discuss the other parts, we will then end up having an exhibit of the same name under two different exhibit numbers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will then simply admit this document as it is and note that only one page was actually used during cross-examination. That seems to be acceptable to everyone. 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 111. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And there is no need to place this document under seal. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 111 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we bring in the next witness, please? 
$(Witness entered courtroom) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Good morning, Witness. 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Good morning, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, what was your age, as of the 6th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was 22 years old. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And where did you live? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I lived in the ****************************** in Rugenge secteur. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I shall be using for the rest of my questions, Exhibit P. 3. This has been produced. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
And Witness, during the break, I am going to ask you to indicate on that sheet where your house was located. 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Very well. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But, for now, are you able to say close to which important building was your house located? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are in open session. 
@WITNESS WOW:
(No interpretation) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Hold on, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. I didn't have the reflex to think about that. So, for my initial questions, I would request for a closed session and then we will come back. I have about two or three questions which, in my opinion, relate very closely to the witness and which will require that we go into closed session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. We will do that. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 36] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
$(Pages 30 to 35 by Judith Baverstock)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness WOW, we are now back in open session in connection with the beginning of your cross-examination. 
@WITNESS WOW:
Very well. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, can you tell us what happened in your neighbourhood on the 7th of April, in the morning? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
On the morning of the 7th of April, around seven, we saw a vehicle arrive with members of the Presidential Guard. They arrived in our neighbourhood and we heard gunshots; they started firing. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you know whether anyone was killed at that time? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, some of our neighbours were killed, some families that lived not far from my place of -- my residence were killed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you remember the names of people who were killed at that time? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Stanis Nyirinkwaya was killed. A lady and her husband, whose name was Ngunda were also killed. Charles Rwanga was killed. And another lady called Kanakintama was killed, along with the girls who lived in the JOC hostel. They were all killed by members of the Presidential Guard. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, the first name you mentioned, I did not hear it properly. Who was it? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Nyirinkwaya, Stanis. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I do not have that name on my list, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the last name is probably the same as under number 304; and the first name is probably S-T-A-N-I-S. Would you agree with that, Mr. Witness, concerning the first name? 
@WITNESS WOW:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then this lady, Ngundalinda? 
@WITNESS WOW:
It was the husband that was called Ngunda, but he was shot down at the same time as his wife. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 265. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Ah, N-G-U-N-D-A. All right. Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, the third name? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I talked about Kanakintama.
@MR. CANTIER:
Number 151 on the list. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
And, then, Witness?
@WITNESS WOW: 
I referred to Charles Rwanga. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Which is number 347 on the list.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, what did you do on that day, the 7th of April? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
On the 7th of April, I could not do anything. We stayed there following the news in order to know what the situation was. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, were there any roadblocks set up in your neighbourhood? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, roadblocks were erected by Interahamwe, and other inhabitants who were in charge of security in our neighbourhood. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, could you tell the Trial Chamber what was the name of the cellule in which you were in Kigali? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Counsel, could you please repeat your question? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asks the witness.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
The name of the cellule in which you were? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not really want that, do we? He said the name of his cellule in closed session, and we noted it and added it on the personal information sheet. The cellule is a small place. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was disturbed by that matter, about the closed session and I did not hear the response. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, please, Witness, do not provide that answer. 
The name of the secteur? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Rugenge. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, who was the conseiller of that secteur? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Her name was Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you personally hear messages from the préfet requesting that roadblocks be set up? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
No, I never heard such messages on the radio. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, were there communal policemen on the roadblocks? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not see any policemen manning a roadblock. There were only Interahamwe and inhabitants of the neighbourhood. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, according to you, who was in charge of the roadblocks that were set up in your neighbourhood? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Those in charge of the roadblocks were the Interahamwe. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you remember the name of one such leader? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I remember one Fidele Castar. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 52 on the list. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, were you a member of any political party or any youth wing at the time of the events? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Youth movement", correction from the interpreter. 
@WITNESS WOW:
I did not belong to any political party or any youth movement. Because of my occupation, I was a (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) people who were members of different political parties. So I had to remain neutral because I needed to have customers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Even though there are very many persons belonging to that group, I think we will place it under seal, since we dealt with that in closed session. So the profession will be placed under seal. 
And the next question? 
@MR. CANTIER:
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you ever move around during the events? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
On the 9th, ******************** Gitarama. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, who were these people, without giving their names? What type of customers were they? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
They were not customers. They were people who were under threat. They were thought to be Inyenzis, and so ************************* Gitarama. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you have a laissez-passer? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
No, I only made use of my identity card, but I also had a laissez-passer for my vehicle, and I would show that laissez-passer at the roadblocks. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I'm troubled, simply because it wasn't even disclosed to us that -- the particular occupation of this witness. And certainly in the will-says that we have received and the signed statement, there is no mention of this trip. I really -- I do object to this evidence being led in the circumstances. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am checking the identification sheet, and it is, indeed, only the present occupation of the witness that was mentioned, and not the occupation he had in 1994. But, I believe this is a piece of information that does not come as a surprise, and can enlighten the Trial Chamber as to the activities of the witness during the events. 
And as he just testified, the trip he made was not a professional trip, as I thought it was, but rather, was something he did personally. That is what he just stated. I fail to understand why such a question should give rise to an objection. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is, in principle, all right, and the profession is not, in itself, such a great surprise, maybe. But what you are about to deal with now, this trip, is that something which is relevant in this case and which can effect the Prosecution case, and hence should have been mentioned in advance, or is this just a parenthesis? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it was just a parenthesis to ask the witness what he did during the events, and it does not affect the Prosecution case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Let's follow the evidence, then see how this develops. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Witness, when you made that trip, did you have any problems at the roadblocks? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes. We would encounter difficulties at the roadblocks. And sometimes we had to give money or drinks or food to the people manning the roadblocks. Because they needed those to survive. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, you testified previously that there was a location that you knew, the name of which you mentioned, CELA. Can you tell the Trial Chamber what was happening on the CELA site from the 7th of April onwards? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
On the morning of the 19th, I was going to the market and I noticed that there were refugees at CELA. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That was not my question, Witness. I wished to know whether you knew what was happening on the CELA site from the 7th of April onwards. Were there any specific events that occurred at CELA from the 7th of April, that is, the question I'm putting to you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
From the 7th of April onwards, there were refugees at CELA. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you know some of the people who were there? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, some of my friends were there as well as some of my neighbours. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you give the Trial Chamber the names of the people you knew, and who were at CELA? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
There was one of my friends called Nizigiyimana; there was also one Muriwanashyaka. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you please observe a pause after each name so that I can provide the number under which it appears on the spelling list in order to enable the Trial Chamber to follow your testimony. 
The first name you mentioned is? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I talked about Nizigiyimana. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 270 on the spelling list. 
The second person, Witness?
@WITNESS WOW: 
Muriwanashyaka. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What letter does it start with? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
M. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is number 241 on the list. 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Muhayimana. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 212 on the list.
@WITNESS WOW: 
And there was also Emmanuel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 62 on the list. 
Witness, did you keep contact with these persons while they were at CELA? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, I was in contact with them because I would bring them food. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, do you know whether the CELA site came under attack? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, we heard that the CELA had been attacked. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
How did you come to hear about such an attack? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
In the morning, I was going to the market and I passed by CELA, and I saw young people as well as Interahamwe who were at the gate of CELA, and was -- were trying to enter the premises. 
There were also gendarmes who were trying to push the Interahamwe back, and the Interahamwe were saying that there were Inyenzis there. They were saying that the Inyenzis were firing at them, and they wanted to know who were the people who were shooting at them. So when I was passing by, this is what I witnessed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Witness, during the break, I will ask you to show on the sketch you made what was itinerary on that morning, it being understood that the document I will propose to you is the same document as the one appearing here, but on a smaller scale. 
Witness, let me backtrack somewhat to put two questions to you: First question, what time was it when you were passing by the CELA? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I had just left my home, around 7:00 in the morning, and I was going to the market. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And, Witness, the market -- and you can say so now and show it later on, on the plan, where was the market where you were going? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The market was in downtown Kigali. It was the Nyarugenge market. So one had to use the road from Gikondo to downtown Kigali, the centre of town, and this road passes in front of CELA. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which date is this, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW:
It was on the 22nd of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
These four persons you knew at CELA, did you know their ethnicity? 
@WITNESS WOW:
They were Tutsi, but one of them was a Hutu. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And who was the Hutu? 
@WITNESS WOW:
It was Nizigiyimana. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you mentioned names of persons killed by the Presidential Guard on the 7th of April. Did you know their ethnicity? 
@WITNESS WOW:
Yes, I knew that they were Tutsis, and besides, they had been jailed during the period when the accomplices were jailed. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
On that day, you were (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) or you were walking? 
@WITNESS WOW:
Which movement were you talking about? 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
On the 22nd of April, you left your home at around 7:00 a.m., were you (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) walking? 
@WITNESS WOW:
I was on foot, because during that period one could not get fuel. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, you did say a while ago that you saw a crowd in front of CELA. There were the Interahamwe and gendarmes who were trying to stop them. My specific question is as follows: How long did you stay there watching the situation? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not stay there for a long time. I stood there for about ten minutes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, at what time do you situate your arrival in the market? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I will say that I arrived in the market around 7.30. But this is just an estimate. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
How long did you stay in the market? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I went to the market and I started buying my items. So I'll say that I stayed in the market from -- for between 30 and 40 minutes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What did you do next, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I went back home. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you pass in front of CELA once again on your way home? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, I passed in front of CELA. It was the only route to my house. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Are you able to tell the Court approximately at what time you got to CELA? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Approximately -- after I bought my items, I got -- I came out, so I'll say that I got to CELA around 8.30. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And when you got to the neighbourhood of CELA, what did you do? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
When I got to the CELA neighbourhood, I realised that the situation had changed. I saw that those young persons and Interahamwe had become more violent, and I realised that there was a larger number of Interahamwe than I saw previously, and I realised that the gendarmes were pushing them back with force, asking them what they wanted at CELA. And the Interahamwe were saying that they wanted to get the Inyenzi who were firing at them during the night. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What did you observe, and for how long did you stay there on this occasion? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I stopped for some time, because this was something quite unusual. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you observe any particular event while you were there? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
While I was there, I saw that the young persons were screaming, saying that "Release those persons to us". And he said, "You" -- these gendarmes -- "You want to kill us, the Inyenzi". I was there, and then suddenly I heard people saying behind me that the préfet had arrived. I was curious, and I saw the préfet, who was there in front, and he started talking to the gendarmes-- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
In order to avoid long answers, maybe you should take successive questions so as to shed light on these issues for the Chamber. 
So you just said that you saw the préfet arrive. Now, still approximately, are you able to say around when the préfet arrived? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Approximately, the préfet arrived between 8.30 and 9:00 a.m. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Witness, you've just stated -- by anticipating a little on my question -- that you saw him speak to the gendarmes, but before then, let me ask you this question: When you saw the préfet arriving, was he alone or was he in the company of others? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The préfet was not alone; he was accompanied by two policemen. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Let me ask you to go back to your account a while ago. You said you saw the préfet arrive with two policemen, you saw him talking to the gendarme. What then happened? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Following his arrival, the préfet spoke to the gendarmes. I don't know what it was that they discussed. All I saw is that I saw him turn and face the Interahamwe and told them -- and asked them, "What do you want here?" And the Interahamwe said, "We are looking for the persons who are here, the Inyenzi who were firing at us in the evening." The préfet then told them, "You think those persons who are here are Inyenzis?" And they said, "We want those persons who are here and who are Inyenzis." And the préfet said, "That is not true. You said that there were persons who were firing at you, so they have to be people who were carrying weapons. But those persons who are here are members of the population who are afraid and who sought refuge here." The préfet told them, "I don't know why you want to attack these persons, they are members of the population, just like yourselves." The Interahamwe then -- some of them started moving their heads, and others said they do not understand why the préfet is preventing them from attacking the Inyenzi, and some of them even said the préfet is an accomplice, and we do not understand why he is preventing us from attacking these Inyenzis who fire at us every day." 
I then saw the Interahamwe disperse angrily, saying that the préfet had just prevented them from killing the Inyenzi. They started moving away. We were still there standing, and we saw the préfet turn towards the gendarme and the refugees; and he asked the gendarme to call the other refugees. And I saw some people come out of the group of refugees and got closer. I was also curious, and I wanted to see what was happening and what was being said, because some of my friends were at that place. So I got closer to listen to what the préfet was saying. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am going to put a question to you, Witness. I believe we have understood what you have just told the Court. But let me ask you a question, on account of the layout of the place, when you got to the neighbourhood of CELA, were you on the pavement of the road, since you were coming -- you were going home? Did you remain at that place or did you move? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not remain by the roadside because what was happening was interesting. I became curious and got closer to the premises to hear the statement of the préfet. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well. Now, you have explained to us that refugees came out. Where did the refugees come out from, just so we can understand, because we know the lay out of the place somehow? We have looked at the plan. Where were the refugees? Where were they? Where did they come out from, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The refugees came out of the buildings and moved into the courtyard where there was a car park. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well. Now, you may proceed. You heard the préfet, who was discussing with some refugees. Very quickly, what was the discussion that took place between the refugees and the préfet? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The préfet called them and told them that, "You see, there is no security here, organise yourselves and I'm going to give you gendarmes who are going to escort you to another place where there are other refugees so that they do not attack you here. You see that the evildoers have become very violent." 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, towards which other location did the préfet propose to move these people? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
He was telling the refugees to join other refugees to Sainte Famille church or at Saint Paul's, because that is where there was a larger number of refugees. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, among the attackers, did you know some persons? Where did the attackers come from? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The attackers were Interahamwes who lived in the neighbourhood. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Was -- did they have a leader among them who was directing the operations, whom you are able to identify as such? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The leader of these attackers was one Fidele. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Is that the name that you mentioned a while ago, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, Counsel. He was the one in charge of roadblocks in the neighbourhood. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, during that event, did you see the conseiller? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not see her. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
During that event, did you see a woman whose first name is Angeline? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not see her. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, this scene that you have described to the Court, how did it end, the scene during which the préfet was talking to the refugees? What happened thereafter? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The préfet spoke to the refugees. He then asked the gendarmes to accompany these refugees. I left the place and I stood close by the road. I saw the préfet come out, and he left in the company of his two policemen aboard a Renault 21 vehicle, white in colour. They went into the vehicle and I do not know where they went. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, are you able to tell the Court, in general terms, the time that elapsed between when you saw the préfet, which you situate between 8:30 and 9 a.m., and the time when you saw him leave? That is, the entire duration of the scene that you have described; how long did it take? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The scene lasted about an hour. The préfet came out around 10 a.m. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, you explained that you went back up to the road. So you are saying that once you got to the road, it was when you got to the road that you saw the préfet pass by in his vehicle. And you have just said that this was around 10 a.m. Now, what were you doing at that time? Did you remain there or you moved on? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I remained there to see the fate that will befall my friends who were among the refugees. The refugees were escorted, they passed by -- they passed close by where I was standing. I saw my friends and I greeted them. I expressed my sympathy to them. I remained there briefly, and then subsequently I went home. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, do you know if there were other incidents at the CELA, apart from the one that you have just described to the Court? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I went home, prepared some food to eat and then I went to bed. The following morning, I heard that the attackers went to kill people at the CELA centre. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Are you able to tell the Court who gave you this information? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
During the period of war, everybody was moving around. This -- these were people who lived close to the CELA complex who gave me this information. They told us that the Interahamwe had attacked CELA and killed the refugees who were there. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you receive information on another attack which may have taken place at CELA the previous day, that is, 21st April? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was never aware of this attack. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So when you went home and prepared some food to eat and then went to bed, was that still on the 22nd? 
@WITNESS WOW:
I was coming from the market, and that was on the 22nd. And I heard that people had been killed on the 23rd. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you get to know of attacks directed against the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille locations? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, I was aware. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did -- first of all, the dates of these attacks, did you get to know them and do you recall the dates of these attacks? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
This was a long time ago, and I do not have a clear memory of these dates. I recall that there was an attack of the Inkotanyi; and the Inkotanyi abducted people of Sainte Famille and Saint Paul. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And the dates of these events? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I do not recall the dates. But I remember that the attack did take place and people were abducted. We were not paying attention to dates. The situation did not allow that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you hear that Interahamwe had attacked the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille locations? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, the Interahamwe attacked those centres. After the RPF had abducted people from those centres, the Interahamwe became very furious. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And, Witness, did you know who carried out these attacks or, rather, who led the attacks? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
These attacks were led by the Interahamwe, and Angeline, and the conseiller, Nyirabagenzi. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you get to know if the préfet, Renzaho, participated in these attacks? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I tried to get some information, but I never heard that Renzaho took part in these attacks. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, do you know Angeline Mukandituye, in particular? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I knew her. She ***************. I used to go to her house. I used to go to her house and her friends were -- her children were my friends. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
In a moment, would you be able to indicate on the plan where Angeline's house was located in relation to your own house? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Are you able to say approximately the distance from your house to Angeline's house? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
There was a distance of about *********** metres between my house and Angeline's house. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you know Angeline's political activities? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Angeline was a member of the MRND. She very often wore the MRND uniform. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, do you want me to ask another question or did you want to interrupt? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't want to interrupt you, but maybe this is a good time for the lunch break? If so, I understand there are two remaining witnesses, one is BIT and then another one. This witness, how much is left, approximately, of the examination-in-chief of him? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, maximum 15 -- ten to 15 minutes. And we have requested the section to prepare -- to get the next witness ready, TPO -- PPO. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. It seems that we can allow ourselves two hours lunch break today. So we start at 3 o'clock. 
You will not have a very long cross-examination
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And we understand that the BIT witness cannot sit in the afternoons, is that so? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, but in any event, we will not have been able to take her -- take him this afternoon. He is a witness with some health problems and a health certificate testifying to the fact that he can only testify in the morning. So we are thinking of Friday morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's see how this develops. Thank you for the information. 
The Court is adjourned till 3 o'clock. 
$(Court recessed at 1300H)
$(Pages 37 to 47 by Judith Baverstock)
$(Court resumed at 1500H) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, the Court is session. 
Defence. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, we were talking about the case of Angeline Mukandituye. You told us that she was involved in political activities and that her house was near yours. Mr. Witness, my question is as follows: Did you see the préfet go to the house of Angeline on the 21st and on the 22nd of April 1994 -- or, did you come to know that he had gone there? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not see the préfet go to Angeline Mukandituye's house. Angeline Mukandituye's house was near my house. We had the possibility of visiting Angeline's house. We knew the préfet's vehicle very well because he was an authority. So if he had come to Angeline's place, we could, at least, have seen his car. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, when did you leave Rwanda? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I left Rwanda around the end of June 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you return to Rwanda, and, if so, when? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
When I left Rwanda, I passed through Gisenyi where I spent some days before crossing the border in order to go to the former Zaire. I then returned to Rwanda in September 1994. After my return to Rwanda, I remained in Rwanda. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, were you prosecuted in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, I was prosecuted in 1995. After being arrested and detained in prison, I was released in 2003. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, you were telling us you were released, but had you been tried as such accordingly? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, I was tried. My trial took place before a court of law and I was acquitted. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, when and why did you flee Rwanda? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I fled Rwanda in 2005 because the Gacaca court, once again, summoned me, whereas I had already been tried and acquitted. I have to specify here that before Gacaca courts, judges are actually ordinary members of the public; they are not professional judges. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, I've completed my examination-in-chief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year was the year of your acquittal, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW:
I was acquitted in 2002 in December, December 2002 -- that is when the judgement was delivered. I left prison on the 14th of January 2003. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Prosecution? 
##
$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, Witness, just to clarify: You fled and now reside where you do to avoid prosecution? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I fled Rwanda because I noticed that people who had already been acquitted following regular trials were, once again, arrested and accused of having committed crimes in respect of which they had already been tried. And, therefore, I thought this was an injustice and I decided to flee the country. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Isn't it more an indication of guilt to flee prosecution, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Personally, I don't blame myself with regarding anything. I just noticed that people who had already been tried were, once again, arrested in spite of the fact that they had been tried publicly -- prosecuted publicly, they were still arrested. There were prosecution witnesses who would testify by telling lies, so I thought this was unlawful, particularly given the fact that the Gacaca trials take place in courts whereby -- where judges are not professional judges, they are not lawyers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just to clarify: Did you, Maître Cantier, ask this witness to draw a sketch in the break or to mark something? And if so, was there any result of that? And if there was a result, is that something you want to show us or is the issue moot now? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That's what I asked the witness, but I've not yet had the time to ask him about it. I had intended to ask him at the end of my examination-in-chief. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, Mr. Witness, have you drawn the sketch with indications which you were requested regarding your residence, as well as the position where you were within the proximity of your residence and the indicated areas? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I -- I was not given a sketch on which I would have made indications requested of me, because at the beginning of the lunch break I was taken to the place where I was being accommodated and, therefore, I've not had the time to carry out that exercise. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, there's a mistake here because we did give a sketch for -- the sketch to be given to him. So apparently there was a misunderstanding, because the witness has not received the sketch. But with your leave, we can give him the sketch again immediately. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The two remaining witnesses are PPO and BIT for this week, I understand. You indicated that 
Witness BIT only can testify in the morning. Your proposal was that that witness should then testify Friday morning. 
The preference of the Bench would be if that witness could testify tomorrow morning, and if this witness is not finished by then, we can then have BIT in the morning, and the other witness -- or PPO in the afternoon. Can that be arranged because we would really like Friday for working purposes. Is this possible? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I have a serious problem. We expect on Monday to lead a witness via video link, and I'm the one who's going to lead that witness. Now, in view of our schedule, I made a reservation -- a flight reservation for tomorrow evening in order to go to where that person is, and I need time to see him, and as well as to return here. And since I've worked with Witness PPO, that option would be incompatible -- I mean, the reality would be incompatible with the proposal being made by the Bench. 
And I'm sorry about this, but, really, I can't see how I can do things otherwise. Unless, Mr. President, tomorrow afternoon, since I'm taking my plane late in the afternoon, I can lead Witness PPO. But in that case, I'll request the Trial Chamber's leave not to be here during examination-in-chief, and ask -- request the Trial Chamber to allow my co-counsel to represent me in cross. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No problem. But if you have to leave tomorrow night, that is the situation, isn't it? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That's the case, Mr. President. I have to be free at around 2:30 in the afternoon -- 4:30 in the afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And are not the chances good that we can start PPO immediately after cross-examination of this witness, and then finalise BIT in the morning, plus PPO before you leave? Or alternatively, as you suggest, that you have PPO in chief and your co-counsel is present in cross, which would appear to be no problem. 
@MR. CANTIER:
That seems possible, Mr. President. This afternoon I'll request -- I request that PPO be brought here, but I don't know how long my learned friend will take in cross-examination of this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you finished the sketch, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga, can you show the sketch to Defence counsel and then to the rest of us. 
You have seen the sketch, Maître Cantier, does it speak for itself or does it require any follow up before we really start the cross-examination? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I know the layout of the place, but the witness is testifying in Kinyarwandan. I don't know whether the indications are in Kinyarwandan, but this document in my opinion, is not immediately understandable when one looks at it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But why don't we follow the normal procedure; namely, we will give this to the Kinyarwandan booth and ask them to translate the Kinyarwandan words on this sketch, and then I suppose Defence counsel can come back to this. 
@MR. CANTIER:
That's preferable, Mr. President. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Defence counsel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. Then we leave the sketch at this stage for the time being and let us proceed with the cross-examination. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you confirmed this morning some details about yourself on a personal information sheet. You didn't include your ethnicity. You are, in fact Hutu, aren't you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, I'm Hutu. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you mentioned some attacks that took place on the 7th of April 1994, carried out by the Presidential Guard. And you said that they -- those attacks included some girls who were killed at JOC. That's correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And those girls were Tutsi, weren't they? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, they were Tutsi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And it's right, isn't it, that the Presidential Guard that carried out the attacks in -- that you mentioned this morning, they had lists of people they were seeking out to kill, didn't they? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, the Presidential Guard are, aren't they, members of the then government armed forces of Rwanda? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That is correct, they were a unit which was entrusted with the task of protecting Habyarimana. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So you agree, don't you, that as early as of the 7th of April government forces were out on the street killing Tutsi? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I acknowledge that I saw some soldiers of the Presidential Guard; however, I do not have further information which would allow me -- allow me to assert that other units of the Rwandan army committed massacres. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, we can, at least, agree that this particular unit of the government army did? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I agree with you, because I saw soldiers of the Presidential Guard kill people whom I mentioned. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you see the Presidential Guard kill Charles Rwanga who, you said, was killed on the 7th of April? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The vehicle of soldiers passed there. Soldiers had a list and they entered into houses of people who were to be killed. Most of the people who were killed were people who had already been arrested on the pretext that they were accomplices of the Inyenzi. So they were the people who were killed as from the 7th of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see Charles Rwanga be killed? That was the question. 
@WITNESS WOW:
I was not an eyewitness to the actual killing, but we heard gunshots. After the soldiers had left, we were curious and we wanted to know the identity of people who had just been killed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you saw his dead body or didn't you? 
@WITNESS WOW:
When we went to Rwanga's place, we found the other people who told us that Charles Rwanga had just been killed. But the body I was able -- the bodies I were able to see was Ngunda and Nyirinkwaya's bodies who were *******************************. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can we have the spelling of those names? Thank you, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Ngunda is probably 265. 
And the other name, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW:
Stanis Nyirinkwaya.
@MR. CANTIER:
304, Mr. President, we mentioned him this morning. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So the answer, Witness, is that you didn't see Charles Rwanga killed and you didn't see his dead body? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The fact is that he was killed, because some young people told us that they had seen Rwanga's body down on the ground in his compound. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, in order for us all to be efficient, it's important to listen to the question and answer them very briefly. And, isn't the answer, no? You did not see Charles Rwanga be killed, and you did not yourself see his dead body. Isn't the answer, you did not? 
@WITNESS WOW:
You're correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Witness, please try to limit your answers, where possible, to yes or no. 
Now, you said that you had friends at CELA, didn't you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
It's right that people sought refuge at CELA after the 6th of April because they feared that they would be killed or otherwise attacked if they stayed at home? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you agree, do you, that it was mainly Tutsi who were afraid of being killed or otherwise attacked? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I do not agree with you on that point, because even members of opposition parties were afraid of being attacked or being killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, do you agree with this proposition, Witness, that between the 7th of April and the 
17th of July 1994, there was a genocide against the Tutsi ethnic group in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I agree with your proposition; however, I have to add that there were other people who were not Tutsis who were killed during that period. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
The majority of the refugees at CELA were Tutsi, weren't they? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, the majority of people who had sought refuge there were Tutsi. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you say that you took food to your friends on a regular basis in the first few weeks after the 
6th of April, isn't that right? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you were able to move about freely like that because you were Hutu. That's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And isn't that why you were able to stand around, you said, watching while Interahamwe attacked CELA? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, I was able to do that because I was a Hutu. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You never had any trouble at roadblocks in Rugenge secteur, did you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not have any problem except on some few occasions, and that is when those who were manning the roadblocks needed money to buy some beer or needed some foodstuffs. And on those occasions, we would give some money or some foodstuffs if we were coming back from the market. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you said this morning that the roadblocks in that secteur were erected by Interahamwe and inhabitants who were in charge of security. That's what you said, isn't it? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Nibyo --
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So you agree --
@WITNESS WOW: 
-- that was my statement this morning. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You agree then that the Interahamwe had been given such a role to be in charge of security by the authorities? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I do not confirm that the mission was assigned them by the authorities, because even members of the population who were manning roadblocks were doing so on their own initiative, because members of the population had realised that they were being attacked by RPF troops. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, according to you, Witness, what was the exact purpose of the roadblocks? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The roadblocks were intended for road checks so as to get those who were infiltrating. And those who were intercepted, were killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And did you yourself work on a roadblock, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was at the roadblock, like the other members of the population, because when one did not go to man a roadblock, you have to pay a fine -- and you even run the risk of being considered as an accomplice, a supporter of RPF that was attacking the country. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where was the roadblock where you worked, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That roadblock was located down hill from where we lived. And the Interahamwe on some occasions would come to ask us why we took the liberty to remain in our homes when they have to keep the roadblocks to ensure our security. They, therefore, forced us to go and man those roadblocks ourselves. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
For how long did you man that roadblock? By which I mean, was it just for a matter of days or for the period April to July '94, or something in-between? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I manned that roadblock for some days, because I was never at ease -- when I had to go and man those roadblocks, I did not want to go and check identity documents of people who were passing through. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, are you saying that despite the Interahamwe threatening you, you were able only to work on a roadblock for three or four days? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I manned that roadblock for some days, because we did not support the idea that some people -- we'd keep arresting other members of the population who had the same rights as ourselves. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How many people were arrested when you worked at that roadblock, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
At that roadblock in -- during that period, some persons who did not have the required documents were arrested, and some of those persons were interrogated. And they were able to indicate the neighbourhood they originated from. But some of them were taken away by the Interahamwe who went and killed them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How many? 
@WITNESS WOW:
I was among those who remained at the roadblock, but I observed that there were, at least, two persons who were taken away by the Interahamwe, but I really do not know if those persons were killed by the Interahamwe because the Interahamwe -- if they killed those persons, they did so in another place; they didn't do that at the roadblock. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
How many RPF infiltrators did you stop at your roadblock during the time you worked there? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
At that roadblock, an RPF element was arrested and he was shot immediately because he had a -- he was armed with a pistol, and he was shooting at those people manning the roadblock. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So someone was killed at the roadblock when you were there, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I have told you that I saw the Interahamwe take away the two persons who were taken away, and I did not see those two persons again. But, regarding the RPF troop, he was not killed exactly at the roadblock because he was fleeing; and while fleeing, he was still shooting at the persons who were manning the roadblock and who finally shot him. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
All right, Witness, now on the 22nd of April you said that you went to the market, and you saw Interahamwe at CELA, and then you came back from the market and there were even more Interahamwe at CELA. That's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, that is correct. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You didn't mention your seeing Interahamwe on the way to the market in the statement you made in May of this year for the Defence, did you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
This morning I did say that I saw these Interahamwe, because when I was passing by, these Interahamwe were pushing the gendarme because they wanted to enter into the premises of CELA to kill the refugees who were there. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you agree that you didn't mention it in the statement you gave to the Defence in May of this year? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
But I'm repeating to you that I saw them, so I stand by what I'm saying. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, perhaps it wasn't important enough back in May, but you agree, do you, that the Interahamwe you describe were armed with machetes, clubs, guns and so forth, do you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What exactly is the contradiction here, if any, between the testimony and the statement? And I'm asking this if you look at page 1 and count from the bottom, the fifth paragraph from the bottom. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, Your Honour, it's -- it's really the fact that the paragraph above that beginning "après" says that on returning from the market "I noticed a group of young people" and so on. And there's simply no mention of seeing them on the way, but it's not a very significant point. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, all right. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Tell us, Witness, how many Interahamwe you saw, let's say, on your way back from the market? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not count the Interahamwe that I saw, but I would say that there were between 50 and 60. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And do you remember how many gendarmes you saw? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I managed to see three gendarmes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Where exactly were you when you saw this apparent attack, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was behind the fence. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So how were you able to see those three gendarmes behind a mob of 50 or 60 Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
The Interahamwe were not between myself and the gendarmes. I was on high grounds and because of that I was able to follow what was happening. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Behind a fence, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, in fact, there is a gentle slope -- and where I was was higher ground in relation to the premises of CELA. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Despite the weapons that the Interahamwe had, you yourself, weren't frightened at all. Is that right? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was not frightened because I'm not among those who were being chased out. And among the attackers, there were persons that I knew -- and on some occasions, I even had the opportunity to have a drink with some of them. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Sorry. Mr. Witness, could you remind us what the distance was between you and the place where the Interahamwe and gendarmes were? 
@WITNESS WOW:
Between 2 and 3 metres. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, some of the Interahamwe were your friends. That's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was not selective. There were Interahamwe who were my friends, and at the same time I had friends among those who took refuge at CELA. I was a member of the population just as any other, and I did not discriminate. I had friends among the Interahamwe -- just as I had friends among those who had sought refuge at the centre. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You weren't an Interahamwe yourself then, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was not an Interahamwe. Besides, the nature of my work did not allow me to join any political party; that would have been incompatible with my job. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But after the 6th of April, Witness, things weren't quite normal, were they? Were you not part of a mob of Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
No, I was not one of the Interahamwe, because as I told you, my job did not allow me to join any political party. I was at the service of everybody, whichever political party they belonged to. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
All right, let's put it another way: Weren't you a militiaman yourself, Witness? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
No. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Isn't that what you've been accused of and why you fled from the Gacaca in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
No, I was, rather, accused for the same offences that I had already been tried for and acquitted, and let me remind you that my trial was in public. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And were not the allegations against you in that trial that you were a militiaman? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
No, that was not among the charges brought against me -- even if the charges brought against me were trumped up. The fact is at the end of my trial I was acquitted. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So what was it that you were accused of? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was accused of having burnt the bodies of persons who were killed. But investigations were conducted, and the court found that those persons who were accusing me were lying, simply because we had a dispute between us. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, back to CELA, on the 22nd of April, you said that the -- that the préfet arrived with two policemen. Are you sure, Witness, that those were the only two people who accompanied the préfet when he arrived? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I am sure because I even saw these two persons when the préfet was entering, and they were on board the same vehicle. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You are sure you didn't see any soldiers with the préfet or other militia? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I'm sure, because the vehicle on board which the vehicle -- the vehicle on board which the préfet was travelling, could not have contained two more persons. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You didn't see the bourgmestre, Jean Bizimana? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I did not see the bourgmestre. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you said earlier you didn't see Odette Nyirabagenzi or Angeline Mukandutiye?
@WITNESS WOW: 
That is the truth and I did not see them. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So Renzaho came with just two policemen and he dispersed the 50 or 60 threatening Interahamwe. That's your evidence, isn't it? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
Yes, that is so and I'm sure that the Interahamwe themselves were disappointed, because the préfet was preventing them from killing. And when the Interahamwe left, they were saying that Renzaho himself was an accomplice. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, we agree, at least, that the préfet had authority over the Interahamwe? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I'm not able to confirm that because subsequently the Interahamwe were able to go behind the préfet and kill the people who were at CELA. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, Witness, that's what you told us you heard. You told us that this morning, but you said the opposite, didn't you, in the statement that you made in May? In that statement you said you didn't know of any abduction of any refugees at CELA on that day. Do you remember saying that? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That is what I said in my statement, but I also added that I heard on the following day that during that attack there were people who were abducted at the CELA centre. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, Witness, you didn't add that in your statement, did you? Does your story change every month or so? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I recall that I explained that to the persons who interviewed me -- except the person who recorded my statement omitted that aspect of the statement. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you weren't at Saint Paul's or Sainte Famille during the abduction of the refugees that you talked about this morning, were you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
That's right. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And you weren't present during the Interahamwe's attack the following day, were you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I was not present. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But, interestingly, you were able to tell the Court that the Interahamwe were led by Odette and Angeline, weren't you? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
I said that at the Sainte Famille location, the Interahamwe -- led by Odette and Angeline -- attacked the element of the RPF, and this attack was carried out because the two women were complaining that these persons were spared instead of being killed. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So your friend, Angeline and the conseiller, Odette were leaders of the Interahamwe, were they? 
@WITNESS WOW: 
It is true that they were leading the Interahamwe. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you.
MS. MELLUISH:
I have no further questions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President. Thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, just one question: When the préfet arrived at CELA, you said he addressed the refugees. What were the options he gave them? You said he mentioned certain places where they could go to. Could you just repeat that? 
@WITNESS WOW:
After dispersing the Interahamwe, the préfet told the refugees that they were not safe there and therefore, they had to leave that place in order to go to the other sites where there was better security -- or where there were other refugees. 
The refugees noticed that the préfet was telling the truth, and the préfet asked the gendarme to escort the refugees so that those refugees could go and join the -- join the other refugees at the 
Sainte Famille church or at the Saint Paul centre. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Did the préfet ask them that those who wanted to go back to their residence should do so? 
@WITNESS WOW:
I did not hear the préfet say that; however, I heard him say that the refugees could leave, and those who opted to return to their homes returned to their homes. Whereas other refugees went to the site of the Sainte Famille church or to the Saint Paul centre. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, am I correct that once you witnessed the detention of two elements of RPF at the roadblock? 
@WITNESS WOW:
There were people who did not -- who are not able to show their identity cards, so they were taken away and they were told that they had to go and show the areas or neighbourhoods where they lived. But after that, I never heard anything about those people again. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
So the fact that those two persons were RPF elements was established on the basis that they failed to identify their place of residence. Is it correct? 
@WITNESS WOW:
Those two people were arrested because they did not have normal documents -- although they were saying that they were ordinary members of the public. That is why people manning the roadblock took them away so that they could show them the exact place where they lived and so that their neighbours could identify them. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are just waiting for this sketch to be returned with the necessary translations. 
$(Pages 48 to 59 by Jean Baigent)
1615H
@JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, I just saw from your statement that the préfet gave three options, either to go to Saint Paul, Sainte Famille, or go home. And you went on to say that some of your neighbours went to Sainte Famille and others returned to the quartier, so my question now is this: What happened to those neighbours of yours who returned to the quartier? 
@WITNESS WOW:
I said that the préfet asked the refugees to go to places where there was security. Since the refugees were coming from different places, some refugees preferred going to the Sainte Famille centre, and some decided to go to the Saint Paul Centre. And all those were escorted, but some of my friends returned to the quartier, that is, the neighbourhood. 
But -- and people -- neighbours were -- were asking them were did they go to CELA. Here, I'm referring to Nizigiyimana. But I saw the neighbours who joined the group -- or, the groups which went to the two proposed sites, that is, the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any need for any follow-up, Maître Cantier, concerning the annotations on the sketch? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, if it appears to you that the indications here are clear, then I don't see the point of dwelling on this. I'll just -- I wanted to make sure that the Trial Chamber understands what his itinerary was on that particular day in respect of refugees. I know the place, but maybe you can look at the sketch. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we just note this sketch, no problem? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
Do you want to tender it?

@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I would like to request a closed session for the first few questions which I would like to put to this witness. After that we can go into an open session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the duration of the closed session, approximately five minutes? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Between 5 and 10 minutes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. We will do that.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness PPO, we are now back in open session in order to hear your examination-in-chief. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, were there civil -- were there Tutsi civil servants at the PVK? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
Yes. At the PVK, just like as in all state institutions, you had a mixture of all ethnic groups existing in Rwanda. At PVK you had Hutus, Tutsis, but I don't remember whether there were Twas. But there were Hutus and Tutsis were who were represented at PVK. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
@WITNESS PPO: 
The names of heads of department at PVK? We had an administrative and legal department, which was led by Jean-Baptiste Butera. Then you had the social -- social welfare department, which was headed by Mr. Aloys Simpunga. 
Then there was the police service -- or, police department, which was led by Major Nyamuhimba. I do not know his first name. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) I think that is it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. We will delete the penultimate sentence in that answer and place it under seal. 
We are in open session now. Be careful, Mr. Witness. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is why, Witness, I had warned you. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).
@MR. CANTIER:
Number 50 is Butera, Jean-Baptiste, Mr. President, on the list. Simpunga is 382, and Nyamuhimba is number 300. 
(No interpretation)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid we have to delete a couple of words from your last remark. So we will simply say that Maître Cantier said the following: "That is why, Mr. Witness, I had warned you." Full stop. And the rest is also under seal. 
MS. MELLUISH:
And, Your Honour, perhaps the question that preceded it which also used that word, the original question by my learned friend. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The same word which was now deleted will also be deleted in the question at 16:12:44. You are absolutely right, Ms. Melluish. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, I saw you raise your arm. 
@WITNESS PPO: 
Yes, Counsel. I forgot to say that we had a financial services -- financial and economic services department at PVK, which was led by Bunani, Fabien. 
@MR. CANTIER:
That is number 47 on the spelling list. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, could you tell us in which neighbourhood did you live in Kigali in April 1994? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
"Neighbourhood" can be very concrete. Do you mean the 12 houses or do you mean the larger area? If you mean something very small, we don't want to have that answer, do we? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, for the caution. The answer which will be given to us actually covers an area which is quite big and, therefore, cannot reveal information which could identify the witness. 
@WITNESS PPO:
In April 1994 I was living in a neighbourhood known as Remera-Nyarutarama. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Number 322 on the list, Mr. President. That is the Remera area. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, when did you hear about the president's death? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
I heard about President Habyarimana's death on the 6th of April at around 11 in the evening, a few minutes after 11 p.m., yes, some minutes after 11. I heard about it on Radio Rwanda, which announced that the country's president, that is, Rwanda's president, as well as the president of Burundi and their entourage which accompanied them, had died in an airplane accident. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You rightly drew our attention to the fact that Remera is 322, but the witness gave another location after that. Can you repeat what you said after Remera, and possibly spell it if it's complicated? Just spell it first. 
@WITNESS PPO:
Remera-Nyarutarama. Nyarutarama is spelled -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, he didn't spell it. He just repeated it, "Nyarutarama." 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And can you just spell Nyarutarama for us now, Mr. Witness, so that we can move on? 
@WITNESS PPO:
Yes. Nyarutarama is spelled N-Y-A-R-U-T-A-R-A-M-A, Nyarutarama. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, on the night of the 6th to the 7th of April, were you at your house? Did you spend the night at your house? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
Yes, Counsel. I spent the night of the 6th to the 7th of April at home. I had come back from work, and I was at home. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, what did you do on the following day, that is, on the 7th of April? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
After hearing the news on the radio, that the two heads of state and members of their entourage had been killed, at around midnight, between 11 p.m. and midnight, there was an announcement which announced the death of the two presidents. 
On the following morning, on the 7th of April, very early in the morning, between 6 and 7 a.m., there was a radio announcement from the ministry of defence, asking everyone to remain calm and stay at home for security reasons. 
So I, too, stayed at home, just like everybody else, in spite of the fact that they were -- there was shooting coming from left, right and centre. There was firing throughout the night. I could hear heavy weapons, light weapons. I could hear explosions, and that continued up to around 9 a.m. on the 7th. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, did you remain at home? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
No, Counsel, I did not stay at home because the sound of shooting of light weapons, heavy weapons, explosions was in -- was intense. I decided to leave my house. And what led me to leave my house, in particular, was that a domestic worker who worked for me came to knock on my door -- or, rather, on my -- and told me that there was a dead body in front of my house's gate. I went to the road and looked there, and I saw a dead body which had been decapitated, without its head. That frightened me so much that I could not remain there. 
One or two minutes later, a neighbour of mine, whose name is -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Should we mention the name if it comes, Mr. -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not want that name, I think. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, it's not -- there's no need to do that, and, in any case, we are in an open session, Mr. Witness. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Continue, but just say "a neighbour" without mentioning his name. Thank you very much. 
@WITNESS PPO: 
A neighbour of mine, who was more courageous than me, came and knocked on my window and told me, "Let's leave." 
I followed him immediately. We abandoned our houses. We abandoned our residences. I sought refuge at a place called Remera Kimironko, at the primary school. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Kimironko is number 181. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, now, to shorten your evidence, because the main thing for me is to know when did you -- when did you join PVK, Kigali city préfecture? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
It took me some time to get to the PVK. As I said earlier on, my neighbour and I, and other people we met at Remera Kimironko, we sought refuge at the primary school, where we stayed for about three or four days, approximately. That place is opposite -- is opposite a hill, where there was an RPF position. Bullets from the RPF position hit the premises of the Kimironko school. I was one of the first people to leave that area. And, once again, I sought refuge in another neighbourhood of Remera, known as Remera groupement -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Groupment" in English. 
@WITNESS PPO:
I spent about two weeks there. After that, a friend -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please, when did you arrive at PVK? Which date? What was your first working day, if any, during this period there? 
@WITNESS PPO:
Thank you, Mr. President. I arrived at PVK end of April 1994 -- or, rather, around -- or, towards the end of April. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
Witness, when you joined -- or, when you went to the PVK, what was your objective? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
The main purpose of going there was, firstly, to seek shelter, a refuge. Secondly, I had heard that Mr. Renzaho, who was the préfet of Kigali city, was already there and that he is trying to look for his members of staff. But I went there basically for two reasons: One, to seek refuge; secondly, to support the préfet for our usual work. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
Mr. Witness, throughout your itinerary, which I requested you to shorten because it was not essential for the Chamber, did you come across roadblocks? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
Counsel, you can't imagine the situation. There was so many roadblocks. There were too many roadblocks. I took time to move from Remera to PVK, a lot -- a long time, because there were many roadblocks, which were manned by people whom I did not know. 
They did not have uniform. They were young people who were armed. Sometimes you'd find them drunk. I remember that on our way to PVK we had to turn around at two roadblocks, one at around Kicukiro, another at a place called Gatenga. There was a terrible roadblock, and it caused us a lot of problems. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Gatenga is number 88 on our list. Kicukiro, which we know, is number 178. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, you're not a Tutsi, yet - yet - you're not a Tutsi. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), and in spite of all that, you encountered all those problems when you were going to the PVK? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
Counsel, what you are saying is true. I encountered all sorts of problems, in spite of the fact that I had all my documents. I introduced myself; I explained myself. 
But, as I was saying, the people manning the Gatenga roadblock, I met a group of five or six persons. They looked drunk and in an uncontrollable state in a Suzuki vehicle. They wanted to take everything we had. They threw everything out. They searched our pockets to see if we had some money. We explained, but they were not the -- did not -- they didn't want to understand us. It was by the grace of God that they subsequently left us to go. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Witness. 
Witness, when you got to the PVK, maybe if, in the course of the examination you are able to recall -- able to remember and give us a more specific date than the one you gave us previously -- but my question is, when you got to PVK, did you meet the préfet? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And before we start with that, we will delete the beginning of this second sentence of Maître Cantier's previous question. With other words, all the words before "and in spite of all that," in that sentence. 
And now your question, Mr. Witness -- or, answer. Now your answer, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS PPO:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I got to PVK. I cannot give you specific dates because this was 12, 13 years ago, but I think it was around the 18th of April, plus or minus one or two days. I got to the PVK, I think it was, around 1600 hours. I found the préfet, Renzaho. He was there. 
When he saw me, I was -- he was surprised because he thought I was already dead. He was surprised and happy to see me alive and to see me back at the PVK.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Witness. My question, what did he tell you and what instructions did he give you when he was happy to see you back? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
Well, the préfet received me happily. He took me into his office, and he started explaining the situation at the PVK to me, the absence of staff, the situation of war. And then he immediately informed me that they had set up a crisis unit at the PVK so as to be able to permanently monitor the development of the situation and to find certain solutions to certain problems that might come up as a result of the war situation. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, are you able to tell us in a more specific manner what he asked you to do? 
@WITNESS PPO: 
Yes, Counsel. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, it seems to me that most of the last answer should be in closed session. Perhaps we -- perhaps we ought to go in closed session, in fact, if we're going to follow this kind of evidence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have to do that. The last answer must be placed under seal. 
Is it possible for you to continue in open session, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER:
In fact, Mr. President, the questions I'm going to put to the witness are on his activities, and, therefore -- well, I thank my colleague for her reflex. And in his answers, it is possible that he will be identified. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
For planning purposes, approximately how much time is left of this witness's testimony, which we have realised now should be conducted in closed session? What is your estimate, Maître Cantier, the remainder of his examination-in-chief? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I am about 30 per cent through my examination-in-chief, so I'm left with about 70 per cent. In terms of time, my estimate would be between one hour and one hour and a half. I believe one hour should be okay. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You did tell us, Maître Cantier, that you also are responsible for examination-in-chief of BIT. Is that the situation? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No? 
@MR. CANTIER:
It is Mr. Nekuie who would do that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Then Judge Arrey was right and -- as usual. Then the best solution seems to be that we finish this witness's examination-in-chief from 8:45 tomorrow, that we continue immediately with this witness and then move to BIT without cross-examination of this witness so that it will be possible to hear BIT in the morning. 
What is the length of BIT, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER:
From memory, I believe we wrote four hours. I do not have the document here. 
Yes, it has been confirmed to me that it's four hours, two hours and two hours, because Your -- Mr. President, Your Honours, we made our estimate on the basis of two hours for examination-in-chief, two hours for cross-examination, based on what our colleagues of the Prosecution did. But here it appears that our colleagues from the Prosecution side are faster with their cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a comment on what is the best procedure to be followed tomorrow morning in view of the health situation of BIT? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, if -- if my learned friend is confident that their chief will not take more than two hours, then I suggest we start with BIT -- start with BIT in-chief then carry on with PPO in the -- in the morning to finish his chief. 
Cross-examination, hopefully, will go on in the afternoon. We can follow on with BIT on -- the second half of BIT, be it, hopefully, cross-examination, on Friday morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In order to avoid any risk for you, Maître Cantier, we think that it's probably best to finish this witness, for whom you are responsible, first at 8:45, and when his examination-in-chief has finished after about one and a half hours, we will then switch to chief for BIT and think that that will be finished approximately around lunchtime. If that is not the case, we will spill BIT over to Friday morning. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Very well, Mr. President. Very well. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are informed that Laity Kama courtroom on the 4th floor is not in use. It's closer to all of us, compared to walking down here. We will, therefore, move to Laity Kama courtroom tomorrow morning at 8:45, and that's also where we will be sitting on Monday, as you know, with the video link. I think there is reason to believe that we may well sit in Laity Kama on Friday as well, but that will be confirmed. 
Mr. Witness, your testimony continues tomorrow morning at 8:45. 
The Court is adjourned.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Good morning. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, could you tell the Court what is your age? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
On 13th of September, I'll be 55. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, are you Hutu or Tutsi? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I had an identity card with the word "Hutu" on it, but I do not consider myself a Hutu. My mother was Hutu --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We did not get the father's identity, Mr. President, because there was a disruption. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I'm a product of a mixed marriage, and I had the -- the -- so I used the information on the identity card of my father who brought me up. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, have you testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, I testified before the ICTR in February 1998. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a slight interruption in the English version. So was it your testimony, then, Mr. Witness that your father was a Hutu and your mother a Tutsi, is that the situation? We didn't hear you clearly. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes, I'll repeat: My father -- my biological father did not raise me. My biological father's ethnicity is not on my identity card at that time. I used an identity card with the word "Hutu" on it, and that's what I explained, and I did that because there was no other possibility in that regard. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So your biological father, was he a Hutu or a Tutsi, just for the record? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
My biological father was a Tutsi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
But he never brought me up.

Yes, my first unpleasant experience was at the Kigali official college, which is in Mburabuturo, in February 1973, where there were ethnic problems at the college where I was -- in 1963, I beg your pardon. So what I did was to try and protect my colleagues, particularly my Tutsi colleagues who were in my dormitory. The dormitory had appropriately four people -- approximately four people: There were two Hutus and two Tutsis. 
Unfortunately, our Tutsi colleagues were compelled to leave the college. At that time, that struck me so much, that I personally also left the school. This is how I stopped school at 19 -- in 1973, and looked for work. And I was employed at the ********************************. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this location, Mburabuturo, can you spell that please? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes, I can spell it. Mburabuturo is a hill near Gikondo, and it's written M as in Matata, B as in Bernard, U as in Uwimana, R as in Rwanda, A as in Anatole, B as in Bernard, U as in Uwimana, T as in Teldo (phonetic), U as in Uwimana, R as in Rwanda, O as in Oscar. And the actual year was '73 when the incident -- when the incident occurred. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, thank you very much for assisting us with the spelling, and the next time you do that, please do not give us a word to clarify each letter because then we will have to spell all those words. So just the spelling is fine. And secondly, remember that you are in a courtroom now, so that all your answers must be brief. Here comes the next question.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was it in '93 or '73 this incident happened? Just for the record. We have two versions. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
'73. I was 20 and a half years old when I experience -- I saw my colleagues being harassed, and that disturbed me. I did everything possible to protect and save them, but I was repelled so much. I was revolted so much by that incident that I had to leave school. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, only brief answers. That answer could have been formulated simply by the year. 
Now, here comes the next question. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Okay. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, your occupation at the ******************************************************** and how did it end? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I was ************************************************************************************* and I did not make any distinction. I looked at merits and not regionalism, regional origin. I did not look at ethnicity. I just looked at capacity and, apparently, that disturbed my secretary general at that time and that led him to dismiss him -- to dismiss me from the job. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, were you involved in any political party? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No, I've never been involved up till now in any political party. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, in October 1990 -- I don't finish my question because there was a minor technical 
problem -- were you involved in human rights defence, be it in respect of a political party or an association in October 1990? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
In October 1990 I did not belong to any political party or any political organisation. I joined ARDHO, the Rwandan association for human rights. When I left, I was released from prison in 1991. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We were in open session, Maitre Cantier. There are many elements which put together could maybe give an indication as to whom they are talking about. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. I think that the witness's fear, which made him testify via video link, concerned his actual coming to this country and not in relation to his identification, because he's someone who is actively committed. So I don't think that those particular -- I mean those particular -- that particular information can really be harmful. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, but we will maintain the pseudonym, I understand. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, were you personally worried during the events which took place in your country as from 1st October 1990? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, I was arrested. I was beaten up at the Rwamagana judicial brigade. I was jailed in Kibungo prison for two and a half months from 4th November 1990 to 15th January 1991, and I was arrested and detained as an accomplice of the RPF. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, do you remember the date on which the préfecture of Kigali city was established? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, it was -- according to my research, it was in June 1990. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you remember the date on which the first préfet of Kigali was appointed? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, immediately after the round-up of 1990, and I was almost detained in that round-up. So, yes, since October 1990. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
According to you, Mr. Witness, who were one of the victims of that repression, did the 
préfectoral -- were the préfectoral departments involved in the mass arrests which took place in October 1990? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
What I noticed at that time, personally I was arrested by soldiers in Kimihurura. I was in Kigali. I was lucky I was not taken to the Nyamirambo regional stadium. I was in Kigali up to the 13th of July. I went to request for a laissez-passer at the PVK préfecture, which I received on the same day. I was lucky to get a car which drove me to the Kibungo in the Muhazi commune where I lived. So, in the neighbourhood where I was in, I did not see city police come to arrest me. Later I found out that it was the public prosecutor's office and the intelligence services which were involved in those operations of mass arrests. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, earlier on you told us that your first involvement in human rights organisation came subsequent to your release in January 1991. Now, Mr. Witness, could you tell us in which organisation were you involved then? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I joined directly the first association created on the 30th September '90. That was the 
association rwandaise pour la defense des droits de l'homme. It's acronym is ARDHO. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
ARDHO is number 1 on our list, and it is spelt A-R-D-H-O.

No, people called me crazy. It's the same thing today, because when you are involved in human rights, then you risk your life and limb. It was very difficult and one required a great deal of determination.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, you and your association, were you between 1991 and 1994, were you -- did you denounce and speak out human -- against human rights violations in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, we denounced many human rights violations everywhere, be they killings, abductions, massacres and other human rights violations. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, since your association followed closely the issue of human rights violations, in your investigations, in your reports, did you denounce acts of violence committed by Mr. Renzaho? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No, we never denounced Renzaho or his personality. The only problem we had to deal with in regard to the préfecture were the vendors, and we organised courses for the vendors, for the préfectoral policemen, and other officials, and things went on quite well in that regard. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, could you give us more specific examples citing areas of serious human rights violations which your association had to speak out against between 1991 and 1994? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
We denounced the -- denounced the Bugesera massacres in 1992, the Kibuye massacres in the Gishyita commune, the Kibilira massacre in the Kibilira commune, and the Muhororo massacres. 
We denounced some abductions here and there in the country as well as confrontations between political party members.

Witness, in addition to your activities in Rwanda with the ARDHO, did you have any activities at the international level? Are you linked with any other organisations at the international level? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, we had links with other organisations, we even participated in the creation of the Inter-African Association of Human Rights in 1992, and we finally got in touch with the -- Amnesty International and human rights. So we were in touch with other organisations, such as in 1993, together with other organisations of the CLADHO; we commissioned the first investigations on violations of human rights in Rwanda. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, were you present in Rwanda during the events of April to July 1994? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No, I was not in Rwanda. I had come to Belgium for studies in human rights, and if I were in Rwanda, it is obvious that I would have been killed.

Witness, did your family remain in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
My family remained in Muhazi commune where they were attacked on 12th April, very early on that day, 12th April 1994, my wife, my daughter, and my third child were all wounded with machetes. The other children were beaten. Fortunately they survived.

When I came back to Rwanda, I went -- I got involved directly in the investigations on the massacres that had taken place. I came back with money, which I had collected in Europe, and I immediately started clandestine investigations in Rwanda together with my colleagues who survived. We started in Kigali, beginning from the 15th August to 10th December, 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Witness, these investigations, are you able to say in what kind of framework did you work? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I worked in this as part of these investigations as the treasurer of the association, because I had the money of the association. I also worked in the field. We set up three teams, each one made up of 
two investigators. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, apart from ARDHO, were there other organisations that took part in these investigations?

@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, that is what I attempted to do because I reminded the witness that he did not mention that name earlier on. But the explanation that he has just given enabled me to understand why. If I may just go through it: There is ARDHO, AVP, ADL, LIPRODHOR, these four were members of -- or they formed CLADHO, if I understood what he explained. And in addition to that, there was a Kanyarwanda association.

And when it comes to AVP, sometimes we get a couple of other letters. Is this organisation only AVP or two more letters? Can you help us, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER:
If I understood clearly, that association was AVP. So there was ARDHO, ADL, AVP, 
LIPRODHOR -- these four: 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I only want the abbreviation of AVP. Is it AVP or AVPCR?

@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did the committee submit a report and if so, when? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
At the end of its work, which was not concluded -- and that is the dramatic aspect of the end of that mission, is that the report in a way was presented before the end of the work. And it is the chairman of the committee, Mr. Iyakaremye, Jean Bosco, who took that responsibility and that nearly led to a disintegration of CLADHO. 
The ADL organisation desolidarised itself from the report, and there were two donors -- donors and CECI, who also desolidarised -- distanced themselves from the report. And that is how come we were not able to continue with the work of the committee so as to deal with other regions of the country. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, hold on. Please slow down. Please do not give us all these details and all these abbreviations in such a speed. Names must be spelt if we need them. We know many names in this courtroom, but not all the names you are using. 
Now you referred to the chairman of the committee. Can you repeat Jean Bosco's last name, please? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
He's called Iyakaremye, and I spell it, I-Y-A-K-A-R-E-M-Y-E.

And then you appeared to refer to two donors. Can you repeat that very slowly now? 
Which two references did you just give us, the two that distanced themselves?

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
It's a federation of Flemish NGOs. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Witness, for these explanations. But we can try and break them down further. First of all to enhance each one -- the understanding for each one of us, and also for purposes of the interpretation. 
Witness, that committee published a report dated 10th December 1994, and this report makes reference to the role played by Mr. Renzaho in the events. Witness, did you participate in drafting that part of the report, and did you share in the conclusions of that report? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
At the stage that the report came out, we were going through the lists. We had to fine-tune -- withdraw duplications, and we requested two colleagues -- investigators just as our ourselves, that is, Mr. Iyakaremye, whose name I just spelt, and Mr. Nkongoli, Laurent. Nkongoli is spelt, N-K-O-N-G-O-L-I. They were to draft the report and present it to us. And it was with a lot of surprise that on the 10th of December, we heard the chairman of the committee present our report, which was not completed because we were still fine-tuning the lists, and this was given on national radio, and that is what brought the finality to this report. 
But as you asked me, I do not share in the conclusions of this report, because the document was never submitted for discussion. We were -- we were obliged to sign it because it had been disseminated before the conclusion of the investigations, and before the conclusion of the fine-tuning, and that is what I referred to as the dramatic aspect or the dramatic nature of this report. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, I reminded you a while ago that this report accused Mr. Renzaho, and you have just told us that you do not share the content of the report. My question then is as follows, Witness: Since you investigated in Kigali town, the investigations that you personally carried out, did that enable you to identify Mr. Renzaho as being the person who ordered the crimes in Kigali or one of the perpetrators of those crimes? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No, we went up the chain of responsibility all the way down -- all the way up to the 
conseiller de secteur. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, are you able to give us examples of persons that you were able to identify in Kigali town through your investigations as persons being responsible for crimes which were perpetrated in the town? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, we identified three conseillers de secteur of PVK, and persons all over the place -- Nyamirambo, Kicukiro and Kacyiru, I still have some names in mind. I don't know if you want me to list them and to spell them. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
For now, that doesn't appear to be necessary, Witness. 
Witness, are you able to tell the Chamber very concisely the methodology that you used to gather your information? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
We used a very simple method which is normally used in the police service or the department of public prosecutions. We arrived in a cellule and we found out about those people who were there during the massacres. And when we found the witnesses of the acts, we will bring them together in a house, which has sufficient space, someone who is willing to welcome us, because we did not have a mobile office or a bus. 
So we asked these people to accompany us -- and we'll be taking notes. People then still had a fresh memory; that was in August, September, October, such that they gave us a detailed account of what happened, giving the names, the location of the roadblocks, and mentioning the names of the victims when they were known in the neighbourhood. Because there were people who were killed along the way, they were trying to flee -- intercepted on the roadblocks and killed. But people who were killed in the neighbourhood, their names were given. 
At that time, people were still speaking freely. It started becoming difficult in October when they realised that there was mass arrests of people without investigations, and they kept quiet because they said there was no point in telling the truth. And that is what slowed down our investigations towards the end -- slowed down the testimony of eyewitness. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, there were names of people which were mentioned in the report, and who were denounced as being criminals, and then there were further investigations, which showed that mistakes had been made. Could you -- if they exist, could you give us examples or an example of mistaken denunciations? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Oh, yes, of course, yes, of course. This was a report which contained many errors depending on the specific investigations, and that really made our report be -- to be flawed. 
I can give you the case of a member of ADL, Mr. Jean Rubaduka, who was wrongly named in the report. Because members of CLADHO could go and talk to him, he was someone who had not left town. 
So you had these kinds of mistakes. There were many people, who were mentioned, and they contacted CLADHO, but unfortunately CLADHO didn't have the resources or the time. Personally, I left in 1995, so we could not really follow up what had happened. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, you've just mentioned a name which is not on the spelling list. Could you please give us the correct spelling of the name? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
He was a lawyer, a former conseiller, a councillor at the state council. His name was Jean Rubaduka. Let me spell Rubaduka. Rubaduka is spelt R-U-B-A-D-U-K-A. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, do you remember the name on -- or names of other people who were named in the report as having participated in the genocide, but who subsequently were cleared of such accusations? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, as I said, there were many complaints. For example, there was the former defence minister, 
Mr. James Gasana, who had fled Rwanda in July 1993, and who had sought refuge elsewhere. 
He was mentioned in the -- in a part of that report, but he had sought refuge in Switzerland. But according to the Swiss authorities, he was cleared of those suspicions. 
Then, there was Paul Mbaraga, who was a journalist at radio -- Deutsche Welle, who at that time, when he heard about the report, he asked me to confirm whether he had been accused in that report. And this was in 1998 that I was obliged officially to denounce in writing that report. Today, 
Paul Mbaraga lives in Kigali, and from what I know he's not -- you know, really being bothered for any reason whatsoever.

Mr. Witness, still regarding the report, because here we have had many difficulties getting it, especially through the EDS system. We have had only a few pages of the report. Now we have a document of 40 pages, and you have just talked about a point which raises questions in my mind. Was there another document published on 10th December 1994 or was the document in question only 40 pages? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No, the document of 40 pages concerns the commentary part of the report as such. Otherwise, our work on the ground was to collect names of people seen at massacres, people who took people in their house. But the most sensitive part is the commentary part, which was to be discussed; but it was never discussed. And that is how on the 10th of December we learnt that the chairman of the commission or committee decided to disseminate the report. 
So we -- not everyone was aware of that. At least, what I noticed in our meeting, people were not aware of that, apart from the chairman himself. Yet, we were also surprised to hear the report on the radio. We had worked on the report together. We had rented a room in Christus centre in Rebero in order to have time and space to discuss that. So, for me, it was premature for him to disseminate the report because it was presented with many errors and mistakes and it prejudiced several people, which was not the objective of our human rights associations; in other words, to actually just attack people. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, investigations carried out in Kigali city, did they allow you to identify people responsible within the PVK? I asked you about Mr. Renzaho; you answered me. Now, I am asking you the same question regarding staff members of the Kigali city préfecture. 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Apart from the secteur conseillers, whom I can mention if you wish, we did not find any authority of the préfecture who incited people to commit massacres. Personally, I had the opportunity of going through the documentation and interviewing people, and found out that Mr. Kibungo (sic), the sub-préfet, assisted orphans; he assisted other people to be evacuated towards safer areas. But we were told that there were some PVK police officers who killed some of their neighbours. But what we saw is that there were individuals who committed -- or participated in massacres in an isolated manner without being asked to do so by authorities, apart from areas where secteur conseillers were seen on the scene of the massacres doing that, as was the case at the 
Sainte Famille. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, in your answer, you have mentioned a site known as Sainte Famille, in English, the Holy Family. Now my question is as follows. Did you personally investigate into the CELA site, the Saint Paul site and the Sainte Famille site? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No, I did not personally investigate those sites because at that time when I started investigating, the sites were empty, people had gone back to their homes. It was in our investigations in neighbourhoods that we met people who had sought refuge at those sites and told us about what they remembered regarding the time and those places. I have some information regarding what happened at those sites through my -- which I got through my investigation in the various neighbourhoods of Kigali city. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, we understand that the sites were empty, therefore, you could not go and see people who, of course, were not there, so you had to investigate in neighbourhoods. But you carried out your investigations in respect of those sites and in respect of the events which occurred there; right? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes. Overall, we took into account other events which took place in Kigali city. People gave us an account of what happened at where they were. So, the information we'd got were wide -- were general information, which were not really like a road traffic accident. No, we got information came in -- amongst a massive amount of information, and we had to sort out such information. And that was what we were doing when the report was disseminated. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness. Could you please tell us, when one read the so-called raw material, so to speak, of what you did, did you talk about the involvement of the préfet of the city in relation to the CELA events? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes. We heard that he left when Interahamwes came to look for people who were either infiltrators or accomplices. So he actually went there, Bourgmestre Bizimana went there, and, after the abduction of some young people, Father Munyeshyaka proposed that the remaining refugees should be taken to Sainte Famille, where they should join other people who had sought refuge there in order to avoid them being isolated at CELA, which was a small centre and which did not have adequate space. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, what information did you gather in -- with regard to the attacks against the Saint Paul centre and Sainte Famille centre, more specifically, according to information gathered during your investigation, did -- was Préfet Renzaho -- was Préfet Renzaho involved in those attacks? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Here I am categorical. It was out of the question to talk about involvement of Préfet Renzaho in those attacks. On the contrary, we know that Sous-Préfet Simpunga, Aloys, helped a lot of people who were at those centres, particularly at the Sainte Famille centre. He evacuated people to another place and, together with Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, helped them get food. If Préfet Renzaho was involved, then he definitely had prevented his sub-préfet from helping those people. And I think that Préfet Renzaho was very well aware of the activities of his aides. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did the investigations you carry out -- you carried out -- allow you to identify the perpetrators or the participants of attacks which were carried out against those sites? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, they were militiamen made up of many kinds of people, particularly delinquents and bandits from Kigali city, and other people as well. And what happened at the Sainte Famille is that -- when people give you an account of what happened they just said, "Interahamwes came". They could not give you names of people, particularly since there are many Interahamwes who did not use their real names. So they would only identify some people who committed the crime. 
But regarding people who were known by authorities, we were able to know the actual perpetrators because they were known. But I have to say most Interahamwes were people who weren't identified because people did not know them, and they used different names. And I heard some names, but that was a long time ago. People talked -- used to talk about Interahamwe, Interahamwe, Interahamwe, without giving specific names of those Interahamwes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, as you suggested earlier on, could you give the Court information regarding heads of secteurs who apparently were involved in those events? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes. From memory, I can mention Odette Nyirabagenzi, Rugenge secteur conseiller, where young people abducted at Saint Solare (phonetic) were killed. There was another conseiller called Kamatamu. I believe Odette -- if my memory serves me well, Odette Kamatamu was from the Muhima secteur. As a lady who often comes in testimonies of people, she was an inspector of the school area of that sector; her name was Angeline Rukahuty (sic). 
@MR. CANTIER:
The three names came up, particularly with regard to the massacre site of Sainte Famille. Mr. President, they are names with which we are familiar, but not the third one. That is on 164 on our list. It's at 164 on our list: Kamatamu, Euphrasie. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, in your investigations did you establish a link between Interahamwes and the leaders you just mentioned and with the préfecture -- with Renzaho, as being the préfet? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
What appeared to us, as I said, is that massacres were committed, often by groups of individuals, and often without a direct link to any authority. The Interahamwes who came with Conseiller Odette or Conseiller Angeline, those attacks took place, but we did not find, in respect of them -- we did not find a link between those attacks and those officials on the one hand, and Préfet Renzaho on the other. There was no link, because he went to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille 
and -- within the context of his work, often accompanied by UNAMIR officials. But we did not establish any link or any evidence showing that those conseillers had received orders from him. 
And I also told you that the sub-préfet publicly assisted refugees. And the préfet could not have -- behind such assistance, could not have authorised massacres to be carried out, no. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, can you tell us, when did you leave Rwanda? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I left Rwanda on 27th of February 1995, and I went to Belgium. I had gone there to try to look for something -- a solution to something, but I did not know that I would be there up to now as a refugee. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, you are not a supporter of the old regime, you were not present during the events; so what made you flee from your country? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
You see, in our work as human rights activists we were doing very dangerous work, because we work -- we deal with violations of human rights and we try to identify perpetrators as well as victims. I started working as *************** during the CLADHO Kanyarwanda effort. Parallelly, I found that with regard to massacres by Interahamwes, parallel to that, there were massacres committed by RPF. I found that. So I would go to cells of gendarmerie stations, I found people who had been unjustly tortured or arrested, I became very well known in the country because I was considered to be fearless, going not only to Kigali but throughout the country. I was looking for people who had been abducted, who had disappeared. So all my work involving the disappeared people after RPF had taken power, all that made me to be considered by the new regime as someone undesirable to be eliminated. I escaped several assassination attempts. I decided to temporarily leave my country, and see whether the situation would calm down and whether the government would put an end to killings, massacres, abductions, which were still continuing almost throughout the country. So it was because of my activities as an activist who did not tolerate those activities and was not afraid, I was obliged to leave earlier than the others. Because, after me, other human rights activists went into exile, including people who went into exile in 2004. So it was in my capacity and in respect of the work I did in human rights. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What happened to the association to which you belonged to initially, that is, the ARDHO? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
L'ARDHO was an association which was, very early, taken over by people close to the government, because when former chairman of ARDHO Alphonse Murango (sic) became minister of justice, it was the RPF -- our association -- I beg your pardon -- our association had a new chairman. So, our association was taken over by RPF -- people close to RPF. Our association was the spearhead of other associations, members of CLADHO; and it was neutralised, particularly after my departure, and Richard Nsanzibara (sic), who had been an assistant who had replaced, who was a Tutsi, who also became permanent secretary after me, and who had to leave at the end of '97 to go to Canada, where he still lives. 
So, after that, ARDHO did not do much in terms of human rights activities. I know that it is -- I heard that it still exists. But I have not seen any reports which try to denounce acts of violence which are taking place currently in our country right now. After the departure of the person who *************, that is Mr. Charles (sic) Nsanzabaganwa -- I will spell -- that is spelt N-S-A-N-Z-A-B-A-G-I -- A-N-W-A, Nsanzabaganwa. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the last name of Alphonse, please, the spelling? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes. Nkubito is spelt N-K-U-B-I-T-O.
@MR. CANTIER:
It's 295 on the list, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And is that the person who later became minister of justice, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes. The first minister of justice in an RPF government. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And, now, the last name of someone called Richard? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes, I spelt it, but I can repeat. **************** before I was forced to flee the country, and he ************************************. When he was there, ARDHO tried to work under difficult conditions, but he did honest work. But when he left, ARDHO became -- fell under the patriotic front. I spelt it, but I can repeat it. It's N-S-A-N-Z-A-B-A-G-A-N-W-A, Nsanzabaganwa.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what was his first name? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Richard. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Not Charles? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
No, Richard.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, you made reference to ARDHO. Are you able to briefly give us the fate of the other human rights associations, particularly LIPRODHOR, since your departure? What has become of them today? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Unfortunately, associations who were members of CLADHO saw most of their members -- active members go into exile. The last ones were the leaders of LIPRODHOR, who left in 1994, after a parliamentary report accused them of being revisionists, and because they continued denouncing violations of human rights in Rwanda. So, today, those associations have been forced into silence, or if they do anything, then they do it in line with the position of power. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief. 
Thank you, Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. We didn't have an 11 o'clock break today because we had this break in connection with the video link from 9:40 to around 10:05. 
Would it be all right with a little break before your cross-examination? How long is that estimated to be, Ms. Melluish? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I don't think my cross will be more than about half an hour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, but then we have time. Let's start at five minutes to 12. 
The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1142H to 1203H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, we have to stop at 12:45 today. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Okay. 
Your Honour, just before I start, perhaps I should let this Court know what's happened with regard to the documents I might be using with this witness. They were sent by the registry to The Hague, where I understand they have not been received in The Hague. And I gather from my case manager that some of those are now being faxed through. It may be that we have to work without the witness being able to see any of those documents before him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will see how it develops. I understand there is only one day which The Hague is prepared for. But what we could do, if suddenly a question arises, is maybe to postpone parts of your cross-examination to the afternoon, if the need arises. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you said you were arrested on the 4th of November 1990 and only released in February 19 -- January, sorry, 1991. That's correct, is it? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Your information is accurate. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, as I understood it, your arrest was part of what you described as the roundup that took place following the RPF invasion; is that right? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No. My imprisonment in Kimungu (sic) is not linked to the -- my arrest in Kigali, because I was released immediately. I was talking about people who came to where I was, because on the night of the 4th to the 5th I was blocked in Kigali. I had gone to Kigali on the 1st. We did not know that war would break out. I remained in Kigali up to the 13th of October. 
On the night of 4th to the 5th, there were gunshots. I was afraid, I could not sleep. And at that time, in the morning, I was arrested when there was a roundup in Kigali city. There were soldiers, yes. Whereas, my arrest in Kibungo took place on 4th of November; in other words, later when I had returned home to the commune. So these two events took place in two different places. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Okay. So what...(microphones overlapping) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Another microphone was on, so we didn't hear you. Can you please repeat? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Just so I am completely clear, Witness, you were arrested on the night of the 4th to 5th October in Kigali as part of that roundup, and then immediately released, is that right? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, that is correct. I was arrested in the morning. There was firing at night. Soldiers in the morning came into houses. I had my identity card showing that I was from Kibungo. Since the rebellion had started in the northeast in Kagutumo (phonetic), I was able to explain that I was not from there. I was detained for one or two hours, not more than that. And my arrest of the 
4th of November was linked to the fact that I went to the brigade to talk on behalf of my brother who had been arrested, being accused as being an RPF infiltrator. So when I went there, I was arrested and, actually, I was put in prison. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, Mr. Witness, that question could have been answered simply with "yes". Will you try to observe that when it is possible. Here comes the next question. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Why is it in the statement that you made for the Defence on the 17th of April of this year that you gave the impression that your arrest and, indeed, your case in Kibungo was all part of the massive roundup following the RPF invasion? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I did not give that impression. There were roundups in October and they continued in different places in the country. When I went to the brigade, that is, the police station, to talk on behalf of my younger brother, I was impris -- arrested, just like those people who had been arrested in October. And there was -- it was the same reasoning running through those two months. So I was arrested as being an accomplice of the RPF. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You said that the préfet could not have had anything to do with these arrests because he wasn't appointed until afterwards; is that right? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Not exactly, because I explained that I was arrested by soldiers. It was -- not by the -- not by police officers or officers of the préfecture. That is what happened on the 5th of October. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Which was, of course, the date that the préfet, Renzaho, entered into office, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
He entered office on the 6th. He was appointed on the 6th of October. I don't know when he actually entered his office because I have not checked that. But I know that he was appointed on the 6th of October. The country was at war, so they needed, maybe, to have a military officer to become a préfet in order to deal with that situation. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But you weren't, at that time, working for the préfecture office, were you? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I have never worked for the préfectoral office. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So you are in no position to tell us what role Renzaho did or did not have in those arrests, are you? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I testified to what I saw at that time, where I was. And even later when I was in ARDHO, we worked in all areas to try to see -- to check the massive human rights violations. I had a talk with Nkubito, who was working for the public prosecution office. He took part in the arrests of RPF accomplices. So in that -- in the course of that work I was convinced that Préfet Renzaho was not involved in those arrests. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Did you hear some of the large amount of criticism that Renzaho received for his involvement in the sale of the property of Tutsi who fled following the arrests in October 1991 (sic)? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I know that properties of Tutsis who sought -- took refuge following the 1990 war were sold on the basis that they had loans from banks. But, of course, the sales were linked to politics; we should not be hypocritical. But I do not have any concrete information showing that he was involved in auctioning those properties. That could have been possible, but the préfet was not involved in the sales of those properties. But I know that properties were sold in order to recover bank loans, and I don't see what role the préfet could have had in those auctions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you just refer to arrests in October 1990 or October 1991? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I am sorry, Your Honour, I made the mistake of mentioning 1991 instead of '90. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, from that rather long answer you just gave, should I take it from that that you did hear the criticism that Renzaho received for the sale of the properties? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
At that time, I did not hear criticisms regarding the préfet. But over the last 13 years, that is, later, we have been hearing a lot of things said. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you left Rwanda, didn't you, on the 12th of March of 1994 and returned from your stage in Europe on the 22nd of July of 1994, didn't you? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So nothing that you can tell us about Renzaho's activities during the genocide comes from your own direct experience, does it? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
That is correct. All that I know actually emanates from investigations. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
The investigations that you carried out along with other members of the CLADHO team from the 15th of August 1994 to the 10th of December 1994; that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes. My investigations did not stop there. Even after going into exile here in Europe, and up to now, I have continued working on several investigations with either entities or interested citizens, I have continued working. And it is within the overall context that I am being able to testify currently. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
But after February 1995, you have not returned to Rwanda, have you? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No, no. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So your most thorough investigations were carried out between the 15th of August and the 10th December 1994, when, as you said yourself, people still had a fresh memory of the events; isn't that right? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes; however, as I said, investigations are permanent work and I am continuing with my investigations. From 15th August to 10th December '94 I dealt with the part concerning Kanyarwanda CLADHO. But I -- I was in the country, I amassed vast information. And even though when I went to Europe I continued looking for eyewitnesses, people who had been in Rwanda. I am still doing this, because an investigator always has new elements, either confirming or otherwise what you already know. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You told us that you don't agree with some of the conclusions drawn by the CLADHO report published on 10th December. That didn't stop you signing it, did it, Witness? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes. I explained that we signed in order to avoid a breakdown of CLADHO. Unfortunately, we did not avoid the split within CLADHO. CLADHO exists, but only on paper. It does not have cohesion as before, and that -- and I said that that committee had actually published a report which was incomplete. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, isn't it disingenuous to sign a document that you don't agree -- or, indeed, categorically disagree with the contents? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yet that was what was one -- was the special aspect of that particular document we signed, because the chairman of the commission presented a report which was not complete. We discussed it, as I said in examination-in-chief. We all must have thought that in order to calm down people, we decided to sign the document, in spite of the fact we knew that there were many, many imperfections. Subsequently, we turned out to be right. There were complaints, there were disassociations on the part of donors, as well as the umbrella body CLADHO, which was part of the investigations. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
You mentioned disputes with donors. You didn't lose the donations from Christian Aid from London or Amnesty from Belgium, did you, as a result of the publication on the 10th of December '94? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Is that a question or is it a -- or are they just comments from you? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes or no, did you lose the donations from Christian Aid and Amnesty, which you didn't mention earlier? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I did not talk about losing funds. I talked about letters disassociating those entities from the report. I did not talk about funds. I talked about donors who made known their criticisms and reservations and said that they did not agree with the report because the report was biased. They would have wanted also the crimes and violence committed by RPF to be included in the report. And that is what led the donors to disassociate themselves with the contents of the report. But I did not talk about funds because the donors continued funding the association. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And that ties in with what you said earlier, which is that the reason that you couldn't continue with the report and finish it properly was that you couldn't -- you were unable to deal with the other regions of the country, so that the report only dealt with the préfecture of Kigali-ville; that's right, isn't it? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I think maybe you did not hear me well. I talked about criticism from donors who said that the first part was not objective because we investigated only one side; the other side does not appear in the report, so our report was biased. That is why we stopped, but not because of lack of financial resources. It's because the first part was already disqualified. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I just want to refer you to a few extracts from your report. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
There was a cut-off in the sound and we did not hear the end of the witness's answer for at least 15 seconds -- for at least about 15 seconds. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you now referring to the very last answer? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. We saw him speak, but we did not receive any sound. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we heard you say the following: "I think, maybe, you did not hear me well. I talked about criticism from donors who said that the first part was not objective because we investigated only one side. The other side doesn't appear in the report, so our report was biased. That's why we stopped, but not because of lack of financial resources. It's because the first part was already disqualified."
Now, this is what we got down here. Did you say anything else in your last answer?

I do appreciate that you don't have the document before you, and please let us know if there is a problem related to that. But it's right -- and the document is at -- it's the seventh document in the bundle. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Page? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, first of all, it's the seventh document of the CLADHO Kanyarwanda report. That's the first question.

Yes, we have understood that. Now, which page, please? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Can we look at page 16 in the English and page 14 in the French? 
Witness, do you recall that one of the conclusions of the report that you signed was that members of the Rwandan government and their collaborators were implicated in the killings and, amongst those people, you mentioned a man called Côme Bizimungu, the préfet of Kigali-rural, which is about the ninth or tenth name down the list. 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
As I told you, the -- we signed the document. I acknowledged this and I said this; however, the content --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
@WITNESS MAJ:
-- actually binds only the authors. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Do you remember that there was a reference to Côme Bizimungu in the report, yes or no? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I don't have the list of those people in front of me here. If my memory serves me well, we are talking about Côme Bizimungu. We talked about him in ARDHO when he was the préfet of Gisenyi at that time. I don't know how he enters into this report because I did not participate in the drafting of this report; and, therefore, in this respect I cannot help you. I don't know why the people who drafted this part of the report put Bizimungu here. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, do you recall, at page 24 in the English and page 25 in the French, that the report concluded that among the sponsors of the genocide were the members of the crisis committee established on the 8th of April 1994; do you recall that? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I did not get your question clearly because there was a loss in communication. There was a loss in communication; can you please repeat your question? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recall that your report concluded that amongst the sponsors of the genocide were the members of the crisis committee established on the 8th of April? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, as far as I am concerned, you are asking me about the content of that report. As I told you, I signed the document without accepting its content, and I have told you the circumstances under which it was written. But that does not mean that, personally, while investigating the tragedy -- the Rwandan tragedy, I could find another person. But, otherwise, the formulation -- the document and the language used is from those persons -- the two persons who drafted it. So I cannot comment on it. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about this, Witness? You said that you were involved in investigations in all three communes of the préfecture of Kigali-ville. Do you not recall that, at page 27 in the English and 28 in the French, your report concluded, when it came to the responsibility of local and national authorities as follows, "Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho was named in all the cities' neighbourhoods as a person who distributed arms and ammunition or incited people to track down Tutsi"? 
Can you hear me, Witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

You said that you were involved in investigations in all of the communes of Kigali-ville. Do you then dispute, nonetheless, the conclusions in the report which stated that 
Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho was named in all the cities' neighbourhoods as a person who distributed arms and ammunition or incited people to track down Tutsi, he even went as far as dismissing one of his bourgmestres, the one for Kicukiro commune, and replacing him with someone that had no training whatsoever who happened to be the chief of Interahamwe for the Gikondo neighbourhood". Do you recall those conclusions? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I do not recall that, but since you are saying it, then it has to be in the report, but we did not discuss it. But if you want my opinion, I can give you that subsequently, because I knew the former bourgmestre of Kicukiro. He also fled and was replaced by an Interahamwe. But, otherwise, the presence of Préfet Renzaho in the neighbourhood, as I said earlier, I did not observe it. He came to the Sainte Famille, to CELA, and Saint Paul also, once or twice to 
Sainte Famille. But, as I said, in the neighbourhood, we did not observe his involvement, and that is why the contents of this portion of the report was not the subject of a consensus, and I was not involved in it. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about the statement on the document marked number 8 in the Court's bundle that, "Monsieur le préfet Renzaho, Tharcisse, is one of the major instigators of the genocide and the massacres". Is that something you also claim today to dispute? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you now refer to an annex to the same report? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We seem to have lost The Hague again. 
Yes, Mr. Witness, can you hear the voice now, my voice? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I heard the beginning of the President's intervention. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you recall the question just before we lost each other, namely, a reference to an annex to the report? Did you hear that quote? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we are losing the witness. We just hear bits of his answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just answer with a yes or no now, Mr. Witness. Did you hear the Prosecution's question about this annex to the report? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Since I cannot see the content of the report, I don't know what is contained in there, and I don't know how you classified or how you structured the document, and I don't t know which passage you are referring to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you see, the Prosecution read out a couple of sentences, and my only question is whether you heard those sentences. But, in view of the time that has elapsed now, she will read it again. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, in the annex to the report, it states, "The préfet, Tharcisse Renzaho, is one of the major instigators of the genocide and the massacres." Is that statement in the report that you signed on the 10th of December 1994 something that, today, you also dispute? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, yes, I dispute that. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Similarly -- and I am referring to tab 9, another allegation made in your report -- do you dispute today that Aloys Simpunga was named as a participant in the genocide along with Alexis Bizinkuli? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I don't know if that is mentioned because I do not have the document, but I know he saved a lot of people, and there is a lot of testimony to that event. Bizinkuli, I have no idea about that.
MS. MELLUISH:
And at tab 10, Your Honours. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
What about Major Nyamuhimba, also described as a genocidaire in the report of 10th December; do you now dispute that? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I cannot confirm or deny that because I have -- I do not recall hearing his name in the neighbourhoods that I investigated. But, as I said, the fine-tuning of this list was not concluded before it was broadcast on radio. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Okay, Witness, what about tab 11 -- what about Gaspard, the chauffeur of Renzaho? He was accused in your report. Do you now dispute that? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I cannot confirm nor deny that because you are the one mentioning his name now as one of the accused persons. But, in Rwanda, a lot of people are accused. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you agree with me -- or do you agree with the conclusions of your report regarding Angeline Mukandituye being the president of the Interahamwe in Rugenge secteur? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
That is clear because, in addition to this report, I heard several testimonies of several witnesses speak about Angeline Mukandituye. So, quite apart from this report of CLADHO, I heard testimonies accusing this woman. 
MS. MELLUISH:
So -- Your Honours, with reference to number 12. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
So, your report is correct, inasmuch as it said of her: "Her house had become the staff -- the general staff headquarters of the Interahamwe, that is where the Interahamwe lived -- the trained Interahamwe lived, and who were -- the escort of the president. Regular meetings were held in her house for purposes of drawing up a list of the remaining Tutsis, specify their place of refuge and to organise attacks to eliminate them. Before attacking, all the killers went to the general staff headquarters to procure for weapons -- to collect weapons and ammunitions." 
Do you agree with those conclusions, then, Witness? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
The formulation and the content could be different from the truth because I did not cover that cellule. I think it was André and Bernadette. But, personally, I heard on several occasions witnesses talk about the involvement of this woman, as well as in my investigation here in Europe, I met people who talk about this woman. The fact that she is involved is indisputable, but I cannot comment on the details that you are reading. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to stop now. As I said, 12:45 there was a meeting which was supposed to start. We will then continue at 2:30 and we hope that any technical difficulties will have been eliminated by them. It's gone quite nicely so far. We will then come back Arusha time 2:30, with other words, one hour earlier Hague time. 
The Court is adjourned.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. Can you hear us well? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I can hear you very clearly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. We will now hear the last questions to be posed by the Prosecution. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. Witness, do you recall what the report said about the conseiller Odette Nyirabagenzi? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And am I right that you agree with the conclusion that she supervised the organisation of the genocide in Rugenge secteur? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
The wording could be true or not. What is sure is that she was seen at several places where Tutsis were abducted. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, Witness, let me remind you please of the wording - 
MS. MELLUISH:
And, Your Honours, I'm looking at number 13 in the bundle. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Your report, Witness, states: "She is responsible for all the killings which were committed in her secteur by soldiers, Interahamwes and other killers. She led abductions, killings operated at sought" -- "at places of refuge, the killings of fugitives, in other words, at the Sainte Famille church, the community of Sister Teresa" -- "Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Centre of missionary of Africa, CELA, as well as the Saint Paul centre and the hostels or homes of the JOC." 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Sorry? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Hold on now. What has happened now is that Prosecution Counsel has read something out to you. 
Now here follows the question. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Now, you have heard a more detailed summary of the conclusions of the report, do you recall them and do you agree with them? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
In general I agree, without approving the wording. As I told you, Nyirabagenzi was seen at various sites. My conviction is that Nyirabagenzi participated in massacres. But the wording here, talking about all centres, is something I cannot know, because this is a disputed document. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And, Witness, finally on this report, do you recall that the report concluded that the church was particularly responsible for the genocide? And do you recall the following passage from the report: "The most" - 
MS. MELLUISH:
I am sorry, Your Honour, I'm reading from page 34 in the English. It's page 36 in French, tab 7. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness: "The most glaring example was at the Sainte Famille church where Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka had taken over as parish priest after the flight of the Tutsi parish priest. He stood out by actively siding" - "he stood out by actively siding with the genocide perpetrators. He behaved as a real Interahamwe in all he did and everywhere he went." Do you recall that passage, Witness, and do you agree with it? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, I remember that. And I can see what it means because there have been such accusations. However, the acts as they took place are contrary to what he is being accused of regarding many things. I think that what he did can be discussed, in that people who were threatened could interpret such -- or such attitude by Father Munyeshyaka differently, because someone under threat cannot generally alleviate the situation. The information which I have gathered up to now, shows that 
Father Munyeshyaka is not a genocidaire. And if there is a neutral commission I think he will be 
really -- he will come out at the end as a hero. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, it seems that there are some allegations in this report that you refute today and others with which you are quite happy. Does your view on this change depend on who has asked you to testify for them? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
No, no. It's because I have a lot of information which I cannot give in detail right now. You have asked me for short answers. That is why I'm brief, in order to avoid wasting time. Wenceslas was not a criminal. He's not a genocidaire. He helped people with the means he had at that time. I've had the opportunity to publish something on that subject. That's why I want to go to the logical conclusion because, you know, talking about bulletproof vests, and so on and so forth. Whatever he did were strategies he took to help people being threatened. That is what I gathered from testimonies of people. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, was it -- when was it that you decided that this CLADHO report was something you disagreed with, presumably after you signed it on 10th December 1994? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
The day of its disclosure, except not only publication, but its disclosure. That when I gave my opinion. I explained to you that the fact that we signed it has nothing to do with the contents of the report. We wanted CLADHO to exist and not to spilt up. That's what I said. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
After you left Rwanda, never to date to return, in February 1995, it's right, isn't it, that you gave a number of witness statements to this Tribunal; do you recall giving those witness statements? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes. I came here for the Akayesu trial, in ninety--
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We missed the last part because of communication breakdown. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, which year? Can you repeat? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I came here in February 1998 to Arusha to testify in the Akayesu trial. That is if I understood your question, Counsel. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH: 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, on that occasion you came to testify for Akayesu. I'm referring to statements you have given to investigators from the office of the Prosecutor here at the Tribunal. Do you recall, for example, making a statement on the 21st March 1997? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Before the tribunal? Or -- I did not come to the Tribunal in 1997. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
I think, Witness, there may be a linguistic misunderstanding. I'm talking about a document that was typed up and signed by you, not an oral testimony that you gave here. Do you remember signing such a document in March 1997? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
I signed a lot of documents. Can I see that one? 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
If the bundle of documents that we sent to The Hague has now been located, you should have that document before you. Perhaps someone could clarify whether a blue folder of documents has arrived?
@MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Yes, Prosecutor. We have received the folder from Arusha. Could you please give me the number, so that I could give this document to the Witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Number 4. 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Do you recognise your signature on the bottom of the French version of that statement? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, yes. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
And isn't it right that on page 3, at the beginning of the second paragraph, in both the English and the French version, you stated in 1997 of this CLADHO report: "The conclusions of the report are very similar to my personal convictions concerning the situation in the country which inevitably led to the massacres and killings which followed the attack on the president's plane." 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, when I say they are similar, it regards the substance, not the details. Because we have a way -- people have a way of wording questions and wording answers in order to pass on information. Among the civilian authorities, there were not people who were capable of stopping the massacres. But it would be wrong to think that all the authorities approved the massacres, or participated in the massacres actually, that would be wrong. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
Witness, you never wrote or published or signed a retraction of this CLADHO report, did you? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
The first time I challenged the report was regarding the journalists I mentioned at beginning of the testimony. It is Paul Mbaraga who works for the Deutsche Welle and who was mentioned in the report. This was in 1998. I did so in writing, and I explained what I explained earlier on in this testimony concerning all the challenges against this report. That was in 1998. And I believe I did this later for James Gasana when he was attacked in Switzerland. I had to give the Swiss investigators working on the case updated information. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the last name of the journalist called Paul, can you help us with that, the spelling? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes. Paul Mbaraga. I'll spell that, M-B-A-R-A-G-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Melluish? 
$BY MS. MELLUISH:
@MS. MELLUISH: 
In respect of those two individuals, Witness, you say that you retracted what was written about them in the report in 1998. But in 2000, in another statement that appears at tab 5 of your bundle, which you made for this Tribunal, you were happy, weren't you, to refer to the report without any caveat about its contents? And I am referring to the last line of page six over to page seven in the French; bottom of page five over to page six in the English. Do you see that, Witness? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, I can see page six and page seven where I have it as well. 
@MS. MELLUISH: 
There you've referred to Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye. And you state: "I was a member of a six-person investigation team that went to investigate in the three communes of the capital city Kigali. You can find a copy of this report at CLADHO." There's no mention there, is there, of any caveat you might have, as you claim today, about the quality of that report, or its findings in general? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
We're talking about two women here, and throughout my testimony here, I've said that these women were mentioned by several witnesses outside the report. I did not only cover August to September. I continued and still am continuing. So one can access, reduce or add something to a report according to ongoing investigations. 
So, I don't see how this is inconsistent, because there are some things in the report which are true. Some of the information in this report can be challenged, in that they were not discussed. They were not debated and the report was just issued just like this, and we just signed it. But here I don't see any inconsistency because I'm talking of something that existed. And these people are mentioned in the report as well as by witnesses who are not covered by the report. So this is a good thing. 
But the reason I mentioned the Kanyarwanda club or the report was simply to also mention those women who had also been mentioned outside the report. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, it is true that there is consistency between the report concerning these two women and what is in this witness statement. The point put to you by the Prosecution is that you refer to the report in that connection, and in making that reference you are not making the point that you have some misgivings about that report in relation to other parts. You seem generally to indicate here that the report is all right, since you refer to it. 
That's the question put to you; do you have any comment on that? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes. I do. The fact that I mention the report is because the report exists. No one can delete it. It will continue to exist. But the reason there is no caveat here, it's not because those facts did not take place. There were witnesses who were -- who testified to the dispute regarding when the report was disclosed on 10th December '93. And these are my comments. But there are some true things in the report. It is -- what is challengeable is the overall manner in which this report is presented.

$RE-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, Counsel for the Prosecution a while ago asked you a question on the presence on page 14 of the French version -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you English interpreter kindly speak into the mike, so we hear you a bit more clearly, please? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Very well, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Sorry about the interruption. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you want me to go over, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, we got it. But just continue from where you left it please. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, Counsel for the Prosecution mentioned page 14 of the French version of the report, and asked you a question about the presence among those who are being incriminated, mentioned Bizimungu, Côme. Witness, do you also remember in the same list there is the mention of Mr. Ntagerura André and Bagambiki, Emmanuel? 
@WITNESS MAJ: 
Yes, I can see that, because I have the list in front of me. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we didn't get the second part of Witness's answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, can you repeat your entire answer, please? We lost something maybe. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I said that the two persons who were acquitted by the ICTR, Mr. Ntagerura and Bagambiki, Emmanuel, were incriminated by -- in this report and acquitted by the ICTR. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I have concluded, Mr. President. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, my question concerns the report. Do you remember who collected information about Mr. Renzaho's activities at that time? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
It's definitely -- must have been one of our colleagues because we shared out the cellules, but the committee met to discuss the whole -- all the results of the investigations. But that is what is lacking in the report and that is why there is dispute over this report, even though we finally signed for reasons that I've already explained. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Do you recall how many people, and who in particular, were examined in this respect? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I do not know the people who were investigated in the report because the report was challenged right from the beginning when it came out. And there are other people who remain in Rwanda for 13 years who were not supported because of this report. Jean Paul Mbaraga, who is also in Kigali. So there are other persons. I do not have the whole lists. I've not seen the lists for several years. But if there were people who were tried on the basis of this report alone, that would have been serious. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Would it be fair to think that one of your colleagues distorted information in respect of Mr. Renzaho's activities during the events? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes, I can suspect that. I can suspect that. In a sense that some of our colleagues, who were members of the team in Kanyarwanda became important members of the government establishment. There is one who became vice speaker of the parliament, and one who is a currently a member of parliament. There's one who has sought refuge in Canada. He fled in 1998. He was chairman of this committee. After -- he fled in 1998 after being the presiding judge of the court of first instance of Kigali. And that leads me to the conclusion that they may have changed the report for political interest or to gain -- to secure a position within the government establishment. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You refer to one person called Jean Paul, who apparently was wrongly accused. Can you repeat his last name with spelling, please? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Paul Mbaraga. I think I say Jean Paul because normally people have the two names. But what is normally known and what is in the report is Paul Mbaraga. So it is Paul Mbaraga. Let me spell Mbaraga once again, M-B-A-R-A-G-A. He's a former journalist in Rwanda and Deutsche Welle, sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This report was submitted by the commission composed of seven members. That's true, isn't it? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
No. That is the point. The report was not presented by committee, because it was published, and was the sole responsibility of the chairman of the committee, that is, Mr. Jean Bosco Iyakaremye, whom I mentioned early on, who has also taken refuge in Canada since 1998. Otherwise we did not have the opportunity of inviting people to present their report because the report was not completed. That is why there is dispute over the report. It is signed. We signed after the report was published. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I am looking on page two of this report now, Mr. Witness. And there are seven signatures dating the report to the 10th of December 1994, and your signature is one of them. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes, yes. I do not dispute the fact that my signature is here, and I explained why we signed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that explanation has been noted. But do we then agree that there were seven members forming part of this exercise which led to this report? These were the persons entrusted with this task, is that so? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Yes, but members of the committee did not have the opportunity of drafting the report and presenting it at the end of the discussions. The report was presented by the chairman of the committee without mentioning it to the other members of the team. We were all surprised, saying on Radio Rwanda -- presenting it on Radio Rwanda on 10th December. That is why the discussion of the investigation stopped on the 10th December, and I've explained why. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you see this is an unusual situation, Mr. Witness, that someone signs a document of such an importance. So you need to bear with us when we have to ask you a few more questions about this. 
Now, when did the chairman make the statement on Radio Rwanda that led you into some kind of a 
fait accompli situation, where you felt that you had no choice but signing in order to avoid a rupture or lack of co-operation between these NGOs? When did you sign? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
If my memory serves me right, it was on the 10th December. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the statement was made on the same day as the date of the signature; is that so? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I do not have a clear recollection of that, but I believe that must have been the case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
At least according to page two, the signatures were entered on page two -- the signatures were entered on the 10th December. So shall we assume that now, then? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I will not be able to assert that it was signed on the 10th December. What is sure is that on that day, we decided to stop the report as of that date because it was published without being completed. I said we were discussing it. This document of 40 pages is not something that was ever presented to the committee for discussion. That is the problem of this report. And I agree with you, that it's an unusual practice, that you sign something that you don't believe in, and when something is disclosed before it is concluded. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You read this report on which date? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
When did we read the report? We never read the report because we did not have the opportunity to present it. The report was presented before the conclusion of our work, before we finished drafting it. So it was presented at the stage at which we were. So you find duplication in the report because we had not yet fine tuned the list. Particularly, since we did not meet to agree that the report was to come out on a certain date. 
So, we were all surprised. We were taken by surprise by its presentation on radio. And from that -- based on that we sign. We sign it so that CLADHO is not dissolved, so that nobody is victimized, because we have to recognise the fact that if you sign a document that you don't believe, there is a problem with that. The problem is that CLADHO might disintegrate, and also the physical constraint, because we were under a regime which probably instigated a premature presentation of the report. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please do not use so many words and please don't repeat your evidence. I'm just trying to solicit some additional information before we leave you. 
Now, the announcement was made on the radio on the 10th December and you signed that page two on the 10th of December; that we have established now, haven't we? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
The report was presented in the evening, and in that evening it was obvious that we did not need to sign it. I'm not able to say the date because this is something that happened 13 years ago. What is sure is that even before we signed this document, we dispute -- it was a long dispute among us, not just me. All of us insulted the chairman. If you find those people who were present, they will confirm the same thing. Now, regarding the date on which we signed, I'm not able to say because that was a long time ago. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much time elapsed until you saw this report or read it, the written version? Not what you heard on the radio, please. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
It was after its presentation and after we had fought among ourselves. And you need to witness that to see how everybody was angry with somebody who disclosed the work which had not been completed. And the signature which took place subsequent to the presentation. If I recollect rightly, we maintain that day because that was the date on which the chairman decided to present an uncompleted work. But I cannot tell you the number of days because that was a long time ago. Maybe with consulting with other members of the committee who were present, I might remember. But I was not expecting this kind of question, so I did not ask anyone. But if you so wish, I can always ask people and we can get clarifications because I was not alone. There were other witnesses as well. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the signature was only added, even if it was not on the 10th December, after you had acquainted yourself with the written version of the report. Is that the evidence? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
We did not read the document, because the document before being presented should have been read, and then there would have been a consensus on its content. So we sign it without having read it. So we stopped work on the 10th December. After the 10th of December we did not do anything about the report apart from the typing by the secretary who was in charge. So there was no discussion on this portion of the report. We did not conclude the fine-tuning of the lists. And, as I said, we were doing it at the cultural centre at Remera so we stopped everything at that stage. Those who distanced themselves, did so immediately as soon as they got the content the report. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We really want to finish this now. Please listen to the question. When did you first read this report? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I read this report long after I signed it. But, well -- on that very day I just went through and there were things that I saw, and I expressed that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So your discussion about the substance of this report took place then in light of what you heard on the radio, but not based on the substance of the report because you hadn't actually read it? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
This report was not submitted to any discussion when we signed it. We find ourselves before a 
fait accompli and we either sign or do not sign, and we prefer to sign. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And of these seven persons, how many reserved their position in relation to this report? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
To tell the truth we decided to -- without examining it, without reading, without discussing, if my memory serves me right, because we decided to sign without going into the content because we stopped discussion on the day it was presented. That was the day the committee stopped its work. 
If you wish, I can tell you that the day on which the chairman presented the report, that was the day of the crash of the report. So, you will understand that no -- people did not have the opportunity to discuss something that was dead, maybe dead. To say it died is just a way of speaking. That's the word I can use to describe it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know whether you are the only member of this group who take exception to this portion about Mr. Renzaho which was read out? Do you know the position of the other six? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
I don't know. I'm giving you my opinion. I don't know what the other members think. The fact is that we did not discuss the list or the content of this portion of the report, because here you have 40 pages of commentary which we assigned to somebody who never came back with a report for discussion. I don't know if there are other members who challenge the content or confirm the content. But I'm telling you, I'm giving you my opinion. Opinion is not just based on this report, but based on 13 years of work because I told you that I continued with my investigations. Even those who are wrongly accused, I'm still working on them because I just want to get to the truth. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Should I take it that when you were signing this document, you were not aware of the allegations brought against Mr. Renzaho? 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Maybe I did not explain myself correctly. When I signed it was not for someone or anyone else. We signed a document which was not discussed, for reasons which I have explained. So it was not for somebody who appeared in the report. I've given my opinion on Paul Mbaraga. And now I'm giving my opinion on Renhazo, Tharcisse. It's solely on these three cases that I've had to give my opinion in relation to this report which was presented before completion. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. This was the end of your testimony. Thank you for having contributed to the work of the Arusha Tribunal, and we wish you all the best. Thank you. 
@WITNESS MAJ:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will then say farewell to The Hague. Thank you to everyone who facilitated this video link. 
@MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Goodbye, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Goodbye. 
Now the exhibits, you probably want the commission report of 10th December together with the annexes in one exhibit number. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I think that would be easiest, although there is, of course, the English version of the report, as well, but the annexes are not translated. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't we simply note that the exhibit number contains, when it comes to the main part of the exhibit, two versions, English and French? But we can content ourselves with one exhibit number, which will then be, Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 112. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 112 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this exhibit number includes both the main report plus circled in number eight, nine, ten, 11, 12 
and 13. These were the document numbers referred to by the Prosecution. Anything else? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. We will then bring in Witness HIN. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I didn't want to interrupt Your Honour. At the commencement of this afternoon's session Prosecution has been served with a number of photographs that, as I understand it, the Defence wish to have this next witness tender. They include photographs of a number of sites, some of which we have photographs which we have tendered and for which I can verify, ones including CELA, 
Sainte Famille and Saint Paul. 
There are a number of other photographs which purport to be other locations, which I am not in a position to verify or to properly cross-examine this witness in relation to. So, whilst I have no objection, and I'm trying not to be overly difficult, but whilst I have no objection to photographs of matters, photos that I can see and recognise. I do have difficulty, and will be objecting, to the introduction of any other photographs. So I thought I should advise Your Honours of that now. 
$(Witness entered courtroom)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, what we will do is simply take this step by step. We note your introductory statement. And when, or if, reference is made to a photograph which causes a problem, you will draw our attention to it and then we'll see how to address the matter. 
Have the parties received any written communication from the witness concerning this judgment? 
$(Pages 45 to 56 by Melissa Hook) 
1530H
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have received two handwritten pages in Kinyarwanda, and then an officer of the witness protection unit has very kindly translated these pages into French, using a typewritten version. Has everyone received these documents? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honour. And I'm aware we are in open court, so I don't know whether these -- any discussions can go on in open court. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No. We have to exercise caution here. It's just to find out who's got what. And you haven't yet received anything on the Prosecution side. 
Defence have you received this? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Not yet. Nothing. We have not received anything, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's difficult to proceed without further copies. 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@UNIDENTIFIED WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will just pause for a moment while we are reading what you have kindly written during the time we were not together, and then we will come back to you in a moment. So just hold on for a minute or two. 
@UNIDENTIFIED WITNESS:
Very well. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In order to an ensure efficient communication with this witness, I think we have to move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 58 to 75] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning. Good morning. 
The Court is in session. I trust that everyone had a pleasant and peaceful recess and if not, at least, an efficient one. 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. MOSES:
$(French spoken) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness MAI in these proceedings. You will have to tell the truth. And the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness MAI in Kinyarwanda) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have a personal information sheet for this witness? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I would like to invite the registrar to come and collect it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We now have the declaration of -- and we have the declaration of Witness MAI, but what you wanted to distribute was the MAI, wasn't it, that is the one we are focusing on now? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President. I thought it was the same information data sheet, and several copies, but the other one must have slipped in. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you have your identification sheet in front of you bearing your pseudonym, MAI? 
@MR. MOSES:
I see my name on the sheet. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, make sure that everyone gets a copy. 
The information contained in that document is correct, isn't it, Mr. Witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, it is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then admit that as the first exhibit, which is -- 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 76. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 76 admitted, under seal)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence. 
Prosecution has a remark. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, it seems as though we're getting French, a very fine language, but I am not getting the English channel one. That's the first remark, if I could ask the technical people to -- 
I have a very brief issue regarding the scope of this witness' testimony that I would like to raise before we commence. I will only take one minute, and I mean one minute. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we do that, I have a practical thing to raise with Mr. Matemanga. 
Then to the second issue mentioned by Mr. Moses, I hope the technical booth is looking into this issue about the translation. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Forgive me, Mr. President, I don't know if the technical booth can hear us. The Kinyarwanda booth is working into French. Can you hear that technicians? They are working into French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us see how this develops. 
Then your second point, Mr. Moses. 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, thank you, sir. I am just wondering, rather than having the witness leave the courtroom, whether he could just remove his headset while I give my brief comments. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear that, Mr. Witness? If you could do that. Thank you very much. 
Please, go ahead.
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, it is simply to do with the second matter raised in a will-say letter that was filed on the 17th of August. The -- it raises two issues, additional matters that this witness is to testify about. It is only in respect of the second that I wish to comment, and that is that the Defence is wishing to lead evidence on threats to the witness in Rwanda and the reasons he left Rwanda. 
Now, it seems, from my submission, Your Honour, that that is clearly a witness protection matter. I have got no difficulty with my friends raising it with WVSS for an inquiry to take place, but it seems -- and the Prosecution's submission is that it has absolutely nothing to do with the matters which Your Honours have to determine in the course of this Trial and, on that basis, I would object to it being led. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's noted for the time being. 
Defence, you have heard this remark and, at some stage, you will reach the part of the testimony where this may come up and then you can maybe comment upon it. Shall we start? 
Could you put on your headset again, Mr. Witness. Thank you very much. 
Let us proceed. Mr. Witness, you will now be asked questions by the Defence. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, before starting, I should like to pray that we go into closed session in view of the testimony of this witness, in view of the point already at issue between us. And as much as the question I wish to begin with might lead to revealing his identity, could we please go into closed session to begin with. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can -- the estimated duration of the closed session would be, in your view, just so that those in the public gallery will know? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I did not hear the answer, but I think I understood that you are asking me the expected duration of the closed session. I thought I had said that it would be for the entire examination in-chief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You said it in French, I can see. 
Any comments, Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour. I will leave it in Your Honours' hands. 
Your Honour, if I can assist. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES:
This witness is with -- not putting a too finer point on it, related to the Accused's family. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But many people may have information and the reason for such information may not be a family link. 
So I'm asking you, Mr. Nekuie, do you really think that you need to close the entire session? We will start in closed session, but having looked through this summary, it would arguably be possible to solve this in a practical way. Why don't you reflect on it and we will then start with a closed session. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
$(French spoken)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, it is, perhaps, towards the end of the examination in-chief that you might consider going into open session -- the end of the examination in-chief, but most of what I have prepared necessarily exposes the witness, through his answers, necessarily to revealing his identity which is why I have requested closed session for the entirety. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but now you have responded that it might be a possibility with an open part towards the end and that seems advisable. Remains my question: If we adopt that model, for how long will you then require a closed session, it being understood that most of the testimony will be in closed session? Can you give an estimate now? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Perhaps a rough estimate, one and a half to two hours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. Then that is known to everyone. 
And we are moving into closed session.

Thank you.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, can I just summarise the contact that you told the Trial Chamber that you had with the Accused during the period of April the 6th 1994 until July 1994? Do I understand your evidence that you saw the Accused for perhaps two to three minutes, a little bit longer, on the morning of 7 April? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
That is true. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, then, the next time you saw him was on the 9th of April at his office? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you tell the Trial Chamber approximately how long you saw the Accused for on that date? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
We arrived at his office and we remained there for less than 30 minutes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Right. Did you see the Accused again from the time that -- before you left Kigali to go to Gitarama? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
No, I did not see him again. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you see the Accused at all from the date of the 9th of April until July -- mid-July 1994? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
No, I did not see him again. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So your entire contact with the Accused during the period of April 7 to mid-July was two meetings, one of a few minutes and the other less than half an hour, or around half an hour. Is that right? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, that is true. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you have talked about the place where you were working. Can you please tell us how many days a week did you work? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
I would work every day of the week, and on Sundays I would rest for a while, but I would still work on Sundays. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what hours would the business that you were working at be open? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
I would open the shop between 6:30 and 7:00 in the morning. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What time would it close? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
I would sometimes close at 9 or 10 p.m. There was no fixed time for closing. It depended on customers. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So it was perhaps 14-15 hours a day, seven days a week? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, you are correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, looking at your personal information sheet, we note that you are married, and certainly at the moment have a large number of children. How many children did you have in April 1994 -- perhaps 1990 to 1994? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
I had eight children. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And am I correct that your wife and those eight children were living in a different town? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, they lived in the rural areas. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How often would you go and visit your wife and eight children? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
I would go and visit them every month and I would remain there for one week. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And was that the situation throughout 1993 and up to the date of the 6th of April? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes. I do not believe I understood your question. Could you please repeat your question, Counsel for the Prosecution?
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you spend one week every month with your wife and family, and did that process, did that continue throughout 1993 into 1994 up until April 1994? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
No, subsequently, I would not be able to remain in my residence for a long stretch of time because I was busier. Sometimes I would stay for two or three days, and I would go back because I was busier than I used to be. But I would still go and visit my wife and my children. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did your employer work at the shop as well? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
No, my employer did not work in the shop. Sometimes my employer would pass by the shop, I would say on a daily basis, but my employer did not work there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you know what your employer was doing during the day? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
My employer would stay at home. My employer would only go out to do some shopping in town, otherwise he did not have any other occupation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How many people were employed at the -- where you were working? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
I was alone, but there was also someone who would clean up the shop. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And -- 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Thank you to you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And was it a particularly profitable business, or was it just a small-scale one? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Any business is profitable. We had profits. They were not that high, but we still had profits. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, on the morning of the 7th of April, am I correct in understanding that you were present with other people when there were some killings going on in your neighbourhood? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, we were hiding and we could hear gunshots, and it is true that some people died. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did the shooting continue for, sporadically, most of that morning? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, the shooting continued during part of the morning, and when they came to fetch me to take me back home, we could still hear the gunshots. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you assist us in advising approximately what time, if you remember, the shooting commenced, and the time that it finished, if it did finish? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
The shooting started between ten and eleven. The shooting did not subside because there was more intense shooting on the side of Ntera, and at a given point in time we even heard shelling. So the gunshots did not cease, because the war continued. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree with me that that morning it was soldiers from the paracommando battalion at Kanombe who were out in your neighbourhood who were killing people? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, indeed; the soldiers were those who were killing the people. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, in fact, they were out in the neighbourhood targeting those who were -- or they perceived as being Tutsi? That is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, that is correct. They were killing the Tutsis, and the Tutsis were the ones who were dying. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Witness, what makes you think that those soldiers belonged to paracommando battalion? 
@MR. MOSES:
I did not refer to the paracommando battalion. I simply noted that they were soldiers. I did not know where they came from, but I was able to note that they were indeed soldiers. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Am I correct in believing that the soldiers came from the Kanombe camp? 
@MR. MOSES:
I did not recognise any of the soldiers. I merely noted that they were soldiers. I do not know which camp they were coming from. I noted that they were soldiers, but I did not know from which camp they came. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
The soldiers that you saw, did they carry any arms? 
@MR. MOSES:
The soldiers I saw were armed, they had firearms. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
How many soldiers did you see? 
@MR. MOSES:
I would be hard pressed to give you a precise number. There were soldiers everywhere in the streets, and they were heading towards different directions. I cannot tell you with certainty how many soldiers were in the neighbourhood. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Following up from the last question and answer that you gave, without giving us a precise number, would you agree that there were a large number of soldiers that you saw on the streets? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
No. From where I was standing I was able to see on the road between ten and 12 soldiers who were passing by. They were not all together. Sometimes you would have two or three soldiers walking together, but I would say that there were ten or so soldiers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
For the record, Mr. Witness, there are two points: The first is that the Prosecution asked you whether you agreed that there were paracommando soldiers, and you said yes to that. Now this word "paracommando" was mentioned, both in the English and the French version of the question. 
@MR. MOSES:
I did not hear that part about the paracommando in the question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. That's noted. 
Then the second point of clarification. You now said that there were ten to 12 soldiers. But in a previous answer you said "there were soldiers everywhere", which would seem to imply a larger number. Do you have any comment on that? 
@MR. MOSES:
I am referring to the soldiers I could see on the road, but there were soldiers on the road and there were others who were in people's houses. So I am referring to those I could see on the road, but there were other soldiers throughout the neighbourhood in the houses. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And how do you know that? 
@MR. MOSES:
I know that because people were killed in their houses. For example, the family members of the people I was hiding with, their family members were killed in their houses and not on the street, and that is why I am saying that there were also soldiers in the houses. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
When the Accused left where he had seen you on the morning of the 7th of April, do you know where he went? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
He went on foot to the camp. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And when you say the "camp", are we talking about Camp Kanombe, the military camp? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, I am referring to the Kanombe military camp. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And it may be that you have indirectly, at least, answered this question, but do you agree with me when I -- with a proposition, namely, that between April the 6th and July, Tutsis were targeted by reason of their ethnicity and killed? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, that is the truth. They were killed because of their ethnicity. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you, you personally accept that there was a genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda from April to July 1994? Is that your personal belief? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
I have not understood what precise period you are referring to, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Between April the 6th and the middle of July 1994, do you agree with me that there was a genocide of the Tutsi ethnic group in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes. Throughout that period the Tutsis were killed, but there were also Hutus who died. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. When you travelled from Kanombe into Kigali on the 9th of April, what route did you take? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
We passed in front of the airport through Rebero, and once we reached Remera we passed through Kicukiro, Gikondo, next to Sainte Famille, and that is how we reached the PVK. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I think all the names are known to us. 
And how long did it take you to travel that distance?
@WITNESS MAI: 
It took us around 30 minutes to cover that distance. We did not stop; we left and went straight to the PVK. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you come across or see any roadblocks during the course of that journey? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, we saw a roadblock in Remera. There were -- there was wood on the road, but there were no soldiers manning that roadblock. This is to tell you that nobody stopped us on our way. We continued until we reached our final destination. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you see any bodies on the road? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
No, I did not see any body -- any dead body on the road. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, you have told us that you eventually made your way to Hotel Kiyovu, and I believe you said that you left that place on the 12th and that you remember it well. That's what you said in the course of your evidence in-chief, isn't it? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, indeed, I recall making such a statement. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you gave a statement to the Defence in April of this year, did you tell them that you had stayed there for a week? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
I do not know when I gave that statement. I was fleeing; I was not at peace, so I could have been mistaken. What I am telling you today is that we remained there for three days. As for the written statement, it was given at a time when I was fleeing and I had no peace of mind at all. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you agree with me that you did tell the Defence that you'd -- "were taken to Kiyovu hotel where we stayed for a week", but that that was not correct because you were of a state of mind which made it difficult to remember the exact date? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
Yes, it was because of the stage of mind I was in that I was not able to remember exactly how many days we remained there. So I am stating that we remained there for three days. I do not believe we remained there for a whole week. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not wish to raise an objection, but if counsel for the Prosecution could refresh our memories by reading out the part of the statement where it is said that the witness stayed in the Kiyovu hotel, for one. This would be greatly appreciated. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I have no difficulty, Your Honours. It's in the sixth paragraph in the French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
"Where we remained for one week." 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am much obliged, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And no one has assisted you to refresh your memory on the date that you left the hotel since making this statement? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
No, nobody refreshed my memory. 
$(Pages 23 to 28 by Judith Baverstock)
1200H
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Witness, you also told us that on the trip from Kigali to Gitarama, that you were stopped at a roadblock, and you said that one of the persons at the roadblock had said to you that Renzaho was an accomplice of -- or an accomplice. That's what you --
@WITNESS MAI: 
That is correct. That was my testimony. And that was, indeed, what occurred. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's just, Witness, that -- you'll agree with me that's not something you ever mentioned to the Defence at all prior to today, is it? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
It is true that I had not referred to that previously. I gave my statement to the Defence team while I was fleeing. I was not in a good state of mind when I was making that statement. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And would it surprise you, Witness, that we have heard from three Defence witnesses about this incident, and none of them have referred to any of those persons at that roadblock calling Renzaho an accomplice? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
That would come as a surprise. I do recall having heard such a statement. That person said that we were carrying Tutsis, and said that Renzaho was an accomplice, and that his car was transporting Tutsis. That is what I heard. I do not know whether the others did not hear it, but that person did make that statement. That person was saying that the vehicle was carrying Tutsis in order to help them flee. I did hear that statement. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Witness, I'm suggesting to you that's just an example of something you are, in fact, making up today in order to assist -- try and assist the Accused, isn't that the situation? 
@WITNESS MAI: 
That is not true. What I'm referring to did, indeed, take place. That person said that Renzaho's car was driving Tutsis, and that as a consequence Renzaho was an accomplice; and that besides, his wife was a Tutsi. And that was the time when they drank the beer we were carrying, and that they smashed the bottles. We left with crates that were virtually empty. So this is an incident that, indeed, occurred. I'm not inventing anything. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I'm probably now at the point, and I'm getting towards the very end of my cross-examination, where I have a number of questions that I believe would need to be put to him in closed session as the answers could lead to his identification. So I'm asking for a brief closed session. Perhaps ten minutes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ten minutes. So then we will ask those in the public gallery to leave us for ten minutes, and then you are welcome back again. We will move into closed session.

$(Page 29 by Vicki Eastvold)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we will now end your examination, and we will hear the questions to Witness MAI by the Judges. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, during your evidence-in-chief, you told the Chambers that there were two pickup vehicles parked in Renzaho's residence loaded with crates of -- empty crates, and that the refugees were standing behind them. Do you confirm this, that there were two pickup vehicles parked in Renzaho's residence? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, I do confirm that there were two pickups with empty crates in them, and I also wish to state that the backyard of the house was quite large, and that the refugees could, indeed, stay there. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
The next question: Is it true that your sister spent a lot of time in the shop even if she wasn't selling? Isn't it true that she spent more time in the shop than at her residence? 
@MR. MOSES:
My sister would come to the shop to see me, and she would stay for a while, but I was the one in charge of the business. She did not spend the whole day in the shop. She would pass by the shop, we would talk about the business, and then she would go home. We would not spend the whole day together. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) ... that your sister spent more time in the shop, and spent only two hours in the residence? Would you be surprised by that statement? 
@MR. MOSES:
Valens has his own interpretation of what occurred. What I can tell you is that she would come on a daily basis, but would only remain there for a while. She would not stay in the shop as if she were in charge of the shop. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
The last question: Since you went to your store at 6:30 a.m. and only came back at 9 p.m., will I be right to say that you didn't know what happened in the residence during the day since you were absent? You were not in a position to say who came in the house and who didn't, or what happened there? 
@MR. MOSES:
That is not correct. I stated that I would go back home for lunch, sometimes around noon or at one. So that was where I would go during the lunch break, and the house help were there. Whenever anything happened, they would tell me about it, and so would the children. Even my sister would tell me who could have come at the residence. So I did know what happened in Mr. Renzaho's residence. I would go there at lunch time, and go back there at night, so I was in a position to know what would occur there during the day. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
I thank you, also, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
At 12:34:04, there is a question and we will delete the words from "So you" until "that" -- it's only the introductory part of the question -- and place that under seal. 
Mr. Witness, generally you are not to inform anyone that you, or anyone else, have witnessed before this Chamber; that is protected information. Is that clear? 
@MR. MOSES:
I am well aware of that, Mr. President. I, also, have some concerns, lest people be informed I testified before this Trial Chamber, so I will keep this information for myself. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. We agree on the necessity to be careful. 
Now follow other questions. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Did I understand you correctly, Mr. Witness, that on the 7th of April 1994, in the morning, the Accused came to your place of work and used the telephone which was there? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, that was what happened, and that was indeed my testimony. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Was there a telephone in the Accused's house? 
@MR. MOSES:
There was a telephone in the Accused's residence, but it was not operating. I do not know for what reason, but it was not working. But it is true that there was a telephone there. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
And was your telephone operating? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, it was. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Should I take it that the Accused managed to get in touch with a person, or persons, he wanted to get in touch with? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you overhear that conversation, Mr. Witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
No. I gave him the telephone, and I went out. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know with whom Mr. Renzaho spoke during that conversation? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, I do not know. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said that you had to restrict the period of your visits to your family to two to three days monthly because you became more busy. Do you recall having said that? Yes or no? 
@MR. MOSES:
I do know that I made such a statement. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you tell us from when you started visiting two to three days, approximately? 
@MR. MOSES:
It was from 1992 onwards. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
From when in 1992? 
@MR. MOSES:
In early 1992. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So this rhythm of one week's visits with your family a month, which would imply approximately three weeks in your place of work, that was a rhythm which preceded early 1992? You did not leave for a week monthly from early 1992 until the 6th of April 1994. Is that what you are testifying? 
@MR. MOSES:
It is true that from that time onwards, I did not spend a whole week in my residence in the rural areas. I would only stay there for two, three days. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This incident on the way to Gitarama, were there any Tutsis in the car? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, there were Tutsis in the vehicle. There was one Rukerikibaye, his wife and his two children, and they were the Tutsis who were with us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you spell that name, please, Mr. Witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
R-U-K-E-R-I-K-I-B-A-Y-E. Rukerikibaye. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
At the roadblocks, did they find out that these persons were Tutsi? Did they check their ID cards? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, they did not check their identity cards at the roadblock. They simply looked at them, looked at their faces. Quite often when you have an identity card bearing another mentioned, but on the face of it they thought you looked like a Tutsi, they would stop you at the roadblocks. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But according to your testimony, the soldiers were right when they said that there were Tutsi in the car. That's true, isn't it? 
@MR. MOSES:
That was true. There were Tutsis in the vehicle. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Were the soldiers right when they said that Mrs. Renzaho was Tutsi? 
@MR. MOSES:
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will place that answer under seal. 
But do we agree, Mr. Witness, that what matters in Rwanda is the ethnicity of the father when it comes to establishing the ethnicity of a child? And don't get into personal circumstances now, but simply a general description of the situation. That was behind the question, the previous one. 
@MR. MOSES:
That is true, that the ethnicity of a child is determined by that of his father. But when a Hutu married a Tutsi, or when a Hutu woman was married to a Tutsi man, sometimes the children would look like Tutsis even if officially they were Hutus. I'm referring to the features of these children, and not referring to their official ethnicity. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The soldier that escorted the car, did you know his name, had you seen him before? 
@MR. MOSES:
I do not recall his name, but I do know that he was a soldier. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know from which military branch or company he came?
@MR. MOSES:
I do not know to which unit or to which military camp he belonged. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The police officers -- officer, had you seen him before? Did you know his name? 
@MR. MOSES:
I did not know the name of the policeman. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know which police force he belonged to? 
@MR. MOSES:
I have just remembered the name of the soldier. Can I give you this piece of information, Mr. President? Am I allowed to do so? I have just remembered the name of the soldier. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please do. 
@MR. MOSES:
It was Corporal Gaspard. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why would Mr. Renzaho seek the assistance of a soldier, Mr. Witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
It was because it was difficult to use this road in Muhima, there were many roadblocks. Every 15 metres there was a roadblock, so one needed the assistance of the soldier in order to be able to pass through the roadblocks. And I explained to you that there were Tutsis on board the vehicle. We could not have passed the roadblocks in Muhima with the Tutsis. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But he was a civil authority, and the soldier would normally fall under military command. 
@MR. MOSES:
Do you mean that that soldier should not have accompanied us, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just wondered whether you had any comment on that particular element which I have now drawn your attention to. 
@MR. MOSES:
Renzaho was also a soldier. Even though he was a civilian authority, he was also a member of the army. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, could you tell us in which way the soldier who accompanied you helped you in the difficult situation, say, at the roadblock? 
@MR. MOSES:
When people would stop us at the roadblocks, he would explain that it was Renzaho's family that was going to Gitarama to seek refuge. Even if those who were manning the roadblock were not entirely convinced, they would beg -- he would beg them, and they would let us go through. So that is how he was of assistance. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
You consider the role of the soldier as a very important one? 
@MR. MOSES:
It is true that he escorted us. And if it had not been the case, we would not have been able to pass through the roadblocks. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. We would like to thank you for having come the long way to testify before this Tribunal. We wish you a very safe journey home. Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone. Should you wish to meet with the Accused, the witness protection unit will arrange that at a convenient moment. 
Thank you very much. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$(Witness excused) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It seems that it takes some time before this witness is coming in. While we are waiting for that witness, there is, of course, a pending Defence motion for variation of the witness list in the sense that it is suggested by the Defence that one witness should be added and heard at the end of this session. 
$(Witness entered courtroom)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are several questions there. Two questions to the Defence to start with. Question one, you have not filed any reply to the Prosecution response. And question two, it seems that the Prosecution is saying that they do not have all the particulars available of that witness in order to carry out its investigations. 
Meanwhile, I see the witness has come in, but simply, do you have any brief reaction to those two questions before we start with the witness? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I think that our reply is nearly ready, and should probably be served on the Prosecution today. And the Prosecution, therefore, will be satisfied on this day -- today -- before close of business today. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the information missing, has that been conveyed to the Prosecution, leaving aside whether the time is sufficient, which is a different matter under the rules, but now only the practical approach, has now the Prosecution received what they say they need to carry out investigations? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Regarding this witness, apparently, we are facing difficulties, Mr. President, since we ourselves do not have all of the requisite information on that person. We discovered him in special circumstances. But as soon as we do get the particulars, we will no doubt serve them on the Prosecution. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you do not know his current occupation, his address in the country concerned, or the information concerning his wife, is that so? Or do you have something to give away? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
We only know, from what you indicated, where that potential witness is currently. He is in another country, the name of which I cannot provide since we are sitting in open session. We know in what 
city -- which city he is. And apart from that piece of information, we don't know anything else. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will stop with this for now. But please convey all you have in your possession to the Prosecution during the lunch break. 
And then we will not continue with this for the time being, but simply say, good morning, Mr. Witness. Please put your headset on. 
You are a protected witness, and will be referred to as Witness PAT in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Witness PAT in French) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you with your signature, isn't that so, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS PAT:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the information contained in that document is correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PAT:
The information given here is correct, but I should like to make a slight correction regarding the occupation. The line "occupation" is followed by the word ************** What I think we should -- I should like to suggest that that be struck out, because it is repeated on the next line. So where it appears opposite the word "occupation". 
And the second correction is I should like to add as regards the family status, I haven't put the number of children. I have three children. 
And that is all, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. That's noted. The first is the question of repetition, the second is a useful addition. We thank you. 
Mr. Witness, you will be examined after the lunch break. 
Defence, do you want to start in open or closed? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I think I will begin in closed session, and then to avoid inconveniencing the public I will then suggest that we go into open session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And Mr. Matemanga, this document will then be -- 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 77. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal. 
$(Exhibit No. D.77 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we will meet again, Mr. Witness, at 2:30 in order to hear your testimony. The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1203H to 1430H)

$(Pages 36 to 43 by Vicki Eastvold)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness PAT, we are now in open session, and your examination-in-chief continues. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you know Mr. Renzaho in April 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I knew Mr. Renzaho in April 1994, first as an officer of the Rwandan army, and since 1992 -- as from 1992 as the préfet of the city of Kigali. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So in that capacity as an officer of the Rwandan army, did you know whether Mr. Renzaho had any powers -- wielded any powers in the hierarchical structure of the army, of the Rwandan army? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No. The préfet, Mr. Renzaho, had no powers within the army headquarters. On the basis of the fact that he was the préfet of the city, he was neither in G1, G2, G3 or G4 in the army military command. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your question, Mr. Nekuie, was the following, wasn't it: Whether Mr. Renzaho had any powers in the army headquarters. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is the question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So now that's on record in the English version, also. Because that's an important distinction. 
Please, now, the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what should we, then, understand from your answer? Mr. Renzaho, in his capacity as an army officer, had no duties, no powers, in your opinion? No special duties? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, Mr. Renzaho had no special military duties, neither within the army headquarters, neither within the Kigali city command secteur. So he was a préfet accountable to the ministry of the interior; and by the same token, he was not within the -- the -- he was not subject to the army headquarters or the army commands that were under it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
In that capacity as a military officer and préfet of the city of Kigali, did he also have duties within the gendarmerie, staff of the FAR? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
My previous answer equally applies to the gendarmerie, because the gendarmerie and the army within the FAR are like two brothers, and Colonel Renzaho was out of these two staff commands.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I would like to request the registry to give you a document included in the list of Defence documents volume 2, document number 4. I will ask you to peruse that document, to look at one of its provisions, then I would ask you questions on it. So it is folder volume number 2 of the list of Defence documents, and it is document number 4.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is presidential order of 3rd January 1977; is that so? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, establishing the status of officers in the Rwandan armed forces.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you want to go to page -- or paragraph number -- 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I wish for the witness to refer to the third page of this document and more specifically to article 10 of this presidential decree. Article 10 on the third page, at the very beginning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got that, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS PAT:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I don't know whether it is necessary for me to read out article 10 or whether I should simply put the question to the witness while he is taking cognisance of this paragraph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you simply ask the question? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you have before you the provisions of article 10 of this text establishing the status of officers in the Rwandan armed forces. And I wish to put the following question to you: From what you can read, is Mr. Renzaho -- does Mr. Renzaho fall under the provisions of this text, under the article of 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Mr. Renzaho's case does fall under this article 10, in that he had been seconded to the 
ministry of the interior, which is a governmental department. So, apart from the general provisions, the last line does apply to Colonel Renzaho, who was put at the disposal of the ministry of the interior by the president of the republic. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for your answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The record is getting unclear. Now, this paragraph 10 starts with the words "The officer may be transferred". That is the article we are talking about, isn't it? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, and the witness seems to be alluding to the last paragraph of the said article. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see we have both in English and French, you saying the following. From what you can read, is 
Mr. Renzaho -- does he fall under the provisions of this text under the article of 1994? That's not comprehensible. Did you say that, and what did you mean? 
So, I think you have to lead us a bit more specifically through this text and maybe explain what you meant by that question. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
No, Mr. President, I believe there might have been a problem in the translation. I asked whether in his capacity as an officer in 1994, Mr. Renzaho fell under the provisions of article 10. That was the question I put to the witness, and that was what the witness was answering. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you mean that or when you ask that question, what do you mean, because article 10 covers the situation of transfer from the armed forces to another branch of the state? And your question is then whether Mr. Renzaho fell under -- into that situation. Is that so, Mr. Nekuie? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, that was my question, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, your answer, Mr. Witness. You said -- so apart from general provisions, the last line does apply to Colonel Renzaho, what did you mean by that? Please help us now more specifically by referring to the text. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, article 10 has four subparagraphs, and it is precisely the reverse of what I said or what was heard in that subparagraph 4 that does concern Mr. Renzaho. Mr. Renzaho was put at the disposal. He was not transferred, he was not seconded, he was not given any responsibilities. He was put at the disposal of the administration, which is the ministry of the interior. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. So, this was not the matter of (French spoken) ... the officer may be transferred, but it was an issue of (French spoken) ... with other words being placed by the president at the disposal of some other entity. Is that the point? 
@WITNESS PAT:
Yes, that was exactly the situation of Mr. Renzaho. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, so, as I understand it, that Mr. Renzaho was at the same time a military person and a civilian? 
@WITNESS PAT:
No, Your Honour. Mr. Renzaho remained a soldier with the rank of colonel. But as regards the duties he had within the ministry of the interior, he was accountable to the ministry of the interior, but it would only depend on the general staff regarding promotion matters and administrative matters. His file remained at the general staff headquarters, but he was a soldier who was put at the disposal of the ministry of the interior for a specific task. So he was not a civilian. He still had his file at the general staff of the army; received his salary from the ministry of the army and could be called upon to either join a military unit or a governmental body following any decision from the president of the republic.
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Okay. Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, so in order to clarify this point, when an officer is thus put at the disposal of the administration, is one to consider that that officer is still operational within the army? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I fail to understand the nuance regarding the operational status of the soldier, but he is active, he is not retired or has not been dismissed, he remains in the army. He is -- receives his salary from the army and can also be promoted within the army, and the proposals for advancement, which are the rights of every soldier, still remains as far as he is concerned and as a consequence, such a person would advance, would be given a higher rank as is customary within the army. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. In order for you to better understand my question what I wish to know, Witness, is whether such an officer could still be considered as being a commander of a military unit? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The officer is commander of a military unit, if there is such a unit. And in the case of Mr. Renzaho, and as regards the provision we are dealing with, there was no such military unit that was commanded by him. It is -- he was an officer if we look at the statutes, but officially was fulfilling other tasks than those of a soldier. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for your clarifications, Witness. And still as regards the status of Mr. Renzaho in 
April of 1994, could one deem that he had power over members of the Rwandan army and the gendarmerie? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, he -- rather, disciplinary powers are linked to the functions one has. And according to the rules of the Rwandan army, one had to be in the hierarchy of command and be the commander of a unit in order to be able to sanction soldiers. So, since Mr. Renzaho was not at the head of any unit, and to provide further clarifications, a unit includes at least one company which is integrated in a battalion, a brigade, even though there were no brigades in Rwanda or the commander of a sector. By sanction, the president of the republic could sanction soldiers as well as the general chief of staff or the 
minister of defence. So apart from that hierarchy, an officer could report on any soldier that would be transferred to a commander of a unit in order for adequate sanctions to be taken, but Mr. Renzaho could not, for example, tell a specific soldier that he would sanction him for one reason or another. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, you are speaking too fast. May I ask you to slow down? 
Next question, please. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Witness, I wish for this matter of disciplinary powers to be clear and for that reason, I will ask registry to provide to you Exhibit P. 11 from the Prosecution binder and to make your task easier.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Registry, I have a copy of this document which you can come and get and provide to the witness as to be able to make progress. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any question you can ask while this is being found, Mr. Nekuie, some kind of introductory -- 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I do not know whether this will make my examination-in-chief clearer, but if you so wish, I can perhaps read out the part which is of interest to me to the witness and then, subsequently, put a question to him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, P. 11 is a compilation of legislative provisions in Rwanda. Which page are you on, Mr. Nekuie? What is the K number? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I, unfortunately, do not have any K number on my document, Mr. President, but it is the document entitled "Discipline", dated 13th of December 1978, and it is a presidential decree, once again, establishing the discipline within the Rwandan armed forces.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and we have that, which paragraph? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I wish to refer to page 747 of the said document and more specifically to article 60 of the said text under chapter "Disciplinary Powers".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have that, Mr. Witness, article 60? Have you found it? 
@WITNESS PAT:
It was indicated to me right now, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let me rapidly read out the first paragraph of this text and then put a question to you. It states -- paragraph one of article 60 states as follows: "Any soldier has a right and the duty to take note of the mistakes made by his subordinates or the soldiers placed under him in the hierarchy and to request that he be sanctioned. Only some echelons or some ranks in the command can rule on such requests and can sanction the soldiers accordingly. This power is linked to the occupation and not to the rank. The ranks are as follows: President of the republic, the minister in charge of the armed forces, the general chief of staff, operational commanders and unit commanders." 
As regards this subparagraph of the article -- and my question, Witness, is as follows. Don't you believe that there is some ambiguity which is brought about by this text regarding the explanation you provided under disciplinary powers of Mr. Renzaho in his capacity as a member of the 
Rwandan armed forces in 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, I don't see any ambiguity, Counsel.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And why not, after having heard what I just read out to you? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, I do not wish to repeat my previous answer, but I did say that it was linked to the position. And since Mr. Renzaho is not amongst those positions that were mentioned, and I mentioned also the commanders of companies, a company being a unit in the Rwandan army because there were other independent companies and even the companies that were supervised could report on unruly soldiers. 
The other component is the duty of any soldier to report on an unruly soldier and this is what corresponds to the first line stating that any soldier has the right and the duty to take note of errors made and to report on such errors to the hierarchy. So Colonel Renzaho, in his capacity as an officer, could report on all the soldiers who were under him, but did not have any power to sanction them. He was to report either to the general chief of staff or to the commander of the battalion concerned because they were the ones who had such powers to sanction. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for the clarifications you have provided, Witness. Witness, I wish now to refer to the 
7th of April of 1994 specifically and put the following question to you. Do you recall the decisions that were made during the meeting held at the military -- senior military school on the 7th of April of 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, I do recall that the most important of those decisions was the setting up of a committee that was called crisis committee and which was aimed at assisting the politicians in the setting up of the transition structure. There was a vacancy and power since the president of the republic had just been assassinated and the politicians had to rapidly make sure that there was no constitutional vacuum. So I believe this was the most significant decision that was made during the course of that meeting. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Witness, while exercising caution when you will respond to this question, who were those who participated in this meeting of the 7th of April of 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Those who were asked to attend the meeting were the officers of the ministry of defence, the heads of departments at the ministry of defence, those heading departments at the general chief of staff in the army and the gendarmerie, the commanders of operational sectors, the commanders of units that did not come under the different operational sectors, as well as the commanders of the gendarmerie units. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Are we to understand that this was a meeting exclusively attending the officers of the Rwandan army that you just mentioned? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, and I would add that there were also officers of the gendarmerie, the ones I mentioned, as well as those from the ministry of defence. General Dallaire also participated in the meeting, and forgive me for this omission, there was also the commander of the military higher -- of the military academy, which is an institution which does not fall under neither the general staff of the army nor of the gendarmerie. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
You have just referred to General Dallaire, who was he, and what was his position at the time?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's clear to everyone in the courtroom. Let's hear the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what was the relationship between General Dallaire and the Rwandan army? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
General Dallaire had good relations with the Rwandan army. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What was the result of this relationship on the 6th of April of 1994 in Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Excuse me, when you mention General Dallaire, should I take that you mentioned the person of the general or the institution he represented? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am talking about the person and the institution.
@MR. NEKUIE:
And that is why, Mr. President, I wanted to clarify the question, that is, to know the relationship between Dallaire and the witness for the rest of the examination. 
@WITNESS PAT:
So with the leave of the President, I will come back to the previous question, that is, UNAMIR as an institution. So, I mentioned laconically that relations between the two were sound and I could go further and explain that. That he was specifically with respect to the army general staff and the UNAMIR command, and not to mention Dallaire -- the relationship in that respect was good and it was good, especially for Kigali. I mean here that that context had to do with the creation of an atmosphere of security in Kigali at the time when there was talk of the setting up of the transition institutions and for the security of the city of Kigali. 
The important paragraph had to do with the weapons safety area. He met with the army general staff often and so relations on that core were relatively good. And since the Rwandan army had transferred almost all the documents that UNAMIR wanted, and since it had also defined control mechanisms for the weapons control programme -- I will come back on this point presently. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, Witness, on 6th April 1994 and slightly before, who are those who were concerned? Who are those who were concerned with this weapons safety arrangement? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
First, there was the UN, which was the designer and prime mover of the project, then the 
Rwandan armed forces on the one hand and the Rwandan Patriotic Front on the other. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How many armies were established in Kigali on 6th April 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, if you are talking in terms of armies, there were three armies, if you like; the 
Rwandan armed forces, the Rwandan Patriotic Front and UNAMIR. I don't know whether that is what you meant when you asked the question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Perfectly, Witness, that is the answer I expected.
@MR. NEKUIE:
And for the next questions, I would like to request the registry to kindly hand over to the witness this miniature map that I believe had been disclosed to the Prosecution. And I would call on him to rapidly illustrate the questions that are put to him on that map.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, this map, is that an exhibit in this case? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Actually, it is the big map of Kigali, which is also in the Defence folder, but it would be difficult to work on the bigger version of the map that we tendered. So we thought it would be proper to miniaturise the map and then tender it later as an annex document of the Defence also.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want the witness to mark anything on this map in connection with his testimony? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That is correct, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, if that is the case, you may wish to ask him to move to the monitor maybe, so that we can see what he is doing. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
If that would be more practical to everybody, then fine, let him move to the projector. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But your problem is that you have minimised this and it may be difficult for the video camera to zoom in, isn't that the problem as well? Why don't you start? Let's see how it develops. Where do you want the witness to focus now? 
You have this in front of you, Mr. Witness. 
Where is the first question? It's coming now, isn't it? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, since he mentioned the RPF, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, I would like him to quickly point out to the Chamber where that army had set up quarters in the city of Kigali on 
6th April 1994, that is, before the events that began on 6th April 1994? That is just what I wanted him to point out on the map. But, at the same time, Mr. President, given that I will have to question the witness extensively on this map, I would like to suggest for the three questions that I am going to ask about this map, that I will put the questions to him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let's try to avoid too much ado. So the first question now is, please mark the RPF positions; isn't that so? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you doing that, Mr. Witness? Do you have a pen? 
@WITNESS PAT:
Yes, I am doing so, Mr. President. I am doing it, but I am doing it on my own copy of the map, I don't know how you are going to see it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will sort that out. Please, do your task first and then we will accomplish our task afterwards. 
Have you done it? 
@WITNESS PAT:
I am through, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, now we need to see this, Mr. Nekuie. Let me hear what is your next question. Is that also concerned with the marking on the map? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
That is right, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please ask the question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, could you also indicate on the map the FAR units that were found in the city of Kigali and the position of the army headquarters of the Rwandan army on 6th April 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, Counsel, I will do that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And it is important that the markings are now made in a way so that we can distinguish them afterwards, so that we do not mix these two different questions up. I am sure you are doing that. 
@WITNESS PAT:
I have understood. I am marking it in a different colour, Mr. President. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
If possible, Mr. President, maybe to gain time, the next question has to do with the position of UNAMIR. So I don't know if he can do that with a different colour. The witness can point out on the positions of UNAMIR in the city of Kigali.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And as mentioned previously, such exercises can well be done in connection with the preparation of the witness. I am sure no one would object to that. Isn't that so, Mr. Moses? Please note it, because then we don't need to use courtroom time for this. 
It is done? 
@WITNESS PAT:
Mr. President, actually, I had done that exercise since you spoke to me about preparing the questions he had to ask. So on this map I had prepared maps before, but I could not tell you before since he was asking me precise questions, but if you like, I could stand up and present the maps that I have already prepared depending on the questions he will ask me. I am sorry for saying this belatedly, but it would be better for me to do it that way. I could not tell him straight away because he was asking me precise questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Those maps you just referred to have the same size as the one you just annotated, is that so, or is it bigger? 
@WITNESS PAT:
They have the same size and the same scale and they are identical to the one you have before you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that doesn't make a difference in relation to the practical arrangements.
Mr. Nekuie, you are in charge here. Just make sure that we get through this in a practical way. The witness has, I understand, finished the three markings. Do you want now to have this shown to all of us in the courtroom so that we see what he has done, because the dimension is too small for the 
téléscripteur? Would you have any other questions when it comes to markings on the map? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I believe the witness has given an answer to a precise question, and I simply refrain from asking him to present the maps on which we work. But if the Chamber has no problem with that, I would rather propose that he present the map on which he has made markings, and on that basis, I will ask him the questions I have prepared. If he has them in the room behind, so maybe we could bring his little bag here and then he would remove the maps and we work on them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now see what we have done and let us now proceed. Can we see this document now? 
So, Mr. Matemanga, you will please show it to the Prosecution first and then the Bench and then the Defence. 
Mr. Witness, you have kindly tried to convey the positions of the three armies in 1994. We understand that RPF written with red ink means the RPF forces, that is where you had the cross and the square; isn't that so, the little box? It is clear, it seems. Is that so, and that's the only place, one location? Can you confirm that? 
@WITNESS PAT:
As far as the RPF is concerned, I do confirm it. It was the RPF battalion that was in the building. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then blue ink here probably means the Rwandan army at Jali, J-A-L-I, Muhima, Kacyiru, the staff at Nyarugenge, et cetera. That is the Rwandan army in blue, have we understood your map correctly? 
@WITNESS PAT:
Yes. For the Rwandan army, you had little squares or rectangles. And for the national gendarmerie, you have little circles. But I would really have wanted to give you what I had prepared because that could raise a bit of confusion, Mr. President, because I need to add the gendarmerie posts that were there, just in case he asks me the question. I have prepared a very nice map for the Court -- for the Chamber.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. But let us now first look at what you did. And then there is something in pink, is that the 
UN deployment, UNAMIR? 
@WITNESS PAT:
That is correct, Mr. President, at Amahoro national stadium near Remera.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
R-E-M-E-R-A.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
Now, Defence, here is the map, and if you would wish to follow up with the previously made map, that is fine with us, but now, at least, we have sorted this out. It is clear both on the map and for the record. 
Yes, Mr. Witness. 
@WITNESS PAT:
Well, amongst the Rwandan armed forces, I am sure I forgot the Huye battalion which was not 
Mt. Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted and you may wish to add it on the map when you get it back. 
All right. Now, we have achieved this. Do you want any supplementary information from the witness based on a previous map? Mr. Nekuie, was that what you indicated? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, I will ask him my questions, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, can you tell the Chamber the mission of UNAMIR units established in the city of Kigali on 6th of April 1994, their mission in the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, concerning the mission of UNAMIR in the city of Kigali, what I can say is that there was a command known as KIBAT essentially made up of the Belgian contingent, whose mission was to ensure security within the framework of the Kigali weapons security area, and also the general mission of UNAMIR as far as peace keeping was concerned to ensure that the accords were on course and generally to ensure that the accords were being applied. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did you also know as at 6th April 1994, the state of arms or armaments that the Rwandan Patriotic Front had in the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I cannot know the arms that they had. What they had was stated in the accords. They had about 
600 men, a battalion at the CND. As concerns their weapons or the organic weapons of that battalion, nothing was made public. But according to information that we received concerning the organic weapons that a battalion should have was agreed upon. Over the three months period that they spent in Kigali or more, it was certainly more than organic weapons because their staff command sent in weapons from their Mulindi headquarters. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
M-U-L-I-N-D-I, into the CND.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, the Bench and the parties do have quite a bit of general information about the situation in Kigali, thanks to several years of work here. What is it you want to place on record which is of direct relevance to the present case and which you need for your closing arguments? Can you help us with that, please? We just want to assist you so that you get, as soon as possible, to the points that are essential to the Defence case. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, well, general information is available admittedly, but the Defence would like to put forward elements for comparison within the context of this trial with regard to the specific charges that have been brought against Mr. Renzaho. And Mr. Renzaho has to answer the charge relating to arms among other charges and the Bench will realise from my question that I was moving towards that chapter of the indictment.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. And the next question is? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, as at 6th April 1994, did you know the state of armament of the Rwandan Armed Forces? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, I know. So, maybe we should come back to Kigali because that is what we are talking about. There were units in Kigali with some mentioned on the map. There were two organic battalions, that is, Huye and Cyangugu. I will spell that one: C-Y-A-N-G-U-G-U.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Such terms are very well-known. Just proceed.
Yes.
@WITNESS PAT:
I do apologise, Mr. President. So concerning the state of armament, each unit in Kigali -- each army unit in Kigali had its organic -- depending on the organic structure, its armament, support armament and what was really important here is the ammunition. So, there was a scarcity of ammunition. Since there were no supplies following the peace accords of July 1992, that was the main characteristic, or with respect to the arms and ammunition. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, on 6th April 1994 were there weapons stocks of the Rwandan army at the ministry of defence? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, Counsel, there were no weapon stocks of the Rwandan army in the ministry of defence. Since the Rwandan army had only one major unit at the logistic base, which is the sole major unit of the 
Rwandan army. Apart from that level of logistics, there were no other notably known at the ministry of defence. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you know, Witness, whether on 7th -- after 7th April 1994 the major weapon stocks were moved from the ministry of defence in Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That logistic unit known as the AR base remained over the -- under the oversight ministry of the army headquarters until June 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Following the marks that you made on the map, could the army headquarters set up such a structure within the premises of the ministry of defence? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, the army headquarters is not found within the ministry of defence and neither is the logistics base. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Would you know, Witness, if after 6th April 1994, weapon stocks also existed at the Kigali préfecture? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, just as I responded for the ministry of defence, the army headquarters never had any reserves, weapons or ammunition elsewhere other than the logistic base. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
On 7th of April of 1994, do you know whether weapons were distributed to civilians from the ministry of defence? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, I am not aware of that, but it would be absurd. I don't see how the ministry of defence would have acquired such weapons since it took sometime to get weapons from the logistics base to the ministry of defence. And as I just stated that there were no weapons stocked, unless there was any other way of supplying such weapons, the AR logistics base would first have a document signed before any potential client is supplied with weapons. Such a client could be, of course, the ministry of defence.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Amongst the missions entrusted to UNAMIR in Kigali town, you referred to security that was ensured by the KIBAT Belgian battalion. Was that the mission that was carried out by the -- by UNAMIR during the day of the 7th of April of 1994 in Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
On the 7th of April of 1994, there was so much confusion in Kigali that I cannot specifically refer to UNAMIR for that day. But the fact remains that there was a lot of gunfire throughout the day, and that at the end of the day the RPF went out of its barracks. So I cannot state that UNAMIR did do what it was supposed to do in terms of security in Kigali town. But, as I stated, confusion was reigning on the 7th of April, and UNAMIR certainly was not able to fulfil its duty since there were weapons that circulated, and there was a lot of gunfire in the town of Kigali on that day. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, could you be more explicit when you said that there was a lot of gunfire in Kigali on that day, and when you're stating that the soldiers came out of the barracks? Could you be more specific as to when all these events took place, Witness? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
During the morning of the 7th of April, anybody who was in Kigali in any neighbourhood could hear gunfire and also grenades blowing up, which is quite exceptional compared to any normal day in Kigali. As for the exit of the RPF from the CND, it happened around 3 p.m. where the RPF went out of the CND to attack the Kimihurura camp, as well as the neighbouring locations, that is to say, the Kacyiru neighbourhood on the side of the Méridien hotel and the King Faisal hospital. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, according to you, what was the reason for the RPF coming out of its barracks on the 7th of April of 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, I cannot read the minds of the RPF command. What is clear is that after the president was assassinated, one had to go to a different stage. Two hours subsequently we heard that there were RPF soldiers that were coming from the northern border towards Kabuye, and who were coming to join the soldiers at the CND. So, as for the reasons, well, I'm not aware of such reasons, but what I was able to note was that there was indeed an attack at 3 p.m., and that at the same time there were troops that had already covered more than 50 kilometres since the morning, which means that the attack was well prepared in order for it to have taken place on that day. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nekuie, when I asked you exactly the purpose of some of this general information, you kindly responded that it was necessary under the indictment. I now have the indictment in front of me. Now, which paragraphs are there that need this information? And I'm sure a lot could be stipulated among the parties as to the general situation in Kigali, maybe even in writing. What is the gist? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I unfortunately do not have a copy of the indictment before me in order to be able to check the information you are requesting from me. But I believe we are all well aware that Mr. Renzaho, in the indictment, as in the testimonies by Prosecution witnesses, as well as in the Prosecution brief, has been charged with distribution of arms, or at least there were allegations whereby he had weapons distributed from the ministry of defence, and as early as the 7th of April of 1994 in Kigali. And I deemed it fit for me to refer to these events -- purported events with the witness without them being leading questions put to him. I believe I put questions to the witness, on which he provided clarifications, as to the possibility for the ministry of defence of having arms -- or, weapons in stock and distributing them. Of course, the Trial Chamber, in its discretion, will rule on the matter. But that was the objective I was aiming at. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Counsel, the Chamber has a duty to help and lead the two counsels, the two sides. I think what is in the indictment is -- what you are trying to contradict here is that your client distributed arms. This witness has been useful in the sense that he's already stated that there was no arms in the préfecture under your client, and that he had nothing to do with the ministry of defence, and that the minister of defence had no arms in his possession. So all of this other evidence that you are leading now is not necessary. It is not helping your case in any way. You have already established what you wanted to establish. If you think it's necessary, you can go on. But I think the Chamber thinks that it is unnecessary evidence and it is a waste of the Court's time. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Since my objective is to enlighten the Chamber, and if this is the position of the Trial Chamber, I shall change my line of questioning and consider that the Trial Chamber is now well aware of the fact that my client could not have had arms in his possession during the events. If that is taken for granted, I can of course move to another line of questioning. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
No, it is not taken for granted. All the Chamber is saying, this is what the witness has already said through your questions. He answered that he had no arms in the préfecture, there were no arms in the ministry of defence. So that's all we are trying to tell you; that is what he has stated, and it's on record. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Your Honour, I shall do my best for the Trial Chamber not to believe that we are wasting its precious time, and I will perhaps move on to matters -- or questions which I hope will be useful in enlightening you. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Yes. Mr. Witness, may I ask you a question? 
Did you have the opportunity, after the 6th of April, to visit -- to make visits to the ministry of defence, the premises of this ministry? If yes, how many times did you visit this building? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I never had such an opportunity, Your Honour. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what was the impact of the gunshots that could be heard in Kigali and the exit of the RPF elements from the CND? What was the impact of these actions on the population within the city from that date in April of 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
With regard to the explosions we heard in the morning from 9 or 10 onwards, and which continued in the afternoon, such explosions took place in the neighbourhoods which means that there were probably victims unless those shots were simply fired in the air. But I don't think that was the case. It means that in the different neighbourhoods there were people who were dying and who were being killed. As for the fact that the RPF came out of its barracks, even though first of all the attack was aimed at the Kimihurura camp, subsequently the RPF attacked the Remera neighbourhood, as well as Kacyiru on the side of the King Faisal hospital. And in the late afternoon and throughout the night, the inhabitants who were in the area occupied by the RPF were killed. Apparently there were lists that had been drawn up and military or administrative authorities were targeted. 
But during the day, also, people who went out found themselves facing soldiers of the RPF and, on the basis of my experience and my knowledge, what was noted subsequently was that such people were either killed on the spot or grouped together in the stadium, that is to say in the camp of the United Nations mission, and were eliminated one by one, or subjected to very difficult conditions. So as regards the population, whether we're talking about the gunshots or the exit from the barracks or the beginning of the conflict in Kigali, the impact was disastrous for the population, and during the three subsequent months, and on the basis of results that were found subsequently. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you able to know who was attacking the population in Kigali outside of the area that was under RPF control at the time? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
First of all, that is to say on the 7th of April, in the morning, one could not believe that the activities were due to armed bandits as usual. One could feel that people were being killed by others. But the phone calls we were receiving at the general staff mentioned "armed groups" that would attack residences without specifying who were the armed bandits. So in the first day, one could not say who was killing whom. But subsequently it became clear that in some neighbourhoods there were armed groups that were Hutu and who were attacking the Tutsis, and in other neighbourhoods such as Gikondo, Gishushu on the side of CND, and also Nyamirambo, it was the reverse. There were people who were Tutsis and who were attacking Hutu residences. 
But, on the first day, one could hear gunshots. One could not talk about acts of -- perpetrated by bandits, and one could not know who was killing who. But subsequently it was clear that the Hutus were attacking the Tutsis, and that in some neighbourhoods there were also Tutsis who were attacking the Hutus. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, saying Tutsi attacking Hutu, you mean RPF soldiers? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
In a neighbourhood such as Gishushu -- I don't know whether you have it on the map. The word is there. It is right next to the mention of the RPF battalion. That -- for that location it was obviously soldiers from the RPF. But in other neighbourhoods such as the ones I mentioned, that is to say Gikondo and Nyamirambo, we learned subsequently that they were RPF soldiers but they were not wearing their military uniforms. So in the confusion that was reigning during that first day, it was indeed Tutsis attacking Hutus. But in Remera or Gishushu, the RPF soldiers were wearing their uniforms. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, did you say -- just say now that in the first day it was Tutsis attacking Hutus? Is that the answer you gave to my learned brother? That is on the 7th of April. Are you telling the Chamber that it was Hutus attacking Tutsis (sic)? Because that's what I heard. Isn't it the other way round, that it was the Hutus -- it was the Hutu soldiers killing the Tutsis in the early hours of April 7th, 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, Your Honour. Perhaps I should repeat my answer in order to enlighten you, because you mentioned the Hutus and the Tutsis twice, and perhaps I should repeat my answer. 
I stated that on the 7th of April, the gunshots that could be heard from 10 in the morning, and in the phone calls we received at the general staff, reference was made to "armed groups" attacking residences. We learned subsequently that some people or some of the groups were setting up roadblocks and were sorting out the people who were fleeing. Now, regarding who was attacking whom, as I stated, we could not have known at the time when we were receiving such phone calls, since reference was made to "armed groups". 
But subsequently we learned that the calls coming from Gishushu, next to the CND -- or, the attacks, were indeed by military -- soldiers of the RPF who were attacking the Hutu populations, whereas in other neighbourhoods, such as Muhima, we came to learn that the Hutus were attacking the Tutsis. In order to refer to the neighbourhoods where the Tutsis, identified as such, were attacking Hutus, I referred to Gishushu, I talked of Kivugiza in Nyamirambo; the word is written behind -- under "Nyamirambo" on the map. And in a neighbourhood such as Nyamirambo, there were cases of Hutus -- of Tutsis attacking the Hutus. 
So to come back to the question put to me by Your Honour, in Gishushu they were wearing the military uniform, they were Tutsis from the RPF; whereas in Kivugiza they were not wearing military uniforms. And this is why I'm not referring to soldiers, but rather to people who were Tutsis and who were attacking Hutus. Now, you referred to soldiers of the armed forces. I did not refer to any soldiers who might have been mentioned in the neighbourhoods I listed. I did not talk about any soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces or of the gendarmerie in my first answer. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes, so could you now answer the question? Did soldiers kill Tutsi civilians in the morning of the 7th of April 1994, or not, in Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
On the morning of the 7th of April I was not told that any soldiers had killed Tutsis in those neighbourhoods. But what I can say is that subsequently there were soldiers who were indeed involved in such killings, but for that day I would like to confirm that I did not get any information of that type, either at the level of the general staff or personally. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And later did you receive information to that effect, or you do not know that it happened? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Mr. President, subsequently we came to learn, and I personally came to learn, that there were indeed soldiers who would leave the barracks or leave the front line in order to go and perpetrate killings along with the groups I called "armed groups". I came to hear of it subsequently. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the answer to Judge Arrey's question is yes, but you simply learned of it later. That's the core, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this testimony is of a general nature in the sense that it provides useful background information about the situation in Kigali which may be of relevance at a later stage. This witness has written a declaration consisting of seven pages, and that declaration contains very few references to Mr. Renzaho. It's all about arms, weapons, et cetera. Now, there have been no initiatives in relation to Rule 92 bis from any party here, but leaving that formal question aside, would it be possible that at least part of this statement given to the Defence could form part of the record as an exhibit? And then there will be less need to get this as oral testimony, and the Prosecution would be able to cross-examine on the basis of this written statement, the Defence would be in the position to choose particular portions of this statement that it wants to pursue. But to repeat what this witness has already said in this statement would seem not to be necessary. 
Now, is this a procedure the parties would wish to consider? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, my position, as always, I'm happy for any procedure which is going to speed up the process which doesn't compromise the rights of either party. And I hear what Your Honour is saying. And I was just checking Rule 92 bis to ensure that, by agreeing to such a statement going in, it isn't any concession by the Prosecution that -- as to the truth of all the contents of it. And I don't believe that is the case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
My suggestion was not really to place this under the umbrella of 92 bis. The procedure envisaged could be that I would simply ask the witness whether what he has stated in his declaration to the Defence, his summary, is truthful, and then I will ask the Defence whether that is the kind of information the Defence wants to solicit from this witness. And if the answer to both questions are "yes", then we could simply say that this is what is on record in this case. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. Your Honour, my -- I'm just having a quick look through -- we only got this disclosed last week, and it hasn't been translated. So I'm going on my reading of the -- of the French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will see that there are references to Mr. Renzaho -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
In paragraph 10. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- in paragraph 5; and then in paragraph 9, at the end there; and in paragraph 10. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I mean, I'm happy for it to be -- to proceed in the manner Your Honour's suggested, as long as I'm entitled to cross-examine on it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will. 
Now, Mr. Nekuie, would that be suitable, also in relation to your interests, that we simply tender this declaration as an exhibit, if we receive the witness's confirmation that this is indeed his evidence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Mr. President, if the Trial Chamber so wishes, I don't see any problem with that. I do not want to put questions to the witness on the statements he made if the -- this is not convenient to the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We want the substance, Mr. Nekuie. It's not a matter of convenience. It's a matter of whether you can achieve the same with a more precise method, formulated in writing by the witness himself. It's to ensure efficient communication and get it down in a precise way. And you will certainly be able to pose additional questions if you so wish, based on that declaration. That's the suggestion. Would this be helpful? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, I would satisfy myself with questions that would clarify the Chamber, because the Chamber's (sic) role is to clarify the Chamber. We would not want a situation where the Chamber will mislead the -- where the Defence will mislead the Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you have very kindly prepared a statement, the 29th of July 2007, in order to assist the Defence to convey to the Prosecution and the Chamber the contents of your testimony. This declaration, do you confirm that that is indeed -- that this is indeed a truthful account, according to you, and this is your view, what you have written down here? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Mr. President, I don't have anything before me now. I know I signed a document dated 29 July, and I would like to know what document you have there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's coming. 
All right, what about this declaration, Mr. Witness? Is it okay? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, the document is for me, as far as the seven pages I have here are concerned. And I declare that it is truthful, as far as the content is concerned. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Having heard that, do you then, if I understood you correctly, agree, Mr. Nekuie, that you can tender this as an exhibit and then continue your examination-in-chief based on this document? Would that be suitable to you? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I accept, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you to both parties. 
Mr. Matemanga, that Defence exhibit will then be? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 78. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will have a look, I think it may well have to be under seal if there is anything about the witness's occupation.
Please proceed, Defence counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour. Perhaps we could also request for an official translation into English, just for the record. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. And the French version will be A, and the English version, once it is available, will be B, of this exhibit number. And because of the introduction in this document which identifies the witness, we will have to place it under seal. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 78A admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please proceed.

@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, on the basis of information you received, did you know if those armed gangs that were perpetrating the acts you described in the city of Kigali, that is the killings, had any relation or link with the préfecture of Kigali city? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
My answer is no -- rather, I don't know. I don't know if these armed gangs were -- had any links with the préfecture of Kigali. What is certain is that when the movement -- the movement started in the morning and involved persons who came from all the neighbourhoods in the city of Kigali. So it involved all the neighbourhoods. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you tell the Chamber whether the Rwandan army took measures to punish these persons, or not, at that time? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well first, that is on 7 and even 8 July (sic), the army's command limited itself to sending out the calls -- the distress calls that they received to the gendarmerie post that were well established in the neighbourhoods of Kigali. Later on, with the opening of hostilities in the afternoon of 7 April, all meetings of the general staff observed that massacres were going on and were actually intensifying, but each time members of the general staff meeting realised that they did not have enough means to check the situation. So when I mentioned the intervention of the gendarmerie the following day, all the calls were sent to the gendarmerie, which was supposed to take care of that problem, since hostilities had opened at the army headquarters at the sector command units. 
Unfortunately later on the fighting, or the war, became generalised and there was talk of insecurity at the political level -- and in the government that was set up later -- and the government also came to the same conclusion -- the head -- army headquarters also came to the same conclusion. But, as far as I know, no army units went out in the field to fight these armed gangs of killers. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What about the soldiers for whom it was established that they joined armed gangs to commit such acts? Were any measures taken against these persons? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, as far as disciplinary or criminal measures against the soldiers were concerned, the army headquarters as such did not take any measures for the simple reason that he has no troops for that. Only the various units were concerned. So they may have had deserting soldiers or persons who left units or combat battalions to go and swell the ranks of the cohort of killers. So, at the level of the army headquarters, no disciplinary procedure was conducted. 
So now at the level of units, certainly some started such procedures, but they did not carry them to their conclusion -- I'm talking about Kigali. And following the war situation that prevailed and the administrative situation, that you can well imagine.

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, could you be more specific when you mention administrative instability, because I find it hard to imagine what you mean, so could you be more specific on what you meant? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, at the general staff meetings that I mentioned the secteur and unit commanders were ordered to punish and check the criminals, especially those from the army, and to check civilians who were outlaws and who were actually carrying out the massacres and killing civilians. But the instability I mentioned, I actually spoke of Kigali because very quickly all the commands, that is the operational commands and the gendarmerie were overwhelmed, because in a few days it spread to the entire camp and with respect to military discipline, there is the military police which was cut off from the rest of the town and which was forced to wall itself in and protect itself. It is situated to the north of the map. 
So, administrative instability here would mean that if you start a disciplinary measure and you had to look for a soldier who has killed somebody and then prosecute him, bring him before -- you need a commander, and then compile a file, it would not have been possible in Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would it be possible to ask questions which makes it possible for the witness to answer briefly? 
Could you make an effort, Mr. Witness? 
Now, the next question. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Still concerning possible measures that could have been taken to punish these armed gangs, Witness, could you tell us whether any form of collaboration was envisaged or undertaken with the Kigali préfectoral authorities for that purpose, that is trying to check the killings that were going on in the town? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, let's say it was a reciprocal approach; that is, the préfet of the city at the first meeting of the army headquarters called for help. Well, he was informing the army headquarters that there were massacres, but the army headquarters, as far as I know, had never given him any response in terms of meeting his demands or satisfying his demands. There was also the gendarmerie, but as I said I believe the préfet referred to the gendarmerie also, which was under the army general staff. But as far as punishment and disciplinary measures were concerned, there were no tangible results and one of the courses conducted of things was that administratively within the military and within the state prosecutor's office, no effective procedure could actually be concluded or carried out. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. Now, we will move quickly to the second part of the events from 
April to July 1994, and specifically May 1994. Were there cases of desertion registered within the 
Huye battalion that was stationed in Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, of course, there were. There was a lot of desertion, and I believe the same thing happened in other battalions. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you know if those deserting soldiers from the other battalions and the Huye battalion placed themselves on the authority of the préfet of Kigali city? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, that would be frankly absurd, because to desert a unit to go and place oneself under the préfet or the préfecture would be absurd because I know that those people who took up clubs to kill civilians were civilian gangs and these people were not answerable to any authority. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you know if during the campaign conducted by the Huye battalion from May until about July, would you know if there were any civilian targets that were effected in the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, talking about civilian targets, that's where I started by mentioning kidnapping or torture of civilians on the part of the RPF. As was noticed and reported by persons who were fleeing, there were -- shots were firing that targeted war-displaced persons, for instance, on the 1st May I was at my first post and I actually saw the damage that was done. But there were also shots that targeted the market, the Kigali market, where a number of people were gathered. But one could suppose that the RPF site was doing it on purpose because they had well-targeted cannons. 
And so later on there was a raid on the Eglise Sainte Famille on 16 June and which targeted rescue operations for people who were on the government side around the Sainte Famille parish and around Saint Paul. So the RPF operation sought to save people, but they would use the occasion to kill other persons. 
So I may have cited Nyacyonga incident, but it is not within the period of your question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness, for that information. And I would like to dwell a bit on the raid you mentioned, the raid of 16th June 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You just referred to a location. You said: So I may have cited that particular incident, but it is not within the period or within your question. Could you just repeat the location you referred to? 
@WITNESS PAT:
Mr. President, it is Nyacyonga. N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A, Nyacyonga. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, we are in open session, so when you are giving your answers don't get too much into details. Now talking about that raid of 16 June 1994, I would like to know whether physically you were in a position to be fully informed of the occurrence of that event. You can answer a yes or no simply.
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when that raid was carried out on 16 June 1994, did you know if it was followed by any reaction on the part of soldiers of the Rwandan army? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The raid was not followed by any reprisal or any pursuit of the elements who carried out the raid on that day. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Again Witness, do you know if on the day after the raid the Rwandan army carried out a reprisal campaign following the raid? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The Rwandan army did not carry out any reprisal following the raid that was carried out on that date against the Sainte Famille and Saint Paul churches. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you know if officers of the Rwandan army went to the site of the raid on the day after the operation? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, I know that the secteur commander, whose name I'm going to cite, Colonel Ndahimana.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
N-D-A-H-I-M-A-N-A. 
@WITNESS PAT:
Lieutenant Mutabaruka.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
M-U-T-A-B-A-R-U-K-A.
@WITNESS PAT: 
Respectively secteur commander and commander of the unit in the area where the raid took place, visited the area in the morning. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, were you also able to know whether on the morning of 17 June 1994 Préfet Renzaho visited the area? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, I have no knowledge of that. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, at this time I would like us to talk about the issue of civil defence, and I'd like to ask you the following question: During all these events from April to July 1994, did the Rwandan army have the opportunity to set up a civil defence mechanism within the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, the Rwandan army could not set up such a mechanism according to -- following guidelines that I may have known. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you know at that time an officer of the Rwandan army known as Bivamvagara? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, I know him. He had retired as commander in the years that preceded the war, I believe, before 1990. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you know if that officer was in the city of Kigali during the events and what his missions were? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Commander Bivamvagara was in the city of Kigali around the end of May, within the context of the training of recruits who were supposed to enforce combat troops. So his mission in Kigali was decentralised training, as opposed to what we used to know -- that is, combined training of army recruits. So at the time the ministerial directives spoke of decentralised training. So that was why Commander Bivamvagara was in Kigali. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So Bivamvagara's tasks, as you describe it, were they not technically more related to the notion of civilian self-defence? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, his mission had nothing to do with the civil service defence mechanism. But as I said, that these followed guidelines. But this time around there was no civilian self-defence, but recruitment that was conducted in much of the haste at decentralised levels, so there were structures for that. Each préfecture had to provide young recruits to combat units and these recruits had to undergo crash training to reinforce the combat troops. So the civil self-defence could have no place in this kind of training. These were troops that received crash training, but they were soldiers, fighters who were trained for the army. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, do you know if Mr. Bivamvagara had any relation with the préfet of the city of Kigali at the time? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, the fact that he was in Kigali and was doing training, and that Préfet Renzaho was an administrative official in Kigali meant that they were in contact. But Commander Bivamvagara was answerable to the secteur commander of the city of Kigali, just like anybody who was in Gisenyi would be answerable to the commander of Gisenyi. So, if there was any kind of relationship, it would be more of collaboration, or rather marginal collaboration, inasmuch as Préfet Renzaho knew that Bivamvagara was there. And the recruits or candidates for combat came from the city of Kigali. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Within the framework of this marginal collaboration, Witness, and given the fact that Colonel Renzaho was a colonel in the Rwandan army, could Mr. Bivamvagara be deemed to be his subordinate? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No. The link between them could have been of co-ordination of the activities that were being carried out, but not of subordination. Commander Bivamvagara was answerable to the secteur and that was where he reported on the results of the training. And once the training was finalised he did not introduce the new fighters to the préfet but rather to the commander of the secteur. That was the procedure. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I see it is 5 p.m. I am almost at the end of my examination-in-chief, but I am in the 
Trial Chamber's hands if it deems that we are to stop at this stage. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What does "almost" mean? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, I don't think I will have more than 20 minutes with the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. If that is the significance of "almost", we will continue tomorrow morning. Do you want to tender this exhibit, this map, so that we have this in the transcript of today in order to avoid any kind of confusion with the witness's annotations?

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, yesterday we talked about the civilian self-defence and we adjourned by mentioning the presence of Major Bivamvagara in Kigali city. Do you recall that? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, I do recall. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, with the leave of the Chamber, I would like to request the registrar to give you Exhibit P. 24 and P. 25 that are in the folder of the Prosecution -- in the Prosecution's folder. 
Witness, do you have those documents before you? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Witness. Exhibit P. 24 is a letter from the Rwandan army chief of staff, 30 March 1994, to the minister for defence, and P. 25 is a letter from the préfet of the city of Kigali to the chief of staff of the Rwandan army, and it is dated 31 March 1994. I would like to read out just the first two paragraphs of the army chief of staff's letter, then the first paragraph of the préfet's letter, then I will ask you a number of questions after that. Do you agree with that procedure? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well. The first letter, that of the army chief of staff, this is what is written: 
"Mr. Minister, I have the honour to forward to you the resolutions of the meeting I chaired on 29 March 1994 at the army headquarters of the Rwandan army and to which meeting the following persons were invited, the préfet of the Kigali city and the operations sector commander. The objective of meeting was to fine-tune the civilian defence plan, whose structure is coordinated by soldiers that are housed within the camp."
That is the end of that paragraph. 
Now, the letter of the préfet to the army chief of staff written on 31 March 1994 states as follows: 
"Mr. Army chief of staff, as part of popular defence, I have the honour to forward to you the list of persons, reserve officers and others chosen by the cellule for civil defence." 
Now, Witness, here is my question: Don't you think that the presence of Mr. Bivamvagara in the -- in Kigali during the events of April to July 1995 -- 1994 constitutes an implementation of this plan on which the army chief of staff and the préfet of Kigali prepared? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's leading. Please reformulate. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I will rephrase my question, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what is your interpretation of the two quotations I have read out to you? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The meeting of 29 March 1994 that was held on the initiative of the army chief of staff and to which he convened the préfet and the sector commander came as a result of an appraisal of the general security situation and the situation of hostility in the city of Kigali, a situation where the information and the position of the army headquarters led to the conclusion that there was a risk of the resumption of hostilities. Whereas the army headquarters realised that ever since the Peace Accords were signed it had done nothing to prepare for war since the country was following a strategy of peace. Conversely, it realised that the RPF had never stopped preparing for the war. So that was our appraisal of the enemy situation. So the civil self-defence mentioned in the letter came to fill a gap without which the Rwandan armed forces would be taken unawares in case of -- peace negotiations. So the army general staff thought that if there were a resumption of hostilities, with the RPF having a reinforced battalion in Kigali and having a number of infiltrated persons in Kigali and throughout the country, the RPF then could launch an offensive, notably by occupying sensitive areas in Kigali, crossroads and other areas. 
So, it was thought that by using a scenario that had been tested elsewhere, they could set up cellules or units that could at least alert the FAR in the event that such an attempt, as I described above, could be undertaken. So they were going to use soldiers as the core of that structure because soldiers had been authorised to stay in the neighbourhoods. So these soldiers were supposed to form the core of the structures, and then other persons appointed by the préfecture -- well, persons who knew how to handle weapons and who had undergone training, notably military reservists, and persons recruited on the basis of discipline, to set up early warning units in the neighbourhoods. This had been tested in Mutara, Gisenyi, in 1992 and 1993. And so the army chief of staff considered this organisation some kind of a check, an early warning system. So that was the objective of the meeting, and the measure that was taken. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for the clarifications. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Witness, may I ask you a question? We use here two terms, "civil defence" and "civil self-defence". Do you see any difference, or these are the same terms? 
@WITNESS PAT:
The proper term is "civil self-defence" and that is the term used by the army chief of staff and the préfet's letter also uses that term, "civil defence". But that is not the term that was used in the earlier correspondence. And since these correspondences are complementary, I believe the use of the term eventually became the same, although the writing was not the same. But the préfet of Kigali would have used the word "civil self-defence" and that is the term I will continue to use. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
The term "civil self-defence" is correct, but not civil defence, yeah? 
@WITNESS PAT:
That is correct, Your Honour. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Just a question, Witness. From my recollection of your evidence in-chief yesterday, you stated categorically that the Rwandan army did not set up a civil defence mechanism from April to July 1994. But the long explanation you have given, are you now changing, because I don't understand? That's what you said yesterday, that there was no civil defence mechanism set up from April to July 1994, in answer to a question put to you by Defence counsel. Are you now changing, on the basis of what you were just asked on these two documents, are you changing your opinion? 
@WITNESS PAT:
I am not changing my opinion, Your Honour. The self-defence scenario that has just been described and that appears in the two letters was not set up; there was no time to set them up. And we are talking here about the 31st of March, when the préfet wrote the letter. And I realise that the army chief of staff put his signature on that letter, but three days later he died and hostilities resumed. 
To implement such a scenario, a lot more days were needed than the two days that followed. And I am sure that the préfet's letter did not receive any response, because it was supposed to be implemented by the operations sector commander to whom the letter was copied, because if you look on the letter, it is written "Copied to the operations sector for Kigali". And, here, the copy went, but the operations sector commander could not implement that mechanism. So over the next three months this scenario was not implemented. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So what link can we establish between this scenario and Mr. Bivamvagara's mission on the ground? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
This mechanism has nothing to do with the mission of Mr. -- Commandant Bivamvagara, who came to Kigali within the context and ministerial instruction to train recruits for fighting troops. So he came to recruit and train fighters for the army; he was not coming to organise the population to defend itself. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you speak of the ministerial instruction, which one are you referring to, Witness? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Actually, it's a ministerial instruction that was signed in the month of May, but I cannot be precise on the date. But the truth is that when it was observed that the troops were wearing themselves out after a month of fighting, there was the idea of recruiting to complement the troops and that was done precisely by recruitment. 
But it was a bit unusual from the normal recruitment because there was decentralisation of recruitment and, above all, the centralisation of training, because normally training is done in a camp under the authority of a director, commander of training. But, here, the préfectures were going to organise training. So Commander Bivamvagara was somebody who was working within the Kigali city sector command, Ruhengeri or Gisenyi. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for your explanations, Witness. 
Witness, I would like us to talk about one last point of clarification with you in this examination, and then we will move again to the period when you occupied your duties that were different from the second part of the events. Would you understand what I am talking about? I would like us to talk about the period of 6th April 1994. Do you understand me? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I understand you, Counsel. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Perfect. Witness, I would like to ask you the following question: In the situation in which you found yourself, was it necessary for you to physically move to the premises of the minister of defence to know whether arms or weapons were stocked there and were being distributed? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I will say yes to know what was happening physically. But I will move further and say that in the normal channels of weapons' distribution my position enabled me to know what was happening at the ministry of defence. Since there are a number of documents that have to be filled and signed, there is an armament statement -- well, the armament situation from a major logistic base was known to me, because it was presented at all meetings of the general staff -- or, at the meeting of the 7th. 
But to have a clear idea of the situation, I had to go there or receive a message that mentioned such distribution. I did not go to the ministry of defence. But I didn't have any messages related to the distribution or non-distribution of weapons. So I am saying that there was no such message at the logistic base. There was no weapons stock to be given to a third party other than the army at a time when the army clearly lacked such weapons. So I don't think there was any distribution. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for all your answers, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is where I end my examination-in-chief of the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Mr. Witness, you will soon be cross-examined, but just a question of clarification. 
Yesterday you were asked what the reasons were for the RPF coming out of its barracks on the 7th of April, and you said you couldn't read the minds of the RPF command, and you said that two hours after the assassination you heard that there were RPF soldiers coming from the northern border towards -- and then you mentioned a location. Can you repeat that location, please? It sounded either like Kibuye or Kabuye. Was it Kibuye? 
@WITNESS PAT:
It's actually Kabuye, K-A-B-U-Y-E. 
And, please, Your Honour, it was two hours after the RPF came out of its quarters, that is, if it came out at 3 p.m., then it was reported at 5 p.m. in Kabuye. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I am wondering if I can just distribute a couple of documents which I may use in the course of cross-examination. 
While that's being done, perhaps I can commence.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, in the position that you held prior to the beginning of May 1994, were you made aware of the deployment of troops in and around Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I am sorry, I don't understand. The deployment of what troops? RPF you mean? 
@MR. MOSES: 
@WITNESS FAR: 
@WITNESS PAT: 
As of 6th or 7th April the FAR troops were in their barracks. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, I want you to -- after that date, up until the date on which you took up a new position, were you aware of, in general terms, the deployment of FAR troops in and around Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct, Counsel. I was aware. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is it correct that in the middle of April the RPF had been shelling an area in Bicumbi, B-I-C-U-M-B-I, commune in Kigali-Rural, called Gahengeri, G-A-H-E-N-G-E-R-I? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Yes, the RPF troops, moving from Kagitumba -- I believe you have the spelling. Kagitumba is the northern tip of Rwanda. It moved across the park and came to Rwamagana -- you have the spelling of that. And these are the troops which in mid-April threatened Bicumbi. 
@MR. MOSES:
I don't know that we do have. We do. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And did the military headquarters in Kigali send a Kigali unit to assist in that area sometime between the 15th and 20th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I am certain that the army headquarters did not send any assistance to that area, which was under the Mutara operations sector commander, M-U-T-A-R-A. And from Kigali the army headquarters was overwhelmed, so there was no reinforcements that went to the east or the north between the 15th and 30th of April. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, during the period that you held your first position up until the beginning of May 1994, did you ever meet with the Accused? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And, of course, Mr. Witness, the reason why the question was formulated this way is because we are in open session. Please remember that when you answer the question. And, now, the answer? 
@WITNESS PAT:
I saw the Accused more than once. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And can you tell the Trial Chamber where and when you saw the Accused? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
At the army headquarters, and especially in the early days as from 7 April. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When you say "more than once" was the Accused attending daily meetings of senior military officers at army headquarters? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No. In all these cases, he did not attend the meetings. He stopped by, probably to share a piece of information or to be informed, but not for the meetings -- to share information on security and the humanitarian tragedy that was unfolding in the city. I recall that he was looking to ask for a military intervention. I believe I mentioned that yesterday. He came to inform -- or discuss with the army general staff the possibility of cleaning up the city because there were too many corpses on the streets. And, at that time, he informed that, together with the Red Cross, they were going to undertake that operation. And he also came to discuss Nyacyonga, with refugees -- from nine to ten, where refugees were expected to arrive. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you first of all spell Nyacyonga for us?
@WITNESS PAT: 
All right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, without -- and I am sorry to interrupt you -- I am really wanting to know, briefly, if you can tell me, how many occasions did the Accused come to army headquarters? Can you remember, other than "More than once"? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The "more than once" represents all what I have just said I mean on those four occasions. But it was informal. He did not go for an audience; he came to seek information on operations. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And after you took up your new position in May, did you see the Accused again from that point in time until you left Kigali? And, once again, without -- I don't need descriptions of what took place between you two, but at this stage I am just wanting to know on how many occasions you saw him, if at all. 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I did not see him again, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And without identifying the position that you held, the place that you were based, was that inside or outside the préfecture? Was it in Kigali city or Kigali rural préfecture? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I was in Kigali city, to the south of the city -- to the south and to the west -- or southwest. If you have the map, it was around Mount Kigali in the area where you have Nyakabanda. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, would you agree with me, Witness, that in the period of April to July 1994, there were approximately 100 FAR soldiers who were killed in and around Kigali? That doesn't count those who were injured. Those who were killed, there were approximately 100 who were killed; isn't that correct? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Did you say 100 Rwandan soldiers killed? Is that what you said? There were certainly more, Counsel. Excuse me, not necessarily around where I was stationed, because where I have just pointed out to you was merely a command post, and the soldiers under my command were a bit more dispersed, and to be more specific there was fighting in that area only from June. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, can you tell the Trial Chamber, according to your information, how many FAR soldiers do you understand were killed in that period, in Kigali itself? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, casualties within the Rwandan army exceeded 500 persons. And, towards the end, there was suddenly an increase, a speeding up of this, because we were like walled in, and we had these young fighters from Ruhengeri and who were just shot down like sitting pigeons. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, you say in excess? Is it around 500 or slightly more than 500 in your estimation? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
In Kigali, there were more than 500. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you able to be any more precise, bearing in mind the position that you held initially? And, perhaps, if I can ask you to focus on the period that you were in your initial position. You have told us that the numbers increased towards the end, but would you agree with me that there were, in fact, less than 500 killed during the month of April in and around Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Counsel, the casualty figure, that is, the dead and injured, is the normal situation that appears in the situation reports. That is, the daily reports that unit commanders sent to operation commanders and that are sent by the latter to the chiefs of staff. In our case, just as I told you, that is the situation of those who are present -- those who are not present, the deserters, the opening of files, or the daily reports of unit commanders. All this information did not get to the army headquarters. 
You realise that an army -- a unit commander, that is, a platoon commander has to report on his staff strength to the company commander, and the latter to the battalion commander, and all this information has to get to the army headquarters. But in the situation in which we found ourselves, I must assure you that it's impossible for me to give you the figures. Conversely, within a unit like mine, by just taking the example of a fight or successive fights, I can tell you just how -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I am sorry to interrupt you. I was asking about figures that you found out in your position, up until the end of April. Now, did you not learn of any deaths of FAR soldiers at army headquarters up until the end of April, or you did learn of some, and, if so, are you able to tell the Trial Chamber how many? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I am sorry, Counsel, I am not able to do so. Those figures came up to the G1, and the G1 was supposed to make a summary over a month or two. And I assure you that work was never done. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree with me, Witness, that during the period when there were a few hundred FAR soldiers in and around Kigali, there were perhaps well over 100,000 civilians killed in and around Kigali during that same period?
@WITNESS PAT: 
Counsel, well, I don't see the link. The figures that are coming to me -- well, I see I am told that the casualty figure in the FAR was over a hundred. I said it was more than 500. But, as for civilians, unfortunately, I know that there were many people killed, but I don't have to compare the number of military casualties to that of civilians, unfortunately. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, I didn't ask you to. I simply asked you to -- whether you agreed with me with the figures that I had suggested to you. 
Do you agree with me that in that same period there were well over 100,000 civilians killed in and around Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, there, again, I cannot venture into any figures. But nobody counted the dead. Nobody counted them. But the observation is that, unfortunately, for soldiers, one can always say a certain battalion lost a certain number of people; but for the civilians, I deplore the fact that many, many of them were killed, but I can't give you a figure. Maybe the Red Cross or the préfecture authorities can venture into such figures, but the position I held does not allow me to make any such estimates for Kigali or its environs. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you aware, and do you accept, that the majority of the civilians who were killed in Kigali were of the Tutsi ethnic group? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I do agree, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree with me that those Tutsi civilians were being killed by those who were targeting them on the basis of their ethnicity? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
For the bulk of them, I believe it was on the basis of their ethnic belonging. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you accept, Witness, that there was a genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994, and, in particular, in Kigali? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I would not venture into a description or the outcome of what happened. But the truth is that, by some confusion or misinterpretation, and by "confusion" I mean of soldiers or the RPF movements that recruited on Tutsi basis or had Tutsi demands -- and, so, in such confusion, people attacked an ethnic group. And I do agree that the Tutsi ethnic group suffered and had victims, some of whom were targeted on the basis of their ethnic belonging. But if you use that word "genocide", I am not the one who used it. Certainly, the UN Security Council and the Chamber have done so; you are here for that. But it is not up to me to say that that description, which is rather technical, is within my jurisdiction to define it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
But do you accept that the targeting of the Tutsis within Kigali in April to July 1994 was carried out by FAR soldiers, gendarmes, communal police and civilians? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The massacre of Tutsis in Kigali and throughout Rwanda was done by people who were Hutu in the majority; but there were civilians, soldiers, gendarmes also, both military corps. But in no case did (sic) those policemen or the gendarmes were sent by their institutions. I am saying that a soldier who is -- has deserted when he kills can be considered representative of either the national army or the national gendarmerie or the communal police force. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Would you agree with me that there was a massive scale of killings at roadblocks and elsewhere in Kigali as from the 7th of April? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Most of the killing was committed in the neighbourhoods, and the roadblocks, to my view, were set up by the people manning them to prevent people from going -- to filter them through. But it wasn't at the roadblocks that people were killed. They were killed, either at home or in their neighbourhoods, and occasionally at the roadblocks. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, on the 7th of April, if we can focus on that day a little bit. You travelled to Kanombe that morning, didn't you? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And so we don't identify you, you were taking someone to look at one of the bodies of those persons who had been killed in the plane crash; that's correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
To be quite precise, someone who was to see a corpse or the corpses of her husband. Someone had to go there in the context of someone who had suffered a loss in the crash. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And as part of your journey, you went past the Kanombe military camp, didn't you? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct; next to Kanombe camp. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. And what time did you pass there on the way to look at the bodies; and secondly, if you can answer, simply the time that you passed back on your way into town? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
About 9:30 I passed Kanombe camp, and I returned to town at about 20 to 11 or 11 o'clock, all a.m. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And as you were travelling both there and back did you hear shooting in the neighbourhood? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Not at the time -- in Kigali there already was firing, shooting in the neighbourhoods, contrary to the impression I had in the morning. And in the vicinity of Kanombe I didn't hear any specific firing or explosions that drew my -- not that drew my attention, at any rate. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't understand that answer. Did you hear any shooting around 9:30, yes or no? 
@WITNESS PAT:
When I went to Kanombe, I heard firing in the neighbourhoods in Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When you passed by 10:40 or 11:00, did you hear any shooting? 
@WITNESS PAT:
Similarly, I heard fighting -- firing in the neighbourhoods. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
When you say "neighbourhoods", Kanombe? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, in the neighbourhoods of Kigali. In the first part of my answer I said that in Kanombe I did not have any specific -- my attention drawn specifically to any detonations. But before coming to the presidential residence in Kigali, at that crossroads, my attention wasn't drawn, in particular, between the entrance to the airport and Kanombe. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you see in Kanombe at 9:30 or 10:40 soldiers who were going around the streets and into people's houses and killing Tutsi? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I saw soldiers at the crossroad. There is a crossroad just in front of the church at Kanombe camp, on the right, and then there is a small shopping centre. At the crossroads there were some soldiers, but I didn't leave the tarmacked road, I went to a specific residence where I was due to go. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, you have told, in answer to a question from Her Honour yesterday, that you subsequently heard of FAR soldiers who took part in killings on the 7th of April. Did you hear that the paracommando unit at Kanombe had been out into the local area and had targeted Tutsis on the morning of the 7th of April? Did that information get to you at headquarters? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
There was no report of that type to headquarters, HQ, on the morning of the 7th of April. 
@MR. MOSES: 
At any point at headquarters, after the 7th of April, did you get such a report? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I think I answered that yesterday when I answered Her Honour that after the 7th of April HQ learned that soldiers were hiding among the gangs -- gangs of killers, to go and -- and perhaps the paracommandos from Kanombe were not an exception -- a particular exception. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, you are an intelligent man, and, with respect, that does not answer my question. 
In respect of the paracommando unit, did you receive a complaint at any stage that you were at headquarters that on the 7th -- morning of the 7th of April they were out in the area targeting Tutsi, yes or no? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I will answer no for the simple reason that that report should be made by the sectoral commander, or the camp commander, and such a report never came specifying that soldiers from the paracommando battalion, named specifically, had participated in massacres in the small trading centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Also on the 7th of April, before the RPF left their barracks, will you agree with me that soldiers from the Presidential Guard in Kimihurura left their barracks and went out and specifically targeted politicians in that area? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
What I heard, learned on the 8th, was that opponents, political opponents had been assassinated, killed in their homes in Kimihurura. If you want to extrapolate and mention the Presidential Guard, there is no real difficulty because the Presidential Guard was there. But, as regards a report, as such, of the RPF exiting their barracks -- I am sorry I am losing my thread -- my train of thought. Could you repeat, please? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you, first of all, accept that soldiers from the Presidential Guard battalion at Kimihurura left their barracks on the morning of the 7th of April and they went out and targeted and killed a number of civilians who were politicians, including the prime minister? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Well, now, the prime minister was living in Kigali not in Kimihurura. And, as to the first part of the question, political opponents were killed in Kimihurura, and unfortunately there was no investigation. It could be that it was soldiers from the Presidential Guard. There was no enquiry -- investigation. At 15 -- sorry, at 3 p.m., but I can confirm that in the morning the Presidential Guard had already exited at night to defend the camp. However, under the orders of the chief of staff, and with the cooperation of General Dallaire, there should be no excessive response, the Presidential Guard returned to their camp. They abandoned their lines of defence that they had taken up during the night and went back into the barracks during the day. But as regards the massacres or the killing of the politicians, there was no investigation or enquiry, but I would not rule out the possibility that it was soldiers from the Presidential Guard. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Try to be brief, Mr. Witness. Will you make an attempt, please? 
@WITNESS PAT:
I will try to do so, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So there was no report to headquarters in respect of those killings at any stage after the 7th of April to headquarters, correct? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And also on the morning of the 7th of April, before the RPF left their barracks at 3:00 in the afternoon, FAR soldiers were involved in the murder of ten Belgian soldiers at Camp Kigali at a place approximately 2- to 300 metres from where you were having your meeting; isn't that correct? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And no soldiers were ever brought to account or found to have been responsible for those killings, were they, by the FAR in 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
As far as I know, no disciplinary measures -- there was no sanctioning of those who were responsible. G1 and the commander of Camp Kigali who would normally undertake the necessary investigations, and they were never completed within three months following those killings. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree with me, Witness, that the battlefront, if you want to use that term, was almost stable in Kigali from the 17th of April until the city was evacuated in early July 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I do not agree at all. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And because, you would agree with me, wouldn't you, if the battlefront -- to use that term -- had been stable from mid-April until July, and assuming, for the moment, that the roadblocks or some persons on them were out of control and not, in fact, doing what the army and the authorities wanted, you would agree with me there would be no good reason why such roadblocks could not have been taken down or taken out during that period? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, the roadblocks and the massacres of civilians were a difficulty for the war effort by the RGF. And if the battlefront had been stable, as requested by Major General Gatsinzi, who was the interim commander, and the wishes of General Dallaire, whether in good faith or not, had the battlefront been stable, I think that the RGF could have taken care of those armed gangs. And the fact that there was killing, the chaos that was created, resulted in a logic of defeat, which only -- and then it only took three months for the country to fall. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that answer. You told us yesterday that you were listening on Radio RTLM on the evening of 6th of April when you heard of the death of President Habyarimana. Was that your radio station of choice? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
It wasn't in the evening, Mr. Prosecutor, it was in the early morning. I think I said when I was woken by the firing of rockets and machine-guns -- heavy machine-guns. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said. 
@WITNESS PAT:
RTLM was not my preferred radio station. I listened to it, I turned it on -- switched it on because it had music, and the young servant boy had it, and he was listening. I was not audacious (sic) to the point of not going to sleep, but he listened to all the messages, and the room was open to all the elements and I could hear them talking about it -- to the events. Far from being my preferred radio station, but it was giving news. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you continue to listen to that or any other radio station from 7th April to early July? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, no. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, from what you have told the Trial Chamber, the military headquarters were aware by the end of March 1994 that the RPF was well armed, correct? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And well trained? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
In any case, well prepared. They had not suspended their training or preparations for war in the period after the ceasefire or the Peace Accords. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, I think you told the Trial Chamber earlier this morning, looking at P. 24, which was a letter sent from the chief of staff regarding a meeting held with others, including the Accused, that they were really organising an early warning system. That's the words you used, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
A warning system is by definition before the fact. It's just that those cells should at least alert to infiltrations or a grouping of RPF combatants in one or another neighbourhood or district. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In paragraph 10 of that letter, there is reference to the bourgmestres -- a suggestion that the bourgmestres instruct the population in traditional weapons, swords, spears, machetes, bows and arrows handling. How would training in the use of a machete, Witness, assist in either an early warning system or in fighting a well-trained and armed RPF? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Could I have confirmation of paragraph 10, please? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's correct. Do you have it in front of you? 
@MR. MOSES:
I am sorry, I thought the witness did. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have a copy for the witness, paragraph 10 of P -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Twenty-four
While that's -- can I continue, Your Honour, while it's -- oh.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you see that now, Witness? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I am there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You will agree with me, machetes would be -- and machete training would be very effective training to be used in the killing of unarmed civilians, it wouldn't be particularly useful in an early warning system or fighting a well-armed and trained RPF soldier, would it? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor. It's not the machetes -- with machetes that you can resist heavy machine-gun 1200 metres from the targets. But the high command of the army recognised its deficiency in lack of armament. They should have at least had rifles, but the chief of staff realised they didn't have them. So not having proper armament, they advised to use what's left; couldn't tell them to run away. So, in view of that, what the RPF did in the zones it occupied before and even afterwards, to have a machete might be reassurance, to have a spear would be reassurance. There weren't enough guns for all the people to be enrolled in those cells, and so the chief of staff recommended they resort to something else. But what is true is that this provision which, fortunately, or unfortunately, did not take place -- was in any case derisory.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Remember brevity, Mr. Witness. 
Here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you involved in the unofficial distribution of weapons and ammunition from within the Rwandan army; yes or no? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The answer would be no, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
If weapons had been provided to the ministry of defence, the préfectoral office, or anywhere else, that were from military camps throughout Kigali, you would not know about that would you, because you weren't, for that first month or so out in the field? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, for the first month I was at my first post, which was rather at the office. But from -- if arms came from a military camp to the ministry of defence, it's sure that I wouldn't have been informed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And we have had heard, in fact, from a defence witness, Witness, that he said some weapons were distributed from Camp Kigali into the sectors, and I am referring to Witness AIA. So that sort of thing could happen, couldn't it, without you being aware of it? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That could have happened without me knowing about it. But the difference is that since the truce of March 1993 there was no fighting, and the administrative and logistic approach was that weapons held by units or camps are transferred to the base through a transfer slip. So there is no reason that a march -- arms should be stored in a store. And since Camp Kigali has a reconnaissance battalion there was no reason that Camp Kigali should distribute weapons to the exterior when it needed such arms. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
I am wondering if the witness could briefly be shown P. 57 -- 77, I am sorry, which is the booklet of photographs. I am happy for my copy to be given -- shown to the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe we could find them. Have you, already, the photograph on the top available for witness? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's really an impression in the first one. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
If you look at the top photograph, Witness, will you agree with me that the group of people there seem to be particularly well armed? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And we have heard that photograph was taken in Kigali, perhaps in Muhima, in mid-May 1994. My question to you is: There didn't seem to be too much of a shortage of weapons and ammunition, so as far as the persons who were manning the roadblocks are concerned; would you agree with that? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
And I would gladly add that they let themselves be photographed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, so, if there was such a shortage of arms for the army, it wouldn't have been difficult, would it, to have collected such weapons off these people who were using their arms and bullets to shoot innocent civilians? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I presume, Counsel, that these photos were taken, as you say, after 7 April and that all our interventions today are to the effect that the armed gangs were not disarmed, because from within the FAR, the FAR, as an institution and as a military organisation, had a task, and those in its rear were actually hurting its effort, and they could not go to collect those weapons because they were fighting against another enemy. And if I tell you that it was worse than the RPF that was firing in front of us, because these people were harming -- were hurting our operations, they were killing the population, but they were destroying the defence structure and pushing it to defeat. It was the resources that were required to dismantle these people. Precisely I told you that these people got together here for a photo because they were at a roadblock, otherwise they would be a lot more armed than the FAR structures. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The photograph just referred to was K0376701. 
Have we finished with the photograph? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, thank you, sir. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
There was an army unit, wasn't there, established to deal with those who were looting in Kigali, correct? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Actually, it was not a unit, but a detachment of the military police of Camp Kigali, just a detachment, because the bulk of the military police was at Kami and did not intervene to maintain law and order and discipline. So that detachment was assigned to combat looting that took hold of the commercial centre and Kigali plateau neighbourhood. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, in fact, I think they shot at a couple of looters, didn't they, and they managed by doing that to stop or seriously reduce the amount of looting. Isn't that correct? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
At about nine -- around 9 April they tried to check the looting or to fight the looters, but they did not carry their effort to the end. The result was really derisory. There was a detachment that was in charge of discipline in Camp Kigali. It was not a major unit to combat looting or indisciplined soldiers, but there was an operation to combat looting in those residential neighbourhoods, notably in the Kigali commercial centre. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Moving onto civil defence, Witness, you told us you didn't listen to the radio after the 7th of April, is that correct? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That is correct. I did not move about with the radio set -- or did not sit down somewhere to listen to the radio. But, from time to time, I would hear the radio. It is possible, but I am not saying that in three months I did not have occasion to listen to a radio. But, generally speaking, my duty was not to listen to the radio.

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, did you, on the 22nd of April, hear on Radio Rwanda the Accused introducing a FAR officer by the name of Esdras Mushimiyamana, M-U-S-H-I-M-I-Y-A-M-A-N-A, who was a second lieutenant? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that second lieutenant said on the radio how on the 22nd of April, how "we will be working together to see how we can improve on the civil defence system in the course of meetings that I will be having with you." You didn't hear that? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And if there was no civil defence, as you have told the Trial Chamber, there equally would have been no reason for the Accused to go on the radio on the 22nd of April, the 10th of May, that's Prosecution Exhibit 56; the 18th of June, Prosecution Exhibit 62; and again on the 18th of June, Prosecution Exhibit 63; where the Accused spoke about civil defence system meetings he had held with youth, the military, and civilian authorities? You didn't hear any of those speeches by the Accused on the radio? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The truth of the matter, isn't it, Witness, that the FAR were working together with the youth, militia of the MRND and CDR parties, and others. They were working together during the course of the events from April to July 1994. That's correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
To my knowledge, no. Well, it was even dangerous to have armed civilians, as you seem to imply, working with the combat units, professional persons trained for that purpose. It was more dangerous to work with them than to stay alone. 
Now, a measure that would have been taken in that direction would have put them within the troops. And within my unit, I'd never known that kind of thing. The truth is that whether they're called gangs, or these gray armies, are behind, in the rear, of the combat troops. And in a double capacity, they manage the official front line, because they cause disturbances within the country. They disturb population to make them to flee. And naturally, they give a pretext, military and pretext, to the RPF. 
So if there had been unofficial troops or defence in addition to the professional troops, we would have known. And I believe that no unit commander would have been comfortable with troops who may have a weapon -- or who may know how to shoot, but who may not have been trained with his own troops. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, do you know a person who, I believe, may have been a commander, Laurent, L-A-U-R-E-N-T, Twagirayezu, T-W-A-G-I-R-A-Y-E-Z-U? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
That name does not ring a bell with me. At any rate, Twagirayezu was a former commander. I do know one, but I do not know about the first name, Laurent. I do know a former commander known as Twagirayezu, but who was no longer part of the army for some time. 
@MR. MOSES:
I'd ask that the witness be shown one of the documents which had been handed out, Your Honours. It's a radio broadcast. 
$BY MR. MOSES: 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Witness, the radio broadcast that's been given to you, the transcript is in three languages. The top is in Kinyarwandan, and it goes through to page 29. I don't know if you would be more comfortable reading the Kinyarwandan or the French. The French begins immediately after that.
@MR. MOSES: 
And I can certainly point to you the part that I want to comment on in the French, and also in the English, Your Honours. I'm looking at page 2 of the English. It's K0298885, about two-thirds of the way down. 
$BY MR. MOSES: 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in the French, Witness, I'm looking at the bottom of page 2. In the French version, it's K0295996, going onto the following page. 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I am there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours? The -- there is an introduction of Mr. Twagirayezu on the radio. And he introduces himself, talks about the war breaking out, and then he says -- and it's in the French, the fifth line starting "Nous nous sommes," and in the English "We realised". 
It says, "We realised that soldiers could not prosecute this war by themselves without the help of live forces of the country, which include the youths. The idea of civil defence originated from there. We, therefore, brought together reservists of all descriptions, soldiers, lance corporals, non-commissioned officers, and some officers we were able to find. We got the youth from Nyakabanda, Nyamirambo, and Biryogo secteurs, and we started giving them military training in what we called the centre d'instruction of Nyamirambo. In reality, we think that we have just trained a battalion of about 700 persons."
And the next line, first part which is relevant: "Currently, some of them are part of the Huye battalion." 
Now, -- I will be able to give you a -- point to you later -- if my friends want me, I can do it now -- that this radio broadcast was at some point after the 7th of June, for reasons which I will show later. But do you agree with me, Witness, that there was, in fact, a civil defence system; there were some 700 youths trained at Nyamirambo stadium as part of that; and, in fact, some of them went to the Huye battalion? Do you agree with those propositions? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I do not agree with the propositions. Actually, you've mentioned a date. I hope -- I hope what you're saying is true. I believe we are -- in June -- we're talking about June. And what I know is that in June...(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) young fighters, who came to reinforce the positions of the battalion at Mount Kigali, where there was a raid. That is, at Mount Rebero, Kimisange -- Kimisange, K-I-M-I-S-A-N-G-I (sic) -- raiders who had attacked the southeastern flank of Mount Kigali. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And looking at page 4 on the French, the very top sentence, and in English it's on page 3, the top two lines of the third paragraph, he goes on to say that, "It was called the first squad, but considering that we trained many persons, some went to the front while others staffed the roadblocks." 
Do you see that? And were you aware --
@WITNESS PAT: 
As I've told you, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover). Whether it was the first squad or second squad or the mosque, as is mentioned below, I don't know. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you aware that some of those persons who were -- the young people who were trained, were sent to roadblocks? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I did not know about that, because the roadblocks go back to 7 April. And given the dates, this training could be the one mentioned this morning with Major Bivamvagara, but I am not really sure. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That major who you've just referred to, he, in fact, had an office and was based at PVK, wasn't he? Or you weren't aware of that? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I know nothing about it, and I'm learning it from you that the training took place at the stadium. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, briefly before we end with this document, that Mr. Twagirayezu introduced another person who was a sergeant by the name of Rwamparage, spelt R-W-A-M-P-A-R-A-G-E. And just so that you know I wasn't misleading you, if you look on page 5, at the top of the last paragraph, starting "Le 1er juin," and in English it's on the fourth page, the third paragraph. In that paragraph, he's talking about events on the 1st of June. And in the following paragraph, and it's on the following page in the French, and the next paragraph down, he's talking about events on the 6th and 7th, after the 1st of June. So, sometime after the 7th of June. 
The last bit that I want to refer you to, in respect of that transcript in front of you, is on page 7 in the French. It's in the middle of the second paragraph. It's the same speaker continuing, namely, Sergeant Rwamparage. And the bit I'm going to focus on is the sentence which commences "II est parti". That's four lines down. In the English it's on page 5, and in the second paragraph, and perhaps the fifth or sixth line down, where he is talking about an event and some fighting. He says, "A person left, and about one hour later he came back with a company of soldiers in reinforcement, fighting continued, the company arrived with some youths of the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi from Simbizi. 
Do you see that there, Witness? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
I have it, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You'd agree with me that that would indicate that the army were, at least on that occasion, working together with the Interahamwe and the youth militia of the CDR party? That's what it indicates, doesn't it? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
From reading what I see here, yes. But as a description of the battalion, that is not true. 
@MR. MOSES: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)
@WITNESS PAT: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)	
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a need to redact from 10:26:00 where the witness started responding to questions within this sequence. That commences with the words, "I do not agree with the propositions." And then follows an exchange over a few paragraphs. It contains a lot of non-sensitive information, but there are a few formulations that should be redacted. And I'm now simply saying that any reference to who received, or who learned about developments, shall be deleted. And the Bench will cooperate with the court reporters so that we only delete what is absolutely essential. 
Let's proceed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I was there, Your Honour. I'm just trying to locate my list of questions, which I think I'm almost at. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Just briefly, Witness, on the 17th of June, did you personally go to Sainte Famille/Saint Paul area in the morning following the RPF having been there the night before? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
No, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Finally, Witness, in respect of the position of the Accused, who was a -- you'll agree, a full colonel in the Rwandan army, as of the morning of the 7th of April, and the death of General Nsabimana and the president, how many generals were left alive in Rwanda at that point in time? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
Only one, Ndindiliyimana. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you'll agree with me that there was only one more senior military officer in the country at that point in time to the Accused, who was a colonel? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
There were many other superior officers, superior in rank to Renzaho, because the ranking is years of service, in conjunction with a system of promotion, which resulted from the order in which they had been promoted from the military school. I think he wasn't even in third, fourth or fifth rank. There were other officers with more years of service, even if they had the same rank. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree with me, Witness, that the Rwandan law regarding armed forces says that a superior has not only the right, but the duty, to enforce compliance with the general rules governing discipline by all soldiers below him in order of hierarchy, even if the soldiers are not under his operational authority? Do you agree with me that's what the law states? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The right and duty to take note and make a report concerning the person showing lack of discipline. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you don't agree that it says -- that the law states that a superior officer has the right and duty to enforce compliance? You don't agree with that, that's what the law was in 1994? 
@WITNESS PAT: 
The nuance in the word as "assured", to ensure -- but an officer, any soldier has the right and duty to take note, and to accuse, or to name, the soldier of a lesser rank who is showing lack of discipline or doing anything against the rules and regulations and laws. He has to report to those who have the power to sanction, punish. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's the end of my cross-examination. Thank you, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. This document you used, is that part of your transcript folder or -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
It is not, and so I'd be seeking Your Honours to introduce that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We got one comprehensive document. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And one document running from page 1 to 5 in the French, and 1 to 4 in the English. Did you use only one of them? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I only used one of them because he recognised the name of the persons. And it was only if he did not that I would have done that, used that other one. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you only want exhibited the voluminous document starting with K0142324? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's correct. And as I say, it's in Kinyarwandan, French and English. And -- yes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mrs. Ben Salimo, next Prosecution exhibit number, please? 
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
It's P. 113, in the three versions, A, B, C. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Kinyarwanda, French and English in that sequence.
$(Exhibit No. P. 113A, P. 113B, and P. 113C admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, a very brief examination. 
##
$RE-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I should like, with you, to revisit the document shown to you by the Prosecutor in which Mr. Renzaho was introducing Esdras Mushimiyamana. He did not give you the totality of the Renzaho speech, but there is a paragraph I should like to read to you, and ask you how you interpret it. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
On page K0246838, the first document brought by the Prosecutor and shown to the witness. K0246838. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I should like, Mr. Witness -- 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I don't know if the Bench has the document before them. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters don't. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just help us exactly with which document you are referring to now. You're not referring to the bundle we just tendered as P. 113, I take it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
No. The first document the Prosecutor brought containing a message from Mr. Renzaho to the population introducing Esdras Mushimiyamana, sub lieutenant to the population. It was the first document. And you do have it, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But just give us the reference, Mr. Moses. Was it P. 11, 24 or 25? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It is P. 54, it's under tab 8. I would also comment, Your Honour, that the -- having put -- the witness said he hadn't heard -- I won't object at this juncture. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So the reference made now is to P. 54. All right. And having heard the answer, that's why you didn't proceed with that document. You are now coming back to that document and want to go into it, Mr. Nekuie. What is your question? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I will read to you the paragraph preceding Mr. Renzaho's introduction, the second paragraph in the French version, and I would like to ask you to comment upon it. 
The paragraph -- the end of the paragraph begins as follows: "We are beginning to note these criminal acts in some secteurs where young people join unscrupulous soldiers to aggress members of the population by obtaining money from them and looting their houses. We must absolutely stop such acts so that the armed forces can resolutely fight the enemy. Therefore, we need to establish security committees, in some secteurs they've been called crisis committees, and it is up to those committees to take care of organising that." And then the next paragraph says, "I take this opportunity to introduce to you the officer who has been selected to work with me." 
This was Mr. Renzaho's comment at the presentation of Sub Lieutenant Esdras Mushimiyamana. If the Prosecutor had read to you what I have just read to you, Witness, how would you have interpreted it? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can't allow that question. So do you have another question? And I think the reasons are clear. It's speculative, it is something that the witness had not listened to, the document wasn't used by the Prosecution in cross-examination. These are three of the reasons why we have to move on to the next question. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Prosecution attempted to use this document, and they drew consequences from it, even if they didn't tender the document. They said that Renzaho wanted to set up a system of civil defence. They described to him that intention. Of course, I do respect the ruling of the Bench, but I did have to make this comment. 
I have now finished with my re-examination. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, it follows from your testimony, doesn't it, that soon after the commencement of events in 1994, some soldiers of the Rwandan army were seen among so-called armed gangs. 
@WITNESS PAT:
The information that reached the chief of staff confirms that, but it was only after the 8th. But that wasn't long, in any case, because it's only one day. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
But what was the status of those soldiers? Were they deserters, or who were they? 
@WITNESS PAT:
The situation in the army was that there was some soldiers who lived in neighbourhoods who, at the time when there was -- from the 6th to the 7th, coming after the assassination, a communiqué inviting the people to stay at home. So the soldiers did not exit in the morning for the simple reason that they weren't thinking that the war was going to start. In any case, they were concerned with security. They stayed with their -- in there (unintelligible) so as not to fill up the roads to the camps. 
Because there was no alerts, there was no call for them to go back to barracks. That's the first reason why the soldiers stayed in the neighbourhoods. And it is not -- we cannot -- cannot exclude that they might have associated themselves with evil-doers in the neighbourhoods, in some shooting and some throwing of grenades. They were also soldiers who took advantage of the chaos that ensued on the day of the 7th, the explosions, the beginning of the looting, the killing. Soldiers who were not being confined to barracks or to camp, because there was no alert, no mobilisation, would come out of the camps and leave. And then there's abandonment of position. 
That -- that category of soldiers, and others that I said in the document which you admitted yesterday, there were others who, speaking of -- or concerned for their loved one's safety, left Kigali with those loved ones, without permission, to return to their home hills hoping to find life a bit calmer there. And they did not return to fight. And all those who were not encarded by the unit commanders or the chief of staff. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Should I take it that there were some soldiers who could be considered as deserters? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please answer briefly, now, Mr. Witness. It's really necessary. We do not need these elaborations. You see, now Judge Egorov has to more or less ask the question again. So what is the answer? 
@WITNESS PAT:
There were deserters in the army. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. And in your statement, written statement, you gave to the Defence in July of this year, you mentioned that among other members of high command of the Rwandan army, the minister of defence was out of the country on the 6th of April 1994. Is it correct? 
@WITNESS PAT:
That is correct. And my statement is dated in May -- May 2007. Sorry. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Could you please briefly explain to us the reasons why he -- I mean, the minister of defence, turned out to be abroad on that particular date? 
@WITNESS PAT:
He was in Cameroon attending a conference planned well in advance. I don't remember exactly which international organisation organised the conference, but he was in Cameroon, and he left on the 4th or 5th. I think it was the 5th of April. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
$(Microphones overlapping)
@WITNESS PAT:
I think it was on the 8th or the 9th. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
What was the reason of the delay? 
@WITNESS PAT:
I imagine it was, rather, for technical reasons. The time to be informed and to get -- catch a plane. There was no regular flights. In any case, it wasn't an easy route. He had to go through other capitals. And he didn't land in Kigali, in any case. So it's for technical reasons; the time taken for the information to get there, and for transportation. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the sentence which we lost because of overlapping microphones when Judge Egorov spoke, was: "And when did he return to the country?"
Thank you. That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness. We would like to thank you very much for having come the long way to Arusha to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you. 
And should you wish to meet with the Accused, the witness protection unit will look into any such request and make sure that it is implemented. 
@WITNESS PAT:
Thank you very much, indeed, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will, then, adjourn to 11:30, and begin with the next witness. 
Will that be in open or closed session, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
We will probably begin in closed session, and then move in to open session, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the duration of the closed session will be approximately -- 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Fifteen minutes or so, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So we will open again at around 11:45. The Court is adjourned.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness PER, we are now in open session to continue your examination-in-chief. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What exactly can you tell us were your activities, both at Saint Paul and at Holy Family? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The humanitarian activities that I was involved in at Saint Paul and Holy Family consisted of receiving the refugees, people who came from all quarters, who were around Sainte Famille and Saint Paul -- or, Holy Family and Saint Paul. When they arrived -- first of all, we showed them a place to stay. There were places. 
Saint Paul centre, I should like to clarify, was a Catholic centre which was used for conferences and meetings. It was, in brief, a pastoral centre. The internal structure was different from that of the structure at Holy Family. When people came, we'd give them shelter, family by family. We would not separate the families. Such and such a place, according to the surface area, would harbour so many families. 
But at Holy Family, it was the church that was there. There was the internal courtyard, surrounded by the houses, premises, of the presbytery. And that's where the people stayed. The structure was different. And at Sainte Famille -- at Holy Family, people also went in to various places, family by family. It was forbidden to break up families when they arrived as a family, of course. 
And, then, when there was injured or wounded people, as there were, we tried to contact the Red Cross, who played a major role in everything we did. And they'd come either to evacuate the injured, the sick, or give them medicine. And it was in that atmosphere that we went on welcoming refugees day after day -- receiving refugees day after day. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for that clarification, Witness. In the context of those activities, did you benefit from assistance from Kigali préfecture, the authorities at Kigali préfecture? 
@WITNESS PER: 
In our activities we -- as time passed, the situation became more and more alarming. And among the authorities we received at Holy Family and Saint Paul, we came to cooperate with Mr. Simpunga, who was sub prefect at PVK in charge of social affairs. It was he to whom we would turn, it's he who would come to us, it was he who worked with us, cooperated with us. He helped us in several fields, bringing foodstuffs, drawing water, and also for medicine he assisted us. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
As of what date, if you remember, did you begin going to Holy Family parish for those activities? 
@WITNESS PER: 
To be quite precise, it was on the 10th of April. Because at Saint Paul's, I told you that the way we received refugees was not organised as it was at Holy Family. The number of refugees at Saint Paul was rather limited in view of the narrow premises, small premises. At Holy Family, there was a constant movement, it was full up inside, outside, anybody could come. There were more than 18,000 refugees. It is after the 10th when I saw that Munyeshyaka was overburdened, he mentioned it to me himself. I went to give him assistance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you -- did you -- did you refer to the sub-prefect of PVK in the last answer, Mr. Witness? Could you repeat the name, please? 
@WITNESS PER:
I knew him as Simpunga. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you mention his first name or did you just say Simpunga in your last answer? 
@WITNESS PER:
If you're asking me his full name, it was Aloys Simpunga -- Aloysius -- Aloys. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
On your way between Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, Witness, did you come across roadblocks? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Saint Paul and Sainte Famille were two adjoining localities, but they were separated by a wall. And on that wall, there was a small door from Saint Paul into Sainte Famille. So if I were going to Sainte Famille from Saint Paul, I would use that small gate. And that was the same route that was used by people staying in Saint Paul and Sainte Famille. It was a private passage for persons living either in Saint Paul or Sainte Famille. It was not a thoroughfare. But if I had to go out with the car, I would go round the wall that separated the two localities. So it is under such a circumstance that one could come across a roadblock of the militias.
$(Pages 31 to 32 by Vicki Eastvold)

$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when we were preparing your testimony, you prepared a sketch for me. And with the leave of the Chamber, since we have circulated copies thereof, I would like you to explain that sketch to the Chamber since it has to do with the roadblocks. And to help you, my question is as follows: Were there roadblocks that were found in the vicinity of Saint Paul? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. The sketch I prepared for you indicated the roadblocks, and I would explain further if you -- if you so want. There you see where it is written Saint Paul. Next to that, there is Sainte Famille. When you go up on this little road that I have drawn, you see where it is written MC, that is militias or militiamen, that roadblock was found near a stand of the brewing company that was around there and the militiamen were there all the time. When one went up with the car -- in a car -- and to move into the small road there, which was incomplete, one had to go round the Sainte Famille church. So where you have MC there was a roadblock manned by the militiamen. And coming from Saint Paul, when you were moving from Sainte Famille those militiamen would stop you and ask you questions and even threaten you. That was the first roadblock. 
Can I continue to explain the roadblocks? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, the roadblocks that were found in the vicinity of Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, just those essentially, Witness. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. Moving down -- move down to where it is written "Péage toll gate", can you see Péage? At that point there was another roadblock manned by the militiamen. Because when you look closely after Saint Paul, going down there is SELA and JOC, all these areas were within the Catholic church area. Leaving Sainte Famille to JOC, that was within the plot of the Catholic church, precisely, the Kigali archbishopric. And where you have Péage, the toll gate, there was another roadblock manned by militiamen. Move down further into the neighbourhood and then leave the major highway you will find secteur Rugenge. This was a dirt road and untarred road leading to Rugenge secteur. There you had a roadblock manned by the militiamen of that neighbourhood and it was called Ngahanga roadblock. I don't know why, but it was also manned by militiamen, who, from what I learnt, wanted to check the forward thrust of the RPF elements who were infiltrating the neighbourhood. And I will stop there because those are the roadblocks that were in the vicinity of the Sainte Famille parish. The others were out of the town, towards the exit of the town.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you -- 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you please spell the name of that roadblock? It sounded like Ugaranga. 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes. Ngahanga is spelt N-G-A-H -- oh, sorry, H-E-N-G-E. Can I take that over, if you don't mind? Ngahanga, N-G-A-H-A-N-G-A. I hope that is understood. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, as far as you know, who were these militiamen, because I suppose you were used to seeing them? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. Actually, my personal observation -- because I observed, I saw them and I had occasion to speak to them, these militiamen comprised what I can call thieves, thieves who were adventurous, who took advantage of the situation we were experiencing to try to express their own usefulness, their lives or their own way of taking it out, because amongst them I had never once seen anybody who was an intellectual or anybody who worked in an office anywhere or any person that I knew well or somebody responsible. Conversely, they were young persons who may not have been employed before, street kids, in short, thieves, as I mentioned. Thank you.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you. Witness, can you tell us if these militiamen were receiving orders from any authority at the time? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. I have told you that I lived in Sainte Famille and in Saint Paul. I spent some time, some part of my life there, 16 years, therefore some time. I knew the authorities. I knew the vicinity and I can tell you that as far as I know, those children depended on one Angeline Mukandituye, who was an inspector or the director of a primary school, Sainte Famille primary school in Kigali. Nonetheless, apart from that lady and the conseiller of the secteur, no other authority had ever managed or had any links with the militiamen. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, at the time did you know the préfet of Kigali city? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Well, there was no way I could fail not to know him. As the préfet, I knew him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the name referred to in the previous answer was Angeline, the last name being at 265 on the revised list dated the 22nd of August 2007. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you tell the Chamber, Witness, if you had occasion to see him or if you learnt or heard people saying that he was often at the roadblocks that you mentioned above?

Please, be specific in your question. Be specific about the person you are talking about. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
I am talking about the préfet of the city of Kigali, a person you claim to know very well. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, sir. All the time I spent at Saint Paul and at Sainte Famille and even when I went out of these areas, I would like to say that I saw Préfet Renzaho just once for all the time I was in Saint Paul and Sainte Famille; that was on 16th June 1994. On that day he came to Saint Paul. He stopped by with UNAMIR. And among the officials of UNAMIR who were with him there was a Ghanaian general and persons from the Red Cross. So Préfet Renzaho was with officials of UNAMIR and the Red Cross. They came and they discussed with Father Celestin Hakizimana, and I don't know the subject of their discussion and they left. It was on that day that I saw him, only on that day. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, were you able to know at that time whether Angeline, whose name you mentioned, and Odette, the conseiller de secteur, were often in contact with the préfet of Kigali city? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. All the time I spent at Saint Paul and at Sainte Famille I had never heard anyone mention the name of Renzaho, especially in connection with Angeline or Odette. As far as I know, Renzaho had never met Odette and Angeline. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did it happen during your stay in those two places that the militiamen that we discussed attacked any of the two places in which you lived? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. In my presence I would tell you that there were attempts to attack but these attempts were repelled each time the militiamen tried to attack us. Unfortunately, there were wider ranging attacks or attacks of a bigger magnitude that I experienced. At Saint Paul there was the RPF attacks and at Sainte Famille there was the attack of the militiamen. These are the attacks that I personally witnessed and which led to casualties. Other attacks by militiamen were repelled. And when you mention attacks that led to casualties, I believe those are attacks that actually led to casualties before me. Once the militiamen managed to enter Saint Paul once -- I cannot recall the date. I do apologise for that because we were living through a kind of situation that did not enable one to look at one's watch when the situation arrived. So we just had to cope with the danger. So, I do recall the attack on that day, but it did not lead to any casualty within Saint Paul. 
Concerning the attack, the militiamen came and asked for one Rukundo, who owned a driving school known as Apomajerwa, it's a driving school. The said Rukundo sought refuge at Saint Paul, and at some point the militiamen came in, they were furious, they forcibly opened the gate that was manned by a guard who could not resist and they told us if we do not find Rukundo -- they said they were sent by Angeline -- and the group of militiamen was headed by one Nkeshimana. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You need to break up your answers, Mr. Witness. First, when was this, maybe not the date, but the month or the part of the month? 
@WITNESS PER:
Early May. Can I move on? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Not yet. Then the next question was the spelling of the driving school. 
@WITNESS PER:
Apomajerwa is spelt A-P-R-O-G-A -- J-E-M-A-G ER W-A. Is that okay? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Witness, once more, please, because you changed the spelling in the middle of the word. Shall we try again? Okay. 
@WITNESS PER:
All right. A-P-O-M-A-J-E-R-W-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. And now the spelling of the leader of the militiamen, it sounded like Nshyimana. 
@WITNESS PER:
Nkeshimana and that is spelt N-K-E-S-H-I-M-A-N-A. Is that okay? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. And the technique in this courtroom is to try to make the answers rather brief and then counsel will ask questions whenever he wants some follow up. 
Now, do you want the witness to continue at this juncture, Mr. Nekuie, or do you want to ask some specific questions in view of what we have heard so far? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, I will ask more specific questions to make his account more intelligible. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us move to Saint Paul pastoral centre and let's talk about the attack that you mentioned a while ago. 
When the militiamen came in and said they were looking for Rukundo, who did they talk to, specifically? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. The militiamen came in furious and they said they didn't want to talk to any other person except for Father Celestin Hakizimana. So he came to meet them. They moved away to some distance because they didn't want to talk to any other person. I was sidelined -- 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Sorry. Were you able to hear what they said? 
@WITNESS PER: 
No, not at all, because I was completely away. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Nonetheless, did you see them talking together? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, I was watching. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And for how long did the conversation last? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Less than 10 minutes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What then was the outcome of their discussion even when you did not hear it? What happened later? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Since I was watching their movements very closely with a lot of curiosity. Later on they went down the stairs leading to the premises where the people were kept. After some time when they came out, they had Mr. Rukundo with them and some other persons, about four or five of them and they put them in a Hilux Mark vehicle, small trucks, which in our country we call Hilux, then they left. They never came back. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
All that was done in the presence of Father Hakizimana? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I repeat that they went down together and still where I was, I was even waiting for them to show me some sign, maybe to know what they were doing, but they didn't do it. They went down directly because they didn't even want him to move from where he was standing. So they went down to go and they came together. I was there, I saw it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I want to place on the record at this stage that this is not included in the statement provided to the Prosecution and this incident has never been put to any of the Prosecution witnesses, and I want that at least noted on the record at this stage. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's noted.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, this incidence -- incident was not notified simply because I did not have knowledge of it on the eve of the testimony of this witness. I don't know, we mentioned -- we talked about Saint Paul and I told myself that since he was talking about Father Hakizimana and his relations with him, it was not necessary then to mention it this morning to the Prosecution, but if the Chamber thinks that there is reason to notify, then I will just move on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is not a formal objection at this stage. When did you have your preparatory conversation with this witness when this reference to Rukundo first came up? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
It was precisely yesterday evening, Mr. President, but it was not the first meeting. There was yesterday evening the final preparation of this witness that I was informed of that incident. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
An e-mail should have been sent. 
Shall we move on? What is now your next question, please? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, Witness, to conclude on that incident, did Father Hakizimana explains the reasons why those people went or left in his presence? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I am going to formally object now, Your Honour. There has been no notification of this. This incident has not been put to any Prosecution witness, and it is unfair to both the Prosecution and anyone else. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would not let the Chamber rule on that issue. I withdraw my question and I move on to another area, simply. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. Now, the new area. Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, can you explain to the Chamber how the militia attacks on Saint Famille parish were repelled? 
@WITNESS PER: 
It was not easy at all. It needed courage. What we did when the militiamen came, they would come in a group and at the risk of our lives, we tried -- we would try to talk to their leader because each group that came had a leader. Thereafter, asking to know the leader of the group, we would try to talk with him, and it was to the leader that we talked. We asked them -- we asked him what brought them there. Then he would say we were harbouring Tutsis, or specifically the term used was Ibyitso or accomplices. 
After listening to their grievances, we would tell them that the person they were looking for -- because they would come with specific names of persons, we would tell them that the person was not there, we'd never taken them in. Then they would protest and say, if we don't see the person, we will cause havoc. But most of them when they came, they came to ask for something, but in the face of our resistance, they would tell us, "We cannot live without something". And often we would realise that they were hungry because foodstuff was scarce in the capital. So, in return, to make them leave without causing havoc because we didn't know the kind of havoc they would cause -- so to prevent them from shooting on somebody, we proposed to them foodstuffs, money or some other such things, flour, rice, then they would leave while promising us that they would come back. It was a constant battle. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, please, try to be a bit more concise and brief in your answers. Don't get into the details; just answer briefly so that we can gain time. 
@WITNESS PER: 
I do promise. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you talk about "we" or "us", who are you referring to, to your own self or to some other persons with whom you talked to these militiamen? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. At Sainte Famille there was **********************************************, that is why I am talking about us. At Saint Paul there was ********************************. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you mentioned a wide scale attack at the Sainte Famille parish. Can you recall the date on which that attack took place? 
@WITNESS PER: 
It was on 18th June 1994 -- 17th June 1994. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction from the booth, please.
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you briefly explain the circumstances under which the attack took place? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The origin of the attack was at the Saint Paul national centre the day before, the eve. In the night of the 16th to the 17th there was an RPF attack on Saint Paul. In the morning the militiamen came, arrived at Saint Paul's and they found that the RPF had already left with the people that they had freed, or let's say, the people they had taken from Saint Paul and enraged as they looted the whole centre, they wrecked that place and then they withdrew. 
Sometime later they went to vent their wrath, vent their wrath, if I might express myself thus, on the people who were at the Holy Family parish. 
May I continue? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
We will continue, Witness, but I should like some clarification, a few small clarifications. Where were you when the militiamen arrived at Saint Paul and at what time did they arrive, if you recollect? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I was in the kitchen at Saint Paul, the priests' kitchen, and next door there was a storeroom, that is where I was. In the morning at about 6 a.m., I exited to see what was happening, what was going on at Saint Paul's. I opened the small gate, I spoke of before, and then I saw the militiamen who were scurrying around, some were opening the containers we used as we saw, each one was carrying off what he could lay his hands on. They were really enraged. They were mad with rage. I am using the term on purpose. They were excoriating the RPF and all the people who were at Saint Paul's. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have answered the question "Where were you?" Here comes the next question by Judge Egorov. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, this is a matter of clarification. You mentioned attack made by RPF, what do you mean? Did they kill anybody and were there some victims and so on? 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes, there were victims. In that attack during the night when everybody was running around, lost and confused, the RPF succeeded in liberating -- because they had come to liberate the Tutsis who were at Saint Paul's, and amongst those Tutsis there were some victims. And in the course of the exchange of fire the two gendarmes who were at Saint Paul -- because we had two gendarmes for our security, died in exchange of fire. Some Hutu were there, the two gendarmes were dead. Thank you.
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, Witness, you were at Saint Paul. Did you stay there watching the militiamen loot or did you leave the premises when you saw them? 
@WITNESS PER: 
In view of the situation obtaining, I could not even have stayed there one minute because if I had stayed, I am sure I would have been lynched by the militiamen. I immediately went to the Holy Family and that is where the militiamen found me, that's where I was. I fled from Saint Paul and I went next door to Holy Family next to -- next door to Munyeshyaka. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you say that's where the militiamen found you, do you mean that you left and they saw you leaving and they followed you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
No, it's because if I said they found me when I left Saint Paul -- I left them there. I fled to Holy Family. They came there, they didn't even see me. I couldn't say it was I they were chasing. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's not very clear. I am sorry. 
@WITNESS PER:
I left Saint Paul's because I thought I would be in security, I would be quiet at Sainte Famille, but perhaps that was their plan. They reacted differently. They found me where I had gone to seek refuge. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What time would you say they arrived at Holy Family, Witness? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I can't give you a precise time because for us a wristwatch had no value in everything we were doing. When they came to Holy Family, it was about 9 a.m. It was about 9:00. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Who -- how many were they, approximately, if you have any idea and who seemed to be leaving them, if you saw them coming? 
@WITNESS PER: 
When they came to Holy Family they were numerous. I did not have the time to count them because the way in which they entered the Sainte Famille, a human being who had seen what happened at Saint Paul couldn't count them. They entered as a group, a large group. When I saw them coming as everyone, everyone just sought a way of disappearing. I don't know the exact number. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What was Father Munyeshyaka's reaction, response to this arrival of the militiamen? 
@WITNESS PER: 
When the militiamen arrived, we thought that perhaps we would resist, as we usually did. Unfortunately, they were determined in view of the rage they had shown at Saint Paul. They broke in the gates with lot of strength. We, as we usually did, resisted with the gendarme who were at the 
Holy Family, even a few refugees came to help us, but when the militiamen saw -- noted that we were resisting from inside, they jumped over the gate. When Father Munyeshyaka saw that the situation was really insupportable, we couldn't resist, he went by the gate below and said, "Keep holding on, I will help you". So he went down to the gate into the vicarage or something like that. The militiamen came in and everybody scattered and he came with reinforcement, military reinforcements, soldiers as reinforcements. And when the soldiers arrived things -- they dispersed the militiamen, chased them out of the Sainte Famille -- Holy Family and stayed there and calm was restored. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How much time passed between the departure of Munyeshyaka and his return with the soldiers? 
@WITNESS PER: 
It was about 10:00 when we saw the soldiers coming, about 10:00. I did not look at my watch. We did not have time to look at our wristwatches, but when I compute the time that passed, it was 30 minutes but less than an hour. Therefore, I would say about 10 o'clock. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
The soldiers, were they also with the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I repeat, if they were with the préfet of Kigali, I would have seen him. I would have noticed. I would have looked and seen him, but I did not see him. I did not see him, he was not there. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How much time did it take the soldiers to disperse the militiamen on that morning? 
@WITNESS PER: 
As soon as the militiamen arrived, the militia saw the soldiers were stronger than they were. And I told you the militiamen were people that I would consider hooligans, and when they saw the soldiers coming, they immediately left the place. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What did you personally do after the militiamen departed? 
@WITNESS PER: 
After the departure of the militiamen the soldiers and the Red Cross began gathering the corpses because the militiamen had killed people. And I don't know how many because I did not have the time to count the dead. I personally and Munyeshyaka, we went to the refugees who were there because everybody was in a panic; people had fled, others were crying. We went to the people to give them moral assistance and asking them to go back to their respective places. Life continued as we were accustomed to it. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you come to leave Holy Family parish after that incident on the 17th of June 1994? 
@WITNESS PER: 
On 17th I stayed with Father Munyeshyaka. We continued our activities of encarding the refugees. All day I was by his side. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, can you tell us whether in the course of that day Father Munyeshyaka received a visit from the préfet of Kigali? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I think I must repeat that if the préfet of Kigali had been present where I was, I would have noticed it. That day, I repeat, I stayed back at Munyeshyaka's side. Munyeshyaka had no contact with 
Préfet Renzaho. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you have occasion to leave the parish subsequently, Witness? 
@WITNESS PER: 
On that day when I was with Munyeshyaka, we were consoling each other, trying to give each other strength. He told me, "My dear brother, you have suffered, you will go mad. You must rest. I have never seen you rest. You are going to overwork yourself", he said. And, therefore, I said, "Fine, 
good night, then I will see you tomorrow. I am leaving you with great sadness. I must go to rest a bit." And it was on the 18th that I left the capital and since I left, I have never gone back. Thank you.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Until the date of your departure, Witness, did you have any idea as to the relations that might exist between Father Munyeshyaka and the préfet of Kigali-ville, Kigali town? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Frankly, Renzaho's name never came up or any question of his relations with Munyeshyaka, all the more so since amongst the préfectoral authorities, I told -- I gave you the name of Aloys Simpunga, any time we had a problem whether at Saint Paul or at Sainte Famille -- at Holy Family, it was that 
Mr. Aloys Simpunga would come to see us. I never saw any relations between Munyeshyaka and the préfet. I never saw them together, so I cannot say there was any relation. That is what was my experience and that is what I witnessed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Let us come back a bit to the Saint Paul pastoral centre, Witness, and I would like to put the following question to you. Did you have a telephone there? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, there was a telephone line but it did not function. It was cut off at the end of April, beginning of May. Throughout May until I left Saint Paul, the telephone was not working, it was faulty. I think that is due to the fact that the electricity was off. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I want to note again for the record that that bit of information was never in the statement and never suggested to any Prosecution witness, and I want the record to note it accordingly. Thank you, 
Your Honour. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, this time I shall respond, for the record. This is an item of information that was brought up by one of the Prosecution witnesses whose name we know and whose name was mentioned here. I don't remember the pseudonym but the name is there, so I don't see how I can be prevented from dealing with this issue because of lack of notice. It was Witness KZ. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely, Your Honour, the issue which I wanted to make quite clear is that, firstly, we had no notice of this issue to be raised. Secondly, it was never suggested to KZ that the telephone at Saint Paul's was not working from some time in early May onwards, which Your Honours, having no doubt recalling KZ's evidence, is a fairly important feature which was never put to him or suggested to him that the telephone wasn't working at Saint Paul's. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have not used the word "objection", Mr. Moses, in this regard. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The answer being given now, Your Honour, I wasn't aware of it. I am simply now saying I want the objection noted to the question and answer and certainly I would be objecting to any further questions. It is pointless objecting now that the answer has been given, but it's there, but I want the record to note. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted. 
Shall we move on? 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, on this point my only purpose is to know whether while the phone was working you had an opportunity to use it or to call any authority whatsoever? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the Chamber wants to rule on (inaudible) 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Court reporter, did you hear what the President said? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The entire Bench is of the view that this should have been communicated to the Prosecution. We also are of the opinion that this matter should have been raised with the witness that testified to this previously, Witness KZ. The question now is the legal consequence to be drawn from the fact that these two requirements were not complied with by the Defence. This is a borderline issue. 
Two Judges will allow the question and take into consideration that this was not put to the previous witness in connection with its general credibility assessments and overall weighing of the evidence. And it is also noted that it is always a possibility to recall a previous witness. One judge would vote for exclusion of the evidence. So that is the situation and you are allowed to ask that last question, 
Mr. Nekuie, but then we want you to move on. 
@MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when the phone was working, and you said that it worked until about the end of April, did you personally or did Father Hakizimana use the phone to call for help from any authorities at all? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. We never used that telephone when it was working to call for help from the authorities because the attacks -- the incursions I have mentioned, we managed to repulse without having recourse to the authorities. I do not see why we would call the authorities when we managed on our own. Moreover, to call the authorities, one would -- must have a purpose, a reason. Of course, well, Simpunga, Aloys, the sous-préfet, came to see us regularly. He came, he would see if there was a problem. When we had a problem, we would tell him. He would go off and he would come back with a solution, especially for medicine, for food, for provisions and for water. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness, you have answered my question. 
I should now like to speak to you of acts of sexual violence, sexual assault. Did you see any cases of rape while you were at Saint Paul? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And we look forward to hearing your answer to that question after the lunch break and we will start at 3:05, five minutes past three. 
What is approximately the duration of the examination-in-chief, Mr. Nekuie, approximately? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
I don't think I will take more than a quarter of an hour, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is why we thought we could have two hours lunch break today. The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed at 1308H) 
$(Pages 33 to 43 by Sithembiso Moyo)
$(Court resumed at 1505H) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon. 
Prosecution? 
No, you had 15 minutes left, you said, or maybe 20. Please go ahead; you're right. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. Thank you. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when we adjourned for lunch we were dealing with the matter of the rapes, and my question was as follows: Did you observe any cases of rapes at the Saint Paul pastoral centre throughout that period? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. During the time when I was at Saint Paul and at Sainte Famille I never witnessed or heard of any rape. The situation which we were, the infrastructures, the people who were there, I believe such things could not occur. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. But, Witness, when referring to Sainte Famille, you indicated that there were so many refugees that, to your mind, there were around 18,000 people. Do you believe, given the large number of people, that you could know whether there were cases of rapes or not? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. In view of the number of people who were there, I wish to confirm to you that there could not be any rapes. I moved around -- what I used to do was that I moved around amongst the refugees to determine what their problems were. You can imagine, if you have 18,000 people in a small centre, they were like ants. They were on top of one another. 
And since people were grouped along with their families, when somebody would go to the toilet, he would be accompanied by another member of his family, because the infrastructures that were available at Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, especially for the toilets were simply holes that had been dug in the ground, and the walls of which were made up of branches of pine trees, and the separation between the different toilets were made of branches. So they were makeshift toilets, Turkish toilets as they are called, and there were no doors to close them. So, as you can imagine, 18,000 people who would have to go to the toilet, people would queue up, and the -- as children in front of a school. The toilets inside the building were not being used, and that is why we had built the toilets outside, so it was impossible to have any cases of rapes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness, for your clarifications. 
Witness, last question: You referred to two gendarmes who were posted at Saint Paul and who were killed. Were there gendarmes or not at Sainte Famille? And if your answer is in the affirmative, from when were they posted there? 
@WITNESS PER: 
There were five gendarmes at Sainte Famille, if I'm not mistaken. I believe there were five of them. It was a small group. I went to Sainte Famille from the 10th onwards, as I stated previously. When I went there, I saw the gendarmes I referred to. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Are you referring to the 10th of April or to the 10th of any other month? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The 10th of April. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honour -- Your Honours, this marks the end of the examination-in-chief of this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, do you accept that there was a genocide in Rwanda of the Tutsi ethnic group between April and July 1994? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, as far as I'm concerned I do not accept that there was a genocide of the Tutsi. Let me be more explicit: I accept that there were interethnic killings which took place on a spontaneous basis, but as to say that there was a genocide, I believe this is simply politics and has nothing to do with the truth. I was in the country throughout the war. People died, that is true, and I regret the fact that there were deaths, be it on the side of the Tutsis or of the Hutus. People died because they belonged to a specific ethnic group. As far as I'm concerned, I would call what happened interethnic killings. Thank you -- and I take full responsibility for what I'm stating. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Good. So as far as you concerned, no one is guilty of genocide because there was no genocide in Rwanda during April to July 1994. That's a fair suggestion, isn't it, as far as you're concerned? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. I said previously that there were interethnic killings. If there are people who are guilty, they can be found on both sides. And I believe the responsibility is shared. And I'm quite surprised -- since we are here to speak the truth, I'm surprised to note that one side is considered as being guilty and the other as innocent. Of course, this is a matter to be dealt with by justice. But we are outside the system, and this is what we note, and which we regret. And I wish to say that the Tribunal is biased, and this is a question I've been wondering about ever since it was set up. I apologise for telling you the truth. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, thank you for that also. But, in answer to my question, if there was no genocide, no one could be guilty of genocide, from your point of view; isn't that your position? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, that is my position. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is this your first visit to Arusha, Witness? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, indeed, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And so therefore you have never heard live testimony of any witness who has testified and been examined and cross-examined in this court, have you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
No, I never met anyone. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Not only did you never meet anyone, Witness, you never heard any such evidence, did you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Monsieur le procureur -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, Witness, before you go on, would you agree -- it's a yes or no answer; have you heard anyone or not? I take it from the fact that you've not been in Arusha, the answer's no. Would you confirm that? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I never heard anyone testify. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And despite not having the benefit that Their Honours have of listening to witnesses in determining which are telling the truth and which are lying, you were prepared, in a statement you provided to the Defence, to say this, didn't you: 
"I note that the ICTR practices restricted justice. It makes up culprits, judges and condemns innocent people under false evidence, and fabricated (sic) charges." 
That's the statement you made for the Defence, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, and I had told you previously that I had never heard anyone testify. If it -- this is what I've been able to see on the internet using modern means of communication. I read newspapers, as anybody else. But as for having heard anyone testify, I confirm that I never heard anyone testify. But I do read newspapers and I follow what's in the news, thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, firstly, do you agree that's the statement that you provided to the Defence, yes or no, what I read out to you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
That was my statement. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And do I understand from your evidence-in-chief, according to you, you saw this Accused only once between April and July 1994, and that was on the 16th of June 1994? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, I saw him, even though I did not speak with him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you have a personal relationship with the Accused prior to April 1994? Did you know him personally? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I knew him in his capacity as an official because I lived in his préfecture, the one he headed. But I never had any personal contacts with him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That didn't stop you, however, did it, Witness, in making this statement to the Defence in your statement: "The charges carried against Renzaho and Wenceslas are instruments of revenge which camouflage the real truth." That's what you said to the Defence, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you also said to the Defence: "The false charges carried against Renzaho and Wenceslas are the fruits of a political machination which aims at demonising innocent people." You also said that in your statement, didn't you? Yes or no? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you have provided for the Trial Chamber a map with some roadblocks shown. Do you agree, Witness, that there was also a roadblock in the middle of May, manned by militia, that was in the compound of Sainte Famille church, outside the main door? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, the roadblocks that I set up were those where we were passing through. If the militiamen set up a roadblock, where was -- could you please remind me of the location of the roadblock you referred to? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It was inside the compound of Sainte Famille church. Beside the church. We're talking about a period in mid-May. Do you remember seeing such a barrier there? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The roadblock that was next to Sainte Famille church was a roadblock that was manned jointly by the militiamen who were on the OAU Boulevard which led to Sainte Famille. When one was at Saint Paul, one could see that roadblock with the militiamen. So it is the same roadblock that I indicated. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, the map that you provided to the Trial Chamber indicated a roadblock on the main road. I'm not talking about a roadblock on the main road; I'm talking about a barrier inside the compound of Sainte Famille. Do you agree that there was such a barrier there in mid-May, at least? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Let me repeat that the roadblock that I drew, I was not able to separate the two roadblocks. The roadblock you're referring to is the one that was at the entrance of Sister Abizeramariya on the road leading to Saint Paul, Sainte Famille, and Kinyamateka. It was at that junction, which I did not separate on the map I gave. It was behind the brasserie kiosk, as I explained previously. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I think there were a number of words used. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we need the spelling of these names. 
Now, the entrance of Sister who, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Abizeramariya. A-B-I-Z-E-R-A-M-A-R-I-Y-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this word, Abizeramariya, is in one word? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, in one word. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Then this road led to Saint Paul, Sainte Famille, and the third location. Can you repeat the third location, please? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Kinyamateka. Can I spell it out? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please. 
@WITNESS PER: 
K-I-N-Y-A-M-A-T-E-K-A. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then you said you were behind a kiosk. How did you identify that kiosk? I think it was a French expression? 
@WITNESS PER: 
It was the kiosk that the breweries would place in different locations, so it was the kiosk of the brewery. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, so what is -- what, was it -- did you say Bralirwa or did you use another expression? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The brewery was the plant that was in Kicukiro, and which produced lemonade. Bralirwa would produce beer. The brewery was in the town; some of the shops only sold lemonade. So it was different. So the brewery and Bralirwa are two different things. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you used the word brasserie, maybe? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, I used the word brasserie, in French, which means brewery, instead of Bralirwa. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. Those were the words, I think. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.

@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, how many priests were there at Saint Paul's during the April to June period? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The -- there were many. There's a long list, but if you so wish, let me give you a list of the priests from the 6th of April onwards. Very well, let me give you the name of the resident priests. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I don't even need that, Witness. I just need the number. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Okay. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
"Very well", says the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the number is? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I am trying to think, because there were many priests who had also sought refuge there. There was the parish priest with his vicar -- the parish priest of Sainte Famille. 
I wish to apologise, Mr. President, but the -- there are some of them who left during the events, so it is not easy to know how many there are. Perhaps I should tell you how many priests passed through Saint Paul's. Because many left during the course of the events and I did not count them all. Do you want me to give you the names? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What I want you to do now is simply to be silent for a moment and think, and then come up with a number. Will you do that, please? Because we don't need your reflection process, we need the result. Please help us. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Oui. 
Mr. President, please, could I be given a specific time frame between which-and-which date, because it's difficult to provide an answer to the question. There were priests who were there, as I stated, there was a delegation of bishops, the bishops left at some stage, the others left afterwards, the director left, he was evacuated -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Witness, don't make -- use so many words. We understand that you want a time frame. That's enough. Now the Prosecutor will offer you a time frame. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Very well. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
How many were -- priests were there, say, on the 10th of April -- approximately? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Around 10 priests. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And how many priests were there as at the 17th of June? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The same 10 priests, approximately. 
@MR. MOSES: 
One of those priests was Father Paulin -- spelt P-A-U-L-I-N -- Munyazikwiye -- spelt M-U-N-Y-A-Z-I-K-W-I-Y-E -- correct? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And as at the 10th of April, how many priests were there at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS PER: 
On the 10th of April there was only one priest, Father Munyeshyaka, Wenceslas. His parish priests had sought refuge at Saint Paul's. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And on the 17th of June, how many priests were there at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS PER: 
There was one priest, Munyeshyaka, Wenceslas, because the other priests would spend their days and their nights at Saint Paul's. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, we'll move on to your days and nights, Witness. You've told the Trial Chamber that you would go from Saint Paul to Sainte Famille at around 10 or 11 in the morning. And how long did you remain at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I would spend almost the whole afternoon in Sainte Famille, and it would depend on the activities I was to carry out there. I cannot tell you precisely that I would go there at 10 and I would go back at 3 or 4. When there were a number of activities I was to help Munyeshyaka with, I would remain there until it was time for me to go back home to go to bed. So I must say that I did not keep the time exactly. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You'll agree with me that you were sleeping at the Saint Paul's centre, weren't you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you agree with me that when you weren't at Saint -- I'll rephrase the question. Father Munyeshyaka was often the only priest at Sainte Famille, wasn't he? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you've told us that there were a large number of refugees at Sainte Famille, a number I think you've estimated at 18,000. And it was a large compound, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The compound was not large, it was quite small, and there was not enough space. And this is why I told you that people were piled up like bricks or ants. Thank you. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, what do you mean saying a "small" compound? What were approximately -- was the size of this compound, Saint Paul and Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I was saying that it was small in view of the number of people who were there. I cannot give you the size of that plot because I am not a surveyor. But what I can tell you is that it was quite small as compared to the number of people who were staying there. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And, bearing in mind, Witness, that you weren't at Sainte Famille all the time, to be fair, you can't say what Wenceslas Munyeshyaka or anyone else at Sainte Famille was doing all the time, can you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Well, I am not God in order to be omnipresent, Counsel for the Prosecution. I cannot be aware of what he was doing in my absence. But on the issue of rapes on which you put questions to me, let me tell you that there are some things that cannot be hidden, especially those that you are referring to. Besides, let me tell you that the atmosphere there, in light of the situation and the experience of people, I do not believe anyone would have thought of having intercourse. 
So let me please continue, because this is an interesting subject, Counsel for the Prosecution. You should imagine under what stress we were, and as human beings, for it to -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Sorry to interrupt you, but the point is I asked -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Listen. You have to slow down, Mr. Witness. And here comes the continuation of the question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, just to make it quite clear, I asked no question about rapes. You're the one who have raised it rather quickly in your answer. But we'll move on. 
Now, in respect of your time at Saint Paul's, do you recall in April members of the population and Interahamwe coming and cutting down banana trees and other bushes in the compound? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. Regarding the people who allegedly came to cut the banana trees, they were not only militiamen, because if the banana trees were cut it was for a matter linked to security. Since the militiamen were saying that there were too many bushes, it was necessary to clear the bushes. If the militiamen cleared the bushes and the banana trees, do you believe they would leave the Tutsis who were there? We had to cut the bushes following a request by the militiamen, because we did not want the militiamen to enter the bushes. And they were outside, they were observing us to make sure that the orders would be complied with, because if we had not done it ourselves, they would have come in and cut the bushes. And you can imagine what would have occurred. Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, in answer to my question, it was really "yes", you do recall that happening. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And on that same day, in fact, some seven men were taken away and not seen again; isn't that correct? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Well, I cannot answer you in the affirmative; that is not correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is that something which might have happened while you were elsewhere? 
@WITNESS PER: 
At the beginning I told you that I would shuttle between Saint Paul's and Sainte Famille. When I saw that the banana trees were being cut, I understood -- I was told why they were being cut, and it seemed logical to me. But as to say that there were people who were taken away in front of me, my answer cannot be yes because I did not witness such an event. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And do you recall at around the beginning of May -- actually, I'll rephrase that. Did soldiers from the Muvumba -- spelt M-U-V-U-M-B-A -- battalion launch an attack at Saint Paul's? Or come to Saint Paul's, for that matter? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, when I came here, I swore that I would speak the truth and nothing but the truth, and I would speak about what I was an eyewitness to. I told you that I would shuttle between Saint Paul's and Sainte Famille. If the soldiers came during my absence, I am not in a position to answer your question. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, were you present at Saint Paul's on the 14th of June when gendarmes and militia came with a list of people, and some perhaps 30 or 40 men were taken away from Saint Paul's and killed? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. As regards the events of the 14th of June, I was in Gitarama. On the 13th, in the morning, some members of my family -- because I had a member of my family who was hospitalised in Kigali and who was -- and then the war broke out. On the 13th, since matters were getting worse, I was asked to accompany them to Gitarama. I went to Gitarama and I came back on the 14th in the afternoon. When I arrived in Runda around 6 p.m., there was a curfew so that I was not able to cross the Nyabarongo river, so I slept in Runda, and I came back on the 15th in the early morning. So I arrived in Kigali on the 15th. So on the 14th I was not in Kigali. I wish you to take note of that, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slow down, Mr. Witness. It's too fast. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Very well. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And your evidence this morning was that in the early hours of the 17th of June in the morning, you fled from Saint Paul's to Sainte Famille. That's correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS PER: 
That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you weren't with Father Paulin and Father Célestin on that morning, were you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The 14th I was not in Kigali. That's what I said, the 14th. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm talking about the morning of the 17th. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Mr. Prosecutor, follow the chronology of the dates. I repeat: On the 13th -- in the day of the 13th -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry to stop you, Witness. I wonder if there is a -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is there a difference, Your Honour, between the English and the French? If there is not -- 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
-- I will repeat my question a third time, Witness. I'm talking about a morning of the 17th of June. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you at Saint Paul's or were you still in Gitarama then? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I remember that on the 17th of June, it was the day where the militiamen attacked Sainte Famille, so I was in Kigali. And I have to be specific. The RPF attacked Saint Paul in the night of the 16 to the 17th. I'd already returned to Kigali because I returned from Gitarama on the 15th, continuing on my activities. And then the night, from the 16th to the 17th the RPF attacked Saint Paul, and on the 17th the militia -- militiamen attacked Sainte Famille. And I was there for those events. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we will backtrack for a moment. 
You gave an overview, Mr. Witness, of what you did the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th of June. And there was a curfew when you arrived at a certain place around 6 p.m. What was the name of that place? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Runda, R-U-N-D-A. It's on -- just outside of town. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And backtracking again, you had confirmed your earlier evidence that you had fled from Saint Paul to Sainte Famille early that morning; isn't that correct? 
@WITNESS PER: 
On the 17th, in the morning, yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So after you went to Sainte Famille, you weren't with Father Célestin and Father Paulin, were you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
In the morning of the 17th there was complete chaos. Saint Paul no longer existed. There was no one at Saint Paul. Father Hakizimana, Célestin, fled to Saint Michel cathedral, which was at the top of the hill on the plateau, next to PVK -- PVK. There he found his co-religionists (sic), Kabagazi (phonetic), Jean Pierre, his co-clergymen. And Paulin had not returned to Saint Paul. We did not -- our paths did not cross again. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Please, please, Witness, could you just answer the questions that are put to you without volunteering other information? 
You already told us in your evidence-in-chief that Saint Paul was attacked at 6 a.m. on the 17th. And because of the way the people were aggressive, you fled -- 
@WITNESS PER: 
Non. Non, non. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
That's not what you said, that you fled and went to Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS PER: 
When you speak of attacker...(microphones overlapping). 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
$(Microphones overlapping) Saint Paul. The militia came and were looting around 6 in the morning, and you were in the fathers' kitchen. And because of the way they were aggressive, you ran away and went to Sainte Famille. Was that your evidence, or not, this morning? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, but the -- 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Just listen to me, please. Is it yes or no? Is that what you said? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Oui. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Okay, so if that is what you said and you were not there, you had gone to Sainte Famille, how would you know where Father Célestin was after you had left, to know that he went to a hill at the second place? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Let me answer. 
What was I supposed to do on the morning of the 17th? We were wondering, where's so-and-so, where is this one or where is that one? And that's when Father Munyeshyaka, who kept his co-clergymen, he told me, "He is with" -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry, I didn't get the name. 
@WITNESS PER: 
-- "he's there at Saint Michel". We had to inform each other. That's how we knew. But when they attacked, it was complete chaos. Everyone -- every man for himself. On the morning on the 17th we were wondering, where is who and what, and that's what I did. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You mentioned a name with whom Father Munyeshyaka was together. Can you repeat that name? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Munyeshyaka or Hakizimana? Which one? Could you please tell me which person? Father Munyeshyaka or Father Célestin? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, if you could just listen. I will repeat my question. I will read out, word for word, what I just asked you: 
You mentioned a name with whom Father Munyeshyaka was together. Can you please repeat that name? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I didn't mention Father Munyeshyaka, I mentioned Father Hakizimana. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You only mentioned one name, and that was Father Hakizimana? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Oh, sorry, yes. I said Father Munyeshyaka had -- during the RPF raid, Father Munyeshyaka managed to hide his -- Father Anaclet Mwumvaneza, his deacon. He had taken refuge at Saint Paul. During the RPF attack, everyone ran away. Father Munyeshyaka managed -- I don't know how he did it, but he managed to save his deacon.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Let us say, for want of a better word. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
See, you did mention another name, and now we understood that the first name of that other person was Anaclet; was that so? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, please spell that first name first, and then his last name afterwards, and then we can proceed. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Anaclet is spelt A-N-A-C-L-E-T. And his -- his other name is -- surname M-W-U-M-V-A-N-E-Z-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was very helpful, thank you. Here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
This morning, Witness, you had said, when the militia arrived on that day at Sainte Famille, everyone sought a way of disappearing. Where did you disappear to, Witness? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Thank you. When the militiamen came, I was with Munyeshyaka at the presbytery with other people. We were discussing what had happened at Saint Paul's. Me, when the militiamen came, I stayed there, Munyeshyaka left, and I stayed with the people at the Sainte Famille presbytery. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay, thank you for that. And how long did you remain at the presbytery for? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I told you that I stayed at Sainte Famille until the morning of the 18th. So I stayed with Father Munyeshyaka at the presbytery, and I remind you that it wasn't different from where the people were. Even in the priests' bedroom there were people. So there was no difference between the presbytery, the church, the courtyard; they were all full of people. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, well, we've heard about people being in the priests' bedroom, but we'll come to that later. 
On the 17th of June, Witness, in the morning when the militia attacked, do I understand from your evidence that you went to the presbytery? 
@WITNESS PER: 
When we speak of Sainte Famille, it's the presbytery that comes to mind first of all. That's where I went because I had to join Munyeshyaka. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So from the time the militia arrived until the end of the attack, you were in presbytery; is that what we're to understand? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes, I was hidden in the presbytery. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. On the 17th of June, did you see any officials with the militia and others who were taking part in that attack? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I did say a while back that the militiamen for me were hooligans, and when I saw the militiamen there was no figure of authority. There was no figure of authority; it was only the militiamen. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, without wanting to contradict you too strongly, Witness, this morning you in fact said that they did have some leaders, and in fact you mentioned Angeline and Odette. My question is: Did you see Angeline or Odette at Sainte Famille on the 17th of June? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, before the witness answers, I should like the Prosecutor to repeat exactly what the witness said. The witness did not say this morning that the militiamen were in Angelina's company. It wasn't in the context of the 17th that he mentioned Angelina. We must reflect accurately what the witness has stated. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The record will speak for itself. Now we are interested in the answer to this question. 
Can you answer? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I told you that the militiamen were young. When they attacked the Saint Paul, they said -- when they came to look for Rukundo, they said -- I asked him, "What are you doing?" And they said, "If we are sent by such-and-such a" --

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can't you listen to the questions? Now, I will read out the question as it was posed. "My question is", said the Prosecutor "did you see Angeline or Odette at Sainte Famille on the 17th of June?" Now, that calls for a yes or no answer.

@WITNESS PER: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And how many times did you meet with the Defence since you have been in Arusha? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Three times. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, as we understand it, the first time you've ever mentioned anything about the telephone in 
Saint Paul's was on the last occasion last night, is that correct? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What was the telephone number, do you recall, for Saint Paul's? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Unfortunately, I do not recall. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you remember that it began with the prefix 7, or not? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Well, it would be like any other Kigali number. I can't remember. I've forgotten everything in respect to telephones. I do not attach importance to it. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And we've heard from a number of witnesses, both for the Prosecution and the Defence, that throughout the period of April to June and July there were no problems with the telephone numbers that commenced -- parts of Kigali which commenced with the number 7, but there were problems at some stage with numbers that commenced with the number 8; do you agree with that or not? Or didn't you use the telephone? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I will not comment on what other witnesses have told you; what they say commits them. I tell you what I experienced, what I lived through, what I know. That's their problem. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, but the question is whether you recognise, based on your own experience, that there was a difference between phone numbers commencing with 7 or 8; do you have any knowledge of that? Or is your answer, "I do not know"? 
@WITNESS PER:
I did not check that because I didn't call. During the war, I didn't telephone. I didn't need to telephone. If there was a problem it concerns those who used the telephone. I cannot speak on that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You didn't use the phone for 100 days, that is your evidence?

You would've been the very last person anyone would've confided in on such a sensitive matter, wouldn't you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I'm sorry, I did not understand the translation. I couldn't follow. 
@MR. MOSES: 
As -- as someone who was seen as a close associate of Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, I am suggesting to you that victims would have seen you as one of the last persons to confide in if they had been sexually violated by Father Wenceslas, or anyone else, because you were seen as an associate of his? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Mr. Prosecutor, the work we were doing was not the work of authority. It was humanitarian. It was apostolic. We were not there to order people around. We were there to help them, just as the 
Red Cross did. So, if there was a problem we should've known it. Some things cannot be in (sic). And when you speak of rapes or sexual assaults, well, I really wonder myself what about that. Who is speaking about that? Rape, how, where, when? People speaking of that have another mission, another task. That's why they know, they speak of that. For me, I banish that from my mind. It never existed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, I have no further questions of this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Re-examination? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, just a few matters of clarification. 
##
$RE-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, when you met Mr. Renzaho's Defence team, did you give them a statement written by -- in your own hand and signed? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness asks, "What was the question?" 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you met members of Mr. Renzaho's Defence team, did you give that person -- of course, it was me -- a statement written and signed by yourself, written by your own hand and signed? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yeah, I sent it by email. I sent it by email, the statement you have before you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Please listen to the question: At the time we physically met did you hand over to the Defence team a statement written in your own hand and signed? 
@WITNESS PER: 
No. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When did you give Renzaho's Defence a written statement and signed? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I sent it by email. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Do you remember the date or the period when you did it? 
@WITNESS PER: 
I do not remember the date, forgive me. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
In your view, how many days have elapsed since you did that and today? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Not quite two weeks. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for that clarification, Witness. 
Witness, the last clarification: You spoke of a banana plantation -- or banana grove -- banana groves that were cut down in the perimeter of Sainte Famille, and you said that it was on the orders of the militiamen. But you seemed to say that it was other people who were cutting down the banana trees, did I correctly understand you? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Yes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Can you tell us -- can you tell the Trial Chamber who were those other people? 
@WITNESS PER: 
The militiamen thought that RPF soldiers might hide there. So they said, "We're coming. We want to cut that." We thought it was a way of infiltrating of getting in Saint Paul where there were the refugees that the militiamen were looking for. So we told them we will do that ourselves and we and the men who were there, went and cut them down. So it wasn't the militiamen who came in and we took in -- we took the opportunity to clean up all round Saint Paul. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, but I should like it to be really clear. You say we took the men, which men? 
@WITNESS PER: 
We took the men. We did it. We took the men who had sought refuge with us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are very fast in your exchanges now. You are not observing the pause. It is a miracle that we get this interpreted and transcribed. That shows the quality of everyone in the courtroom. But do you have to give us all these challenges? Can't you relax and slow down? 
Now here comes the question. Mr. Nekuie? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, in fact, that was my last question. I wanted him to be specific about which men did it. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Can you repeat, Witness? 
@WITNESS PER: 
Well, as a matter of security within Saint Paul, we did not want someone else to enter the enclosure of our centre, because we were afraid that if the militiamen, whom we didn't want to succeed -- succeeded into getting into the enclosure, they would do what they were really coming for. We thought it might be a way of entering peacefully.
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Forgive me for interrupting you. Just tell us who were the men who did that work? 
@WITNESS PER: 
We chose among the refugees the able-bodied, robust men who helped us to clear the bush. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I think I will conclude my re-examination-in-chief at this point. 
Thank you, Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. Witness, have you heard the name Hyacinthe Rwanga? H-Y-A-C-I-N-T-H-E, R-W-A-N-G-A. 
@WITNESS PER:
No, names did not concern me. I was not interested in names. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you ever meet anyone called Nyiratunga? 
@WITNESS PER:
Could you try pronouncing that again, please? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness, is asking for the name to be pronounced clearly, sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Nyiratunga. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, the pronunciation must be incorrect. 
@WITNESS PER: 
Is it Nyiratenga or Nyiratunga? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't you answer in the alternative? Do you know any of those two names?
@WITNESS PER:
I don't know Nyiratenga. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know anyone called Nyiratunga? 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who was that? 
@WITNESS PER:
I know her because she was a Christian at Sainte Famille. We'd often perform the mass together and she lived in Rugenge secteur. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ever met anyone called Mukangira? M-U-K-A-N-G-I-R-A. 
@WITNESS PER:
No, that name does not strike a bell. I don't know her. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know anyone called Mukamuyango? M-U-K-A-M-U-Y-A-N-G-O. 
@WITNESS PER:
No, I don't know her either. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, did you at any point see soldiers at Sainte Famille in May 1994? 
@WITNESS PER:
No, I did not see soldiers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was there a place called the French complex? 
@WITNESS PER:
No, there was the French cultural centre, but not French complex at the time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This French cultural centre, how far away was that from Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS PER:
Stone's throw, a stone's throw, just a bit higher up, at the roundabout. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Behind a church maybe? 
@WITNESS PER:
No, at the corner of OAU Boulevard, and the road going to the Mille Collines. So it was facing, facing the roundabout. It was facing the roundabout. Can I be more precise? Can I? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let me ask you about the place you are talking about. Was that in the Kiyovu neighbourhood? 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
About five minutes walking distance from Sainte Famille church, approximately? 
@WITNESS PER:
No, the French cultural centre was only a few metres from Sainte Famille. There was only a road really separating them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But it was outside the Sainte Famille complex, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes, yes, outside the perimeter -- enclosure of Sainte Famille. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you know Major Nsabimana? N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A. 
@WITNESS PER:
I did not know him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you know where he lived? His residence? 
@WITNESS PER:
Nor did I know that. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, isn't it normal that seminarians in the higher seminary live in whole (sic) cells in the seminary? Or you don't have that in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS PER: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So, you were living at Saint Paul, but you only went to Sainte Famille to render assistance periodically. According to your statement, you were living in Saint Paul but you went to Sainte Famille periodically to render assistance periodically to Father Wenceslas, is that correct? 
@WITNESS PER:
I went to assist Wenceslas only during the war period. I would usually remain in Saint Paul's. It was during the war that I went to assist him. Thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So at no time did you live with the préfet of Kigali? Did you ever live with the préfet of Kigali? Yes or no, and then I will ask the next question. Did you ever live with the Defendant in this case? 
@WITNESS PER:
I stated previously that I had had no contact whatsoever with the préfet of Kigali, thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So how then do you explain the statement you made before us, that Renzaho had never met 
Odette and Angeline? How do you know -- how did you know he had never met them when you were not staying with him and knew nothing about him? 
@WITNESS PER:
My answer is based on what I saw and what I witnessed. I cannot say that I saw Renzaho with Angeline. I cannot state either they were in contact when I never saw such a thing. When I say I saw something, it means I was an eyewitness to an event. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
You also said in your statement that Father Wenceslas was a very good man, and because he was so popular other priests were envious of him, jealous of him. Do you maintain that? That other 
Catholic priests were jealous of another priest because he was popular? 
@WITNESS PER:
I said so for a reason. I lived amongst the priests for a while and I know how they live. If I said that they were envious, well, it depends on the period I was referring to. And I made such a statement because I knew them. Otherwise how can one say that the parish priest fled the parish? And subsequently I lived with him and I would hear what he would say because he was envious of his priest who was popular. This is a popularity that the priest did not have. I can confirm that. I lived with the priests and I know him. Thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
This priest who was not popular with Father Wenceslas was a Tutsi priest, wasn't he? Was he a 
Tutsi priest or not? 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes, he was a Tutsi. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, you mentioned that Saint Paul compound was separated from this Sainte Famille compound by a wall, is it correct? 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes, and I did specify that there was small -- two small gates in order to make passage from one to the other easier, thank you. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Am I correct believing that the person who is in Saint Paul compound can't see what is going on in Sainte Famille compound? 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes, indeed. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
What, approximately, was the length of this wall separating the two compounds? Approximately? 
100 metres, less or more? 
@WITNESS PER:
Not less, but perhaps 100 metres because when one talks about Sainte Famille -- let me say that when one refers to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, Sainte Famille was housing many of the services of the church. There were the sisters, there was the headquarters of the congregation, and there was also the bursar's office. So all these things were within the compound of Sainte Famille, so it was large and the wall was more than 100 metres long. Thank you. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Let me ask you if it is possible for you to explain to me whether it was possible for a person who was in one side of the Sainte Famille compound to see and to know what was going on in the other side of the compound? Were there any abstracts? 
@WITNESS PER:
It was not possible to see what was happening on the other side because the wall was made of bricks, so the wall was not transparent. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
No, I am talking about the same compound for a person who was, say, in the Saint Paul -- 
Sainte Famille compound, on one side of this compound, could he observe the situation in another part, in a different -- in the opposite part of the compound of the same compound? 
@WITNESS PER:
Yes, it was possible. There was an open courtyard, so one could see what was happening. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
And the church itself, was it in the middle of the compound or closer to a certain wall or side? 
@WITNESS PER:
The church was in the upper part and on the other side of the church, towards the bursar's office, there was the courtyard I was referring to, where there was a small garden. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you see Odette on the 17th of June? 
@WITNESS PER:
No. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, Your Honour, it's a matter of witness protection. The answer that the witness first gave to, I think, Judge Arrey's first question -- there's nothing wrong with the question, it was the answer. I think the witness gave information which may lead to his identification. I stand corrected, but when he was answering the question I think he volunteered some information which -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will probably, since it is a matter of context, place the entire answer under seal. Thank you for drawing our attention to this. 
Just a moment. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, your microphone. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. That was the end of your testimony. Thank you for coming the long way to Arusha to testify. In case you want to meet with Mr. Renzaho, you can just mention that to the witness protection unit and they will then arrange for such a visit. Thank you. 
@WITNESS PER:
Thank you. I should -- yes, I should like to visit. 
$(Witness excused) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this was the last witness mentioned on the witness list for this week as originally planned. 
Before we discuss what to do in the hours and days to come, I just want to make sure that the Prosecution has received this document the Chamber wanted concerning the missing information in connection with Witness TOA; have you received it? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Apparently. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We just want to make sure that you have received it and then you can reflect on this and we would raise it next week. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I haven't looked at the document, but it has been received. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
You have scheduled Mr. Renzaho from the 27th to the 31st of August, Defence? It is Thursday today. What is your view? 
$(Pages 57 to 65 by Melissa Hook) 
1640H
@MR. NEKUIE:
We maintain this timeframe, Mr. President. We would wish for the witness to testify from the dates we provided and, by our estimate -- by the dates indicated, the witness will have finalised his testimony. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are in no hurry when it comes to this segment. What we are, in reality, discussing now is whether we should insist that he starts tomorrow, on Friday, or whether we should stick to your Monday proposal. 
And the Bench would be inclined to follow your proposal. And it will start on Monday, the 27th, which also gives time for everyone to work in the days to come until Monday. 
Shall we agree on that proposal? That seems to meet the consent of everyone.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President. The Accused also wished to devote this weekend to his further preparation, so it is our wish that the initial proposal be retained, if this is agreeable to all.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
All right. But then we will simply meet at 8:45 on Monday morning. There will be no court session tomorrow.
The Court is adjourned.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning. The Court is in session. 
Before hearing the testimony of Mr. Renzaho, I want to ask the Defence whether you want to tender as an exhibit the sketch drawn by Witness PER on Friday. I'm not sure that was exhibited. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. We do, indeed, wish to have it admitted into evidence. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 81. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. And there seems to be no need to place that under seal. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 81 admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Shall we, then, ask Mr. Renzaho to take his place in the witness box? If you could kindly come forward. 
The headset is available. 
Good morning, Mr. Renzaho. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are about to give testimony. You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
$(Declaration made by Tharcisse Renzaho in French) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there any personal information sheet for Mr. Renzaho? I suppose much will be clarified during the testimony; so maybe we could just ask you to indicate your date of birth, Mr. Renzaho. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I was born on the 17th of July 1944. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. I think I will leave the rest to you, Mâitre Cantier. You have the floor. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, I'm much obliged, Mr. President. 
Two clarifications before I start my examination-in-chief. First of all, Mr. President, Your Honours, I seek your leave in order to be able to meet with Mr. Renzaho during the examination-in-chief, because I was not given the authorisations I asked for to UNDF, especially during the weekend. So this is my request to you. 
My second observation has to do with the motion which we submitted to your Trial Chamber regarding the disclosure by the Prosecution of a number of documents which came in support of the indictment of Mr. Wenceslas Munyeshyaka. If I were to be given such documents, they would be quite useful to me for the examination-in-chief of Mr. Renzaho. 
I had a discussion with my learned brother from the Prosecution on this matter since, as the Trial Chamber's aware, first of all, there was a refusal on the part of the Prosecution, and following the filing of the motion the Prosecution made contact with me and counsel for the Prosecution indicated that he would, indeed, provide to us the documents we were asking for. 
I wish to inform the Trial Chamber that we are waiting for such documents to be provided to us. And perhaps my learned colleague can tell us at this stage when we will be given such documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Firstly, if you want a comment in respect of the first matter, the Prosecution has no objection to counsel meeting with the Accused during the course of evidence-in-chief. 
As to the second, rather than getting into an argument about whether the material does fall within 66B, and now that on Friday afternoon it was a more specific request, we have, as my friend has correctly indicated, agreed to provide all the material to the Defence. And a CD-ROM with that material is being burnt, hopefully this morning, and we will be in a position to provide that, hopefully, before the lunch break. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was very helpful. So this means that the Defence motion dated the 24th August 2007 containing a request for disclosure of Munyeshyaka documents is moot. The registry will note that. 
And we see no problems, then, that the Defence team meets with Mr. Renzaho during the examination-in-chief. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'm much obliged, Mr. President.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, good morning.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then, only, the final issue. I trust that everyone has the updated spelling list of the Defence dated the 26th of August, 2007. 
Please proceed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'm much obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, good morning. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Good morning, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am about to start your examination-in-chief, and I wish to publicly repeat the advice I gave to you previously. That is to say, to answer the Trial Chamber in a direct, concise and precise manner, and also observe a pause, or at least not to answer my questions immediately after they are put to you since you have decided to answer them in French, but you should leave sufficient time for the interpreters to translate the questions I will put to you. 
Mr. Renzaho, my first question has to do with your social and family origins. In a few words, could you tell the Trial Chamber what they are? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, before I answer your question, I wish to be given some time to express my emotion because of all the victims of the Rwandan tragedy. Amongst the victims of this tragedy I have relatives, I have brothers and sisters, as well as friends. Thank you. 
With regard to my origins, I was born in the Kabare-1 secteur, and not in the secteur mentioned in the indictment, which is in the Kigarama commune, in the former Kibungo préfecture. I was born in 1944. And as regards my parents, my father was called Habineza, Jean. My mother's name is, since she's still alive, Muhimpundu, Christiane. And I come from a family of farmers. 
I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the name of Mr. Renzaho's father is number 147 on the list. And as for his mother's name, it is under number 304. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And Kabare is number 182, I understand. Yes? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, from the outset, let me put a question to you. On the period from April to July of 1994, between the 6th of April and the 5th of July of 1994, did you go back to your préfecture of origin and in your commune of origin? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, Counsel, I did not go to my commune of origin. I did not go there since December of 1993. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Sir, can you tell the Chamber, briefly, what education you received and what diplomas you have? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I went to primary school in the Kibungo Catholic parish. After that, I studied Greek and Latin humanities at the minor seminary in Rwesero, in Kabgayi, and in Kigali, and I finished these studies in 1966. I was awarded a diploma for general humanities. From 1966 to 1967, I spent one year at the national university of Rwanda at the faculty of letters. And after that, I entered the military school in Kigali. I graduated from it in 1970 with a diploma in social and military sciences. 
Subsequently, I underwent a few training sessions, as was customary. And later on, in 1980-1981, I followed the second cycle course at the war school in Brussels, and I also took a course for battalion commanders. And I also underwent the training session for the battalion commanders at the Arlon school, infantry school, in Belgium. And from 1987 to 1989, I took the higher course of general staff at the Hamburg military school in the federal republic of Germany. And from there, I went back to Rwanda in July of 1989. So that is what I can say. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, and all the names should be on the list, even though I am having problems finding them; the names that are not known, such as Arlon in Belgium, are on -- is, rather, on the list under number 17. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
Q. There was another name, the name of a location which you mentioned, Mr. Renzaho. Was it Rwesero 
or Awasero?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It's Rwesero. R-W-E-S-E-R-O. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, that name was not on the list. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for the spelling of that name. And you mentioned Rwesero, Kigali, and was the third one Kabgayi? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is correct. Kabgayi. It is number 186, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. We have everything now. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I wish to apologise, Mr. President, but from where I am I cannot see your microphone. 
Thank you very much. Otherwise, I do not know when you wish to take the floor. I thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, so you underwent military training. Can you tell us what was -- what were the different stages of your career as an officer? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
My rank when I graduated was that of second lieutenant. And I was the head of the platoon, and I was subsequently the commander of the company. I was also an officer of the general staff working in different departments, including a combat unit. And from 1984 onwards, I was appointed study director at the higher military school at the time when that school was changing its curriculum, its training curriculum, and was going from a system to another one based on four years of training. And I left my post in 1987 in order to go to Germany to undergo the training -- military training -- and then I came back to Rwanda where I was appointed director of the programmes and study department at the ministry of national defence. 
I left that position on the 5th of October 1990 when I was appointed préfet of Kigali. 
I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, in view of the military career you had, and which you just referred to, did you ever consider yourself as being one person enjoying privileges from the regime? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I believe, in view of the career I had, I did not refer to the different appointments, and I did not refer to some observations. But frankly speaking, I do not believe I had any privileges -- or enjoyed any privileges from the regime, and I do not believe it's necessary to go into some details about some situations here. But by merely observing my career from 1973 up to 1980, it is quite clear that I did not enjoy such privileges. 
I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho. You did not tell us what rank you had when you stopped exercising your military prerogatives to become a préfet. What was your rank at the time? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I apologise. Perhaps this was this was an oversight on my part. I referred to my rank when I graduated from school, which was second lieutenant, but I reached the rank of lieutenant colonel when I was appointed préfet of Kigali. And while I was préfet, in July of 1992, I became a colonel. I do not know whether I have answered your question. 
I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, that was what I wished to ascertain. Mr. Renzaho, could you tell the Trial Chamber whether you were a member of any political party or organisation -- or political organisation? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you answer that question, Mr. Renzaho, what was your rank when you headed this study programme just before the 5th of October? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President. I was lieutenant colonel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. And then your answer to the question, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you for the question. I was never affiliated to any political party or to any organisation. 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, were you aware of the contents of article 17 of the presidential act dated 13th of December 1978 which was, in fact, the discipline -- the rules of discipline for the Rwandan armed forces? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I'm aware of the existence of these rules. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, this is Exhibit P. 11 from other Prosecution bundle of exhibits. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I wish to read out to you this article 17, and please tell me whether your mind -- you are aware of its conditions: "It is prohibited for serving soldiers to be affiliated to any political party." 
Mr. Renzaho, do you remember this particular article of the presidential act? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, indeed, I'm fully aware of its existence, and I believe this was the reason for which I did not belong to any political party, because I maintained my status of soldier while I was a préfet at the Kigali préfecture. I had been put at the disposal of a territorial administration, but I was still a military officer, even though I was exercising civilian functions. 
I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes. We shall come back to this matter of you being put at the disposal of the administration, Mr. Renzaho, when we will deal with your appointment as préfet. 
Mr. Renzaho, with regard to this banning, are you aware of article 21 of the law of the 18th of June 1991 on political parties in Rwanda? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I'm aware of this law. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you recall the provisions of article 21, or I shall remind them to you? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honour, this exhibit is in our bundle, volume 1, number 12. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
The law of the 18th of June 1991 on political parties, which states that "By waiver to article 20 of the present law, career magistrates, members of the armed forces and of the police -- serving members of the armed forces and the police, cannot endear to any political party." 
Mr. Renzaho, can you tell the Trial Chambers what residences you lived in from the time you were appointed préfet? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I was appointed préfet while I was living in an official residence on the Paul VI avenue. I then moved from that residence to go to a residence on the plateau facing the secondary school, Notre-Dame de Citeaux, on the Notre-Dame -- on the hospital avenue. Sorry. And in May of 1992, I moved and went to reside in my own residence in the Nonko cellule, Nyarugunga secteur, Kanombe commune, in Kigali-rural préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President with respect to the different locations. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
The first location, Mr. Renzaho, is Longo -- Nonko -- Nonko. Nonko is number 379 on our list. Then you referred to a secteur, number 418 on the list. And finally, the Kanombe commune, we are all aware of. 
Mr. Renzaho -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
A question: This act of 18th -- the 13th December 1978 which contained article 17, that was the first provision you referred to. That was before the multiparty system; whereas, then, the second legal provision of 18th of June 1991 was after the multiparty system. Is that so? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I believe that is so, but perhaps I can provide some clarifications. The rules of discipline of the Rwandan armed forces concerned me, at least in some of its provisions. As for that legal provision, since I was an officer of the Rwandan army, I was also concerned by that same provision, and that is why he referred to it, because I was duty-bound to observe the rules of discipline. 
I thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So article 17 remained in force after the introduction of the multiparty system? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, were you asked to participate in the democratic process launched in Rwanda at the beginning of the 1980s -- sorry -- of the '90s. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I did participate in the democratisation process in the country from 1989. I do not know whether I can elaborate on this matter to provide clarifications. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you have just answered in the affirmative to the question I put to you. Could you now tell the Trial Chamber what part you played in the democratisation process, and in the proceedings that led to the advent of multiparty democracy? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I believe there are two stages in this political activity of mine. The first phase had to do with what the president of the republic called aggiornamento. When I was the director of the studies and programmes department, my minister asked me to participate in the proceedings of a coordination -- of an inter-administerial coordination committee in charge of political matters; because the president of the republic had requested that the minister report to him on the wishes that had been expressed during the framework speech he had made during the previous legislature. So several people from several ministries were asked to meet and to think about the military -- about the political situation in the country so as to identify those issues that would require the attention of the authorities in order to take into account the changes requested by the Rwandan population. 
So this is the phase I call aggiornamento, and this is the phase that we were in when I went back to Rwanda. This was the period of political aggiornamento. And I must say that it was not easy. Because, of course, when you have a single party in power, there are forces that are against change. But I was surprised to note that the report of the committee proceedings was endorsed by the president of the republic, who reported on it to the nation on the 5th of July of 1990. 
And at that time, he set up a national synthesis commission, and I was a member of that commission. And this is now the second phase I was referring to. At the time that this national synthesis commission was starting its work, Rwanda was attacked from Uganda on the 1st of October of 1990. 
We signed a petition, we thought that we were to be given guidelines as to what we were to do, whether we were to continue our task or not. And the president asked us to continue with our task and to finalise it as rapidly as possible. So we submitted the results of our work which was, in fact, a political charter, as well as a code of political ethics. The political charter was the source of inspiration for the Rwandan constitution which was promulgated on the 10th of June 1991. 
I thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You referred to article 21 in this act of the 18th of June 1991. I understand that at least in some binders that provision is missing? You may wish to check the photocopy and ensure that that provision is available to us, since you have referred to it. 
Then there was this name referred to by Mr. Renzaho. Can you help us with this term, in connection with the first stage? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Aggiornamento.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Just one moment, Mr. Renzaho, please let me answer in the order in which the questions were put. 
Mr. President, first of all, regarding the constitution, article 21 was in our third list of exhibits under number -- tab number 2. Or rather, it is the one that was distributed this morning, I'm just being told, in document number 2. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when you say document number 2, you haven't really marked it with a 2, but it is simply the second to be found? With other words, the official journal, that's where we are to look. Thank you very much. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. Mr. President, aggiornamento is not a French word, and it's not a Kinyarwanda word, either. It is spelled A-G-G-I-O-R-N-A-M-E-N-T-O. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It sounds suspiciously Italian. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Because it is Italian, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, the result of the proceedings you participated in, if we understood you correctly, was, in fact, a report of this national synthesis commission on the political reforms in Rwanda? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Counsel.
@MR. CANTIER:
And in that document, Mr. President, that document is on our third list, under tab 1. 
Yes, it's the binder that came this morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's be absolutely certain here. We received an email on Friday, I think, entitled "Lists of exhibits in connection with the examination-in-chief of Mr. Renzaho." That is a comprehensive document, and that has been printed out. And then when we came in this morning, we found a folder with documents. In addition, we have previously the Defence exhibits. 
So when you make these references to a folder, exactly which one are you referring to? There are three possible interpretations. If you could just help us. You have just said that you are referring to what we found this morning, or what we got on Friday electronically? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is the same thing, Mr. President. Nonetheless, we wanted to bring the hard copy this morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So with other words, when you referred to numbers, they can be found not in what we got this morning, but it is indeed in what you sent us on Friday under 1608 bis? That's where we find the numbers running from 1 to 21. 
Thank you. I trust everyone in the courtroom has this document, including interpreters and stenographers. If not, it should be available at some stage. Let us proceed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
In fact, that is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER: 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'll present this report to you, the report of the national synthesis committee. What does it advocate at the political level, basically? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Basically, I think the report advocates the opening up of the country to multiparty politics. That is the main thrust of the report. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well. Mr. Renzaho, were you a member of this committee? You spoke of two phases. Were you part of the first phase aggiornamento, then the second phase the drafting of that report? Is that correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
When were you appointed the préfet of the city of Kigali, sir? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I was appointed préfet of the municipality of Kigali on 5 October 1990. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
When did you take the oath of office? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I took the oath of office on 5 October 1990 at about 4 p.m. in the afternoon at the Nyamirambo regional stadium in the presence of my friends who, like me, had been appointed bourgmestre. So there were about three: The bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, and the bourgmestre of Kicukiro. And we took the oath of office together before the minister of the interior, thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the three names mentioned, Nyarugenge is 417; Kacyiru is 191; and the third one, is Kicukiro. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes.
@MR. CANTIER:
It's number 245. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, sir, can you tell the Chamber, in your opinion, what were the reasons that led to your appointment to that post? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I think it is a difficult question. I was not in the secret of the powers that be to know the reasons that prompted them to appoint me préfet of the city of Kigali. I believe that I was appointed following the incident that happened in the city of Kigali on the night of 4 to 5. There were shootings that lasted all night. And personally, I saw the arrival of the president where I was, because we had closed down our usual activities to reinforce the activities of the general staff, the army headquarters. I was there at that time. And so he got there at about 3 a.m., and he watched us work. He saw the confusion into which the city was plunged. 
So I did not follow the part that came about immediately that morning, but I was told that there was an extraordinary council of ministers. And while I was still at the army headquarters, one of the friends with whom I worked, told me, "We've just heard your name on the radio, and it would appear that you've been appointed préfet of the city of Kigali." 
I did not want to believe it. But later on, the president came to the army headquarters and he convened me to his office, and he told me that he had actually appointed me préfet of the city of Kigali; and that he was not ready to fight on two fronts, and that the incidents of that night demonstrated clearly that there would be excesses. And he said we were fighting at the borders. If we have to add to that fighting within the city of Kigali, we'll never succeed. 
Then he told me that I had to contribute to bringing calm and stability and enable the state institutions to function properly, and to reassure the Rwandan population and the expatriate population in Kigali. That is what he told me. 
But to answer your question, I think that there must have been reasons, since my appointment happened after the deliberations of the ministers in the council of ministers. Now, I don't know what was discussed about me or the situation, because I did not read the report of that meeting. 
Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, so what do you think of the president's decision to appoint to the post of préfet a soldier, rather than a civilian? Well, in addition, or quite apart from the reasons you've just mentioned now. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
As far as I'm concerned, I think it was customary in the country that officers be appointed to civilian positions, and that was not limited to the second republic. We have known officers that were appointed ministers in the first republic. So, it was customary. But what was exceptional in my case was probably the fact that the country was at war and that, really, the situation was deteriorating with the excesses that we had that night, and the general disorder that was seen in Kigali which could continue. 
So that was the situation. So maybe there was a preponderant fact in the sense that those who initiated the disorder in Kigali did so in view of a specific objective. Because with the continuation of such agitation, we had repeated urban guerrilla attacks from the RPF, and those attacks caused a lot of material and human damage. But above all, those repeated attacks suddenly plunged the population into some kind of violence, or a vision, that progressively destroyed the social fabric. 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But in such a situation, you need a hands-on person, an operative personality. And why you? You were then at the ministry heading a study programme? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That is true. I was a research officer. I was not heading a military operation on the ground, that is correct. But why me? Why not some other person? I mean, that is what I was saying. So I wasn't into the secret of the powers that be. I could not know. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Sir, do you think that in the prevailing context of the time in Rwanda, that there were regional considerations that prevailed in your appointment? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I believe that all of this could form a pattern that I do not have the time to discuss here. I realised, in the performance of my duties, that the position was highly envied, and it had a lot of problems because everybody in Kigali was fighting. Fighting -- one -- one doesn't know why they were fighting. And we were in the context of political change. Parties. Political parties are going to be set up and were going to carry out their main activities in Kigali. And at the same time, we were prosecuting a war, so there were democratic measures that came up. But there were restrictive measures linked to the security of the country that was threatened -- threatened a situation that some people considered sensitive. And so maybe it was thought that somebody should be found who could help address that situation. But I don't know. 
Then the second question that he asked, that has to do with regionalism. So we're talking about competition from political parties, and then we were at war. Was this not going to further compound the situation in the case of Rwanda, as we experienced it at the time? And then, would that regional aspect, the usual antagonism between the north and south, was it not further going to poison the situation? That was part of the complexity of the situation which, to my mind -- I wasn't told, but I thought that I was less of a problem than some other person who could be identified as being part of what I've just mentioned. 
And so these are some of the issues that could be considered. But I believe that some other person coming from any given political party, with a known belonging to the north or to the south, would have raised a bigger problem than my person. Because I felt I was performing that mission for everybody; the armed forces, the country. I did not have any political party. And I believe that may have played -- or counted in the appointment of my humble self to that position. 
Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what was your administrative status following your appointment? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I believe that I maintained my status as an officer, and I also carried out civilian duties in that capacity. My immediate superior was the minister of the interior. But my administrative status was that I was still at the disposal of the army. That is, at the end of the army, for purposes of promotion, army officers, as well as other civilian workers, have to be promoted. So for that purpose, I remained under the ministry of the interior, but my status was that of an officer. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you enjoy the provisions of article 17 of decree law from 19 March 1994 to lay down the general statute of state workers? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is in our folder of volume 1, Exhibit Number 51. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I will just recall the provisions of article 17 to you. "State employees can be placed at the disposal of any state administration, or any other organism, while being regulated by their status." Is that the provision? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, that is it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Likewise, Mr. Renzaho -- and this is in a bit to clarify your status following your appointment -- were you aware of the presidential order of 3 January 1997 to lay down the rules and regulations governing Rwandan army officers? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
In the folder, the Defence folder, it is in the second volume, number 4. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'll read out point 10 of that document to you: "An officer may be transferred by a presidential order of the national forces to another service of the state. He shall maintain his rights." 
Now, did the provisions of this statute apply to you at the time of your appointment as préfet of the city of Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, is there not a subparagraph after that? I was not transferred. I was placed at the disposal of --
@MR. CANTIER: 
So we're not talking about transfer? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It's about disposal. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So you benefitted from that status, Mr. Renzaho? 
@MR. CANTIER:
It is a problem of speed. I will see to it immediately.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, we have to watch out. Since we are speaking the same language, we tend to move too fast with our questions and answers. 
Now, this is my question: By virtue of the text that you've just seen, did you, administratively speaking, remain attached to the army and the ministry of defence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. By virtue of that provision, I remained attached to the ministry of defence with respect to my career file. That is correct. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Consequently, the ban on belonging to any political party that we saw a moment ago in the text, did that ban still apply to you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We agreed to observe the pause. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The answer was in the affirmative. It's a typical military answer, sir. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, following your appointment, what essential missions were entrusted to you by the president of the republic and your minister, the minister of the interior? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you for your question, Counsel. After I was appointed, I was given the mission, first, to implement law number 39/90 of 22 June 1990 -- law number 35/90, correction. That is a law that raised the city of Kigali to an autonomous authority. But I must state that there were duties relating to the property of the former council of Nyarugenge that I took over. But in the meantime, it was split into three councils, or three communes, with a central préfectoral administration that was supposed to govern all of that. So, priority was given to the implementation of the provisions of that law. And I went to work immediately to identify a number of priority needs to find housing, or office space, for the commune; hire personnel; acquire equipment; and try to draw up a budget and execute it, and to get all the structures off the ground. And I must say that it came at a bad time because funds had been earmarked for activities in the city of Kigali; but with the outbreak of the war, the funds were not available. So the new authorities had to do their best to find recurrent expenditure for the préfecture and the commune. 
So that is what I had to do. Obviously, there were other missions that were imposed by the situation and by the very nature of the position that I held. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a difference between the English and the French version. 
We agree that the point of this act, and your initial tasks, were to administer the transition from a former Nyarugenge commune, to the préfecture. Isn't that the point, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I believe I said I received the property of the former Nyarugenge urban commune, which was split into three communes, and for which we had to find infrastructure and personnel. That is what I meant. So the -- we had to recover all what we had to recover from the Nyarugenge commune, and then share them out to the three new communes that had been set up. So that is what I meant. And the property, of course, was inadequate because we were moving from one commune to three. So two of the communes were essentially rural. There was nothing. It needed school, infrastructure, roads, but there was nothing. 
Thank you Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER: 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes. For greater clarity on your assumption of office, were you the first préfet of Kigali city to be appointed? And did that happen within the framework of the law of 22 June 1990 to lay down the administration of the city of Kigali? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, that is Exhibit P. 14. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, I was the first préfet of the city of Kigali, and my mission was to implement all what was provided for by the law you just mentioned. 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what was going to be the essential thrust of your work following your appointment? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
After I was appointed, I tried to set up the structure of the préfecture and the structure of the communes. That is what I had just said. And for the préfecture, there was a major problem; and the same, also, applies to the commune. The major problem was related to personnel. Because the personnel I met at the Nyarugenge commune were not skilled to perform the duties prescribed by the law. So I had to recruit academics, follow the procedure in that area. So it took a bit more time, five to six months at the very least. And in the meantime, we had to operate, continue operating. So we found office space for the three communes, shared out the available personnel, purchased some equipment, with time. But we got down to work to try to implement the law and get the structure to operate. 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Again, just for clarity in the records, you were the first prefect of the Kigali-ville préfecture, isn't that the situation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, that is true, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, when you took office, did you participate in the repression following -- which followed the outbreak of the war of October of 1990? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. I did not participate in any acts of repression. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, could you tell the Trial Chamber what you know of the arrests that were made in the town of Kigali, but also throughout the country, from the 4th of October of 1990? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
What I do know is that during the night from the 4th to the 5th in Kigali, around one in the morning, there were gunshots that led to reprisals, and there was shooting up until the morning. I do not know what occurred in the rest of the country, whether there was also gunfire; that I am not aware of. 
And during the day of the 4th, there was a rumour in Kigali whereby there was an imminent attack that was going to take place, probably on the night of that same day, and this was information that was circulating amongst embassies in Kigali. And, curiously, at that time, at the time announced, there was gunfire, so the security forces arrested people who were thought to be working with the RPF movement, which was not very well known in Rwanda at the time. Because prior to the attack of the 1st of October of 1990, very few people knew what the RPF was. So, some arrests were made, a number of people were arrested, as was observed by many people, and this was perhaps due to the war and to the tension that was pervasive. But it is also, perhaps, due to the fact that the Rwandan population was caught unawares. Because very few Rwandans were expecting an attack from any country on Rwanda since we had just spent 20 years in peace, and we had enjoyed friendship with all our neighbouring countries. So it was an unpleasant surprise. But there was panic, and I believe the security forces were excessive in their fulfillment of their task. I do not understand how 8,000 people can be arrested in one single operation. I believe there were a number of people they could have arrested. But as for 8,000 people, I believe this was an excessive figure. 
So this was the atmosphere in the population when the war broke out in Rwanda. Because, once again, one can say that apart from the problem due to the war, it was not a Rwandan hill that stood up and fought against another commune. It was a war that was waged from Rwanda -- from Uganda -- sorry -- and this had an impact on the population. I observed the population. I observed how things were going quite well, how people were helping one another, how we shared everything within the population. And throughout the war, the social fabric started deteriorating, and so on and so forth, and this led to a disastrous situation because of this war. 
I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I was putting this question to you since, as you're well aware, the Prosecution claims that you were closely linked to this wave of arrests, and that as a consequence you played a significant part in the events of October of 1990. So, can you tell us clearly who made those arrests and how the people who were arrested were subsequently treated by the legal services, as well as by the police force? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I believe those who arrested these people are the gendarmerie, the central intelligence service, as well as the public prosecutor's office which intervened, as it should, taking into account its functions. I also know that when the massive arrests took place, a national committee was set up, and this committee was headed by the minister of justice. And the task of this committee was to sort out those who had been arrested. Why? Because it was clear that out of the 8,000 people, there were probably some people who were, indeed, wanted, whereas there were others that could be innocent. And that is what we were able to observe subsequently. But personally, I was not associated to this activity in view of the nomination -- of my nomination. And if we look at my activities from my appointment until October of 1990, I was not involved in this operation at all which had started in the early morning of that day. So this is what I can say. 
Perhaps before conclude, since you were wondering, and were saying that there were documents found here and there proving that the préfecture was involved in that activity, well, that is true. The préfecture and the communes were requested to provide information on people and on their whereabouts. Because, once again, when the massive arrests were made, people were not severally identified. And subsequently, we had to deal on a case-by-case basis to determine that person X was arrested in the Gikondo secteur, and then we had to make sure that that person really lived in Gikondo, for example. So we provided information as to the place where these persons lived, and we were asked to confirm whether those arrested really lived in the neighbourhoods where they had been arrested or where they were to be looked for. 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did the police participate in the arrests? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
The Nyarugenge police force -- or rather, the Nyarugenge commune did not have more than 25 policemen. And I do not know whether, during the transition -- because the person that was in charge was to relinquish his duties to me, I do not know whether such duties were relinquished to the police force or not. So as far as I'm concerned I cannot answer your question. 
I thank you.
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, were you given any explanations as to why those people had been arrested? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I can provide the explanation. The people were suspected of being RPF followers, or partisans within the country, and were suspected of preparing sabotage operations -- or mining operations; were suspected of looking for information to the benefit of the RPF. And that was the reason why they were arrested. 
I thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So my question to you is: Did you, as the prefect of Kigali, provide information about the people to be arrested? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Your Honour, I must put myself in the context of the events. I was appointed on the 5th of October of 1990. I did not have any personnel to work with. No department or body of the préfecture had been set up in order to be operational. And I'm referring to two main bodies which are, in fact, two supreme bodies; the préfet only being there to implement orders from these two bodies. So the security urban council and the commune council. 
Regarding the question you put, it is linked to the urban security body, which had not yet been set up. And what we are to do is to be done in the framework of this urban security council. It was set up subsequently. And it is clear, in the documents available, that the matters that we deal with -- or dealt with within the framework of this urban security council. 
$(Pages 1 to 18 by Vicki Eastvold)
1015H 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO (continuing): 
So on the 5th, on the 6th and on the 7th, I had no organ or body set up in order to be able to work. I did not provide any information. I was able to provide information once that council was set up, and I provided information on specific issues that were sent to me through correspondence to the national sorting committee. It was that committee that addressed the commune directly in order to request information on persons who had been clearly identified. So I do not know whether I have answered your question correctly. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes, you have. Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I am insisting on this matter because what you said a moment ago was not very clear, and I believe this is what led to the question by the Judge. 
Regarding the information you were requested to provide through your administrative structure, the information dealt -- did it concern people who had already been arrested, or persons who were to be arrested? In fact, I'm putting the same question to you as the question put to you by the Judge, but it was not clear earlier on. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The information had to do with people who had already been arrested, and it was important to have such information for the sorting process so as to complement the individual files of the persons who had been arrested, in view of possible release. And many of them were subsequently released. I thank you.

@MR. CANTIER: 
I wish to have shown to you an exhibit which is in our -- on our third list. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is document number 3. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is a report of the meeting of the sorting committee that you have just referred to. And this report is dated -- Mr. Renzaho, this report is dated 23rd of October of 1990. First of all, are you aware of the existence of this document? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I know of the document. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, the document refers to the sorting task you have just referred to. Did you see the names of those who were the members of this sorting committee, and can you remind the Trial Chamber of the position of the main members of this committee, apart from the minister of justice that you have already mentioned? For example, were there magistrates as members of this committee? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. There were magistrates who were members of this committee, and the first one was the public prosecutor. There were also other staff members of the public prosecutor's office, as well as the ministry of justice, as well as a few gendarmerie officers, if I'm not mistaken. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, still with regard to this episode of the large-scale arrests in October of 1990, the Prosecution claims that you played an active role in the sale of the property of some of the people who were arrested or some people who had fled Rwanda. What do you have to say in the face of such an accusation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Let me start by stating that I played no part whatsoever in the sale of the property of those who were arrested. And I also wish to provide some clarifications on the situation of those who were arrested who were in Kigali, or the situation of traders who, shortly before the attack by the RPF, joined the RPF movement in Uganda. That is a different matter altogether. The people who were arrested could have members of their families who were not arrested, and the -- those members of their families could make sure that their property was safe. But that was different from those traders who, before the attack by the RPF, went to Uganda to join the RPF forces, because they had left their property without anybody to watch over it, and this led to a very serious security problem. But there was also the fact that they owed money to banking institutions. 
As far as I'm concerned, and with regard to the people who were arrested, I indicated that they were managed by a governmental committee, headed by the minister of justice. And the same goes for those traders who had some property in the country and who had fled the country. The government decision also included the cases of those traders who had fled, and I do know that the court of first instance of Kigali was entrusted with the matter, and that it was through a conservation order that this was done. And the préfecture did not deal with any of those matters. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, can you tell the Trial Chamber what was the population in Kigali when you took office, or during the months or the years that followed? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we move to that line, Maître Cantier, you wanted to make a point in connection with the issue of Mr. Renzaho's role in 1950 (sic). The question arose about information provided about persons to be arrested, or who had been arrested, and you tried to clarify that issue for us. In doing so, you referred to document number 3 in your last bundle of documents, and that document is presumably the letter from the minister of justice dated the 6 November 1990. Then follows, in the binder, the report of this commission, which apparently held a meeting on the 23rd of October 1990. And you asked about the members of that commission, and we're told that there were magistrates and -- at least in the sense that the general prosecutor was a member. We see no judges in this collection of names, but we do see the prosecutor. That's number 3. 
But what was then the link between this commission and the collection of information? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Monsieur le Président -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
With other words, what was the link between this commission and the role of the Accused? He's not listed among the 12 members of the commission. Does that mean that he was not a member, or that he was not present during the meeting? Can you explain this to us by posing questions to Mr. Renzaho, please. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, I shall do so, Mr. President. But let me provide a clarification to you right from the outset. Regarding the letter you referred to, Mr. President, on the cover letter for the report, it is dated 6th of November 1990, and this letter, which was sent by the minister of justice, with copy to the presidency and the préfecture of Kigali town, this letter is in fact a cover letter for the report on the meeting of the 23rd of October. So that was my clarification. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, you have heard the concern expressed by the President, so I put the question to you: You are not amongst the people referred to in this report of the meeting of the 23rd of October, but were you a member of that sorting committee? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I was not a member of that committee, and I believe no member of the territorial administration of Kigali town was a member either. Perhaps I could provide some clarifications on the link that we could have had with that committee. The persons who had been arrested had been arrested in different secteurs of the communes of Kigali town préfecture, and they were not identified before they were arrested. It was during the sorting out process that specific information on specific cases were -- was -- were necessary. And at the préfecture, the sorting committee would make requests for information on people who had been arrested, and for whom it was necessary to have additional information in order to settle their case. And that is when there were exchanges of information on a case-by-case basis. But we did not have any members within that committee. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, did you then provide information to the committee? Was that your role? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Mr. President. I believe even other préfets were asked to provide information in that regard. I thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then I see that, in French, I was translated as if I said that something happened in 1950. I certainly said in English 1990. So please, there should be no "sic" there in relation to what I stated. All right. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Renzaho, should I take it that people who carried out the arrests of 8,000 people didn't know who they arrested? They were not aware of their names and some other details? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Unfortunately I have to say yes, because even among the persons arrested there were foreigners. So they had not taken time to check all the information concerning these persons, yes. Thank you. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, the question that the President's asking you: So, in that commission, apart from the public prosecutor, who is the highest magistrate of the country, were there judges in that sorting committee, as far as you know? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I have not looked completely through the list, but I think I saw the name of a certain Mr. Vianney, but I think he was a worker in the court of first instance in Kigali. But I believe there were persons appointed by the prime minister. I would not be surprised that some persons were taken from the court of first instance. Vianney, I believe, worked at the court of first instance in Kigali. Vianney Hebiyembere, he appears on the list. He was appointed to the Kigali court of first instance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please slow down. 
Now, this name, do we find that between the 12? 
How do you spell it? Please do. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Readily, sir. H-E-B-I-Y-E-M-B-E-R-E, Vianney. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is it number 7, Antoine? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, we -- we find that name on number 7 of the document, but the first name is Antoine. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is possible. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But on the document his function is director general of the justice administration. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
However, I knew him to be working at the Kigali court of first instance. I don't know. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, then, Mr. Renzaho, I would rephrase my question, because you may have forgotten a while ago. The question was: What was the number of the persons you administered when you took over office in the year that followed, that is, the population of Kigali city? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you for your question. I am obliged to -- to say this maybe with reference to the census that was conducted in Kigali and throughout the country in 1991, and a report came out in 1994. So I will give you the overall figure, because the report is -- is very voluminous, so I did not calculate everything with any great precision. So, generally speaking, the population of Kigali, including foreigners and everybody, was 233,000 in April 1994. And within that figure, because this is the Rwandan scourge, people were identified by the ethnic groups and so on. And the Tutsis were 38,910 in Kigali. And the number of foreigners is there; I believe the document is available. And so there you have the figures for 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, you mentioned the population census of 15 August 1991, but that was made public only in April 1994. Is that the document, Mr. Renzaho, the document I'm holding up? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That should be the document, but it was not drawn up on the date you mentioned. It was a process that went up to 1994, because the proceedings went on at the administrative block of the Kigali préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, this document is found on the third list of our -- of our folder. I don't have the number right away. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Number 16. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, let us now go back to your duties as préfet. After your appointment and the assumption of office, what, in a nutshell, were the main duties that you were expected to carry out? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I would not like to repeat myself. I believe the priority duties was to set in motion the organs of the préfecture. Then the -- the thorny issue at the time was the security problem. So there was daily insecurity in the city of Kigali, and we were experiencing a rather deadly urban guerrilla attack in public places, in leisure areas, in buses, in taxis -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Sorry to cut you short, but I think we will come back to that context by and by. But the main duties that you performed shortly after your appointment -- because a while ago you mentioned the setting up of the two main committees that govern the city, and you were the executive organ. So, now, a question on the context: In what political context did these actions that you mentioned take place? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. The political context was difficult -- a very difficult one because we had a war situation, and the democratic opening up that was happening at the same time. That was a decision of the powers that were at the time. So it was difficult to grant democratic freedoms at a time when guerrilla attacks imposed restrictions on such freedoms. I am talking about control of the population -- measures to control the population that raised a controversy within the population because political parties did not take it well. But we had to tread a fine line between the two situations: War and security, and democratic freedoms. So it's a difficult situation that I may develop further. 
But, as counsel has just asked me, the context was also characterised by a very difficult economic situation. Rwanda was attacked at the time -- when it had just been imposed structural adjustment measures, and then the war broke out, closing off the northern corridor. That was the fastest and the most (unintelligible) to merchandise coming from abroad into Rwanda or from Rwanda going outside. So the country's economic situation was very difficult. And for Kigali in particular, this city is supplied by other préfectures that bring in food items to Kigali. So the war prevented much of these products from coming into Kigali. And restrictions, roadblocks were imposed on some of these préfectures and they delayed the transportation of products and goods. 
And that situation also prevailed in some kind of competition, as I told you. When the préfet took up office he had to cope with demonstrations of the youth, of political parties, rather turbulent demands, and one had to cope with all of this and at the same time create safety valves or outlets for people to make their -- hold their rallies and so on. So the context was really difficult. But I don't know if there are other aspects that you would like me to mention. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you. I will ask you the appropriate questions, Mr. Renzaho. Now, on the context that you've just described, the political context as well as the economic context, can you mention passive or active measures that you had to take to cope with the situation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The guerrilla warfare in the city of Kigali was very, very dangerous and harmful. At the time the city was not very large, and schools, transportation -- collective transportation systems were threatened, as well as markets, and one could not find enough soldiers to protect all the areas that had to be protected. And I believe that the passive measures that involved the contribution of the population to protect specific sites, persons who were well informed of the danger could significantly contribute to improving the situation. So we carried out educational charts, or sessions, to inform the population of the nature of the conflict that had been imposed, and the ways and means by which they could help protect filling stations, road vehicles, ways of how they could identify a mine by looking at a fresh mound of earth anywhere, raise awareness among students on how they played in school. Because there were grenades that were stuck in schools, entrances into schools, and these things were there, the children they don't know them, and they got themselves killed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maître Cantier, it is certainly always important to view things in context, but I wonder whether you will assist us so that we'll only get what is needed legally? Sometimes there are some details coming up that you may not wish to use in your closing arguments. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, you are perfectly right. These are points related to the context, and they are meant to help the Chamber to come to terms with the environment in which Mr. Renzaho worked, and in which, generally speaking, the political and military situation in Rwanda took place. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, you've heard the President's clarification on those passive and active measures. Please cite them and try to be brief and illustrate your attitude, your action, and your work in the face of that situation. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. Under passive measures you have education, public awareness, possibly training on what the population had to do. And active measures came in during the major crisis we had in Kigali, and we had them, you know, during violent demonstrations, assassinations. And these measures comprised of curfews -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, this would come in with more specific questions, so please try to be concise. Yes, Mr. Renzaho, to illustrate that situation and the political context, I will give you this document titled "Report on the attitude of youth movements of parties in Kacyiru commune, Kicukiro, Nyarugenge, and Kanombe". It is a report that was commissioned by the authorities, and is dated 16 December 1992. Mr. Renzaho, do you know this document? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I know -- I know it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it is found on our third list, I think, it is number 6 or something. The sixth document. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, precisely, on page 12 of this document -- well, we found only the French version of this document. 
"The préfets regularly held security council meetings to decide on the appropriate measures to take. They also organised meetings with the population in areas of attacks." 
Are these the measures that you mentioned a while ago? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Precisely, these are pacification measures only. But I added others under prevention, through public awareness campaigns on the new situation, because Rwanda had never been accustomed to the explosion of minds. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, still in a bid to illustrate the situation, and more directly, your attitude in the face of that situation, do you recall the letter that you wrote to the secretary general of the central intelligence service in Kigali on 7 November 1991? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it's in our folder, Defence folder volume 1, exhibit (sic) number 5. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you have any recollection of that document? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I may read out to you the first paragraph, and you would tell me if you confirm that it is what you wrote at the time: 
"I have the honour to report to you that I have received information to the effect that there is interethnic conflict in Kibungo (sic), Kanombe, and Kibukeru (phonetic), and these tensions" -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Remember to read slowly. 
Let's start again. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
"I have the honour to report to you that I have received information to the effect that there is interethnic tension in Rubungo, Kanombe, and even Kicukiro communes. And this tension is the outcome of the dissemination of tracts inciting persons to carry out interethnic massacres." 
So, do you recall that paragraph, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I do acknowledge it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And what precisely did you want to point out, and what kind of answer did you expect to your request? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I wanted to report that tension was building within the population, and was caused by extremist elements who were found everywhere. You always find extremist elements. And with the progress of the war, these elements seemed to be justified. So the state services had to face the problem head-on and try to identify such persons, and seek to neutralise them, because I considered it a danger. At the time when we were prosecuting the war, we should not start another war within the country. So that was the problem. 
And you realise that the letter was addressed to the central intelligence service, and with the creation of the post of prime minister, the central intelligence service was headed directly by the prime minister. So he was going to know about this, or at least the government was going to know about this, following the change in constitution in 1991. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you recall a letter that you sent this time to your minister, the minister of the interior and rural development, on 15 November 1991? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I sent reports regularly. So maybe if you can read a few passages of it, then I would know. But I generally sent reports on the situation. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'm going to read out a passage to you: 
"The préfecture is also fighting against these crimes -- this criminal -- or the thieving actions by carrying out police patrols." And I will cite the main passages. "The resources of the police are highly limited, and therefore we count above all on the gendarmes." 
On that score, Mr. Renzaho, there's a question I've not asked you which stems from this document. What was the staff strength of the communal police? A while ago you mentioned that when you took up office, there were about 25 communal police in Nyarugenge commune, I believe. So did you add to that number of the communal police, and so what was the total number of the communal police in September or November 1991? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you very much. We developed a police unit given the missions that had been entrusted to us, and the police staff strength, even unarmed as they were, was 250 persons. Unfortunately, part of them were armed and another part was not armed because we did not have the necessary resources to provide them with arms. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The letter you are referring to now, dated 15th November 1991, is that a document which is also in Defence folder volume 1? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. Volume 1, number 6. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, still on your concerns at that period, do you recall a letter that you sent, this time to the minister of national defence, 23 September 1991? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I do recall. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it's in the Defence documents volume 1, document number 4. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
I will read out the first sentence of that document to you. And you say: "I have the honour to report to you the alarming security situation of the préfecture of Kigali city." 
So what exactly did you want to report to the minister of national defence through that letter? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. What I wanted to bring to his attention was a very serious situation of generalised insecurity. At a time when we were experiencing a war situation, we equally had elements, be they soldiers or gendarmes, who were carrying out acts of banditry within the population. And I would like to say that it was rather regrettable, and it justified the preparation of the country for the war that was imposed on it in 1990. Because these elements were the direct outcome of the massive recruitments that followed the FP -- RPF aggression. 
So the Rwandan army moved from a low number of 6,000 men to over 25,000 in a very short while. And you will agree with me that the speed of recruitment and training was not enough to -- to give the soldiers the required experience, notably with regard to military regulations that each soldier was supposed to know, and to implement with regard to his attitude as a soldier. So it was seen through a lot of indiscipline. These people sometimes deserted their positions, and they came to swell the ranks of bandits in this city -- in the capital city. So I called on the minister of defence to intervene and to help combat strongly these elements who disrupted public peace. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would this be a good moment for the 11 o'clock break? We will then resume at 11:25. Court is adjourned.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you hear about a document called "Note on the evolution of multiparty democracy in Rwanda"? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I read the document. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am going to ask, forthwith, the booth to refer to a passage, because in the document which we have, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence list number 29 (sic), the text I wish for Mr. Renzaho to listen to is only available in Kinyarwanda. Part of the document is in French, and the other part is in Kinyarwanda. So I would ask -- like to ask the booth to read out the short excerpt and translate it to us, and then I shall put a question to Mr. Renzaho subsequently. I distributed the document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Exactly which document are you now referring to? We have what we got this morning and an electronic copy, and we have a document which is called "outgoing code cable" which we just found on our desk. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President, that is not the document I'm referring to. The document I just mentioned is entitled, in French, "Note on the development of multiparty democracy in Rwanda", and it can be found on the third list under number 29 (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But, you see, when you say "the third list" we think that you are referring to the list which is running from number 1 to number 21. And that's why we don't understand why you are referring to number 29. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
My apologies, Mr. President. When I put my glasses correctly I do see that it is number 21. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, the last document in what we received this morning. And it's true that it's only in Kinyarwanda. 
Mr. Moses. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, sorry, Your Honour, I'm just wondering before -- or, if the Accused is going to make reference to it, whether we can have some greater foundation for what this document is? I, unfortunately, do not read Kinyarwandan. I only have from page -- we're only disclosed, I believe, from page 10 onwards. So it's very unclear who made the document, it's not signed, and it's in a language which -- which is a different issue, but I'm just asking that there be some foundation laid before questions are asked. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't you start explaining this, Maître Cantier? It seems to start with K number K0504232. On the top of that page, the internal pagination is 9. What kind of document is this? Where does it come from? We have noted the title of the document, as you have summarised it under number 21, but what kind of note, written by whom? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is a document which we discovered in the databank of the Prosecution, and the document which we have is not signed. The title is the one I provided previously, and as it indicates, the purpose of this document is to give some idea to the reader on the developments in multiparty democracy in Rwanda during the -- during two years -- the two years from 1992 to 1994, and it -- it is this part in Kinyarwanda that deals with that matter. And we deemed it interesting in order to give an idea of the situation that prevailed in Rwanda, especially with regard to public order. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you said that it covered 1992 to '94, whereas the title you have written indicates the period '90 to '91. But, leaving that aside, who wrote this? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, all I can say is that this document is in the Prosecution database, and I do not know much more about it. Since this document seemed to us to be comprehensive and objective -- it is not a propaganda document -- we thought it might be interesting to make use of it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, the Prosecution's submission is that what is of interest to Your Honour is what the Accused has to say, and not what any other person who is unknown and unnamed might have said. It is -- it doesn't prevent my learned friend from putting a proposition to this witness and asking for his comment on it, which might be a way in which -- but I would be objecting to the document being used in the way in which my learned friend is proposing to use it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we would prefer avoiding reading this document, even if it may come from a good source and be interesting. You probably have a plan, and the reason why you want to put this to the Accused is that you want to solicit information from him. He may, for instance, agree with some of the propositions in the text. Maybe instead of going the cumbersome way through reading this unknown document, that you could just ask questions to the Accused. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I can proceed in that manner, but what I was proposing was quite similar to what was proposed by my learned friend. I wished to briefly read an excerpt and then put a question to the witness. But then I can go straight to the question. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, in this document, reference is made to demonstrations by MRND and CDR in order to protest against the Arusha Accords, and such demonstrations blocked roads. Do you confirm that such events took place, especially in Kigali town, since you were its préfet? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and everyone must remember to speak slowly. Everyone. 
Now it's your turn, Mr. Renzaho. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I'm much obliged, Mr. President. 
The demonstration which is referred to, if my memory serves me well, took place in early 1993. And unless I'm mistaken, there were, at the time, negotiations on the sharing of power. And the demonstrations did indeed take place, not in town, but rather in an area of Kigali-rural, and more specifically in the commune of Butamwa on the Giticyinyoni-Rwada (phonetic) road. That was where the demonstration took place. I thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the location was -- shall we make sure that we have the spelling? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I referred to the commune of Butamwa. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, these demonstrations you were faced with, were they violent in nature? Were there armed people who participated in the demonstrations and who perpetrated serious acts? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I do not know whether you are referring to the demonstration we were talking about earlier on. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. Renzaho, I am referring to other demonstrations that might have involved people who were armed and who perpetrated serious acts. That is my precise question. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you very much, Counsel. Yes, indeed, I was faced with violent demonstrations during which people were armed with clubs, with studded clubs, or knives, and where people had tools in order to puncture vehicle tyres. When such demonstrations took place, the sole purpose was to perpetrate acts of violence throughout the town, including the breaking into shops and thefts. So I do state that I was indeed faced with such violent demonstrations. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In the -- in the answer you just gave you said that you were faced with violent demonstrations three times. The question was precise; why don't you content yourself only by saying it once, and very briefly? Here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I was putting the specific question to you, because in the correspondence I mentioned earlier on, dated 7th of November of 1999, which is in our binder, volume 1, number 5, there is a third paragraph that I wish to read out to you, and I will subsequently ask you whether you confirm what you denounced in that correspondence. You are stating, and I quote: 
"These youths are allegedly armed with machetes. Their intention would be to burn out -- burn down houses and kill people, and they even supposedly have fuel in order to carry out that task. One house has been burnt down in the secteur already. That house belonged to Mrs. Muhimpundu, of Tutsi ethnicity, in the same Ndera secteur." 
Do you confirm the event you denounced to the secretary general of the central intelligence service? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I confirm the information. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This was probably number 304. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, my apologies regarding the names. Indeed, the name of the individual who was the victim is indeed found under 304. And the Ndera secteur is not on my list, and it's spelt N-D-E-R-A. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, throughout that period, what links did you have with political parties and their youth wings? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Regarding my links with political parties and the organisations, I had some relations with them within the framework of the relations the administration was to have with groups that were within the préfecture and who were exercising their rights under any free democratic system. So that -- those were the links I had with such groups. And perhaps I can explain further regarding the exercise of democratic freedoms, that there was a law on demonstrations, and that is the link between the administration and political parties. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you, after becoming prefect, join any political party? Yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The description you just gave, does that mean that your links with the political parties were then of a professional character in connection with your duties as the prefect? Is that your evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is what I just stated, Your Honours. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho -- and perhaps your answer will complement the first question posed by the President in an indirect manner. After your appointment, did you maintain any specific links with the military institution -- with the army? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, I had no military function. I did not have any specific military activity, but my name was still on the list of those who were paid by the army every month. That's it. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, does that mean, since you were still within the army, you were still bound by the rules of the army, that is to say, you were to be neutral and you were prohibited from belonging to any political party? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, what you are saying is true. I entirely agree with you. Because of my status as a member of the army, it was prohibited for me to be a member of any political party. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you. Mr. Renzaho, what was the specific role of PVK, and more specifically, your role in view of the destabilisation actions carried out in Kigali? And I would like you to only focus on the issue of the attacks and the political assassinations, since we have already dealt with all the issues related to the enforcement of law and order in general. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The Kigali town préfecture was a prime target during the revolutionary war that was waged against us. The aspects you are underscoring, that is to say, attacks and political assassinations, indeed took place. In Kigali, there were violent attacks using explosives or mines, or very sophisticated tools that I saw for the first time when those events took place. These attacks took place at the Kigali station, at the junction in Nyakabanda, also in Kigali. Some buildings were burnt, a bomb exploded at the Kigali post office, at the bar called Kigali Nightclub there was also a bomb that exploded, and so on and so forth. So these were events that indeed took place. And I cannot list all the cases which we recorded. 
Regarding political assassinations, that is also true that they took place. First of all there were some cases where we would find people dead on the street and we did not know how such deaths had occurred. But the most flagrant cases were witnessed in Kigali town, the assassination of Gapyisi, Emmanuel, which proved -- and it was proven that the same people who perpetrated that act wanted to also kill the members of his association, which was called (French spoken), peace and democracy, which published a newspaper. There was also an attack in Ndera and another of his associates was also attacked. Subsequently there was the case of Gishushu where I personally intervened in order to calm down people. Four persons were killed by APR members who had come out of their base at the CND. And when they were leaving, they abducted people that they took back with them to their base in CND. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, let me interrupt you just for a moment in order to give the Trial Chamber and the staff the names you have just referred to. Gapyisi, Emmanuel, is number 109 on the spelling list. 
And the second name you mentioned -- 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The second name is Bonameka (phonetic). 
@MR. CANTIER: 
You said Gishushu. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Gishushu is the village which faces the CND. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
One hundred and thirty-four. 
Now, which periods are we referring to now? Attacks and political assassinations started from when? Just give me a time frame, very briefly. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In December of 1990. And these acts were perpetrated throughout the war. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, are you aware of a document entitled "Study on terrorism in Rwanda since 1990", which was produced by the national gendarmerie in Rwanda? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, before I answer your question, I do not know whether I answered your question or whether what I said on the matter was sufficient. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I shall come back to the matter subsequently; have no fear, Mr. Renzaho. Now, I am referring to a document which is on the third Defence list under number 12. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I have read that document you're referring to. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well. Let me remind you -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
The document which was provided to us on Friday appears to be from an annex to a book written by Mr. Lugan. Once again, I don't know exactly who wrote it and when, and it doesn't -- and it's only in French, and I stand corrected, but it's not readily apparent who compiled this document and what period it is covering. And I don't know if my learned friend can assist us before he starts referring the witness to the document. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, I believe that it was the first attack of my learned colleague on Professor Lugan. In order to continue with that attack, one will have to wait until next week. But the document is indeed mentioned by Professor Lugan, annex 1 of his book, "Rwanda, enquiry on the genocide." This document which is mentioned in the annex does indeed refer to the Rwandan republic national gendarmerie criminal research and documentation centre in Kigali. It bears the title "Study on terrorism in Rwanda since 1990". According to Professor Lugan, it dates back to June of 1993, and the date, Mr. President, Your Honours, seems to be confirmed through the examples provided in the report on page 584, since he refers to events that go up to May of 1993. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you need additional information, Mr. Moses, or do you have any comments? 
Is this the complete report of June '93, or is it an excerpt? Is this what we find as the complete annex in Lugan's book? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. Since we did not merely target the city of Kigali, this report covers the whole of Rwanda, and it is the entire annex to the book. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. What is your first question? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, this report mentions a number of attacks, and I'm going to mention only those that took place in Kigali. Moreover, you've mentioned some of them yourself. So still on page 584 -- I am sorry that there is only the French version, we found it only in French. This page gives examples of the attacks in Kigali, that is, this one in Kigali bus station; 2 June 1992, Petrorwanda; 22 April 1993, the central post office in Kigali. Mr. Renzaho, do you confirm these incidents and the dates? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, the problem now is that this annex only has one page number, and that is page 279. We find that on the bottom of the first page. But in the photocopies we have received, there are no other page numbers. Well, one would assume, then, that page 280 is the one on the left-hand side following, et cetera. But it's not so easy to find out exactly where you are. Can you tell us what the title is on the pages you are referring to now, so that we can identify that page with certainty? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I apologise for the complications, Mr. President. Maybe not the page, but the numbers, because they follow. I mention this because under number 41, under the title "Relations between the attacks and attacks committed with the use of explosives", that's number 41. And effectively you won't find the page numbers in this photocopy, but you will realise that our document is complete because after 41 there you find 42. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine. And are you now under iv, and you started with number 41, and then are referring to number 42, and you want Mr. Renzaho's comments on any of these two attacks? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President. Under 41 I limited myself to examples of attacks cited in this report: Butare, Kibungo. But I restricted myself to those that occurred in Kigali. You have the list there before you. So you have the third one there, 19 March 1992, Kigali bus station; 25 April 1992, bus station, Kigali; 2nd June 1992, Petrorwanda Kigali -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down. All right. So it's on the following page under "examples". It's noted. Yes. We now have this list of examples in front of us, and you want a comment from Mr. Renzaho? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It's already been done, Mr. President. I asked him if he confirmed the dates and the places of those attacks, and he answered in the affirmative. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Still in that document, under chapter 8, entitled "masterminds" or "commanditaries", in French, it is written, and I quote: "We can affirm that the mastermind of most of these attacks is the RPF." Mr. Renzaho, what is your comment on that observation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do confirm what is written here, and I say so with full knowledge of the facts, because I know that from the outbreak of the various incidents, a committee of experts was appointed to assist the gendarmerie service in charge of criminal matters to conduct the investigation. And each time the result was that the incidents were committed by agents of the RPF. The last incident was the one that happened in Cyangugu préfecture, where young persons were arrested in the heat of the action and they confessed. That is what I had to say, thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, a while ago you mentioned assassinations. Do you recall that of Mr. Gatabazi? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I was not in the country at the time of the assassination. I was informed while I was abroad by the organisers of the seminar that I was attending. And I was -- I was shocked because I was told that, at the time I was receiving the information, the city of Kigali was on fire. That was the -- the hard information I got. So I received that information, and I was given the secretary there that had a telephone, and I contacted those I could contact in Kigali, and the information was confirmed, as well as the measures that were taken. That reassured me a bit, and I stayed on. That is how I learnt of it. And when I returned home, I found the city of Kigali under a curfew. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'm going to -- to read out a paragraph from Mr. Ruzibiza's book. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it's in our folder on the third list, number 9. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I've had the opportunity to look at the proposed documents, and can I just make a general comment, because I don't want to be having to repeat: I'm not going to be objecting to any official documents, I'm not going to be objecting to any UNAMIR SITREP reports, I'm not going to be referring to -- objecting to such documents. But to try and get in through the back door, as it were, comments by a disaffected person who hasn't testified in this trial through -- by means of a passage from his book, in my submission falls within a category of document that should not be referred to in this manner and which is a back door way of trying to enter -- enter it into evidence. 
I've had the opportunity, Your Honours, of reading Trial Chamber I's decision on the Nsengiyumva motion to admit documents as exhibits from the Military I trial, where a similar approach was taken in respect of statements. And the Trial Chamber made it quite clear that there were appropriate ways in which documents could be put to witnesses in cross-examination, but that it was not to circumvent Rule 92 bis, or -- which, in my submission, this is potentially -- this isn't to do with background information, it's to do with matters which are in contest -- which we do contest. So, can I indicate that this is one of the documents that I will be opposing being referred to or introduced. Thank you, Your Honours.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I don't see any clear reason from the legal standpoint for any objection to this reading out of comments or to the tendering of this document. The Prosecutor would recall the position that Mr. Renzaho occupied, and it is on that basis that he has built his charge, the charge brought against Renzaho, and that position had to do with the maintenance of law, order, and security in the city of Kigali. 
Indisputably, the attacks and the killings were major disruptions of public peace. I will read out an excerpt from a book, which is a general analysis, and hear the specific case of the assassination of Mr. Gatabazi. I don't see how this document cannot be used by the Defence for the defence of Mr. Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which page? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Page 225, and I would merely put the first paragraph to Mr. Renzaho, and it has to do with Mr. Gatabazi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
About rumours? That's the one? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is how the sentence begins, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has expressed a view as to who was behind certain attacks. That view seems to be the foundation for why he wants to draw our attention of a statement in a book which is a public document accessible to everyone. 
The Nsengiyumva decision was a bit different in various respects, so we will allow you to go ahead with this sequence, Maître Cantier. Please proceed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, I will move on by reading out the paragraph to you, by asking you a number of questions. 
"Rumours were spread to the effect that Gatabazi had been assassinated by the Impuzamugambi youth of the CDR, because he was one of the opposition leaders who were opposed to President Juvénal Habyarimana. But, as I have said before, he was assassinated by the RPF. And he was not the only one on the list of persons who were going to be killed."
Mr. Renzaho, what is your comment on that analysis of Mr. Abdul Ruzibiza? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I believe that analysis is correct and real. I would like to say that terrorist acts were committed by the RPF agents on the ground, and the trick they used was to try and turn away responsibility for these crimes to some other persons. Well, strictly speaking, in 1993-1994, at the time Gatabazi died, there was no longer a Habyarimana regime. 
So, the ten days before the RPF infiltrated persons to commit crimes, and then used their relays to spread the information that the crime was committed by the regime was a frequent one. So, at the time when Gatabazi died, it was rumoured that Gatabazi had been killed by the agents of the president, who considered him a personal enemy, as they claimed. 
And we had occasion to observe this situation well before. The mix-up of war and multiparty politics only led to a situation of misinformation, subversion, and destabilisation that led to the lawlessness that we witnessed in April 1994. And maybe it was part of the strategy that was designed beforehand to take over power. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please try to be briefer. 
Here follows the next question. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you personally participate in the negotiations that led to the Arusha Accords? Please answer by yes or no to speed up proceedings. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I forgot to apologise. I really want to make an effort. 
No, I did not participate. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And concerning the KWSA negotiations, did you play any role in the negotiations and conclusion of that accord? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, I was not involved in the negotiation of that accord. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, concerning the Arusha Accord -- well, at least with respect to the aspects dealing with the law and order and security in Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, the aspect that had to do with UNAMIR. The overall mission of UNAMIR falls within the -- that peace accord. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, with respect to the KWSA accord, did it also have provisions that targeted the city of Kigali and the security situation in the city of Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, the KWSA accord had to do with the security of the city of Kigali which fell within the security perimeter defined by the same KWSA accord. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I am going to read out to you point number 5 of the KWSA accord. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a document in addition to the Arusha Accord, a document that has already been tendered in evidence, D. 36; D. 36, the KWSA accord, points 4 and 5 of the KWSA. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am going to read them out and then put them to your position (sic). 
"Point 4: The commander of the Kigali secteur is responsible for the setting up of the weapons safety zone of weapons in Kigali in collaboration with the national gendarmerie and the local police. 
"Point number 5: The infantry battalions and UN observers deployed all over Kigali will provide the personnel and assume control of the weapons safety area." 
Mr. Renzaho, were you aware of these provisions, and how did you interpret them? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I was aware of them. I interpreted them as an exceptional situation for the city of Kigali, which under that period was placed under the occupation of UNAMIR forces. 
And with particular regard to the involvement of the police, I would like to tell the Chamber that the police did not play any role in the activities that were planned by UNAMIR officials, and any request for the training of staff between UNAMIR and the préfecture did not yield any positive result. So the police is cited in there, but it was never involved in the security mechanism for the city of Kigali. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, can you tell the Trial Chamber about the origins of civil defence and also tell the Trial Chamber what you know about the setting up of this mechanism? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, let me tell you, as regards the origins of civil defence, that once again it was all due to the war, the war and the way it was waged. It was a revolutionary war which made use of all the tricks that would enable one to reach one's targets. Concretely, in the field, there were, in fact, incursions and also actions aimed at circumventing the Rwandan armed forces operations conducted by the RPF, which was using methods whereby people would disguise as ordinary citizens with a lot of clothes that they could change in or out of quite rapidly, and they would infiltrate the population, and they would perpetrate atrocities; people were killed, other people fled, and when they so wished they would abduct people, because as I stated previously the country was surprised by the attack, and we did not have an army or sufficient soldiers to cover the whole border in order to be able to organise surveillance of the border. It was not possible, so there were spaces that were not covered by the surveillance, and the attackers had probably, through reconnaissance work, seen which locations they could infiltrate the country from. 
So we were surprised by these attacks which created a lot of damage within the population and it was not possible for us to intervene. And for that reason, it was absolutely necessary to involve the population, for them, at least, to mention to us the arrival of these fighters so that the intervention forces could come and assist the population. So those were the objectives of the civil defence mechanism. The populations were asked to participate in their own defence. I do not know whether I answered your question, and I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, yes, you answered the question, but can you tell us in what part of the country the civil defence system or mechanism appeared at the beginning? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, it was set up in the northeastern part of the country and in the northern part of the country, which were those regions that were attacked first by the APR troops. I thank you.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you do know that the Prosecution has charged you with having been the leader of civil defence in Kigali and in PVK and, consequently, has charged you with being responsible for the killings that were perpetrated by the civil defence forces. Could you tell the Trial Chamber what specific role you played in the organisation and the operation of civil defence in Kigali? And, perhaps, before you do that, you should tell the Trial Chamber what were the governmental decisions that were adopted regarding civil defence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I might disappoint you if I tell you that I played no part whatsoever in the organisation of civil defence and that civil defence was never implemented in Kigali. 
As for the second part of your question on the decisions adopted by the government, I only know of one which came along with the guidelines by the prime minister dated 25th of May 1994. And in Kigali we were -- we almost had no resources left, and I do not know whether one can indeed talk about civil defence under such circumstances. If I may be given some time, perhaps I can be more explicit. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I believe that is the wish of the Trial Chamber, since this is one of the main charges brought against you. And in order to orient you somewhat in your answers, at least as regards the format of your answer, you do know that there had been an exchange of correspondence between yourself and the ministry of defence on the 30th and 31st of March 1994 dealing with this very issue. Could you please explain to the Trial Chamber the reason for this exchange of correspondence and also the effective role you played in the setting up of civil defence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I thank you, Counsel. I wish to state that from January of 1994 the situation in Kigali was such that we were expecting the war to break out in Kigali. And I can tell you that there were rumours that started as early as January of 1994 whereby the RPF was ready to stage a coup in Kigali. And some explosions, the bombings that were not fully understood at the time, especially the bombing we referred to when we talked about Gatabazi's death, can be explained by the fear within the population that violence was going to break out in Kigali when most Rwandans, not all of them, but most Rwandans were in fact operating in a context of peace within the framework of the Arusha Accords. This to say that evidence was -- intelligence was being received and the chief of staff, who was the head of the unit, probably -- was probably thinking of what would have to be done if the war was to break out in Kigali. 
I attended a meeting during which he took stock of the situation and his main concern was the system of alert for all the soldiers who were spread out in the different neighbourhoods and who could be -- or could have problems grouping and joining the rest of the forces. So this was the starting point for this idea, and he believed that the soldiers were not the only ones to be concerned by this matter. 
There was also the issue of the protection of populations if fighting was to break out in this large city that is Kigali. What was to be done? It was clear that there were three armies on the site, that there were strategic positions that were occupied by the UNAMIR forces, and that it was not possible to base one's activities on assumptions whereby some of the positions would be lost or not. And for all those reasons, it was thought that the matter was to be looked at in a comprehensive manner. I attended the meeting and I was asked to provide lists of the staff members who were to undergo training and to be used within the framework of this civil defence mechanism. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, the letters you have referred to are the letters you sent on the 31st of March of 1994 with a list of people to the ministry of defence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, indeed, Counsel. I provided the lists, but there was no action carried out in order to implement these ideas. There were decisions of the government which were to be made following the action undertaken in order to finalise the programme of civil defence on the 6th of April 1994. There was the attack that did not enable us to do anything, because on that date we did not have any civil defence system implemented in Kigali. So that is what I wish to explain. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The meeting took place, when? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I do not recall the date, but it was towards the end of the month of March on the 28th or -- 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, in the letter of the 30th of March reference is made to the said meeting. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you have just stated that a civil defence system was to be set up, but in view of the events this mechanism was never implemented. So how do you explain the presence of Major Bivamvagara at the PVK? And, perhaps, before you do that, you could tell us when that person arrived there and what was his mission? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, thank you. I might once again imitate some people, because what I have been able to hear here is in contradiction with what I am about to tell you. Bivamvagara was a reservist. He was a reserve officer, and the act calling upon the reserve officers was signed by the minister of national defence on the 1st of May. And if my memory serves me well, on the telegram referring to that matter, the name of that person is listed amongst the officers who were being called by the minister of national defence, in accordance with the provisions of the ministerial decree which dealt with the reserve officers of the Rwandan armed forces. The persons listed were asked to state whether they were ready to serve the country, and if -- they were given four days to respond, which means that Bivamvagara came -- or went to the general staff in May at a date I am not aware of. And since he could not find an office at the military Kigali camp, which had been shelled, and even the general staff headquarters had been destroyed, he was brought to me in order for me to provide him with office space at the préfecture, along with the team he came with. So I gave him some office space at the préfecture. So this is what I can say regarding Bivamvagara. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Renzaho, but you only responded to my question in part. What was his mission, since the Prosecution claims that Mr. Bivamvagara was the person who came under your authority in order to set up the civil defence system at PVK? So, can you please tell the Trial Chamber what was his role and what was his specific function? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you very much, Counsel. I believe it is a good thing that you remind me of that aspect. Bivamvagara came not in -- not as someone who was seconded to the préfecture, but rather as an officer who was being entrusted missions by the general staff. He came in order to recruit and train the fighters that the army required in order to fight on the front in Kigali. 
Perhaps I should say a few words on the situation prevailing in Kigali at the time, if I am allowed to do so; but if it is not necessary, I will not insist on that. But I had no authority on Bivamvagara. He did not come to work for the préfecture of Kigali. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Later on we shall deal with the matters linked to the situation in Kigali town after the 6th of April 1994, Mr. Renzaho. 
Mr. Renzaho, still with regard to civil defence, and from what we have been able to read -- or what we have heard through testimony before this Trial Chamber, and I am referring more specifically to Mrs. Alison Des Forges -- this system, which was quite sophisticated, had provided for the setting up of a fund that was aimed at financing the civil defence activity. So, my question, Mr. Renzaho, is whether you created such a fund at PVK and whether you received any funds from the government for the purpose of financing these activities, because it was necessary to feed, train, these people. So this is my question, in two parts.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not set up a fund at the préfecture in Kigali and I did not have the necessary resources to do so. If I placed myself in the context prevailing at the time, it was virtually impossible to set up a fund because most people had fled the city, especially the traders; and all those who had things to protect had fled. 
The second question had to do with the uniforms, the food, and the training of these people. If Bivamvagara came in order to recruit, train, soldiers in order to help the army fight on the front, it goes without saying that it was the army that was responsible for these people. It was the army that took care of them. I had no means in order to carry out such a task. I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, we are now going to move onto a different subject which will deal specifically with your life and your attitude from the 6th of April 1994 onwards. And my first question regarding that date is: Where were you in the afternoon of the 6th of April of 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In the afternoon of the 6th of April of 1994, I was at the office. I was in Kigali and I was in my office. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you go back to your place of residence in Kanombe in the 6th of April in the evening? And if your answer is in the affirmative, at what time, and how? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
On the 6th of April of 1994, in the evening, I went back to my place of residence in Kanombe, and I used the Mazda double-cabin pickup truck of the urban development unit, because my own official vehicle had been sent to the garage during the morning of the 6th of April of 1994. And I reached my home around 7:30 p.m. or thereabouts. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, since you referred to it, could you tell the Trial Chamber what was your usual official vehicle? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
My official vehicle was a Renault 21, which was white in colour. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what did you do during the night from the 6th to the 7th of April of 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I remember that upon arriving at my house I went to take a look at the work I had asked for on the right-hand side of the residence I lived in in Kanombe. It was a separation wall which was to be built, because in that part there were reeds that had been eaten up by ants and I -- it was necessary to replace that part of the enclosure by a brick wall. I noted that the work had not been done, so I went inside the house. I spoke to the children who were doing their homework, and then we started eating; and towards the end of our meal we heard explosions, and we did not know what they were. Insecurity started immediately because the second explosion was incredibly loud. And immediately after that I heard gunshots which came from the lower part of the Kigali-Rwamaganda (phonetic) road, towards the camp. 
In order to give you some idea of the fear in which we were living, I immediately thought that we had come under attack. And the intensity of the gunfire was increasing, so I requested the members of my family to switch the lights off, to close the windows, and to also hide in the corridor, because I had a house with a long corridor with the rooms upstairs and downstairs. So that is where they hid. And along with a policeman who was stationed at my house, he took the left -- or rather the left-hand side of the house, and I went to the right; and that is how we remained. We waited. But there was still gunfire, so we waited. In that way there was insecurity. 
Increasingly, people were hiding out in the houses. We couldn't see anyone moving about in the neighbourhood; and around 3 a.m. we noticed that the gunshots were -- seemed to come from further down and were going out of the neighbourhood. And that was when I decided to go to Kanombe. So those were the events as I lived them throughout that night. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, when did you hear about the death of the president?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I learned about the death of the president when I switched my radio on in the morning, around 6:30. I switched the radio on and I heard classical music, which was unusual. After sometime there was a communiqué from the ministry of national defence announcing the death of the president. And that is how I heard that the president had died. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, there are two things that are quite surprising when one listens to your narration and on which I wish to put questions to you. How come you did not listen to the radio? Because, if you had listened to it, on the basis of what a number of witnesses told us, you would have heard about the death of the president. So that is my first question. 
My second question is: Why did you not try to reach your minister or any other official you were accountable to in order to try and determine what was happening? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. With regard to your first question, if I asked that the lights be switched off, I also asked that the radio be switched off. These are security measures that come to me automatically under such circumstances. I did not know who was behind the gunfire, and in that situation of fear we were in, I immediately thought we were coming under attack. After having asked that the lights be switched off, I would not have switched on the radio. 
I don't know whether you have at any time gone around a house in the night and heard a radio on. If a radio is on in a house, then it indicates that there are people who are there. That is why I asked that everything be switched off in order for us to protect ourselves because I was fearing that we would be reached by any object that could have been thrown through our windows. So that was the reason why I asked that everything be switched off. 
Now, regarding the second question, that is to say, why I did not call the minister of defence or the minister of the interior, or any other person, how could I have done that when I did not have a telephone? I tried to say so under different circumstances and it appeared strange. But, once again, I need to state that I did not have a telephone, and I could not go out of my place of residence because I was afraid because of the insecurity. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to adjourn now to three o'clock. 
$(Court recessed from 1304H to 1500H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. 
Maître Cantier.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, a while back you explained to us what you did in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April, and you told us that you thought it was a fresh military assault attack by the RPF. Did you, sir, learn of a report, a KIBAT report, dated 21st January 1994? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, Exhibit 11 -- document number 11 in our third list. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, Counsel, I did read that report. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
I will share with you the contents of the third paragraph of that document, and then I will put a question to you. I will read:
"Rumours are abroad -- there are rumours in Kigali -- there are rumours in Kigali that the RPF has already arrived in town with 3,000 men, including the 300 -- no, 600 I think, officially ensconced in the CND. In the north there are also 15,000 RPF troops waiting for a signal to launch a coup d'état from Kigali." 
My question, sir, is the following: Were you aware of those rumours, and was it those rumours that led you to believe, in the night of the 6th to 7th of April, that it was an RPF attack? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I was aware of those rumours and practically everyone in Kigali, the entire population of Kigali, was aware of those rumours. And things that arose in those days could but confirm those rumours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A general remark: The last question was leading, and there were quite a few also before the break. So far, there have been no objections, and we have simply disregarded it. But when we are coming to the core of the case, then it would be good if we would avoid it. I am just stating this for the record so that the reader of transcripts later will not wonder why no one mentioned this. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. It's my legal tradition which leads me to be suggestive in my questioning, and sometimes I can be even worse. I do beg your forgiveness. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, the Prosecution at first asserted that you were present at the meetings held at the chief of staff headquarters in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April. Can you tell us why those assertions were jettisoned? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I don't see how the -- one, it's no longer in the indictment, so it's not relevant. Secondly, how can my learned friend ask the witness to comment on why the Prosecution may have amended the indictment? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the point you want to highlight, Maître? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I know that that charge was withdrawn; I have said so. And I also know what Mr. Renzaho is charged with. And in the indictment it states that he had authority over the armed forces, over the gendarmerie, and consequently that clarification as to what was decided at the outset seemed important to me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, were you present at the chief of staff headquarters between the 6th and 7th of April? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, sir, no. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, this morning I think I asked you when you had learned of the death of the president, and you answered "At about 6:15 a.m., on the radio". My question is the following, therefore, what did you then do? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you for your question. What was my reaction? I was dumbfounded, and -- which was unusual for me -- I donned my military uniform. I went out to seek information at Kanombe military camp, because I had no information. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
At what time did you arrive at Kanombe camp? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I left for Kanombe camp at about 7:00 and I think arrived at about ten past. It didn't take long to get there. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you tell us what is the distance between your house and Kanombe camp? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Kanombe military camp is about 600 metres from my residence. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Who did you meet at Kanombe camp? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I saw and greeted the camp commander, Colonel Félicien Muberuka. He was holding an officers' meeting and it was towards the end of the meeting. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Muberuka is number 289 on the list of proper names. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what, therefore, was the tenor of your conversation with Colonel Muberuka? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I was concerned as to what had happened during the night, and I was asking what happened during the night, and I was answered, I was given information regarding the attack. I also asked whether what provisions were being made, disposition. And that's when the camp commander invited me -- informed me that there had been a meeting at the chief of staff headquarters, and at that meeting the participants had agreed to inform the unit commanders, operational sector commanders, in addition to the officers who had taken part in the meeting. I asked where the meeting was to be held, and I was told it would take place at the general staff headquarters. That was the information given to me. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
At what time did you leave Kanombe camp and where did you go? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It was about 8:00-8:15. I also asked the commander to lend me a vehicle to take me to Kigali because I had no vehicle. And he gave me a jeep -- I think it was his own jeep -- and he detailed someone to accompany me. It was his own jeep. Because he was busy with other things, he asked the driver to take me and to come back as quickly as possible. 
So I exited with his vehicle, and when I got -- for those who know Kanombe, when I reached the military clinic, dispensary, I crossed the pickup that had -- I had ridden in the day before, and I signaled the driver to follow me. So I went home with the jeep. I took a few things. I snatched up a few things quickly and started off for Kigali. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And where did you head for? Where did you go? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I went straight to my office at the Kigali-ville préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And at what time do you estimate that you arrived at your office? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It must have been about 9:30, 9:40, 9:45, something like that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Whom did you find at the PVK when you arrived there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
At the PVK, well, there weren't many people, not as a usual working day, because the office was still closed, the curtains drawn. I found the police on guard, as well as two people who'd fled to the préfecture. And a bit later, I saw Major Nyamuhimba, the police commander. Those were the people I saw at the préfectoral offices. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
You spoke of refugees. Can you name them; some of them? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I don't know. If it doesn't threaten their security in any way, I can give their names. The first person was Célestin Gahamanyi, director general of development at the ministry of the interior, who was a Tutsi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the previous name was number 414 on the list. Now, you have in the enumeration you just gave us, you mentioned one name. Shall we take it number by number? This first name, where do we find it, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 101, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then the next you wanted to mention, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
The other one was Mr. Ntawiha. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 402 on the list, Mr. President. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
In the morning on the 7th of April did you make any telephone calls? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Honourable Judge, thank you. Yes, in passing at the small Akajagari trading centre, there was a shop -- a small shop with a telephone, and I borrowed the telephone. I telephoned. I merely wanted to contact the minister of the interior, but I didn't reach him. It didn't take long. I couldn't get through and I went back by foot to the camp. Yes, that's true. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, concerning those two people whom you have named, what did you do in their regard? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I felt that they were threatened, which is why they had left their homes to come to the préfecture, and I tried to talk with them to know exactly what sort of threat. And they spoke of the gunfire they'd heard here and there throughout the night -- during the night, and they probably thought that some people were killed. And I asked the policeman present to open, to take them inside and show them where they could rest. In fact, there was a room very near the conference hall where they could rest. That is what I did. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
With regard to the PVK staff, who was the first person you met? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I saw Major Nyamuhimba shortly after meeting the two people who had sought refuge at the préfecture. And I needed to go into my office, and I asked the police to go and get my secretary so as to open the office. It didn't take long. He soon came and opened the office, and then I could ask -- I asked him to try and contact the bourgmestres to know what their situation was, and the heads of departments at the PVK, so as to know what their situation was. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What was the name of your personal secretary -- personal assistant? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
His name was Alfred Sibomana, number 532 -- Sibomana, Alfred. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
These two refugees, did you know their ethnicity? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President. They were both Tutsi. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
On that morning of the 7th of April 1994, did you take part in a meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, it's true. On the 7th in the morning, I went off to take part in a meeting. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Can you tell us which meeting -- what meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
A meeting of the officers, unit commanders, operational zone commanders, and the members -- and at the ministry of defence and at two general staffs. The meeting had been due to be held at the general staff, but in view of the large number of participants, they sought a much bigger hall, and the choice fell upon the meeting hall at the École supérieure militaire. So I went to the general staff and I asked the officer on duty, who informed me that the meeting would be held at the École supérieure militaire. So I immediately went there. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
To be quite clear, Mr. Renzaho, is this the meeting Colonel Muberuka had informed you of that very morning? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Who took part in that meeting? Who was in attendance at that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The list is a long one, I don't know if I could remember the names of everyone who attended. I only remember a few names. There was General Ndindiliyimana, General Rusatira; unit commanders such as Leonard Nkundiye from Mutara secteur, Sebahire; there was the paracommando battalion commander; there were officers from the general staff, such as Musirango (sic), Joseph. I can't -- I don't have the complete list of all the officers who took part in the meeting, but they were very numerous. 
$(Pages 37 to 49 by Judith Baverstock)

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now we only need the last name of the person whose first name was Leonard and the person whose first name was Joseph; so these two were mentioned on the spelling list maybe? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Leonard Nkundiye, the surname Nkundiye, number 377 on the list. Rusatira, Léonidas, number 475. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just give us the last name of the person whose first name was Joseph now, please. That is all we need, the rest was easy.

@MR. CANTIER: 
344. 344 on the list, Mr. President. 344. But I don't have the first name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good, let's continue. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, what decisions were taken because of that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The main decisions that were taken, in that order, the first was to try and help the politicians to set up an interim government to negotiate with the RPF and to set up the transition institutions. The second decision was that a crisis committee was set up to manage the difficult situation while awaiting the formation of the interim government. And the third decision was a recommendation to all the units to try, by all means, to bring back discipline and order in their ranks, to regroup, and to call up their men so as to give them instructions. Well, I believe that all the points that were discussed at that meeting were contained in a report, and I can't have all of them in my head, but I believe there is a report of that meeting. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, who chaired that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The chair of that meeting was General Ndindiliymana. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, why did you attend that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
First, I was not authorised to take part at the meeting, since it was a meeting of unit commanders; I wasn't a unit commander. It also included secteur commanders, but I did not command any secteur. It also included general staff officers and officers in cabinets, but I wasn't any of the above. 
So, to take part at that meeting I had to ask for authorisation and I gave the following reasons: The situation at first view was very dangerous and the initial victims were the population of the city of Kigali. So I requested that I should attend that meeting so I could put forward the security concerns of the population. Well, they heard my request and I was authorised to attend the meeting. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, you told us that the meeting set up a crisis committee; could you tell us what the duties of that crisis committee was supposed to be? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And before doing so, who authorised you to attend the meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
It was the chair of the meeting and the participants. The chairman asked whether I could take part in the meeting and the others said: Why not? So I took a seat. It was the chairman to whom I put the question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So it was raised during the meeting, at the beginning? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
You mean the question of my presence? Yes, that question was raised at the meeting. So immediately I got in I raised the question, because to be able to take part in that meeting I had to raise the question. I couldn't have just entered properly and taken a seat amongst persons who had certain powers that I did not have. So, I raised that question initially. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Does this mean that if we saw the minutes of this meeting, it would reflect the fact that you came and asked for permission? The document containing the resolutions in the meeting, I'm sure had minutes of this meeting. Would they contain this fact that you came into the meeting, stood up and asked for permission to participate? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Your Honour, if those minutes exist, then they would show that is what happened. Personally, I read an extract thereof, somewhere in Rwanda, where it arises the resolutions taken, but I didn't see the minutes. But if the minutes do exist anywhere, then they would show that it happened that way. Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, my question was actually directed to the crisis committee that was set up by the meeting; who headed that committee and what were its duties? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. From what I know, the crisis committee was decided upon by that meeting but it did not craft any specific duties for the crisis committee. It had its major missions, notably, establish contact with political parties, a recommendation to the army chief of staff to ensure follow-up in the units to make sure that the unit commanders installed discipline. But the duties of the committee were not made known to me. I think they did not have time to prepare the duties of that crisis committee. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, with respect to the decisions that were taken on that day, a while ago you mentioned a communiqué that it made public --
@MR. CANTIER: 
I have here a document, Mr. President, Your Honours, which is in our folder, volume 1, number 37 with the reference K0149001. The Defence folder number 1, number 37, and the text we have here is in French and a bit of it is in Kinyarwanda.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'd like to read out that communiqué to you, so you can tell the Chamber whether it is actually what was decided at that meeting of 7 April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just a practical matter, in the copies I have of Defence volume 1, the number rotation is from numbers 1 to 30 and then it starts over again from 1 to 23. Does this mean that we shall look approximately around number 7 in the second round? Please indicate the exact nature of the document you are just referring to? You kindly gave us the K number. But what kind of document is it? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I do confirm that -- it's a follow-up to your first question. Secondly, it's a transcript of a programme of regional Rwanda during which the meeting of 7 April held at the higher military academy was mentioned, and during which the decisions or recommendations taken at that meeting were read out. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, do you know which number it is in the Defence folder? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Number 7 in the second round. And I don't know if our friend is able to assist us also, obviously he's only concerned with pages 6 and 7 of the document, which are the only pages that are in the bundle. I don't know if he is able to assist us to know which radio station and the date that it was broadcast. I think it might be of assistance to us all if -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, we have located the document. And now, can you help us with the source, as asked by the Prosecution, Maitre Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it's a key document that we found in the records of the Tribunal. After reading it, it became clear that it was a transcript of a programme, it has no date, but the transcript shows that it is a -- it's a transcript of the meeting that took place on 7 April at the higher military academy. 
Your Honours, knowing that we've looked for the report, as the Honourable Judge asked a moment ago, we couldn't find it and this is the only document that we could find. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, but do you know whether this comes from Radio Rwanda or RTLM? Do you have any information? 
You, Mr. Renzaho, do you know? This is a transcription of something that was said during a radio transmission, is there any knowledge in the courtroom? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I believe it is a transcription of a programme of Radio Rwanda. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, sir, we are trying to find out. We're looking for it. And my assistant has just pointed out to me, that the document that I've just mentioned, reappears in Exhibit P. 48, the Prosecution 
Exhibit P. 48. So it is actually a programme of Radio Rwanda. 
Prosecution, it is your Exhibit P. 48. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's continue. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, I'll read out the decisions taken, and you'll confirm whether it was what was broadcast over Radio Rwanda on 7 April: "Participants at the meeting took the following decisions and recommendations: First, make every effort in collaboration with all the other services concerned for the situation in the country to get back to normal as quickly as possible. For that purpose, members of the armed forces are urgently invited to get hold of themselves and display restraint and discipline to reassure the population and restore calm in the country. Second, create a supportive condition or atmosphere to enable the governing structures in the country to work in calm. And those in the name of the Rwandan armed forces, the participants, I gently request the political authorities to invest more in the discharge of their duties especially at this time of crisis." 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, would you like to say something? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I was sitting quite silently and innocently here. I hadn't made any sign I think to indicate any intervention. But it seems to me it is pretty close to P. 48, page K0368587. I think you're right, or your assistant is absolutely right, that it is the same document. And we have that document in all three languages, so I'm not so sure that we need to read it into the record following your indication that we already have this as an exhibit. 
So, what is it then that you want to ask Mr. Renzaho about in connection with these four points in 
P. 48? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Well, so we can now be sure of the content of that document, my question to Mr. Renzaho has to do with the fifth decision or recommendation that was taken. So I could read out that recommendation to him: "Following the problems, the security problems, participants at the meeting called on the authorities of the préfecture to examine the security situation in their jurisdiction including the curfew, if possible, and they reiterate their call to the population to bear with the situation", and the rest is not necessary. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, my question is: During the course of that meeting were you entrusted with any special mission within that crisis committee?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, I did not take it that way, in fact I did not receive any special mission. But that recommendation is clear for all the préfectures of the country, the préfets were supposed to make every effort to restore order and security within their various jurisdictions. And later on that is what I tried to do unsuccessfully. I had a bit of success, but it was generally unsuccessful. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I still want to come back on this document, because I consider it essential. It is one of the earliest official documents after 6th April. Point number 4, I would like you to comment on that point: "The senior officers of the Rwandan armed forces call on the population to remain calm and to reject any demands made on them that are likely to fuel hatred and disorder of any kind." 
Sir, how did you understand that recommendation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I believe that I sat silent in the atmosphere that prevailed in that meeting, and the determination of the participants to try to check the wave of violence that was sweeping across the country, and I thought -- and I heard at the meeting, I heard the speakers saying that for unit commanders the absolute priority was to get hold of all soldiers and bring them under control. Now, if that means that there were some military men who were uncontrollable and were causing havoc within the population, killing et cetera, so maybe the disorder that was seen was related to that. So, the absolute priority was to get all these persons under control and establish discipline in all the units. 
I will not hide it from you that at the end of the meeting I had the personal conviction that the situation could be brought under control. The participants at the meeting displayed so much good faith. Unfortunately, fighting broke out a few moments later and those involved did not have the time to implement these recommendations. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We will come back to this point, Mr. Renzaho. My next question is: What did you do after the meeting? Could you tell us at what time it ended? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The meeting at the ESF (sic) ended about 12:30 or thereabouts. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And what did you do after the meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
After the meeting, I was part of the team that was selected to prepare a message to the nation. The concern of the participants was to reassure the population and to call on people to remain calm and to avoid plunging into futile violence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, in spite of the fact that you had to ask at the beginning of the meeting to be present, it ended by you forming part of a drafting committee? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Well, one thing followed the other. First of all, they set up the crisis committee before the end of the meeting, and then I was appointed to replace Colonel Félicien Muberuka in the crisis committee and to prepare the message to the nation. I was part of the team that was supposed to draft the message. I think that is how one should understand things. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, so as to better understand things, the document that was broadcast over 
Radio Rwanda that you've just mentioned, is it the message you are talking about? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, it is not the message that was mentioned, the point you just raised. The message as such took the form of a communiqué and I would like to tell the Chamber that we have -- we were driven by the concern of involving everybody. And I recall that as we prepared the message, we had 
General Dallaire with us who participated. So a communiqué which came out, which includes all of that message. That's not what you said. Maybe there were excerpts of the report of the meeting of what you've just read. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, my question now is: At what time did you leave the small committee that drafted the document and what did you do after that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
At 2:30 p.m. we received a statement from General Dallaire that the RPF had broken from its base with the intention of going to punish the elements of the Presidential Guard, and emotions were running high, so I left the area where we were to go back to my office and I got there about 3 p.m. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, who did you meet on your way back to the PVK? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
When I got to the préfecture I met the bourgmestre of Kacyiru commune, Mr. Nyirikwaya. He had fled. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The name that has just been mentioned is number 427.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, are you through with your answer? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, I want to continue. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Please go ahead.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. So I discussed the prevailing situation in this commune with him. And he told me that -- Kimihurura was almost into -- engaged in fighting in the night. And that is where he was staying and he had come to look for me because he had received a phone call in the morning, because in the 
message -- I'd mentioned in the message that I'd left to my secretary. So, I saw that there were already about 50 refugees or so at the préfecture. Then I discussed with my secretary to have the content of the report I read that morning on the situation, and the report was alarming. Several persons we tried to contact were not available; they were not found. And that is the situation of the people I met when I got back to the préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, to be more specific in your response and to testify as clearly as possible for the Court, you said you'd asked your secretary to contact the bourgmestres and the conseillers; is that what you just referred to, is it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And then, more specifically, what did he say about the conseillers and the bourgmestres that you were trying to contact? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you very much. So I had already got the Kacyiru bourgmestre on the spot. The secretary tried in vain to contact the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune and hadn't found him. He also tried to call the bourgmestre of the Kicukiro commune who was -- who could not be found. And some had served -- had acknowledged that they were present at home and agreed to come to the préfecture, but others had not been there to answer the call, or had not answered the phone. So, there was exchange of information. There was a continuous exchange of information that revealed the absence of some conseillers, some counsellors, who were said to be dead: Gikondo, Gisozi, Kacyiru, Kagarama, 
et cetera. So the situation was very worrisome. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, did you try to speak to the citizenry as of the 7th -- already on the 7th in the afternoon? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, in the afternoon. I sent a communiqué to be broadcast, a message calling for pacification. I forgot to tell you that I also tried to know what was the true situation in the préfecture. So I asked Mr. Butare, he didn't live very far from the préfecture, to try and contact the conseillers and members, those available, to the urban security committee for a meeting at the préfecture the next day, the 8th, as of 
9 o'clock. Where there was no other means to contact them, except by phone, so that was done in preparation for the meeting due to be held the next day. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Butare, Jean Baptiste, is number 66 on the list. I am referring to P. 48, page 3 in the French and page 2 in the English. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
I will read this to you and you'll tell us if, in fact, it was you who drafted in the afternoon of the 7th: "The préfet of Kigali urban préfecture calls upon" -- "urges the population to respect the instructions issued by the ministry of defence and calls upon the citizenry not to undertake acts of aggression against others. To be vigilant in these difficult times and to co-operate with people involved in security and make their task easier. Every householder is responsible for the security of his home and to prevent infiltration." 
Mr. Renzaho, is that the communiqué you've just referred to? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, that is the one I spoke of. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you come -- did you return home in the evening of the 7th? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, I did not return to Kanombe in the evening of the 7th of April. I attended the first meeting of the crisis committee in the evening after 7:30 p.m. and the meeting ended quite late, at about 10 p.m., and we were in security because there was fighting throughout the town and I did not dare take the risk of returning to Kanombe and I slept at the préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, when did the hostilities resume between Rwandan government forces and the RPA in Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, the hostilities between the RPA and the Rwandan government forces resumed in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April essentially, more particularly towards dawn when heavy guns, shelling from heavy guns was in Kimihurura and the CND near the Medali. But, more specifically, combat resumed in the afternoon of the 7th of April at about 1 p.m. This was a general RPF offensive in Kigali town and that was the offensive that General Dallaire came and informed us of. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you learn of a statement made by the Belgian military concerning the first combat in the night of the 6th to 7th of April? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I know that document. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is in volume 1, Your Honours, item 14. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I will read a short extract from this document and ask you whether the information contained therein is correct. Okay, 0075307 at the top of the page are: "Commander Vandrisch then explained to us that the RPF had left the CND and was advancing on our position in order to go and attack Kanombe military camp." 
And I will go on because it is possible to date the document, two paragraphs further on: "The next day on the 7th of April we had the same task." 
What would be your comment, Mr. Renzaho, on this statement? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, that just confirms what I've just said. The RPF troops left their barracks at the CND in the night of the 6th to the 7th to seize and guard a number of immediate objectives, which they would require to insure for ensuing operations. And, on the same line of thinking, that statement shows that, indeed, the RPF had tried to approach, or make a breakthrough in the direction of Kanombe military camp. And that also confirms, or tends to confirm, the general state of insecurity that I referred to, that I told you about, and after the downing of the airplane continued until about 4 o'clock in the morning.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the Belgian name which was referred to a few seconds ago was spelt V-A-N-D-R-I-S-C-H. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us briefly, in brief, what parts of Kigali on the 7th of April fell to the APR (sic)? I had asked you to prepare a map, to sketch a map, have you done so? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said which parts of Kigali fell to which army; can you just repeat the abbreviation, Maitre Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I asked Mr. Renzaho to sketch on a map of Kigali those secteurs of the town that were taken in the evening of the 7th of April by the RPA. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Counsel. In general terms I would identify the following secteurs: Kakiru, Kimihurura -- even if it wasn't all of Kimihurura that was conquered -- Remera, Gisozi, Kagugu and two secteurs of Kicukiro that were totally involved in combat. 
In fact, the situation becomes very clear after the 15th of April where you see that all of the north and east and south-east, even south, were totally conquered by the RPF troops; in other words, Kacyiru and Kicukiro, Kicukiro -- only a very little part of Kikundo secteur resisted. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, could you repeat the last sentence, Mr. President, please. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you repeat the last sentence, Mr. Renzaho? "In other words", and then you continue. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I was saying, in other words, Kacyiru, Kicukiro, were totally conquered or involved in combat, mainly in Kicukiro, that part of Kicukiro and part of Kikundo which resisted, thanks to Mburabuturo, a centre of resistance at the place just named. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The two last names, shall we repeat them? Part of -- be very brief now, please. Just give me the two names so that we can proceed. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think he said it was part of Kikundo. Witness is spelling Kicukiro. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is number 245. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mburabuturo, M-B-U-R-A-B-U-T-U-R-O. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good, that's the one we wanted. Thank you. 
Next question please? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, in Kigali préfecture how many secteurs were there? How many secteurs were occupied by the RPA? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The préfecture of Kigali -- Kigali urban préfecture consisted of 19 secteurs and until the 15th, ten secteurs were occupied. 
If you'd allow me, I should like to add in fact the occupation as such doesn't mean much, if you don't realise -- appreciate what we're talking about. The scale -- size of the secteurs and what it means in terms of local government because the administrative structures were completely dislocated. As regards the size of the secteur, first of all, they blocked entirely all the supply lines and reinforcements that might come from the north to Kigali and all the high points overlooking the capital and from which points the other secteurs would simply -- were simply exposed to cast a bombardment from which they could not resist until the end, because the high point had been occupied by UNAMIR soldiers who in the ensuing days, even after the 6th, began to pull back bit by bit. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, since you have sketched this map for us, please you will give it to us so we can tender it to the Court. So that was the situation in Kigali on the evening of the 7th. Mr. Renzaho, when and how did you learn of massacres in town? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I learnt of massacres in the town already from my first contact with the refugees that came to the préfecture. It wasn't on a whim that someone who has a house leaves his house. So I could feel that things weren't right. But even in listening to the radio before I left home, I felt that this event that had occurred, the attack, and in view of what had been happening in the previous three months, January, February and March, had forced some persons to flee -- had caused victims. I could feel that an earthquake was underway and, if other unfavourable factors had not further deteriorated, the situation -- because unfortunate events never occur singularly, but not usually accompanied by the cascade of events that ensued.

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
When did you realise that the massacres were targeting the Tutsi and the political opposition? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, right away I thought that these things were going to happen. When I heard of the incident that had happened -- the outbreak of the war in Kigali, I felt that something very, very bad was going to happen. And this was the outcome of the development that had been known in the country on account of the terrible war in which people gradually moved towards radical positions on the issue of war: who is for war, who is against war. Who is for war meant who was for the RPF. And, then, who was against war -- and who was against the ideals of the RPF. 
And so this hardening of the blocs and the -- the -- that phenomenon that developed, it developed between 1990 and 1994 and kept getting worse. Increasingly, it felt that the conduct of operations, especially on the -- on the side of the RPF -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't get that last sentence, Mr. President, his microphone went off. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's start again, Mr. Renzaho. You were just about to say something. "Who is for war meant who was for the RPF", et cetera. That sentence is all right. And then, "And so this..." take it from there, please. Did you talk about crystalisation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, Your Honours, I mentioned the -- the forming and hardening of blocs following these dangerous developments, wherein all the other problems of the country had been forgotten and everybody focussed on war. And so when the event happened -- and with the tension in which we had been plunged since January of that year, the explosion was well-nigh inevitable, so right away I thought that a disaster was going to call. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what was -- what were your activities in the morning of 8 April 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In the morning of 8 April, I took part in a crisis meeting that did not last for long. We did the bulk of the work the evening before. I returned to the préfecture for the urban council crisis meeting. We started at about 9 a.m., and the meeting ended at about 2 p.m., and I didn't have the time to go and visit my family. I went to Kanombe on that afternoon of the 8th of April, and I returned at about 5 p.m. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, let's look at a few stops on the day of the 8th. I'd like to ask you: What was the first meeting that you had on the morning of 9 April -- sorry, 8 April? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The first meeting I had was a meeting of the crisis committee in the morning; it did not last for long. Then, I returned to attend the urban council security meeting at the préfecture office. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So when you returned to the PVK, after the crisis committee meeting -- and here, we are talking about the morning of 8 April 1994, so what was the first meeting that you had? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Oh, that is clear then -- it was the meeting of the urban council security meeting, but there were little meetings like that that may not look very important. Actually, I first made a review of the policemen who were standing there, who had assembled. Then, I had a discussion with these policemen and their commander. Then, I briefed them very quickly on the situation that was prevailing, and then I asked them to keep in mind the situation in which we found ourselves. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, that is the question that may be of interest to the Chamber, because those policemen were under your orders; is that not correct? And, if I understood you well, that was the first contact you had. So can you tell us how many policemen were present at that assembly, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I found about 45 persons who may have assembled there. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Was the police commander present? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, the police commander was present. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
How do you explain that only 45 policemen were present at that assembly out of the total number that you gave us a while ago? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you very much. I think the starting point of the event that occurred in the night of the 6th to the 7th. The employment system of the policemen was a decentralised one where a number of policemen were assigned to the bourgmestres and the conseillers for some time. And at the end of their mission, they came back and were replaced by other policemen. That was the recommendation of the urban council which gave preference to that kind of rotation -- permanent rotation. Which preferred rotation to permanent employment, rather, because permanent employment may -- may create habits that may harm discipline. 
So, by rotating the policemen, it meant that they'd come back to -- to their original place where others went to replace them on the ground. And the bourgmestres and the conseillers did not have the same policemen all the time, because that's the rotation system -- were able to keep an eye on all these policemen. 
When the event occurred, we were not able to lay hands on these people. I believe that there were -- there was talk in the various secteur in which they found themselves. Some were killed, and maybe some even tried to flee or to desert; that is possible. 
But, the police assembly that morning was made up of 45. The others had simply disappeared; I could not see them. In fact, I asked the police commander to -- to carry on and to try to -- to assemble his men. But with those that we had, we had to start tackling the problem, because we had held a meeting with the responsible persons, and we had to see what we could do. Those who were able to come could come and tell us the situation they were facing. But I could not send them away empty-handed without sending some policemen with them to help them in the work of providing security. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You said that in September-November '91 the number of police officers was about 250. Is that correct; yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, that is what I said. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In April '94, in principle, was the number the same or had it increased or decreased? Was it still 250? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I believe that the 250 figure that I gave was the highest we attained; we could not recruit any more. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
About the same number in April '94, is that the evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And of these 250, only 45 were present at the meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That is what I saw, and that is the figure I actually saw. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that mean that 205 approximately had deserted or were some of them on rotation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
There were -- they did not answer "present" at roll-call. So we continued to try to assemble them, but that is what I noticed on that day, and it was the first day on which I had the possibility to -- to come in contact again with the administrative structure since the event started. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are going to pursue this, Maître Cantier, because it would be interesting to know the total deployment of police officers from around the 6th of April throughout this 100 days. But you can choose the timing of your questions. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, I had planned to mention the issue of deployment. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Before that, Mr. Renzaho, I would like you to tell us whether you addressed those policemen in the morning of 8 April, and if your answer is yes, what message did you put across to them? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I have said that I addressed the policemen -- the policemen present there, and that I briefed them on the security situation in the city of Kigali. I called on them to invest in the various missions that they would have to help the council authorities to restore law and order -- and above all, to help some persons who may be in danger. I said so in reference to a meeting I'd held with officials of the commune. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, my next question is precisely: How were the policemen then distributed? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
You see, I had a police commander -- at least, on that one I abdicate -- because it was not my duty to distribute people like that; there was a police commander to do that. I laid down the principles, so the conseillers there received a policeman each to help them in their work of intervening within the population. But as to what policeman was assigned to what duty, that was the duty of the police commander. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, if we understood you properly, you laid down the principle of giving each conseiller a police officer, and it was then your police commander, Nyamuhimba, who had the duty of implementing that instruction; is that correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Counsel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that was a leading question. 
Shall we repeat the name of this police commander, it's number? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Nyamuhimba -- 414, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I would like to defend myself on the leading question. I just wanted to rephrase what the witness has said just to make sure we had understood him. I was not trying to lead him in anyway. 
@MR. MOSES:
With respect, one of the reasons my objection was going to be also -- not only that it was leading, but that it did not, in fact, summarise what the witness had said. It was, in fact, putting words in his mouth because the witness had never said previously that he had given instructions for one policeman to go with the conseillers. He had earlier indicated that he had left the logistics, as it were, up to the commander. So my objection was, in fact, two fold: One, that it was leading; secondly, that it was in fact misstating and putting words into the witness's mouth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the next question. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, if you check you'll see that he actually said that he had instructed that the conseillers be assigned an officer, so I did not change anything. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will look at the transcripts, but now we have to move on. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, if I am not interrupted unnecessarily, I'll move forward. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you mentioned the meeting that took place after the urban council security meeting -- I think I've not invented that one. So, can you tell us when that meeting started? Who participated in that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The meeting started at about 9:30, and the participants were certain members of the urban security council meeting who were present, including myself, the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, Munyansanga, a gendarmerie officer, Major -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Something", I can't get it. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
And the conseillers who -- who attended the meeting. We did not have all members of the urban security -- urban council security meeting at that meeting. The meeting -- I addressed the war situation that we were living through. I -- I don't know whether you want me to move on? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'll ask you a specific question, but the name that was mentioned -- you mentioned a Mr. Munyasanga, number 326 of our list of proper nouns. 
Mr. Renzaho, did you give another name? I can't recall. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I mentioned a gendarmerie major, Ngirabatware. There were other officers, Colonel Rutayisire, who was in charge of intelligence at the ministry of national defence. There were other officers, too, who came as observers. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, you mentioned Major Ngirabatware, 364. Then you mentioned Colonel Rutayisire, 479. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That colonel was not a member of the meeting, he came as an observer to see what was happening. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, we are talking about the urban council security meeting, Mr. Renzaho. What decisions were taken at that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you very much. After introducing all members around the table, we observed that the situation was very serious. The administrative structure was in no way responsible for what was happening. And then I asked, as the first measure, that an administrative authority be restored in -- in the communes or in the commune, because only one was left in the secteur, in the cellule -- to know what was happening. 
Then, since there were people from the gendarmerie -- and the situation was clearly very serious with regard to the fighting, I asked that the collaboration that existed between the administrative structures and the gendarmerie brigades -- that is, the territorial brigades of the gendarmerie, I asked that such cooperation be very close, so that both structures could help themselves mutually so as to check the killing and the confusion that was happening within the population. 
Then, there were very few of us -- very few civil servants had come to the meeting at the préfecture. And the same situation prevailed in the commune; most people had simply disappeared. 
So, it was necessary to bring together these people and make the little group that was left operational to cope with the situation. So we had to create flexible, tailored structures capable of carrying out certain activities on behalf of the population. At that stage, the problems were simply countless. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Renzaho, but my question is: Who, among the communal personalities, who were those that participated at the meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I mentioned Bourgmestre Nyirinkwaya who, unfortunately, had lost his (unintelligible) -- his commune. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Was the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge present? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not see him. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Was the conseillers of secteurs present at that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
They were present, they were there. Those who were available were there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a reference to the name of a bourgmestre who had lost his commune. Can we have that name again, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President, Pierre Claver Nyirinkwaya, N-Y-I-R-I-N-K-W-A-Y-A.

@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Honestly, it was a long time ago, and I think my memory's going blunt. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover). Karekezi was there. Sezibera, I think, was there. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I asked you the names. You -- you have to tell the Chamber whether you are sure or not. Do you recall the names of the conseillers who were present at that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Frankly, I did not undertake that exercise, but I know that the conseillers were there. Now, to list them in any kind of order is difficult for me. Well, except -- I'm given some time to put the pieces together, but they were there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you just mentioned two names and we want to make sure that we get them right. Are you able to help us? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Karekezi is number 424 (sic) and Sezibera is number 527.

Did you say "424" for the first name? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No, 224 and 527. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, 224 is correct, yes, thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, what I heard but doesn't appear in the English transcript was something which had indicated something of a witness protection. Your Honour may need to check the French. When the witness said that "My memory" -- just after when he said, "My memory is blunt", I had heard him indicate (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover). Now, that -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is true. In the French version we will place under seal at 16:57:06 the part of the sentence starting with (French spoken), and then there are four other words in French. We will delete that segment, from (French spoken). And if any of those elements appear in the English version, they will also be placed under seal. 
It's 5 o'clock. Do you want just to finish what we are doing now or can we simply continue tomorrow morning, Maître Cantier? 
Maybe by tomorrow morning he will be clearer with the names as well, so the night will give some time for reflection.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
A final administrative issue: You have partly referred to Defence volume 1, where there are a lot of documents, partly to the third list of Defence documents which were distributed this morning. It's important that we know exactly which document you want to tender. 
There is a risk that if you only tender these documents in two days' time, there will be confusion. So may I ask you and your team to ensure at the end of the day that you are absolutely certain as to what you want to tender, and then when the examination-in-chief is over, that you kindly produce a list in writing so that we can save time. Will you please do that? Then we do not have to interrupt you all the time by tendering exhibits. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, that is exactly the system that we've set in motion this morning and it has worked. 
Thank you.

Very good. 
We will then continue tomorrow morning at 8:45.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning; the Court is in session. The Chamber is sitting under 15 bis this morning because Judge Arrey was not feeling quite well. She hopes to join us later today. 
Yesterday the last issue raised before we adjourned was the need to place portions of the transcripts under separate cover. That was done, but upon further reading, I can see that a remark by Maître Cantier, later on, could give a hint as to what was placed under separate cover. So we will therefore, in the transcripts of yesterday, delete the words in Maître Cantier's question to Mr. Renzaho, starting with the words "when you" until the word "publicly". And then the last sentence "you can write them", et cetera, remains in the transcript. 
Secondly, just to dispel any doubt, the fact that we noted in the courtroom that there is now communication of documents concerning Mr. Munyeshyaka, there will be no need for a response from the Prosecution. There is an oral decision by the Chamber that the Defence motion for disclosure of those documents is moot. So that's settled. 
Maître Cantier, you have the floor. 
Good morning, Mr. Renzaho.

First of all, we should like to draw the Bench's attention to the motion for an additional witness to which we have not had a response as yet, and time is short because the section is telling us that if we don't have a rapid response, the witness will not be able to appear next week, whereas we really wanted to call that witness next week. 
Secondly, another brief comment, Mr. President, with our witnesses. The problem with our witness -- we've just learnt that a witness who we intended to call is in Rwanda but didn't want to come because felt under threat, was the subject of an attempt -- an attempted arrest and had to flee. It is only our team with our Rwandan investigator who had the coordinates, that witness's coordinates, and I wanted to speak about that before continuing with examination-in-chief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Couldn't we reserve this for some later stage? And it is now on record that this is a problem, but it will, of course, primarily be a need for a report to the registry, if it is the view of the Defence that there is a link between the attempted arrest of this person and his testimony. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It was a witness that we intended to call, and who told us that he wouldn't come. He did not make a deposition. And there was an inquiry undertaken by the registry, of which I think the Bench is aware. I merely wish to state it in public. We don't need a response from the Trial Chamber, but it's serious enough for us to bring it up at the time when we have heard about it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We understood that the person had not testified. The only point now is that there will be a need for an administrative follow-up in addition to stating it for the record as you did now in the courtroom. Thank you for drawing our attention to that now. 
As regards the awaited decision on the additional witness, the Bench is aware of that. We have been in touch with the witness protection unit to know when a decision has to be rendered, should we grant the motion. But, on the other hand, we also wanted to give the Prosecution some time in order to see whether this could be solved in a way before the Chamber rules on it. And we will come back to the Prosecution later today and hear updated views on the motion, in view of the fact that you have had some more time, even if the information came late and not in conformity with the 21 days rule. 
So we promise to come back to you on that, Maître Cantier, as soon as possible. 
Let us begin. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, yesterday, before we adjourned, I was asking you what decision had been taken in respect of the urban security committee meeting on the 8th of April. You began to speak of it. Could you summarise for us the main decisions taken that day? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I was summarising the decisions taken as reestablishing the communal authority over the situation, because things were falling apart. Secondly, we (unintelligible) that we were opposed to wildcat roadblocks; and thirdly, absolutely resist killing and disorder in all parts of the city. And fourthly, since we were not very numerous, many people had gone, were in hiding, we had to use the few staff we had rationally so as to respond to the needs of the people, and I, to that purpose, set up the crisis unit which would follow things full time, and a number to call in case of distress was given to the citizenry that they might, in case of need, call the préfecture for assistance. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I want to put a specific question to you: The crisis committee -- the crisis unit -- cell, crisis cell, who was it composed of, and what was that cell's task? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The cell was composed of myself, the bourgmestre who was present, and other bourgmestres if they came forward would join it, Mr. Butera, and Mr. Bisanukuli, who was the secretary with the secretarial staff available to him. And they had the telephone of the préfecture secretariat to receive the calls from members -- from citizens in -- with problems, in distress. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us, at this point, what was UNAMIR's role in respect of maintenance of public order and safety? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, before answering that question I think I have not said that there were technical commissions. We set up technical commissions to undertake activities on the ground. Because the crisis cell was at the préfecture, who heard requests and examined the situation, but there were technical commissions who were intended to go out and act. There was the -- I'll mention them quickly. 
There was the administrative commission in charge of distribution of documents, laissez-passers, or to help people who lost their identification papers; and then there was the social affairs commission that was responsible for (unintelligible) and assistance to refugees; the infrastructure commission which was responsible for supply of water and electricity; and the logistics and supply commission, which handled logistical problems and the organisation of supplies to Kigali town. And then there was a police detachment which was ready to intervene at any time; they were ever ready to assist people in danger. Those were the commissions that helped the cell do its work. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you have to spell the other name after Mr. Butera. Can you do that, please? Or do we have it on the list? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. Number 66, 66. And the other name was 43, Bisanukuli. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. And now the answer to Maître Cantier's question about UNAMIR's role, Mr. Renzaho. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I would ask him to put the sentence again -- put the question again. I have fragments of it in mind, but I don't remember exactly. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
What was UNAMIR's role within the PVK perimeter with regard to maintenance of public order and safety before the events of the 6th of April? And then I'll ask you about after the 6th of April, and in the period from the 6th of April to the 5th of July. So, first of all, before the 6th of April. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. UNAMIR's role in maintaining public order and safety in Kigali town before the 6th of April was, first of all, to watch over -- watch out for circulation of armament within the framework of the KWSA agreement, the Kigali weapon-free area, so as to ensure a serene atmosphere for establishing the transitional institutions. Therefore all military camps, all gendarmerie camps, were under the effective control of UNAMIR units who monitored the movement of weaponry, including lists of troops guarding the camps, and who held the keys to the arsenals and weapons stores, munition stores. And so that -- for that purpose, UNAMIR might set up mobile roadblocks on the main roads in Kigali to check whether weapons were moving or not. 
And as regards to the safety of the citizenry, patrols were held -- organised on a regular basis, and UNAMIR troops would undertake motorised patrols in the various neighbourhoods of the town. And we experienced that system, that arrangement, from January up to the 6th of April 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Renzaho. Now my question is: How did those UNAMIR activities, in the field of safety -- public safety, security, how did they coordinate with you in your capacity as head of the PVK, with regard to public order and safety? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, thank you for your question. I am sorry to say so here, but I was not involved in how -- how the situation was organised and managed by UNAMIR. They alone set up their work plan, and they had a gendarmerie unit which was supposed to help them. The préfecture was in no way involved. And to illustrate what I am saying, I'd like to refer to a public safety meeting organised at Kigali urban préfecture, at my request called by the minister of the interior, to try and clarify the situation. 
In the period in question, we had a very deteriorated safety -- public safety situation, and the threat was exponential, and it was absolutely necessary to clear things up. And I remember that that meeting was organised at the préfecture, presided by the minister of the interior, in the presence of the minister of defence, in the presence of General Dallaire, Colonel Marchal, and the two chiefs of general staff. The préfecture was already -- was also involved and these matters were discussed. Numerous matters were discussed -- raised and discussed by councillors, and I think even the chefs de cellule had been summoned to the meeting. So there was quite a few people. 
But I regret that the decisions taken at that time were not applied because our problems were not solved. It was accepted that UNAMIR patrols would continue -- they would continue in various neighbourhoods, in association with certain patrols by the citizenry in difficult -- in hot spots, such as Bilyogo, where there'd been problems, for example, after the assassination of a party activist which had stirred up the population, and we had a difficulty. And also in Gikondo. That was the situation, and I sincerely regret there was no relational framework making it possible for me to indeed be involved in UNAMIR's decision-making process, with an eye to what was the facts on the ground among the citizenry at the time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When was that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. If my memory serves me well, the meeting was on the 3rd of February 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Bilyogo was number 41. What was the other location you mentioned? Please repeat it. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I spoke of Gikondo. G-I-K-O-N-D-O. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It's number 129, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, to illustrate what you're saying, did you learn of a United Nations report by Mr. Booh-Booh on the situation in Kigali, and the presence in Kigali town of United Nations troops? It's a report of -- dated the 5th of April 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
This is the document you referred to yesterday morning, the outgoing code (unintelligible) -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness -- counsel states in English. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
-- which we gave in separately from the lists and the files. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I remember it. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you remember paragraph D, K0080228, entitled "Kigali sector"? Do you remember, Mr. Renzaho, the extracts? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Vaguely, but perhaps you could refresh my memory because I don't have it all. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So I will read it in English, and I beg the Chamber's indulgence for my English. 
"Three hundred fifty-one vehicles and 65 (unintelligible) -- foot (unintelligible) in Kigali in order to ensure Kigali weapon secure area established daily six checkpoints at -- at different places in KWSA. Random patrols and checkpoints -- and checkpoint saturation monitored by force HQ." 
Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us what you think what those figures -- do those figures match what you observed on the ground? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I don't know if all the vehicles were in Kigali, but I know that UNAMIR units were approximately 2,500. Now, how -- those forces had to cover the whole territory -- in fact, not all the territory, but mainly in Kigali and in the demilitarised zone, the buffer zone, as it was called, but with observation points in other préfectures. And what you said, what you read in the report concerns -- is what the normal deployment of UNAMIR was. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, let's come back to the situation before the 6th of April -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And just for the record, the understanding, then, seems to be that in this document, which is an outgoing code cable from Booh-Booh to Annan dated the 5th of April 1994, on page 4 of 9 pages, under section D for David, the introductory sentence refers to the fact that UNAMIR has conducted 351 vehicle and 67 foot patrols. That must be the meaning of these technical abbreviations in the text. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Quite, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sorry for interrupting you, Maître Cantier. Please proceed with your question. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, my question was: What did UNAMIR do in the field of competence you shared with it to fulfil its task after the 6th of April, in the evening and in the following days? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I regret to tell the Trial Chamber that, contrary to what usually occurred, the UNAMIR troops did not undertake foot patrols in the neighbourhoods. And it is inexplicable in view of the fact that I learned -- I read the -- the report of that meeting organised at Rwandan army general staff HQ in the night of the 6th to the 7th, where it was recommended that mixed patrols of UNAMIR and the gendarmerie be rapidly organised in all neighbourhoods of the city, so as to prevent disturbances in those difficult times. And the -- it was not done. 
That was confirmed to me when I took part in the meeting at the École supérieure militaire at the ESM on the 7th. General Dallaire came a bit later at about 11 a.m., and he was given the floor to speak to the participants. And in his speech, or in his statement he said two things: 
"The situation, as it is, concerns you, the unit commanders. You must take control of your units and face up to the situation." 
And the second thing was: 
"Don't expect from us to do anything. I gave -- I have ordered -- given the order not to move our troops." 
So, the reason for not fulfilling what had been decided at the meeting -- decided at the meeting was the responsibility of the UNAMIR commanders. I don't know if I've answered your question. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, you've answered the question. But I should nonetheless like you to tell the Trial Chamber, in concrete terms, on the ground, what did UNAMIR do? Did it do anything, still in respect of maintaining public order and safety, or did it fulfil other missions? But what concerns us is public order and safety in the capital -- capital city. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. What I observed, and it must be true, as of the evening of the 6th of April 1994, UNAMIR forces began to concentrate, and several reports mention that fact. So that means that the normal activities of controlling the neighbourhoods and keeping watch over the population was not done. The concentration continued -- accelerated, and I am obliged to regret the unilateral withdrawal, because at other times we mention the presence -- or, other witnesses here mentioned that there were three armies in Kigali. There were procedures, rules of engagement, a certain coordination. 
And the events accelerated after the 6th with apparently no person at the helm, no captain at the helm. And the strategic positions that were in Kigali were abandoned and, of course, then occupied -- taken over by the RPF. So the safety -- public safety situation, the security situation, could only deteriorate. And that favoured the advance of the RPF. That's what I saw. That's what I observed and took note of. Thank you, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you try to request UNAMIR presence in particular places on particular occasions because you wanted it to intervene to ensure the safety of the citizenry? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Yes, I did try. I tried unsuccessfully. The first case concerned, at that time, the evacuation of the orphanage in Gisenyi -- the Gisenyi (sic) orphanage in Nyakabanda secteur. And we requested -- we asked that the orphanage that had provided shelter to many people be evacuated, and to that end we needed sufficient force that could impose itself with certain moral authorities. It was accepted, but the next day there were problems and I did not see it actually effectively implemented. It would be done later -- it was done later, but not at the time. 
And the second case was the Saint Paul-Sainte Famille, the place constantly shelled by the RPF from its positions in Kacyiru. And you can -- it's very visible -- Saint Paul is very visible from there, and I'd asked that a detachment at least of UNAMIR observers be put there, that the UN flag might fly there to prevent the shelling. But that also wasn't done. I had difficulties in finding sufficient troops, so it wasn't done. But we did organise together operations to exchange refugees between belligerents, which operations managed to save many people, and also at certain times convoys encountered difficulties. But I think that's it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We'll come back to that.

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Can you tell us what were the salient points up to the 8th of April 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. On the 8th of April of 1994 -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
In the afternoon, since we spoke about the meeting you held in the morning with the urban security council. So my specific question has to do with the afternoon of the 8th. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In the afternoon, immediately after the meeting, I asked my colleague, Butera, Jean Baptiste, to compile information which reported on the meeting we had just held. And there was an emergency in that the different committees were to be made up -- or, set up and were to be given their duties. So I asked him to do this organisation work. And I went to Kanombe; I went to see my family. And upon my return, I asked Butera to give the phone number that we had heard on Radio Rwanda in case of danger, and that was all. I do not recall having participated in any other activity. I do not recall whether I attended a crisis committee meeting during that evening, but those were the main activities that I carried out during that afternoon. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, you just told us that you went to see your family on the 8th of April in the afternoon in Kanombe. What was the situation along the way in the centre of Kigali up to Kanombe? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you very much. Strangely enough, I did not come across any roadblocks manned by the population along the road since I used the main road, the Avenue de l'armée, passing by the Hôtel des Mille Collines, then I turned in front of la Rwandaise, and next to the roundabout I used the OAU boulevard. In Gikondo there was a roadblock manned by soldiers which I passed through, Gikondo (unintelligible) and Gikondo Rwandex, there was also another roadblock manned by soldiers, and I continued on my way without coming across any other roadblock, up until I reached Kanombe. There was fighting, I could hear shelling explosions in the Kimihurura secteur and further down towards Kacyiru. That is what I can say. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
How was your family and how was the state of your house when you reached Kanombe? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
When I reached Kanombe, I was first of all impressed by the number of people who were at my residence. The house had not been touched or bombed, because no bombs had fallen next to it as of yet. My family, of course, was in a state of panic. The children were afraid and the mother was crying, and when she saw me she said that it seemed that there were very serious things going on and people had come to seek refuge here, and there had been some killings in the neighbourhood. I went to see the people who had fled and who had come to my house. I spoke to them, and it was obvious that everyone was frightened, extremely frightened. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Renzaho. Let us now move on to a very important question which has to do -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you say that you passed by Gikondo and Gikondo Rwandex; was that the testimony? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Mr. President. I said that I passed by Gikondo Rwandex. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, did you give the order that roadblocks be set up? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
During the meeting that took place at the urban security committee on the morning of the 8th of April, was such a decision made? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. On the contrary, we noted that roadblocks had been set up in an haphazard manner in the town, and that no administrative authority had any control over those roadblocks. I requested that the officials try to control the situation in the cellules, in the secteurs, in the communes. That was what I did. But, prior to that, people would do as they pleased. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, still a specific question: Did the government ever decide to set up such roadblocks, and was such a decision conveyed to you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I note, Counsel, that the announcement of the president's death led to the disbandment of the government. That was what I noted. Some ministers tried to flee as they could, and they sought refuge in embassies. Others who did have some protection were killed. And this remains a mystery to me to this day, but they died. They were killed. So when the officers met on the 7th at the military school, as I told you, there was nothing. In any case, I was never told that two or three ministers met somewhere and carried out any action. So, as far as I'm concerned, I doubt, and I even deny, that any member of the government ever requested the population to set up roadblocks during that period. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, Mr. Renzaho. In the same vein, since we're all aware of the importance of this subject, I wish to ask you the following question even though you have already answered it partially. Let me ask you when the roadblocks appeared or were set up in the town of Kigali. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I believe the first roadblocks were set up in the secteurs that were close to the RPF headquarters. And that was done during the night from the 6th to the 7th. And then with the ongoing attack of the RPF in the afternoon of the 7th, a number of other roadblocks were set up. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, since you have just stated that it was not the government who gave the order to set up roadblocks, and since you have just testified that you did not give such an order at the PVK, who took the initiative to set up those roadblocks in the town of Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I would be hard-pressed to tell you who took the initiative to set up those roadblocks, because I don't know. However, since I lived in that city during the period in question, let me give you a few (unintelligible) that will show you that the phenomenon is not as surprising as one might think. 
Throughout the war there were crisis periods during which the political parties, or the youth wings, or through actions that were carried out through the city led to the anger of the population. So that sometimes you would use a road, and upon your return you would find that same road blocked. In order to give an example of what I'm saying, let me tell you about the -- the example of the road leading from the Kigali hospital to Nyamirambo, which was closed in May of 1993. The population had set up a roadblock on that road because there had been deaths in the Rwampara secteur. And since I followed this matter, people wished to protest against insecurity, and especially against the fact that there was nothing one could do to improve the security situation. When I went there, people told me, "Well, you are the préfet. If you are not able to ensure security, just go away and find someone who can do the job, who's more important." That is what they told me. They told me that they were looking for the minister of national defence. I told them that they were exaggerating somewhat. 
But, in the final analysis, I thought it was necessary to go and look for the minister of defence, who was kind enough to come to the location to talk to the population. And it was only then that they accepted to dismantle the roadblock. And we followed the population to that place where three people had been killed by unknown people, but the killings were attributed to the RPF. So they asked that a patrol be based on -- in that location, and a decision was made by the minister to do so forthwith. So this is an example which gives you the context. 
If we go to the period which followed the assassination of Gatabazi and Bucyana in February, and subsequently of Mr. Ingabire -- Katumba -- in March, then I can tell you that it was not only Kigali that came under attack, but the whole country. There were roadblocks that were set up, but there were also other people who were killed. There were refugees. When the events of the 6th of April 1994 occurred, we had centres in Kigali which were sheltering refugees who had come at the time of the events I mentioned. So the events that occurred after the death of the president was announced are not surprising for anyone who has been able to follow the security situation in Kigali. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when was this event involving the minister of defence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, thank you very much. I do not have the precise date. I believe it was in May of 1993. And the incident that took place on the same day -- and which might be a good indicator because we will probably be able to find it somewhere in the documentation, on that same day there was an attack at the Kigali central post office. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We heard you say May 1993. That was the evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I referred to the month of May of 1993; is that correct. Because the minister I was referring to was Minister Gasana, James, who was still holding that position at the time. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, when did you learn -- or, when did you understand that the roadblocks were used in order to sort out and kill people who were targeted because of their ethnicity or because of their political leanings? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I observed that there was anarchy everywhere, and that from the outset. But, until then, before the 10th which was the day when there was a massive influx of displaced persons from Nyacyonga, the situation was serious but had not deteriorated too much. So I became aware of that after the 10th of April of 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Number 409. Yes? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, if I may, I wish to add a few words: I do not believe that these criminals thought that the victim was a political opponent. But -- and what I tried to explain yesterday, I have a feeling that all these people believed that anybody who was involved in the war or who had any contact with the RPF were the enemy. Thank you.

@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel. I witnessed this incident. There was a convoy that had been organised by UNAMIR for 72 or more Tutsi refugees who were being transferred towards the RPF-controlled area. And the incident occurred at the level of the passover at the street light located at the place called Akanogo (sic), not far from the Sopecya station. I don't know whether this station still exists, but that was the exact, precise location where the event took place. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, let me interrupt you for a moment in order to give the spelling of the names you referred to. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Kanogo is number 216 on the list, and Sopecya is number 540.

@MR. CANTIER: 
You may proceed, Mr. Renzaho. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
So, it was in the afternoon -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you say 216? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Two hundred and sixteen, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Two-one-six? All right. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It was in the afternoon, I was at the office. A delegation of soldiers came to tell me that there was a very serious problem at that location, and they were asking for my assistance in order to solve the matter. I was not aware of the operation, and I thought it was necessary to do something, since the incident had occurred. So I went to the location, and when I arrived I saw a very large crowd -- a very large, overexcited crowd with a few members of UNAMIR. And I tried to talk to the mob, but I could not find anyone to address in that crowd. I could not find anyone. I was trying to find someone I could talk to. 
The crowd was getting more and more agitated, and by chance one of the members of the group asked the crowd to listen to me in a loud voice. It is only after I identified him that I took him aside and asked him to find three or four people representing the group, and we stayed on the side in order to talk. I asked them why they were there, why they were overexcited, and what they wanted. And they told me that refugees from one side only were being transferred in a unilateral manner when they were -- they were aware of the fact that people who were in the centres under the control of the RPF were selected and killed, and that others were forcibly transferred towards Byumba where they were also sorted out and killed. So that was the problem as they put it to me. 
I tried to make them understand that the authorities were -- would only get involved in situations that would be to the benefit of the populations, and that no authority would ever plan any activity that we -- would be detrimental to the population. And that my mere presence was enough for them to understand that I was there to protect their interests, and that whatever I was to request from them, they should do. Then they asked me whether I would be in a position to bring back their parents or friends who were on the other side. I solemnly promised that I would do my best for the exchanges to take place in such a way that those who were in the RPF-controlled area who wished to go to the government side could do so, and that those who were on the government-controlled side, wishes to go to the RPF side, also be able to do so. That was the best solution. 
The discussion took quite a while, and the crowd was getting more and more excited, since we were not able to convey our decisions to the crowd. We finalised our discussion and we agreed that we would inform the population that the convoy would go back to the Hôtel des Mille Collines for the simple reason that it was night already and it was clear that the operation could not be finalised successfully. And we also informed them that we would agree on a day when people would come from both sides and the -- the transfer would take place in the open. So they accepted the proposal, and I asked the man who appeared to be the leader of the mob to come with me in order to inform the crowd of the decision we had just made. And the crowd calmed down. 
We had to take action swiftly. I asked that vehicles -- in the meantime other people came, there was the general chief of staff and other people who joined the initiative. And we asked the convoy to retrace its way. The convoy went back to the Hôtel des Mille Collines. I remained there with the crowd because of a young woman that they had abducted, and I fought in order to be able to save that girl. They tried to intimidate me, they fired shots, but I was able to seize that girl from them. We were able to leave the location, and that is what happened when that incident occurred. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Renzaho. This is an example you have just given on the situation that prevailed and those roadblocks. Now let me put a specific question to you: What measures did you take in order to dismantle the roadblocks? Or, if you were not able to do so, to ensure security in these locations? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I attempted to remove the roadblocks, but I wasn't strong enough to force compliance with my decision. In my -- that decision fell in the communiqué on the 10th. I wanted that, at least in daytime, the roadblocks be removed so that the citizens might move around to fetch supplies, go to the hospital. And it was fortuitous, because in that brief period of time there was relative calm which, of course, was completely destroyed by an intensive shelling on -- on the populated districts, the markets, the hospitals -- anything. Completely uncontrolled, wild shelling. And the decision was of no consequence, of course. 
But as regards the control of the roadblocks, I consistently stressed -- insisted that the communal authorities should be involved and should ensure the proper control to avoid that there be excesses and brutalities by the people manning those roadblocks. I did that in the course of meetings with the bourgmestres, and for the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, he'd bring his conseillers along. I also did so through my various appeals, messages, communiqués. 
But I think the people already in Kigali at the end of April was nothing like the inhabitants of Kigali on the 6th of April. Because many people had come from outside, fleeing the fighting, the atrocities, they'd swollen the city's population, and they were not encarded, those people, and they didn't obey anyone. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This communiqué of the 10th, do we have that in the file? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. I was on the point of reading some extracts to Mr. Renzaho. It's Exhibit P. 49. I was going, just now, to propose reading some parts of it to Mr. Renzaho, Mr. President, should you have any particular question. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, because this question is essential: What did you do? What did you say? Do you remember the words of your radio appeal, communiqué of the 10th of April 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I don't have all the points in mind, but all of them were in the -- normalising the situation. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It's P. 49 in the English, page 5, K0357183 -- 357183. And we have a French translation on the last page, which I shall read. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, this communiqué, point 3: 
"The roadblocks erected and manned by the population in the neighbourhoods is not allowed. They can be erected at night under the authority of the local authorities." 
Is that what you were referring to a moment ago? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Is it also in this document that you incite -- you encourage the civil servants to return to their desks, to their place of work? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that is correct. And I was the first to be concerned. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I will remind you of point 5: "The préfet urges the population to resist all troublemakers, looters, bandits, killers, and all types of criminals who are threatening the lives of other innocent people", and appeals to the population to denounce those criminals to those responsible for security. Is that indeed what you stated in that communiqué, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that is correct, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what did you do to arrest the criminals whom you -- whom you referred to in this communiqué? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It's true, I tried to do something to arrest these criminals. And that's what I asked the various authorities -- because you must understand, everyone has their role to play all the way down the social ladder. But I think in the meeting on the 8th I stressed the need to be firm against the criminals, all those who were attacking others and disturbing public order and safety. And we would always be using the small number of policemen we had. But, as I tell you -- as I told you, in Kigali town we had here and there territorial brigades -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I think he's referring to gendarmerie. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
-- who would cooperate with the conseiller to the extent that things could take place normally. But these were difficult times and -- but people did what they could to eradicate the evil that was abroad. But, with the war, I felt that the orders given, the possibilities that normally would exist completely evaporated. To begin with, the authorities, the grass roots authorities either were in hiding or fled -- and fled, or -- well, I don't know. People are made differently. There might even be some who ceded to private interests. I don't know what motivated them, but the structure did not function.

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, forgive me for interrupting, but I have a specific question. And, before doing so, the President wished to speak. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have now read the communiqué of the 10th of April, but in his testimony he said that he gave similar messages to avoid the problems at roadblocks -- or dismantled them on various occasions. Are you going to lead us through other documents, Maître Cantier? And how many such documents are there? Just give us an overview. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am sorry, Mr. President, I am having a problem with my earphones. Let me repeat what you asked to be sure that's what you mean. 
You have asked me whether I have other documents to use as to Mr. Renzaho's appeals for dismantling the roadblocks or for ceasing the killing at the roadblocks. Yes, Mr. President, I have other documents which I intend to use shortly. In fact, these documents are other communiqués and occasions on which Mr. Renzaho spoke on the radio at that time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But we are now getting a rather elaborate answer from Mr. Renzaho. It would be very interesting if you, in a concise and precise way, could lead us through these documents so that we have them on record. Would that be a good approach now? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I thought of developing somewhat differently, but I could go straight to it to move ahead rapidly. On the same subject, I come to what Mr. Renzaho said. I am trying to find it because I hadn't planned for just now. But we found in the archives that he spoke on radio on the 14th of April, the 27th of April and the 6th of May 1994. 
Now, Mr. President, to organise this regarding the exhibits we already have the recording of the 6th -- of the 14th of April 1994. That is Exhibit P. 51, and two other documents, not yet admitted. Mr. Renzaho -- what Mr. Renzaho said on the radio on the 27th of April in our bundle -- in our document number 45; it's the second series of tabs in volume 1. And then we have the 6th of May 1994, which is in volume 1 of the Defence document number 46, seventh set of tabs number 16, one-six. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. But that was helpful because now we have in a concise form four documents in relation to a particular subject matter. If you feel that you want a slightly different approach, that's fine, but it would be good just to have this on paper, and you have now provided the references. Thank you for doing so. 
So now you can follow your own logic, if you prefer that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, yes, I prefer, because that's the way I have organised myself. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you have already partly answered the question, but before that I wonder whether you can -- my question was: What did you do to arrest the perpetrators of the killing? More precisely, can you give us examples of arrests of killers, presumed killers, that you were able to effect?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Yes, let me give you the example, the case of Kigingi -- it must be a name, a nickname, one of the nicknames. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 248 on the list, a nom de guerre. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
He was among the killers in Nyamirambo. I had asked the bourgmestre to arrest him for some time, but he hadn't done so, and I had to intervene to get him arrested. We locked him up. We put him in a lockup. His supporters invaded the préfecture. Before that I had arrested another one, Sukari, whom we kept for a while. There was also a gang we had arrested in Rugunga cellule where they were terrorising the local population. That gang was armed, and we disarmed them and we put them in the préfecture's lockup, in the jail, the cells, for a few days. But our difficulty was to establish dockets. There was no judicial institution functioning in Kigali. My efforts to get the prosecutor's office to function led nowhere. And I should like to add that Kigali central prison had deserted -- gone. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Renzaho, you mentioned two occasions when people were arrested. Who specifically carried out these arrests? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Your Honour. I sent policemen from the préfectoral detachment to go and get those people. The policemen were a detachment established at the préfecture who went off to get those people. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when was the arrest of Kigingi, and when was the arrest of Sukari? Just give us very briefly the dates now or approximate periods. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I think that Kigingi was arrested in May; there was fighting in Nyamirambo. And Sukari -- well, it must be in the second half of April, towards the end. Whereas the others was in the middle of the month of May 1994. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Those two persons, were they local residents or they came from a different part of Rwanda? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I think that Kigingi and Sukari were among those young people that we called town boys. In fact, one came from Gisenyi, the other from Ruhengeri. They were sort of itinerant traders. I don't think they were necessarily considered to be residents of Kigali. But these are people who spent the best part of their time visiting the town. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two events, are these the two events where you ordered arrests of perpetrators or did you do that also on other occasions? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Well, I don't remember well having done it on other occasions, it was specific cases brought to my attention where I intervened. 
And I think that the problem, Your Honours, is that in a situation of disturbance, where crimes have been committed, to act, the one who decides -- who has to decide to act needs information. He must be told the specific place a crime is being committed. If he doesn't have means of communication in respect of the crime being committed, how can he act? That is the problem. 
Because I am very humble, before such a situation one has nothing to say one is completely -- I want to be sincere with you. Every case brought to my attention I acted on. To explain the difficulty of communication with the grass roots where the various crimes were being committed -- the various things being done -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that mean that there were only on -- only two occasions, then, on which your attention was drawn to specific individuals carrying out illegal acts? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I think that other cases required presence on the ground, not necessarily to arrest people, take them away, but to settle the crisis by negotiation with people. And the incident was over without any excesses being committed but -- and that sort of thing we knew of. But people in -- in the act of committing, no I don't think we were. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, we have some difficulty understanding how this situation, thousands -- tens of thousands of crimes being committed, were you not able to seek out or to have -- sort out the perpetrators of the crimes? That is what we are wondering -- I am wondering about. And it leads me to put the question to you: How is it that you couldn't -- that you could intervene on those rare occasions? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, Counsel, I believe this is proof of the anarchy that was reigning. We had indicators of what was truly happening -- if we had indicators of what was truly happening, we could have carried out actions using the scarce resources that were at my disposal. But the situation was such that nobody knew what the other was doing. What other means did I have at my disposal in order to know what was happening at the grass roots, if not the administrative structure? In the situation in which it was in April, May and June of 1994, was that administrative structure operational? That is the question. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I shall come to that matter subsequently and you will be able to respond at that time. But before we do so, Mr. Renzaho; so, on this issue of the arrests, you told the Trial Chamber a moment ago that at least on one occasion -- and I believe it was the example of the arrest of Kigingi -- there was a throng of people that had come to the PVK. Could you be more specific? What is a friendly crowd, a hostile crowd? What happened on that occasion? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel, it was an overexcited crowd which was quite violent and wanted to storm into the administration building and destroy everything. We contained the crowd, even though it was quite difficult to do so, and it was difficult to restore order. With the very few policemen at my disposal, I could not ask them to engage in an unequal battle. And what would it have led to? What would have been the positive effects? I negotiated with them and they left. So that was the situation in which we were. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But, Mr. Renzaho, how many policemen did you have at your disposal in order to face the mob? And how many people were there? Were they armed? Please be specific in order to for us to understand. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not have many policemen at my disposal, because every day at first assembly there would be a few policemen and there would not be that many of them. Every day there were events that required the presence of a few policemen. So if there were a few policemen remaining at the préfecture, they were not that numerous. There were maybe 11 people who were available at the préfecture, and they were the people we could use if interventions were necessary. 
Now, as regards the crowd, it was a very large crowd. There were more than a hundred people and some of them were armed; others had clubs, and so on and so forth. So it was a mob, and this was a mob which was fighting and this would have been led to a lot of damage at the préfecture. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There were up to 250 police officers in Kigali, you explained yesterday. Then, on 6th of April, only 45 reported to duty, so there were about 200 who'd either deserted or at least did not show up. Now, from the 6th of April until July, is it then the testimony that the number was about 45, the total force, or did it increase? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, if a few other policemen were able to come to the préfecture, they were not many because people who were asked to protect conseillers or other people would desert. They would disappear, or they were killed. 
But, Mr. President, if I may, I wish to provide clarifications on the 250 policemen. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will delete that answer, the last sentence starting with "My impression is" until "..then a hundred" and place that under separate cover. 
Do you remember what we discussed yesterday, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I forgot, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Court video booth, please do not transmit that sequence. 
All right. But, leaving aside that element, your point is that there were not more than a hundred. Is that the evidence, not 250? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Not more than a hundred who had weapons, the others were not armed and were posted in specific facilities, important facilities throughout town in order to guard them. And the other part would replace policemen who were either on leave in order to guard the weapons and in order to enable each of the policemen to have a weapon. So I am not surprised that when the events occurred those people who did not have weapons thought it better for them to remain at home, if, of course, they had not been killed. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Renzaho, and those two persons arrested, did they belong to Hutu or Tutsi ethnicity? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Your Honour, they were Hutus. They were Hutus.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, referring once again to your appeals, we were able to find several of your appeals and to take them in the chronological order. The first one was made on the 14th of April of 1994.

And, as I was stating previously, Mr. President, this is Exhibit P. 51. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
In that document you mention at length -- 
@MR. CANTIER:
Because the problem, Mr. President, Your Honours, is that this is not a communiqué but is, rather, an interview on the radio, which is quite lengthy and which deals mainly with the security situation in the town of Kigali. I have selected an excerpt from this interview, which I believe will be of interest to the Trial Chamber. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, in the French version, it is document K0264711, the last page. I do not have the page in English. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Could my learned friend from the Prosecution -- or, is my learned friend from the Prosecution there? I would not wish to lose him, because I do not have the K number for the English version of this text.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I wish to read out this paragraph to you, and I quote. 
"According to the directives given, the roadblocks set up on this road are to be dismantled. Those who set them up should be prosecuted and severely sanctioned." 
It is a specific road, perhaps you could tell us which road it was. And do you confirm, Mr. Renzaho, that you made such a statement on this day, that is to say, the 14th of April of 1994. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, let me say that this must be the road from the Muhima roundabout to the Nyarugenge fire (sic) light. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, there are other excerpts, and I am referring more specifically to page 21 of the said document. Still in it's French version, K0264707, second paragraph, and I quote:
"I wish to seriously caution some small groups that are continuing to perpetrate shameful acts in some locations. I wish to inform you that guidelines were issued to those who are charged with the enforcement of the security to severely punish those that will be caught in the act of looting and killing." 
Mr. Renzaho, do you remember having made such a statement? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there are also other excerpts because, once again, I am taking them from the radio transcript of the 27th April of 1994, for which I provided references earlier on, and I wish to refer to page K0337586, fourth paragraph, and I quote: 
"The préfet of the town of Kigali" -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this in the same document? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, I have now moved to another document, Mr. President. That document which is the transcript of the radio interview of the 27th of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That makes it clearer. So you are now -- you are now in Defence binder volume 1 number 45, then? That's where we shall look for the last K reference; is that so? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is the second (sic) volume, Mr. President, binder -- sorry, tab 15. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are looking. Why don't you start? This was K number -- just repeat it. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, K0337586. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got it, Prosecution? 
Okay. We are there. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am much obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So I wish to refer to the fourth paragraph of the said document, which I wish to submit to your attention, Mr. Renzaho. And I quote: 
"The préfet of the town of Kigali, Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, continues to ask for the cessation of acts of violence, of lootings and killings, and requests that the persons arrested while committing such acts be severely sanctioned."
Mr. Renzaho, do you recall having made such a statement? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I do recognise that that was what was done. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What we heard you say in English, Maître Cantier, was that this was in the second volume, but indeed it is in volume 1 of the Defence binder. So we have that in front of us now. 
Now, how do we know that this is the 27th of April? That follows from the beginning of this quote on the top of the page. So that's where we find it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Because, Mr. President, in the first sentence, which comes from the journalist, it is the first paragraph. It says:
"Good morning, it is time for the news in Kinyarwanda. This is Wednesday the 27th of April."
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. So we agree on that. We both agree that that sentence is the clue. What is the next we do now? That's very good. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I read out the fourth paragraph of the document to Mr. Renzaho. I read it out to him and he acknowledged that it is indeed what he had stated at the time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have heard that as well. And what is happening now? I am just inviting you to proceed, please. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, Mr. President. Let me proceed with the third document I referred to previously, which is the transcript of a radio programme dated 6th of May of 1994, which can be found in our Defence binder, volume 1, second series of tabs under number 16. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which means 46, because it is the second round. Yes, we have it, is that K0149350? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. This document starts there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which page, please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The excerpts I wish to use have the following K numbers: K0149352, the following page, K0149353, and the next one, K0149354. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
The excerpts are quite lengthy and for that reason -- the excerpts we are interested in are lengthy, so I will choose a few. The first one being on the page I mentioned, K0149352. 
So, Mr. Renzaho, this is an interview, and I quote: 
"There are people who have selected themselves in order to control the roadblocks. As a matter of fact, no one can pretend he loves his country more than others, except for traitors. One can say that a given person is a traitor and does not love his or her country, but there is such a thing as excessive zeal, and it is this excessive zeal that leads to situations where unruly people kill people, and we wish to stand against such actions. That is the reason for which the conseillers were instructed to monitor -- or, watch those who manhandle people at the roadblocks and who disrupt public order. They are people who have become untouchables and who disregard observations made by other people. And they would rather manhandle people as they wish. This behaviour is unreasonable and is one of the reasons for the insecurity. I request that the conseillers replace such people immediately, who are at the roadblocks, to put them where they should be. Some should be put in prison, if necessary, and the others should be brought to justice."
Mr. Renzaho, do you recall having made such a statement? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I remember. This is, in fact, expressions of distress. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you remember what else you might have said in this document, because this is a very lengthy document? You just told the Trial Chamber that you were expressing your distress, could you be more explicit as to what you mean by that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. What I mean is that there was a situation which was not improving while we were expending all our energy trying to solve all the problems. It is obvious that the anger I had, as expressed in this statement, was due to the very difficult situation we were faced with, and which we were not able to control. I noted, for example, that the conseiller had not done what he should have. That was obvious. And it was also obvious that the members of the cellules were not doing what they should, and the grass roots structures, such as the nyumba kumi, when I am being accused of having organised meetings at the préfecture with nyumba kumis, with responsables de cellules, with conseillers; it is clear that such structures had stopped existing, had stopped operating. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We shall come to that, Mr. Renzaho. We shall come to that. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you, Mr. Cantier, after the 11 o'clock break, if you do not want to read out all these relevant excerpts from this document, maybe simply draw our attention to them so that we can mark them in this document which you no doubt want to tender as an exhibit later on. That makes it possible for us to focus on the relevant part, and the Prosecution to know what he is expected to prosecute on. Could that be done in the little break we have ahead of us? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. In fact, I had already marked the excerpts, so it will be quite easy for me to provide the information to you later on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. We will then resume at 11:25. 
$(Court recessed from 1100H to 1125H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are very pleased that the full Bench is together again. 
Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The Defence is also most gratified, My Lord. 
Now, we had promised, as regards the radio broadcasts, first the one of the 14th of April 1994. In the French, and perhaps to simplify I will give you the K reference. It is K -- page 20, K0264706, third paragraph heading, "Speaker, Tharcisse Renzaho, préfet of Kigali", the entire paragraph, which is seven lines long. 
Then K0264707, the next page, the first paragraph, from line 4 to line 8. And then page 24 in the French, reference K0264710, the whole page. And the following page, K0264711, second paragraph, and the seven lines from the second paragraph. 
And then we have the second document dated -- which is from the 27th of April 1994, reference K0337586, the fourth paragraph, which I read a bit earlier. 
Finally, the third document, which is a transcript of an interview of the 6th of May 1994, page 3 -- in the French K0149352 -- K0149352, second paragraph, the 13 first lines; 13 -- 13 first lines of the second paragraph. 
And with the same K reference, the sentence beginning "For us to supply Kigali with provisions", and the ends nine lines later, "They will no longer do that work". 
The following page K0149353, in the middle of the page, sentence beginning "He who does not know it must seek an explanation", and ending eights lines lower with the words "a government who want the rule of law". 
And, finally, reference K0149354, the first paragraph, which is seven lines long. 
Those, Mr. President, are the extracts we have selected. My assistant points out to me that I have forgotten a paragraph. Please forgive me. 
On the K0149353 already mentioned, we should add the four lines of this page under the given K reference. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was very helpful. Thank you very much. And just for completeness of the record, the three documents now referred to by Maître Cantier, the dates were mentioned by him, but their identification is then P. 51, Defence volume 1, number 45, and Defence volume 1, number 46 respectively. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, Mr. President. So I shall continue.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I am putting the following question to you: How did you ensure follow-up by communal authorities of the decisions taken on the 10th of April --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think it was. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
-- 1994. After the 8th of April 1994 I held meetings with the bourgmestres, and it was on the occasion of those meetings that I would be informed of what was happening to the extent that the information I was provided with could be relied upon. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you give us, Mr. Renzaho, further information on these meetings, their frequency, their duration? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I don't think those meetings were as frequent as it has been said on some occasions because after the 8th of April 1994 certain measures had to be taken to try to face up to the situation we were in, and sometimes I had to go on the spot. But we did hold meetings with the bourgmestres. I can't say how frequently, but I had -- I did have meetings with the bourgmestres. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, when did you learn that initiatives contrary to what you had decided were being taken by communal employees? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, in -- when you're impotent, a situation that you've often denounced doesn't improve, but the factors were numerous, and among the factors was due to a lack of commitment on the ground by basic communal structures in the face of this very difficult situation. Probably people preferred to hide or to shirk their -- flee from their responsibilities. I learnt of that progressively after several attempts to get things moving again, to exercise some authority over the activities in the préfecture which were not producing the results I had hoped for. So it is probable towards the end of the second half of June -- no, I mean April, that I would see that in spite of our efforts to try to master the situation, very little change could be noted. To a large extent because of the fighting which was gaining in intensity, but also through lack of commitment on the part of those who had to face the danger and go on the spot -- on the ground. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, at the PVK, your personal secretariat, who ran it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
As soon as we had established the crisis management cell, the secretariat was assigned to that cell -- crisis cell, which was in fact in the secretariat of the Kigali urban préfecture. The secretaries were with the members of the crisis management cell in the secretariat of the préfecture, and I think that it was Miss Astérie and Mrs. Bisanukuli among members of the crisis management cell, who that later coordinated the small team at the secretariat. But to all intents and purposes, I had no secretariat other than that secretariat that was assigned to working for the population at that time of crisis. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you told us at the beginning -- at the outset you spoke of your personal secretary as being, moreover, the first person that you met. That person, could you remind the Trial Chamber of his name, and did he stay by your side until the end of the events? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I must tell you that that person did not stay at the préfecture. He was there for the first week after the triggering events on the 6th of April 1994, and thereafter Alfred Sibomana -- that's his name - left, no doubt under pressure because he wanted to know how his family was. He left without even saying goodbye to me. Maybe he was afraid that I would ask him to stay. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, please, on what date did he leave? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It was a week after the 6th of April, so probably something like the 13th of April 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
You spoke of Astérie, can you give us her surname, and tell us if she stayed throughout the events by your side? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Miss Astérie Nikuze stayed during the events and was assigned to be the secretariat of the crisis management cell. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It's number 370, Mr. President, Astérie. Sibomana is 532. And Bisanukuli, who is also mentioned, is number 43, four-three. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you learn of the questioning of Miss Astérie Nikuze in Rwanda? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I have learned of it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I am sure we are getting fairly and squarely, this occasion, in the area of the realm of the Bagosora decision, bearing in mind I have had disclosure of certain documents, including the procès verbal from Rwanda, and it would be my submission that if -- as I am sure my learned friend's intention is to refer to that and have that document presented to Your Honour -- that in terms of the Trial Chamber's decision in respect of procès verbals from Rwanda, it is a matter which falls within 92 bis and this is not the appropriate means of getting to it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The document we are about to approach indirectly now, where do we find it, Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the document which indeed I am referring to is in our Defence file, volume 1, tab 11. If I have correctly understood my learned friend from the Prosecution, he does not want the Defence to use this document. I am prepared to respond to that motion, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But before you do so, it would be good for us to know what we are talking about. We heard you say volume 1, tab 11. Is that so? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is correct, Mr. President. And there is a second document. We might as well deal with both matters together, which I wanted to come to and which is in the same volume 1 at tab 10, tab 10. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So this is then a pro justitia with K number 0107785. That's the document, isn't it? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That's correct, Mr. President, and the following document, under reference K0107643 at tab 10 which precede; therefore, the one we have just spoken of. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
These documents refer to different persons, true? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. We are with you. What are your submissions? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Quite simply, Mr. President, that Rule 92 bis cannot apply to these statements because they do not concern directly the Accused and were not gathered in the course of a procedure concerning him. So the provisions of 92 bis do not, I feel -- are not I feel applicable and all the more so -- all the more so as they are essential to Mr. Renzaho's defence. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But if they don't relate to the defence, why do you want to use them? If they are not of relevance or do not directly concern the Accused, why do we want to hear of them? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, that's a very good question, Mr. President. It's because the way these matters are handled comes into -- what I am driving at is the behaviour of the communal staff, and that is what concerns us directly because what Mr. Renzaho is accused of is what he did himself, but also by virtue of 6(3), by the people under his orders for whom he is responsible. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So it is relevant to Mr. Renzaho under the perspective of article 6(3)? Do you have any other submissions? If not we will ask the Prosecution to address us. Do you have a copy of Nsengiyumva decision, Mr. Moses? 
It's coming, Mr. Matemanga? 
Which paragraph do you want us to look at? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Bearing in mind what my friend has said, it is clear from the statements they are being used to try and impeach Prosecution Witness ALG. I don't believe they were put to ALG, and the decision that I will hand to Your Honour deals directly with the use of Rwandan pro justitia for the purposes of impeachment of various Prosecution witnesses in that trial, and it was declined -- denied. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very carefully worded now, ALG, is that the person whose document we have here or is it this person's statement which is here to contradict the testimony of ALG; it's the latter? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's the latter. One of the persons whose statements they are wanting to use is, in fact, dead, according to the evidence that we have heard. And I don't think there is necessarily any contradiction to that. The other person is alive. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Mr. President, could counsel repeat? That wasn't very clear. I think he is asking to see the document that he's just referred to. 
@MR. CANTIER:
We did not hear the documents at the time of the ALG's cross-examination. We did not have the document. But, to respond to my colleague, these documents do not necessarily contradict what ALG said, but speak of ALG's conduct, and that was the topic I was discussing with Mr. Renzaho just now. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which paragraph in the decision? In the entire discussion? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour, I believe it goes through various Prosecution witnesses and the statements which were being sought to impeach, as it were, those Prosecution witnesses, and the Trial Chamber went through them one by one and denied the Defence to approach the matter in that manner. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What you said, Maître Cantier, would give the impression that the purpose of using this document is not to impeach ALG's testimony. But if that is your submission, why would you use it? Couldn't you simply ask the Accused what he knows about ALG, and then we get around it? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, if I have correctly understood the Prosecution's grounds, they want to show that Mr. Renzaho commits the crimes of which he is accused both directly and through the administrative structure under his authority. Now, the documents we have here concern and that -- it's in that context I raised the topic: People who were under Renzaho's orders and their conduct. I would add that I felt it necessary that Mr. -- that the Prosecutor spontaneously and under Rule 68 disclose to us such documents that we discovered thanks to our research after ALG was questioned.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a bit vague. If we now look at the pro justitia, K0107785, which lines do you want to use, which portions? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
K0107786. Can I read it? But then that means I must pronounce its name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
$(Microphones overlapping)... person concerned. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Couldn't you simply now say which questions you are referring to? You see, it starts with a Q and there are quite a few Qs there. Which question is it? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, on the second page, K0107786, I am counting the questions, and it is question number 5 out of a total of seven questions. And the following answer, obviously. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything to add? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Nothing, Mr. President, except that this document and the following documents are material to Mr. Renzaho on the question I just put to him, that is to say, his authority over the staff in the commune. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But it does affect the role of the person concerned. It does affect ALG's role during the event and consequently throws light on his credibility. That is the point, isn't it? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am not referring to his credibility, I am merely providing an illustration of the question put to Mr. Renzaho, "Did you still have authority over the communal staff?" And I wish to know whether these people executed his orders and what was their behaviour. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, if I had had this document before ALG testified, I would obviously have made use of it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can't you just ask Mr. Renzaho what his view is in the situation in relation to this individual, and then the testimony of the Accused speaks for himself? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, but with regard to the demonstration I wish to make, it will be substantially weakened because you will hear the utterances of an accused person or -- even though he is a witness, whereas here you have a document which is proof of what Mr. Renzaho said, and proof that it is the truth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand your point of view and the approach you are trying to follow, Maître Cantier, but the fact that you may have discovered this after the appearance of the witness doesn't really change the situation. The fact that a witness has testified and that a document is being used to contradict his testimony being put to the Accused, letting him comment on that document and thereby getting it into the transcripts and hence part of the case file, is an indirect way of doing it, which is according to our Nsengiyumva decision, not in conformity with the rules. You will have to content yourself with the question to the Accused, and we will listen carefully both to the question and the answer. This is settled practice in the Chamber. 
$BY MR. CANTIER: 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I asked you previously whether you were aware of the questioning of Miss Astérie and your answer was not (sic) affirmative. I am now asking you whether you were also aware of the interrogation of Mr. Dieudonné Nkulikiyinka?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I was aware of that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 378 on our list, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier, I am not sure you fully used the available opportunity in relation to the previous document. You can, of course, ask your client what his view is about what is found in that document, and he will then give us his evidence. Having done so, you can move to the next document, which was the one you now refer to. Don't you want to use the first opportunity before you go to the second document? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was proceeding in that way because the two documents are linked. One witness referring the investigative -- investigation policemen to the other. 
Mr. President, I understand that your ruling has to do with the possibility of having both documents admitted into evidence, but this does not prevent me from putting questions to the Accused on the contents of the said documents. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho -- 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Counsel, you yourself have just said that he said he was not aware that that lady was questioned. If he wasn't aware that she was ever questioned, you cannot ask him questions to something that he was not aware of. That's what he said. You have just said it now, that it was 'not affirmative'. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Your Honour, Mr. President, when I put the question to Mr. Renzaho I believe he answered in the affirmative. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's just clarify this. 
Were you aware of this, Mr. Renzaho? 
$(Pages 16 to 31 by Judith Baverstock)
1215H
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I answered that I was aware of the document.
@MR. CANTIER:
Perhaps a problem in translation? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem is that there were two very similar questions. One relating to the first document and one relating to the second document. When it comes to the second document, I understand that the person was aware. When it comes to the first document, as pointed out by Judge Arrey, he says he was not aware of it. 
So there is a distinction in his answers concerning the two documents, according to the English version. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
If I may, Your Honours, I wish to tell you that in both cases my answer was "yes", that I was aware of that fact. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now looking at the French version, I will read it out: "Mr. Renzaho, sir, earlier on I asked you whether you were aware of the interrogation of Miss Astérie, and you said yes. So I'm now asking you whether you were aware of the interrogation also of Mr. Nkulikiyinka? Yes, Counsel, I was aware of that." 
In the French versions there are two answers with yes, and in the English there is one yes and one no and that is behind the confusion, and it's quite understandable that we had problems in clarifying this. But now we have, in addition to the French version being reread into the transcripts, we also have 
Mr. Renzaho's confirmation again that his answer is "yes" again in relation to both documents. 
So please, proceed.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, first one question -- as the testimony of Ms. Astérie Nikuze, the following question was put to her in the following document before me: "Bizimana, Jean Baptiste" -- 
@MR. MOSES:
Can I interrupt? I'm sorry to interrupt. I am -- I must say somewhat unclear as to the effect of 
Your Honours' ruling because if the document is not admissible then, to be blunt, in our submission it should not be admissible for the Counsel to suddenly read it into the record. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Our problem now is that we need to find out what was the questions imposed by Maitre Cantier.
@MR. MOSES:
Well, his last question was he began to read out a question and answer, but I think the LiveNote is not operating just at the moment. That was the reason for my interruption, because he was about to simply read a question and answer into the record. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you about to read in a document that we just decided you couldn't use? You wouldn't do that, Maitre Cantier, would you? 
@MR. CANTIER:
I believe there's a misunderstanding. If that was what I'd understood, I would not do it. But that was not what I understood and it is the reason for which I asked the Trial Chamber about the ruling it had just made. 
So I had understood that you did not want the Defence to have both documents tendered into evidence, but that I could make use of them in order to put my questions to Mr. Renzaho. So that was how I understood your ruling and that was how I formulated it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was not the ruling. You cannot, once a document has not been allowed as a possible exhibit, read it in connection with the question and answer. What we meant -- and that is certainly in conformity with practice, is that you can solicit independently of this document similar evidence from the Accused, but not going all the way through the document. That is the effect of the ruling.
@MR. CANTIER:
Very well, Mr. President, so I may use the answers provided, the questions and the answers without reading them out. Very well. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's very simple. You can ask, for instance, ask Mr. Renzaho whether he knows anything about 
Witness ALG based on his own knowledge, but forget about this witness statement. That's the situation.
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it is quite difficult for counsel to forget about elements that is material to his client's defence.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, when reading the first document, how did you come to learn of the behaviour of ALG? 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I had understood it was to be independent of the reading of the document. So my understanding that the sort of question that Your Honour was anticipating was: Were you aware of the activities of ALG?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, we are not interested in documents by persons not appearing as witnesses before this Trial Chamber. Now that follows from the rules adopted within the Rules of Procedure and Evidence in this Tribunal. It may be different in the national jurisdiction of many countries, including my own, 
Maitre Cantier. That is the situation here. 
For that reason we are not interested in what you know having probably read in this document by Astérie Nikuze. Do you know anything you want to convey to us about the role of Witness ALG during the event which could be relevant to your defence? That's the issue. Have you understood the question? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I did understand your question. I understood your question. Are you asking me to answer your question? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, you do have to answer something. We had pains to come up with the question, please do not disappoint us. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Hold on. You cannot refer to names in this connection and we have to place that under seal. And, Maitre Cantier, when we have adopted an approach which I am sure everyone in the courtroom fully has adopted, it would be useful if you assist Mr. Renzaho to get from him what you think is relevant for you; can you help us, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Of course. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
To avoid any lack of clarity, the reference to the name and the position will be placed under separate cover. And video booth, please do not transmit that. 
Here follows the question. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we had come up with a different system with the Prosecutor yesterday. That is to say only to give the pseudonym of the witness in order to avoid such difficulties, and you had proposed when the name of a protected witness was to be mentioned here, that it be written on a piece of paper. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Everyone in this courtroom knows who we are talking about. That follows from the entire record. We do not need a piece of paper in this situation. It can be used in some situations where the actors in the courtroom hear of this for the first time, but here we have another reference point, namely the pseudonym. So you can just proceed in connection with ALG. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, regarding that person, please do not mention his name or his position, but please refer to ALG. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel.
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, now for the specific question: Did Mr. ALG take any initiative during the events which was contrary to the instructions or the orders you had given him? And if your answer is in the affirmative, could you provide an example?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, in order to be consistent with what I just said, would you allow me to finish with what I had started saying?
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, please go ahead, Mr Renzaho, conclude what you were saying and conclude with the question that was put to you.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I believe that in my capacity as préfet I had some authority over the bourgmestre or the communal authorities, in the spirit of what you just stated, in times of peace as in times of war, and that was what happened. 
Now, as regards initiatives, we should place ourselves in the context of April to July of 1994. Events took place in this small area of the commune led by ALG, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover). And this right of oversight was not made easy in view of the fighting that was taking place and because there was no time to make written reports, or even for that matter oral reports. So it would have been difficult for me to exercise this right of oversight in light of the prevailing situation. 
Now with regard to initiatives on the part of that person, I can tell you it was not easy to take good initiatives during a period such as that one because it would require courage. There were none. It required audacity and he did not have such audacity. It required some amount of loyalty vis-a-vis one's superiors in one's endeavours, and that was not the case. If you asked me for my opinion, this is what I can tell you regarding that individual. 
It was difficult for me to bear seeing him here, but I am giving you my opinion, my assessment, and I will seize this opportunity to provide examples of what I am saying because throughout my life, I have hardly ever said anything evil about anybody.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, that is exactly what I was expecting from you, an example. This is why I put questions to you without being able to cite that document directly.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Let me give you one example, which unfortunately is contained in my indictment, or in the charges brought against me. It is the incident that took place on the 22nd of April of 1994 at CELA. This was an incident which was recounted in different ways by many witnesses who came here to testify, which did not occur in the way in which it was depicted. 
I will spare you the narration of the whole story, but with regard to the people we are referring to let me state that the information on the events that were going to take place in CELA reached the secretariat of the secteur. The information was received and conveyed to the crisis unit, which informed me shortly after that. What was involved? Gendarmes who were there were faced with a difficult situation, a group of attackers, some 40 attackers had just entered the CELA compound and were threatening refugees who were there. 
The gendarmes who were on the site while trying to prevent acts of violence from being perpetrated appealed to their superiors in order to get reinforcement. Since they received no positive response, the leader of the detachment that was at CELA went -- or asked the préfecture for assistance. And this is how the information reached the secretariat of the préfecture. 
I thereupon gave the order, or instruction, to go on the spot and settle the incident. He was supposed to have the gendarmerie support. Anyhow I thought it would have been possible to do it, and after giving him the instruction I went back to my office. It wasn't far away. It was next door. Instead of doing what I told him, he went off to hide in the building's basement and stayed there until the gendarme, having waited in vain for the reinforcements they called for, telephoned again, called again to say that the danger was imminent. So they came to fetch me and told me that the situation is even worse. 
So, you must understand that I couldn't understand. I was astounded, so I asked if the bourgmestre had gone to do what I asked him to do; to fulfil the task I'd assigned to him and they told me: No, he's in the cellar, in the basement. And we don't know if he is prepared to fulfil that mission. 
So I summonsed him and I saw him in a very sorry psychological state. I have never seen men crying when asked to undertake a task, a mission, whatever its nature be. So then I reacted perhaps a bit. That's when I said that man was a pathetic figure and simply wasn't up to the task. And I immediately decided to go and fulfil the mission, and that's what I am accused of now. He didn't have the courage to come and tell you what really happened. Because when he saw me leave he joined the group that followed me. He did come and he did see what was happening on the spot. But he didn't have the courage to say it here. Thank you.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you have another example to briefly tell the Trial Chamber that you might briefly narrate? Do you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, these are difficult situations. Some people might think that I'm here to seek revenge, vengeance. But that's not in my nature. There are problems, I assure you. As regards that individual, I tried to put myself in the position of a subordinate faced with a superior. They might see our behaviour, and we don't know about it, but they are observing us. But in the heat of the action in April 1994, it was constant, every minute, one had to act. 
Let me tell you here, the events that occurred in Nyarugenge commune and the communal authority, the normal authority, would be the normal place to go with such problems, to solve them. But when I was absent -- for things to be coherent, when I was absent the authority that would replace me would be Nyarugenge commune. I was always told that you must always take an initiative if you're in a managerial position. 
And when I left to see my family in Kanombe it was during my absence that some critical things that could be criticised were done. Firstly, there were refugees who had stayed with us without any problem in those days, and I sought information as to the situation, the circumstances under which those refugees were chased away, but forcefully removed to another place without awaiting any decision from me. Because when I came back, I found that it was already done and dusted, and some of the refugees who stayed came to complain to me -- complained to me. 
But it was already done. Of course, I scolded the bourgmestre. I criticised him, but nothing could then be done. I was lucky no one had then been killed. And immediately afterwards the event of 14th June occurred of which I am accused. That incident was first and foremost the responsibility of the bourgmestre. And, funnily enough, it was during my absence. I don't wish to go -- dwell at length on the whys and wherefores of that incident, but I would like to say the versions you have heard here do not match what we know of the incident.
@MR. CANTIER: 
You mentioned the date the 14th of June, could you tell us where, for the Trial Chamber to fully understand what you are referring to? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The incident I am referring to is what occurred at Saint Paul where 50 men were taken away and handed over to a band of killers who are unnamed, even the leader is unknown. That is the incident I'm referring to. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho. The question that I think occurs to all of us here is when you heard of such events, what was your reaction? Did you take steps, corrective steps, in respect of those people? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, that's -- that was the problem I faced, what gave me a lot of trouble. Number 1, the people were appointed by presidential decree under a law over which I have no authority. The procedures are very lengthy and I was in a weakened position because I had no one to -- that I could substitute. I might suspend that person and appoint a civil servant who would manage the situation in my name. But I was already short of staff; as I've said, they were already committed on the field. 
Then there's the direct consequences of the difficult situation we were living in -- we were going through at the time. What could be the reaction of the citizenry if I suspended the bourgmestre with the difficulty there was, difficulty in any way of the procedures to go about sacking him? The proper procedures in those days were very difficult. As to any other measures to be taken, well, it was very difficult under the circumstances. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you know what became of Astérie Nikuze, your secretary? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. From what I have heard from various sources that person is deceased, no longer alive. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you know the circumstances of her demise? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel, I have had reliable information that she -- that person was questioned on several occasions by Rwandan security services, intelligence, security service. And the last time she presented herself she died. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What was her ethnicity? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
She was Tutsi. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you know what happened to Dieudonné Nkurikiyinka? Number 378 on the list. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I know that person is still working in Kigali at the préfecture, except it is not called the préfecture anymore. It's called the mayor's office. So he continued working as an accountant for Kigali mayor's office. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, for what reason did certain conseillers leave their jobs? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I think that the situation was such that the reasons were many. My first checking up, I noted that several conseillers were killed in the night of the 6th to the 7th. Others were reportedly absent, for example, conseiller for Kicukiro and that of Kimihurura and others, I had to replace; well, I appointed, replacements. 
The first one was that of Nyamirambo who was replaced by the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge. And I approved because the person had just spent more than two weeks without being seen and we welcomed, we received at the préfecture a group of people that came to complain that there was no local authority when the secteur was facing a war situation, because this was towards the end of the month of April. 
As for the other conseiller, Nyakabanda, he fled at the beginning, at the outset. And procedures would have been followed for his replacement by naming from the list of candidates to the municipal elections who came next would be appointed. So it's a bourgmestre who appointed the replacements of the conseillers and all I had to do was to accept. 
And the last that I mentioned was a case that I had also seen in my indictment, which indeed hurt me considerably. I'm referring to the case of the Cyangugu conseiller. It was said that he had been sacked by me, chased away by me, who might -- and that I wanted to replace him with an extremist candidate to kill the Tutsi. 
I should like to make it clear that I received that person on the 7th in the evening, and he spoke to me of the situation prevailing in his secteur which was occupied, firstly, by the Alpha brigade in the night from the 6th to the 7th. I had left that position and arrived in his secteur in Gisozi and he could not stay there anymore because he had been warned by a friend. He left. We received him. We kept him at the préfecture and towards the end of the month of April he freely asked to be able to go to the 
Hôtel des Mille Collines where the former conseiller had taken advantage of -- to be able to go behind the ranks of the RPF. 
I tried to call him here. I tried to call him here to testify, but you know what the difficulties have been. He is working at Texwa (phonetic). I have reliable information on that. There had been an exchange of prisoners that have been allowed to leave Mille Collines. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, are you referring to any particular text when you speak of the replacements of conseillers? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, certainly, I'm referring to the law of the 23rd November 1963, which had been regularly -- frequently amended, but that was the law governing local government. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And in that law, you're referring to a specific article? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Your Honours, the document is Exhibit P. 9.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'd asked you, are you referring to a specific article? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I'm sorry, Counsel, I don't remember the specific article. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The Trial Chamber will understand. Well, Mr. Renzaho, let us change topics. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
To make sure that the Trial Chamber understands, do you want to give us the reference so it is relevant, so we have it on record? Even if Mr. Renzaho does not remember right away. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Article 10 bis of the law, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, would this be a good moment to stop now, before you move on to the next segment? 
@MR. CANTIER:
But, of course, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, when we resume at 3:00, then we will first hear this motion concerning an additional witness. We have a few questions that we may wish to ask you, and then we will continue with the testimony of Mr. Renzaho. I am just making sure that you have all the documents with you when we start with that at 3 o'clock. The Court is adjourned. 
$(Court recessed from 1257H to 1501H)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon. 
As indicated before the break we would like to have some comments from the parties in connection with the pending motion from the Defence to add one witness to their witness list. 
And we will start with the Prosecution. Mr. Moses, you indicated in your response that it was difficult to start investigating because you lacked the necessary information concerning the witness's wife, in particular. Some days ago the Chamber invited the Defence to provide the missing information. They didn't have it immediately at hand, but provided it as soon as possible thereafter. 
Now, leaving aside whether the formal requirements have been abided by the Defence, what is your situation now? How complicated is it? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I received that information last Thursday and immediately sent it to our investigations section in Kigali, and simply said: Can you commence investigations? I've heard nothing back from them at this stage. 
There are two aspects, I think I indicated to the investigation for this potential witness, the first is any such investigations which may be able to be carried out in Rwanda. And the second is by virtue of the witness's particular situation having left Rwanda and gone to another country. There are other investigations which can be carried out. 
Your Honours will, I think, understand that the investigations department can't launch those type of investigations, which are necessarily costly potentially, if it requires visiting, as it often does, the people concerned and to carry out such checks with any organisations within the country that that person is in. That can't be launched until -- we can't even apply really for them to have funds used in that way until a decision is made as to whether or not the witness is to testify. It would be impossible to justify on the basis that it was a potential person. 
So those are the -- so far as the first issue is concerned, I don't know how they were getting on. I haven't made any enquiries since sending the information last Thursday. So far as the second part is concerned, none has begun. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You received the information you needed on which date? Can you recall that? You said last Thursday, was that so? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honours. Your Honour indicated, I think, on Wednesday when we commenced that the information we had required should be given to us as soon as possible and it was the following day. I believe that's the 23rd of August. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And how much do you think you would need in order to do what you have to do in case you had the possibility? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I would want Your Honour, I am sorry, to check out with the investigators before committing them, or myself, to a position. And I could make some enquiries -- or have some enquiries made this afternoon, I guess, to see how they are getting on. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence, you understand that the Prosecution is in a very difficult position, and we must follow some rules here and if they are not given sufficient time then the situation is complicated. This session is supposed to end next Friday. That is when you're leaving, is that so? You won't be in Arusha after Friday, or will you? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence has taken all these factors into consideration. And in our motion we stated that we, of the Defence, discovered the witness only on 25 July, and within the Defence we don't have anymore information than the Prosecution, and all the other information that we subsequently collected, we have disclosed such information to the Prosecution in good time, so as to be in keeping with the date for the end of this session and the time limit for 21 days for the Prosecution to carry out its investigation. 
So our motion of 14 August is the same date on which we disclosed the witness statement to the Prosecution. In the same motion, we proposed that the witness be heard on 6th September, that would give the Prosecution enough time to carry out its investigation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, Mr. Nekuie, we know all that. This is not the point. The point is that the information provided was not sufficient. That's why the investigations couldn't start on the day you had envisaged. No one is blaming the Defence. You did your very best. You gave what you had. You gave what was available to you. 
The question now is simply whether we can find a practical solution and whether we cannot. That is why I will repeat my question: Is that Friday the last day you are available to hear testimony? We will ask the Prosecution the same question afterwards.
@MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, sir, we are at the disposal of the Chamber. In principle, we planned to be there on Friday to hear the witness's testimony, but the Chamber in all sovereignty may prescribe a date on which we would be here and we would conform to the decision of the Chamber. So we are available as far as the Defence is concerned. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses, if the solution were to be that we -- that we heard the witness in-chief and gave you sufficient time to prepare for cross, once the investigations were carried out, would you be available for, say, half a day at some stage later? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour, but not the following week, which is -- I think I had indicated that particular week, I am the team at the moment and that was going to be a problem for me. 
Now, yes, any time subsequent to that, of course I'm anxious -- I think everyone's anxious to try and finish the evidence as soon as possible. Perhaps Your Honour can -- if Your Honours can wait until the end of the day, I've had our case manager go now to telephone Kigali to see how they're getting on. And if they are able to give me, and I in turn give you, any indication, once I know that and if I also find out that they have sufficient material that I feel I can carry out my duties and responsibilities properly then -- I'm not wanting to delay this trial for a minute for the sake of it. 
And if I can advise the Trial Chamber that that material is available by the middle of next week, I would happily conduct the cross-examination in the middle of next week. My concern is not to be committed to a position which I am embarrassed about because I have not been given sufficient information or time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This exchange does not in any way imply any suggestion as to how the Chamber would rule, it simply means that we want to explore the situation. And we will come back to you later today, once you have got some provisional news from Kigali. Thank you for this useful information. 
Mr. Renzaho, your examination-in-chief continues. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you.

Mr. Renzaho, first, do you know a policeman called Hakorimana? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
If I have to tell the truth, I don't know his name. I did not know the names of all the policemen that we had at the préfecture. There was a service that managed them and the name does not ring a bell with me.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, could you give us the highlights of your agenda on 9 April 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Briefly, on 9 April 1994 I basically was involved in the implementation of certain aspects that we had agreed upon at the meeting of 8 April. That is, setting up the crisis committee, the various commissions, and looking for the personnel who would help us around those commissions, notably the infrastructure commission whose officials could not be found at the préfecture. 
So, we had to go and look for personnel of Electrogaz, a state-owned company, a state-owned utility in charge of water and electricity. I negotiated with the officials to obtain the release of a number of technicians to come to the préfecture to treat the water, water to be treated on a daily basis. 
And I was very fortunate to have the assistance of CICR, the International Red Cross. That gave us equipment to treat water and had to ensure that the other commissions that were provided for were up and running, and the priority ones were the commission in charge of providing documents, notably the laissez-passers, because there was a huge crowd of people who wanted to leave town on account of the fighting. So that is what I did. 
And about 11 a.m. I went to see many refugees and displaced persons who were at the embassy of the Zaire. There were foreigners and friends who had to be taken care of. There were very many of them. And I had tried to see how we could take them in because the embassy could not take care of all of them. It was the rainy season. Then they had been identified, so they could be given food and water while waiting to have the means to repatriate them.

@THARCISSE RENZAHO (continued):
That was an extremely arduous task, but we succeeded. On 9 April in the afternoon, my family came to join me in Kigali. I sent them to Hotel Kiyovu, a small -- rather, average hotel. And then I had to look after problems of accommodation and housekeeping. So it was -- it was a bit exposed, so I had to ask for some protection. 
So that is about all I did on the 9 of April. Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, looking again at the timetable on that crucial day, can you tell the Chamber what you did on 10 April, essentially? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you very much. On 10 April, in the morning, I received a message that there was a meeting of the International Committee of the Red Cross at the Hôtel des Diplomates at about 11 a.m. Then I continued to work in my office. And in the interval, I received a message from some policemen who were assigned to the downtown area, notably, the Kigali market, that a crowd had attacked the stores, the shops, there. They attacked the shops, pulled off the tiles, carried away what they could, and the situation was getting out of hand. So I telephoned to the army chief of staff because I was told that there were guns of soldiers and gendarmes within the crowd, and so I thought that speech alone would not be enough, and I thought maybe there should be some force to compel them, all the more so as the majority of them came from Nyacyonga, that had experienced a lot of fighting, and that had been attacked by the RPF troops on their push towards Kigali. 
So the army came, fired in the air; they were using armoured vehicles, and then soldiers that came in were calming the shopping area. And calm was restored in the area. And in some other areas that we also mentioned, especially Gikondo. 
So at the time indicated, I went to attend a meeting, which was like a discovery to me, because I knew that in Kigali there was the International Committee of the Red Cross, but I'd never spoken to them in respect to services. And the representative of the ICRC, Mr. Gaillard, briefed us very rapidly on the humanitarian situation in Kigali. It was a situation that I knew. But what I didn't know was that we were threatened with a major epidemic if nothing was done immediately to rescue the situation. He also mentioned contacts that he had undertaken with the president of the republic -- of the prime minister who had promised the full support of the government. And that is how I also met persons in charge of security. I met army officers, gendarmerie officers. And I myself -- we actually agreed on the principle, and we expressed our entire collaboration. 
The meeting ended, and I was summoned by the minister of health. Actually, the government was housed at the Hôtel des Diplomates. That was at about 1 p.m. And the minister for health was there with his counterpart, the minister of public works, and they briefed me on the practical procedures for the holding of a coordination meeting of the services that had to be assigned to the ICRC to help it discharge its duties. 
I told them that at the Kigali city préfecture we had the conference hall, and that it was already playing host to a number of refugees but we could make an effort, during the meeting, to move those people out just so the meeting could take place, and the refugees could get back into the hall after the meeting. We all agreed on the principle of it. Thereafter, they drafted a communiqué listing the persons they needed for the operation. They convened them to a the meeting at the Kigali préfecture on the 11th at 9 a.m. Ended the meeting, and I went back to the Kigali préfecture. 
I don't know whether the other activities I had on that day are of interest to the Chamber, but basically, that's it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I believe that on that day you drafted a communiqué we mentioned, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, that is correct. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I would like to shape that question, because we saw that document in the PVK dated 14 April. 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, since you have started, let's move to the day of 11 April 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to be certain here, we have one statement of 10th April, P. 49, and one statement of 14th April, P. 51. And which one is it that you drafted on the 10th of April? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That was the communiqué that gave instructions for roadblocks to be dismantled. That is, the communiqué of the 10th of April. Basically, the communiqué -- in the communiqué, I asked the population to dismantle the day's roadblocks, as a main point. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is Exhibit P. 49, Mr. President. I'm sorry.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
All right, then, Mr. Renzaho, we'll move on to the day of 11 April. And since you started talking about it, could you just continue, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I started the day of 11 April 1994 with a meeting. It was precisely the meeting that brought together the minister of health, the minister of public works, the representative of the ICRC and his team, and myself, with the public sanitation team. And the ministers had also convened their personnel, those that were required. And the meeting took place in the conference hall of the Kigali city préfecture, from 9 a.m. 
The meeting did not last for long. Actually, they sought to implement what we had discussed the previous evening with the representative of the ICRC. And so at the meeting, gave the floor to Mr. Gaillard who presented his working mission, we supported, and there were practical questions that we raised and addressed; notably, who was supposed to do what? Who was supposed to provide fuel? Vehicles had been presented to the préfecture, admittedly, as well as drivers, but who was going to provide fuel? And so the ICRC representative tackled that issue and decided to provide fuel, and he stated the ethics of the ICRC in such activities. 
For instance, he asked me personally to ensure that the policemen who were going to escort the convoy should not be armed, and I did just that. I explained to those people that that was how it was supposed to work. And all the vehicles had to fly the flag of the ICRC. So it was a coordination meeting to seek to implement of the activities of the ICRC. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, precisely. The objective of that meeting, witnesses have come here in this Chamber to talk about it. So could you clarify us on the decisions that were taken at that meeting in the presence and with the collaboration of the ICRC? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The decisions were that at the end of the meeting the services present were going to be assigned to the ICRC to help it carry out its work; because, of course, there were some specialised personnel who were working, but the resources and the label had to be provided by the government. There was the public sanitation, service of the ministry of public health that was available. There was also the public sanitation service of the préfecture that were assigned to the ICRC. 
And what was it all about, since we're talking about humanitarian actions, and it may not be very clear. It means that after a week of fighting and killing, there were corpses laid out all over that had to be removed and buried somewhere. But that was not all. Because the persons who were carrying out all the terrible acts also injured a number of persons, and these injured persons were the priority because they were persons who could still be saved. So the work included evacuation of injured persons, who had to be identified in various houses in the neighbourhoods, because they were not on the public highway, as I often hear here, or at the roadblocks. So, they had to do with moving in the houses, in the neighbourhoods. And then people would tell you there was a problem in this or that house, and so on. So, it was not only on the highways or at the roadblocks. So we had to carry out that work of research, identification and assembly so the ICRC could do its work. 
Then, again, we noticed that we had a number of refugees, lots of refugees. The refugees went to locations where they hoped they would be protected, and they had done so since the 7th on the large scale, and in Kigali we had a number of sites which were sheltering refugees. And those refugees were hungry, they were sick, and the humanitarian services had to start taking care of them. So those were the matters that were to be dealt with during that meeting of the 11th at 9 a.m. at the préfecture of the town in Kigali. 
At 10:30 I left in order to attend the meeting of the préfets, which was to be chaired by the minister of the interior, but at the time he had not yet returned from the mission he had undertaken with the president of the republic, when he died in the attack. So the meeting was chaired by the prime minister, and it ended around 1 p.m. 
And in the evening, I believe I made contact with a number of managers of hotels in order to see to what extent assistance could be provided to them in order for them to feed the people who were there. And perhaps I'm talking about the Kiyovu Hotel, the Mille Collines hotel, the Hôtel des Diplomates, because they had a number of people there, and the food supplies were scarce in Kigali. In fact, there was a shortage of food. And it was necessary to find an escort for them in order to help them go to the markets for supplies in Gitarama, for example, which was close to Kigali, and where they could purchase food for the people who were staying in the hotel. 
So that is what I did on the 11th. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Renzaho. Could we pause for a while on the meeting of the préfets you referred to a moment ago, and which took place at the Hôtel des Diplomate? 
In your capacity as préfet of the town, did you receive any specific instructions from the prime minister, since you stated that he was the one who chaired that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
First of all, Counsel, let me tell you that because of the first meeting I arrived late, and I apologised for that. But I did not receive any specific instruction, even if some overzealous people have stated a number of things I allegedly stated upon my arrival at that meeting that was chaired by the prime minister. When I'm referring to overzealous people, I wish to refer to a specific witness I will not mention, and whose pseudonym I don't recall, who came and testified in a trial that when I arrived at that meeting I'd started talking about a theory for the organisation of killings. Such people are observing rules we are not aware of. We have lived through a traumatic situation, and no one should invent anything that did not occur. We were placed in a very difficult situation. I have not received any specific instruction. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, apart from the radio, did you have any other means to directly address the population? I'm thinking more specifically of the television, for example. Did you go on television? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In April of 1994, the Rwandan television was not operational. The offices of the national television were next to the offices of the préfecture, the buildings were next to one another. But the national television did not operate, so there was only one way, which was to have messages broadcast over the radio. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, this morning we looked at a number of messages you had broadcast. What was your objective when you were having such messages broadcast on the radio? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. My objective had everything to do with the situation we were faced with. These were difficult times, and people were to try to think instead of unleashing passions, so the messages I sent were messages for pacification. I asked the inhabitants to adopt responsible attitudes in the face of such a situation. That is what I can say. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I now wish to submit to your attention a number of excerpts taken from your interventions that were used by the Prosecution and notably by Witness Alison Des Forges, the historian, and I will ask that you explain to the Trial Chamber what you had stated at the time. I wish now to refer to such statements in a chron -- in the chronological order.
@MR. CANTIER:
And I will, of course, provide to the Trial Chamber, as well as to the Prosecution, the documents I will be using. The first document is P. 50, which is only available in English, on page 9. 
And perhaps the representative of the registry could provide to Mr. Renzaho copies of the documents I will ask him to comment upon in a moment. So the first document is Exhibit P. 50, page 9. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I wish for this document to be placed before you, and I shall proceed in the same manner for the following documents, because it might not be sufficient to rely on your memory. 
Mr. Renzaho, the said document is in English, but we already submitted it to your attention, and I believe you will be able to decipher it. It is not a paragraph, since there are no paragraphs in this text, but I wish to refer to the first 12 lines of the text. 
Could you read them all over again? And once you have done that, I will put one question to you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you do not have to read them out, Mr. Renzaho, just make sure that you have looked at them. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I believe it would not be necessary for me to read it out myself, or would it be necessary for the purposes of -- 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, so let us go straight to the subject. I believe you recall the comment that was made on this excerpt. Are you in a position to explain to the Trial Chamber the objective you were aiming at through this message, and what comments you can make on it today? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The problem is that I cannot read English at a very fast pace, so -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So perhaps we could ask the interpretation booth to translate it into French? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Do you have it available, booth? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I know it was subsequently provided in Kinyarwandan, which might be easier for the witness to read. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is that available, Mrs. Ben Salimo, the Kinyarwandan version of P. 50? Do you have that in the plastic folder? 
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
(No interpretation) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm asking you now whether it is there, the Kinyarwandan version? Can we have a look? 
It's not here. All right. Has the booth got these lines? This is from the prefect of Kigali, and then 12 lines. That's what you want read out, is that so? You wanted to start from the very beginning? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I just provided my own copy for the Trial Chamber. I had underscored it in my copy, but I believe it is indeed the one you mentioned. It begins at the beginning of the page. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If the English booth could read, and then we get the translation into French, please. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I believe it would be easier for someone to read it out from the courtroom, and it would then be interpreted into French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. 
"The prefect of Kigali préfecture urges, once again, all the population to keep on watching out by patrolling through all the ways, even all places where the enemy may establish his freehold. The prefect urges the population from the communes neighbouring the chief town, that is, Butamwa, Kanombe, Rugenge, Rutongo, and Shyorongo, to do more in maintaining security by collaborating with the armed forces in driving the enemy out. They are requested, once again, not to desert their houses because this would mean providing the enemy with a bridge. They are requested to follow the instructions which were repeatedly issued by the ministry of defence and the ministry of interior and communal development. This is, then, an announcement." 
Is this what you want read out, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President. I believe we're not on the right document, and my learned colleague from the Prosecution also agrees. We agree, at least, on that. 
The representative of the registry, could I please get my document back, the one I had underscored? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It was very kind of you not to interrupt me, but you should have done it a bit earlier, I think. Now, I'm doing my very best here, because that's the document I was given. And that's why I started asking you, Maître Cantier, whether the first words were, "The prefect of Kigali," and I was told yes. 
Now, let's sort this out. Mr. Moses, do you have a concrete proposal? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I believe I have the K number at the top of the document which might assist Your Honour. It is, as my friend pointed out, I believe, is page 9 of P. 50. And the K number is hard to read but it looks as though it is K0216044. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But what are the first words to start with? Is it -- 
@MR. MOSES:
$(Microphones overlapping)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- "It is all right," or is it further down? 
@MR. MOSES: 
You'll have to ask my learned friend, but that is the right page, at least. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, sir. If we are on the right page, it is at the beginning of the page, and it starts with, "We request of them to make patrols." 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Shall I make a new attempt, then, just to save time. 
"We request of them to make patrols within their quarters, like usual. They ought to come together and look for their traditional tools they are used to, and defend themselves. I would like to request of them that now each quarter should try to organise itself and make a communal work within quarters by cutting off bushes, searching empty houses, check out in the nearby swamp if no Inyenzi hid inside. They ought to do all this so that they get the hope that nobody hid inside. They must cut those bushes, check in gutters in houses overgrown with weeds. Then at night, they have to be watchful so that they find nobody inside houses and kill him, or something else. People must come together within quarters. On the streets leading to their quarters, it would be a good thing to block them with roadblocks. They can look after them, choose people they really trust, and who have papers, and put them there." 
Is that the essential segment, Maître Cantier? Can we stop there? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. This was indeed the main part of this excerpt that I wished to submit to Mr. Renzaho's attention for his comments, since it was an excerpt which was used by the Prosecution and by Witness Alison Des Forges. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho --
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, Counsel, it would be very helpful if you could tell me the approximate date of the message. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
This document is an interview dated 12th of April of 1994. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Without being able to guarantee that all that is said therein is indeed what I uttered, because I found a number of transcripts which were somewhat changed, or altered. But let me submit the problem to you as it appears. Generally, the messages were linked to specific situation occurring in Kigali, and for which messages were made for the population to adopt specific attitudes. 
On the 12th, the whole city of Kigali had been circled -- surrounded, and the higher parts of Kigali were occupied by RPF troops. The positions of UNAMIR were now under the hands of the RPF, and it was the date on which the government left Kigali. And to show how relevant the message was, during the night of the 11th, we had observed the advance of the RPF forces in the Nyarugenge secteur, Rugunga cellule, where a number of people were killed, and my family and myself came under attack during that same night. I was fortunate enough to have 11 soldiers at my disposal so they were able to chase the attackers. During that same night, there was a foray in the Mulindi cellule in the Nyamirambo secteur. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho? You have been given a text, it appears to be your words, it gives an impression that you're asking people to search for them -- search for people hiding. And the innuendo is that it's an order to kill them. That's behind this. That's what's being put to you. 
Now, was that what you said? It's not explicitly stated. How do you explain this statement? That is what Maître Cantier wants you to comment upon, so don't take this long round around. Tell us, why did you choose those word on the 12th of April where people were being killed in thousands? That's the question. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
First of all, it should be clear that I did not order -- give orders to anyone to kill anybody. I did not give any such order to have anyone killed. The message is referring to the context in which we were, which I had explained. There were forays within our -- the FAR territory. Because the Rugunga cellule is also in the area that was under government control. And I mentioned another case in the Kimisaga (sic) secteur, which was also within the government patrolled area. So the objective of the patrols was to make sure that people coming from outside not be able to enter the government-controlled area, which they had already done. So I was referring to specific cases. 
And to give you, also, some idea on the prevailing situation at the time, in the case of Kimisagara, for example, the RPF troops had already conquered the positions where the Petrorwanda people were, and reached the red light in Nyarugenge. So they ended up face-to-face with attackers. And what I'm telling you is true. 
So the patrols were recommended, as well as searches in the neighbourhood. That was -- those were the recommendations that were made, and there was no specific order given to kill people. I thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fair enough. Now, the word here is not "RPF", it's "Inyenzi". Any comment on that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, I have a comment. Inyenzi is -- does not have a pejorative meaning. I listened to the national radio in 2003, and one of the former leaders of those who organised forays in Rwanda during the '60s, and who had already been freed -- or released before the RPF attack, I listened to him in 2003, and he was boasting about the boldness and bravery. This is a historical fact. I do not know whether that word was used in the pejorative sense. Not at all. It is as if one was to refer to the national guard, which was -- which led to the present Rwandan army. So it was a movement that was formed during the war in order to take into account the historical claim of the descendants of former Rwandan refugees who were outside. And they linked both words, Inyenzi-Inkotanyi. So this was an expression that was used, and I don't believe it was used in a derogatory manner. Inyenzi has a meaning, which refers to the former Rwandan armies. There was a royal militia, which was of high repute, and it was from then on that the word was coined. It comes from there. "Inyenzi". And it is not derogatory in any way.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I will read out a second document to you, a document that was submitted by the Prosecution. Exhibit 51. P. 51. And this one is in French, and it was used by the Prosecution. And it's Witness Alison Des Forges to highlight the collaboration between the administration and political parties.
Mr. Renzaho, I would like you to peruse this document, Exhibit P. 51. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I would like the registry to give that exhibit to Mr. Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which page do you want Mr. Renzaho to focus on in the French version? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we'll look at paragraphs -- paragraphs that are found on page 23, 24, 25 and 26. At each time I would mention the paragraph in question. And for page 23, the first paragraph I'm going to use is the last one. And I'll give you the K reference, because I have only the French version here. So French version, page 23. English version, page 10. And then French version, the reference is K0264709, and the English version is K0111163. And the French version it is the last paragraph. And in the English version it is midway down the page. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho is now given page 23 and the following pages. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, we are on page 23 and the last paragraph. Please read that paragraph and give us your comments, knowing that the paragraph extends to the next page. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
"I would also like to inform you that as part of activities to beef up security, especially to check looting, banditry and killings, I held a meeting with leaders of political parties at the préfectoral and communal levels, which was very useful because it gave us the opportunity to exchange ideas. We realised that all the authorities should spare no effort to make the population understand that these acts of violence will not help us win the war, and that they should, rather, avoid such acts so we should be united and in a position to fight the enemy that has attacked us in our zones, sharing for better or for worse." 
@MR. CANTIER: 
End of quote. Yes, Mr. Renzaho, what is the meaning? And what I'm interested in, as I mentioned a while ago, is to see whether in that paragraph there is no indication of your collaboration with the political parties. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, Counsel, anything that could bring together persons who could contribute to restoring security was okay. If the political parties could appeal to the militants to contribute to such peace, then I had nothing against using them to obtain that objective. 
Now, with respect to the present situation, what I do recall is that at the commune level I asked that political parties be involved in the management of the situation, and I did so under the recommendation of the minister of the interior who had asked the administrative authorities to involve all the influential groups and persons who could have mobilised the population to check the excesses, the killing, the destruction, and so on. 
But at my level at the préfecture of Kigali, I don't know if I'm being excessive here, but the big guys quickly left town, quickly left Kigali, and I was -- if I had managed to get political leaders within the préfecture of Kigali, I would not have found them. Maybe one was left. But the leaders of political parties left with the government, and some had even left before. And I don't know how I would have managed to bring them together at the préfecture. So I believe that -- those are some of the words that just go out, but I believe that I asked the communes to involve political leaders in the management of the situation. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, in the same document on pages 25 and 26, I would like you to look at the last line of page 25 and the first eight lines of page 26. In the French version, the reference is K0264711 and K0264712. And in the English version, the passage is found in the reference K0111164, and on page 11, I believe. 
Mr. Renzaho, the question that comes up when you look at these statements that have been attributed to you, does it mean that you were essentially concerned in your activities -- concerned with the image of your country? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is true, Counsel. I was concerned about my country's image, and that is legitimate. I've always thought that I could do everything within the context of my career. I signed it, signed that I would do everything for my country. And I was disturbed by the unfortunate fate of my country, and deep down I told myself that Rwanda did not deserve the tragedy that was rocking it. 
And so it is true that I -- I mentioned that the country had done a number of good things, and that Rwanda needed the help of the international community. For years, we had lived in peace, in community, and in friendship and sound relations of the internal components of the country, and with sound relations with all our neighbours. It was not Rwanda that had any hostile relationship with any country of the region, and I was saddened that in such a short time the entire world that we had constructed was collapsing, and the country's image, by the same token, was badly damaged. I think I mentioned this. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho. You keep mentioning the word "tragedy". What exactly are you referring to, so we can be clear on that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, there is no other meaning to "tragedy" than the war we were experiencing, the disaster, the situation, and its increase on a daily basis. The people who were killed, the people were killed on a daily basis. And those who were wandering all over and who destroyed all they found on their way. It was all of that situation, really unspeakable. Seek to find a solution to it, but I couldn't. It was an entire country that had gone under.

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, if you are through, I would ask you another question on another document. It is a speech -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I apologise, Mr. President. So can I move on to P. 20 -- I'm sorry. P. 54. It's an interview of 22 April. This passage has also been -- was used by the Prosecution, and in the French version the reference is K0246838, page 20; and in the English version K0272361, page 13. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Since it's a short passage I may just read it out, and the Chamber will hear the interpretation in English. 
Mr. Renzaho, in the French version the passage is in the middle of the page, the second paragraph on page 20, line 7. And the passage begins with: "That is why". Are you there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I'm there, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So I'm going to read it out; it's not long. 
"That is why I would call on you to make every effort so that the -- the organisation of patrols should be improved so that opportunity should not take advantage of it to attack the innocent population. We are beginning to realise that these criminal activities are happening in some secteurs where some young persons combine with unscrupulous soldiers to assault members of the population by extorting money from them and by looting houses." I have ended the quote. 
According to the Prosecution witness Alison Des Forges, it was an absurd effort to shift responsibility for a programme organised by the administration. So, what is your understanding and how do you interpret this passage? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I'm going to answer, even if it saddens me. My first observation is that there were excesses that had to be checked. If I had some other means to react other than speech, other than speaking, I would have used that means. But as a proverb of my people says, weaklings have no other weapons than their tongues. I was reduced to using only my tongue. That maybe leads us to the relevant question: Could my tongue be of any use? I think that it was better than nothing, because if more substantial or more effective means had been found, they may have been used to address that deplorable situation. And so I tried to use statements, incited them, hoping there would be people of goodwill to listen to those words and apply them. Would it have been better not to have said them? I would have had a lot of remorse on my conscience not to have done anything in as much as I could have done any -- something. That's what I did. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I will now move on to a speech -- actually, these are not speeches but interviews issuing on the radio -- a statement that you made on -- a radio interview of 6 May 1994 which is found under reference, in the French version, K0215881. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, we don't have an English version. This document was tendered by the Prosecution under P. 55. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I am going to read out the -- the sentence in question, and so it may not be useful for you to have the document before you. It's an easy quotation, and my question will also be easy. Here's the sentence: 
"In actual fact, nobody can claim to love his country more than the others, except for traitors. One can thus say that those persons are traitors, but -- and they do not love their country, but there is overzealousness." 
And this is the sentence: "It is this overzealousness that indisciplined people are killing blindly, and we oppose this kind of thing very firmly." 
Mr. Renzaho, still according to Witness Alison Des Forges, the fact that you asked people not to kill blindly meant that they should kill with -- they should kill selectively. So what is your answer to that interpretation, and how can you explain that statement? Mr. Renzaho, we worked on this document this morning when we mentioned your various statements that were broadcast on the radio. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am deeply convinced that nobody has the right to kill. Nobody has the right to kill his fellow man. And I feel that it is already some kind of conviction without judgement to attribute to somebody the intention of ordering persons -- or, ordering a person to kill selectively. I was an agent, and I've explain this all through the questions that you've asked me, that there was the absence of -- of legal structures. And I may add that people should understand that in the terrible tragedy that we experienced, at no time was there a legal provision that could give a préfet, that I was, exceptional powers. Such exceptional powers in other circumstances, and in some periods in history, others persons would have used such powers to kill people, to do other things, but I never had that kind of idea. And in the context in which I worked, the context was never that kind of context. 
So I don't know how I could have incited all the grass roots people to kill. Who? I believe that my family went through, they had problems. Some members of my family were killed in some places. Is that the meaning of killing selectively? I think that that kind of reasoning -- well, I respect people's opinions, the opinion of the person who expressed it, but I don't identify with that strategy. The word was misinterpreted. 
All I would like to say is that these persons, these enraged -- these crazy persons who attacked everybody, who killed for no reason, whereas instructions had been given to arrest people and take them to some administrative structures. Well, we did not have the legal structures, but these people had to discharge their duties and arrest those who had to be arrested and send these people to the bourgmestre and to the others. And if these people went beyond the instruction, then they are the criminals. But one cannot attribute responsibility to an authority in that way of killing or asking people to be killed. Frankly, I don't identify with it, and once again I feel really saddened to be involved in that kind of thing. It is not my nature. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I thank you. I think the Chamber has understood your explanations. 
I would like to present a new document to you, a document dated 10 May 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Still another radio interview, Mr. President, Your Honours. It is Exhibit P. 56, Prosecution Exhibit P. 56. It's in French on page 19. And the English version is page 12. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, on the English version it is found on page 12, and the K number is K0365211. And the French version, Mr. Renzaho, K0337480. 
Mr. Renzaho, I wish for you to refer to the second paragraph. And in the English version I believe it is the second as well as the third paragraphs. Page 12 of the English version. 
So, Mr. Renzaho, in order to make progress, I wish to read out to you the sentence that was underscored by the Prosecution witness. 
"It is necessary for the guidelines adopted in this matter to be observed, and it is the reason for which we have decided to arrest any individual who would not observe them and who would be perpetrating criminal acts, for them to be punished. For example, we have punished about three people, which means that we started checking whether the directives were observed." 
Mr. Renzaho, Prosecution Witness Alison Des Forges stated that this proved that you had the requisite authority since you had been able to arrest three people, but that you did not wish to make more efforts in order to arrest more people. 
Mr. Renzaho, what do you say to that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Once again, one cannot force other persons to think as one does. So my answer, Counsel, is that when one says that we had been able to arrest three people and that we could have arrested more, well, yes. That is true. It could have been that way if everybody had acted in order to obtain such a result, and if the circumstances had allowed us to do so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who were these three people? Who were these three people? Very briefly. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, I referred to them subsequently. There's Sukari, Kigingi, and the persons we had arrested in the Rugunga cellule. And besides, there were not only three people, there were more than that. 
But to come back to the charge brought against me, let me tell the Trial Chamber that I have never been an actor, even though this is what is contained in the allegation. On the one hand, I allegedly made positive speeches, and on the other hand I allegedly let people die. And I allegedly let them die when I was in a position to put an end to the killings. This is what I'm being accused of. But I do not wish to abuse the patience of the Trial Chamber, but perhaps I should be given some time and my counsel should be -- should give me more time to express myself on this issue. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I am aware that this is a painful exercise, and that we have spent a number of hours at it today. I would like to seize this opportunity to reiterate to you the advice I gave you on several occasions, and which I also gave you at the beginning of the session. Please try to answer the questions put to you directly, and perhaps you can provide subsequently additional explanations which I might require of you by putting an additional question to you, if need be. 
I would like to state once again that we are not here to prevent you from speaking, but at the same time we are trying to make sure that your utterances will be of some use. Is there something you wish to add to what you just stated, Mr. Renzaho, on this matter, which is indeed important, which we had already dealt with, but which is referred to here once again? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I believe the situation was out of hand. We were living in chaos as I mentioned -- as was mentioned in the different documents we looked at throughout the proceedings. And I believe this was no play act. Those were the realities, people were dying, people were wandering, people were losing all their belongings. And they were in utter despair. And the reason for the situation was well known. Some people showed some goodwill to put an end to this situation, but this led to nothing. 
Let me tell you, for example, quite frankly, that I was one of those who proposed, during the crisis committee meeting that took place on the 7th, the crisis committee, I was amongst those who proposed that a delegation be set up under the aegis of UNAMIR in order to request from the RPF that it stop the fighting, because we were living in a situation of very -- we were living in very tense conditions, and we had all the excesses -- we were faced with all the excesses I mentioned here. But unfortunately we were not heard. We repeatedly made such a request, but it was never accepted. So under such circumstances, the two contradictory situations that are referred to, it's as if one was not accountable to the international community, whereas, on the contrary, others were in a disastrous situation, because people who could have settled the matter were not willing to do so. So this is what I was referring to. And I'm accused of acting. That is not the case. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, Mr. Renzaho. Mr. Renzaho, still in the same vein -- and we're reaching the end of the exercise -- I wish for you to refer to a statement made by the same witness. It was the result of the exercise of the Prosecution with Witness Alison Des Forges at speech dated 8th of June 1994, which can be found in Exhibit P. 61. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We do not have the English version of this document. In the Prosecution binder it is in volume 3, tab 15. P. 61, as I was saying. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page, in French? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. President, in French it is on page 27. The K number is K0369189. And it is at the top of the page. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, let me read it out to you. So, once again, these are interviews and not communiqués, a page that was used by the Prosecution, and its witness says the following, and I quote: 
"Here in town, people who wanted to loot shops were killed so that the movement was quelled. However, we noted that these bandits have invented a new trick which is -- which consists in putting fire to the stores. For example, they have just put fire to three stores, and I asked that this problem be solved today. I demanded that a report be made on the setting up of roadblocks, as well as on the people who are charged with the protection of the stores in the business district -- in the trading centre, so that if there is any incident, those would be the persons to provide explanations." End of quote. 
Mr. Renzaho, Witness Alison Des Forges stated that the authorities were more concerned with the cessation of the lootings than that of the killings. What is your reaction to such a statement? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
There was looting and there was killing at the same time, and there were also other activities carried out. My concern was broader than that, I believe. I did not merely refer to lootings. I was concerned by the situation in general in Kigali. There were interventions that we conducted. As far as I'm concerned, I am not aware of any incident that was made known to me and for which I did not intervene. The only problem was to be able to identify the locations where such events were taking place and the people who were responsible for such acts, or to prevent such acts being committed, or be there immediately after they were committed. 
Perhaps an intervention in a trading centre is an action that was quite visible, and easier. But it was much more complicated to identify each house where there was a death. For example, I believe a witness came here to testify before this Trial Chamber and made a statement that was quite wise and relevant. There was no demonstration where people were assembled and were killed. If there were people killed, it was probably in houses in remote neighbourhoods. And who brought that to our attention? Who warned the authorities that something was going to happen in specific locations? That is the difference. 
I believe the allegation, according to which we would have been more concerned with the protection of property -- and let me say that I was in charge of Kigali, and the shops belonged to the Tutsi to the tune of 65 per cent, and to a few foreigners. But what I'm stating here is true. So I protected the property -- these properties in order to fill my own pockets while populations were being killed? I believe priority would have been granted to persons, but it was difficult to identify these people, and it was difficult to guarantee that actions would be prevented before they were committed because of the disorder that was reigning. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Monsieur Renzaho -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry to interrupt my friend. I note -- I don't know whether this is a suitable time for me to comment on the motion. If my friend's got a question which is only going to take five minutes, then it's his examination-in-chief and I don't want to interrupt it now. But bearing in mind that the issues that we have been dealing with have taken more like 10 to 15 minutes -- I leave it in my friend's hands. But I just want to indicate that I am in a position to assist the Trial Chamber further. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Wouldn't that be a good idea now, Maître Cantier, that we come back to the motion for the addition of the witness, to see how it is developing? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
By all means, Mr. President. I see no problem with that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for coming back so quickly, Mr. Moses. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I have received -- in fact, this afternoon we made some enquiries, and there have been some investigations carried out. They're not sure whether there will be other ones which they can carry out in Rwanda or not. I'm of -- to be quite blunt, I'm obviously quite reluctant to say, yes, I can go ahead, as if that is a concession on the Prosecutor's part that we are agreeing to the motion. And I can indicate that I'm not. 
But, if Your Honours were of a different opinion, can I say at this stage I would prefer the evidence to conclude next week. I understand that Professor -- or, Mr. Lugan is to testify. I can, in terms of scheduling, indicate that I don't expect to be much more than an hour or -- with him, and some of that will be in the qualification process which we've indicated our opposition to, his being qualified as an expert. So even if that was -- he was qualified as an expert, I don't expect my -- for my part, the evidence -- the cross-examination to be very long at all. 
Having spoken to my learned friend, I think he is, in terms of scheduling, asking perhaps that Professor Lugan commence his testimony on Monday afternoon, because I think he's only arriving Sunday night. And I certainly don't have any difficulty with that. My learned friend, without binding him, I think felt he was going to take perhaps four hours. And -- so, in any event, I don't expect his testimony to run beyond Tuesday. 
Because of my team situation, it would -- if the Trial Chamber -- and as I say I'm not encouraging Your Honours to make such a ruling. But if Your Honours do so, I would ask that perhaps the witness be brought to testify on the Thursday, which would at least give me some time to prepare the cross-examination on the Wednesday, and perhaps gives my learned friend some time to also prepare the witness, if the motion was granted. 
Can I just put a proviso on that, and I haven't had the opportunity to speak to the investigator myself. I'll try and do that after leaving court and see if there are further investigations which they are planning, and when they can carry out such investigations and whether they can carry them out by the beginning -- or, Tuesday next week. Obviously if I do that, the preparation -- the level of investigations would be contained to matters in Kigali, but it may be that we can limit ourselves to those -- that nature of investigation without compromising our case. 
So, if I could perhaps finally get back to you when I have spoken to the investigator and -- but I don't know if what I've just told you assists or not. I think it would -- I think it's preferable, if we can, to complete and conclude this case by the end of next week as it was scheduled, one way or other. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
The Defence application for an additional witness to be heard was a problematic request. It's a borderline issue. The assessment has been complicated. We are particularly concerned that it is important for the Prosecution to perform its task, that it has sufficient time for investigation, and it's clear that the Prosecution is, in this instance, in a difficult position. Nevertheless, we think that, having heard both parties and the various arguments, that we will, under the circumstances, grant the application, but we will then certainly not let this witness testify before Wednesday the 4th in order to give the Prosecution some time to prepare. 
And should the OTP feel, at the end of next week, that it has not been able to perform its investigation in a satisfactory manner, then you can address us and we will then consider whether you need an additional remedy in order to avoid suffering prejudice. This said, it is our hope, as the hope of everyone in the courtroom, that we will finish by next week. 
So that should then provide the necessary clarity in relation to this application of the Defence, which has then been granted. And the witness protection unit should then be informed accordingly. 
And we want to thank you, Mr. Moses. 
It's 5 o'clock. We could probably then continue tomorrow morning at 8:45. 
What is your timeline now, Maître Cantier? How much time do you think is left of your examination-in-chief of Mr. Renzaho, approximately? I'm asking for planning purposes simply. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I've done two thirds of it, I think. So given this tempo, I think I will need another day or two to be through. I believe I would have covered the essential areas, but I think I will have to take more time because I've received documents from the Prosecution which will lead us to ask additional questions. So I believe at the latest tomorrow evening I will be through. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for that indication. That will give Thursday and Friday for cross-examination. 
Is that sufficient for you, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I would think so. It's -- it's difficult to know, Your Honours, because a simple -- I mean, it's no criticism of this witness at all, it happens with all witnesses. You can ask what you think may get a short answer and it requires a lot longer. So I -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But in view of the very short duration of Professor Lugan next week, and that the Defence only wants apparently to start Lugan Monday afternoon, we still have some possibilities of flexibility should you run short of time this week. All right. 
Anything else to be said this afternoon? Defence? No. 
The Court is then adjourned until tomorrow at 8:45. Thank you very much.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, the Court is in session. 
Before proceeding with the examination-in-chief, I should just mention that we need to delete a few words from the transcripts of yesterday, and this is on page 35 of the provisional transcripts. 
The problem was that Witness ALG could, because of an element mentioned by the Accused, be identified. So for that reason, in the paragraph in the middle of that page, which starts: 
"Now, as regards initiatives, we should place ourselves in the context of April to July of 1994", that sentence remains untouched. And then the next sentence reads: "Events took place in this small area of the commune led by ALG", and the rest of that sentence should be deleted because the reference to a secteur would identify the commune; that was the problem. 
Good morning, Mr. Renzaho.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, we'll carry on the exercise that we were doing yesterday, which consisted of putting questions to you on the speeches you made and the interviews you granted -- interviews that were commented upon by Prosecution witness, Alison Des Forges. 
Now, I'm going to read to you a passage that is found in the interview of 18 June 1994, and it is Prosecution Exhibit P. 62, which is in the folder of the Prosecution, volume 3, tab 16. I am referring to a paragraph, which in the French version is found on page 28. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the English version? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I -- I did not find that exhibit, the English version thereof. So, right now, I don't know whether it exists or whether it is only the French version that is in the records. So the reference for the French document -- the only one I have -- is K0368041. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an English version of P. 62. So why don't you indicate approximately where we are in the document and we will find it. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I've located it in the English, and I believe it is on page 4 of the English, the second paragraph, commencing, "Thank you". It is K0377212. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good, thank you. 
Please go ahead, Maître. 
@MR. CANTIER:
I do apologise, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'm going to read out the passage that I would like you to comment upon. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
"Thus far we've given enough directives regarding identification documents, and I have discussed this issue on several occasions. The identity paper that is required at roadblocks is the identity card, and the information on the identity card, as described by the law -- and that law has still not been modified. 
"I would like to inform members of the population that there is a new method that the Inyenzis are using to disguise themselves. They send spies into zones that they do not control. They often use Hutus or other persons carrying identity cards with the Hutu ethnic tribe mentioned in them, because they know that persons described as such would not encounter problems during checks."
Mr. Renzaho, first, can you tell the Chamber in what context you made that statement? What was the objective you sought when you made the statement, knowing that the Prosecution expert witness stated that what you meant was that persons of Tutsi ethnic origin would encounter difficulties? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel, for your question. The context in which I made that statement was a war context, the war that was going on in the city of Kigali; a war within a major urban centre, whose technique consisted in sending in reconnaissance or elements, or infiltrated agents to carry out special duties that the perpetrators had planned. 
At the same time, we recorded incursions within the country, and this was constant in the reports of UNAMIR. You'll find a series of so-called rescue operations, especially at the end of April, but also in June, those operations were stepped up at that time. So, it means that these operations were actually happening, and also incurred a lot of loss of human lives. 
So, the assailants came in and with the use of pre-established lists, picked up persons that they were supposed to carry back to the area of the RPF. But at the same time, the population was well served. So (inaudible), apart of Nyakibanda, Muhima and other areas -- those operations added to the tension that was already palpable within the population and stepped up the intensity of the killing within the population. 
So, I had to give that instruction to the population. It was the same instruction that was proposed at the frontline, so that care should be taken at the roadblocks where most of those people were passing to avoid any confusion between the whole lot. 
It was obvious that the identity card had always been an official document that people presented at any checkpoint. But, the novelty was that these infiltrated persons used other cards that were impounded or delivered elsewhere. In fact, without these measures, they were communed in the occupied areas, and the technique used was that all documents in the occupied areas -- documents were -- were stolen from these areas and used by the -- the elements that were supposed to carry out missions in areas that were not controlled by the RPF. 
So, the -- the measure was aimed at stepping up vigilance at the roadblocks to avoid excesses -- or, at least, to help people -- to control -- to check people rigorously, because once more, a check up is a mission. But again, there was a different attitude because any defaulting case had to be referred to the administration. 
If they didn't do that, that was their problem. But the measure was dictated at that moment as these people had to be checked at the roadblocks so they couldn't engage in excesses and to maltreat innocent persons; that was the problem. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what witness Alison Des Forges says in her historical analysis is that the kind of statement you made could be considered an incitement to hunt down Tutsis. What is your answer to that? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you answer that question now, Mr. Renzaho, please slow down and be briefer. Will you make an attempt, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, I'll do that, Mr. President. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I'm sorry, I can't see your microphone when it goes on, so I do apologise. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, my question is: The kind of statement you made, and the -- the check -- the kind of check that was done, could it not be considered as some type of incitement to hunt down Tutsis? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I pray you to consider that this message came out in June, if my -- if I still remember correctly. And in June, we had already organised, in the city of Kigali, a refugee exchange operation on both sides of the -- of the frontline. 
Well, this has not been mentioned, but I also said something to the population to the effect that they should support the refugee exchange operation in the sense that the extremely serious situation in which we lived, prompted a lot more humanism, and that the population had to support that operation and understand that people had the right to go to any part of the country they wanted. 
So, I find it difficult to understand how in June, when we were moving almost towards the end of the battle of Kigali, I would start inciting the population to hunt down Tutsis, whereas rescue operations had been undertaken or were underway to help those people -- and, measures had been successfully undertaken to address the problems that we had had. And when such measures were not able to address all these problems, how do I understand that in June, I was impertinent enough to ask or to incite the population to hunt down Tutsis. To my mind, it's something that I can't understand. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, please, try again, to be brief and concise, even -- even if the question is a bit complex. 
I will now put it to you: Don't you think that this charge, that has some kind of double language, is justified in the sense that in the rest of your radio interview, the population observed that members of the commune -- notably, continued to give their blessing to the killings and they were not bothered at all? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you suggesting an answer to Mr. Renzaho, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President, not at all, if I'm suggesting an answer, it will be in the negative. 
Now, simply, Mr. President, it's trying to get into the discussion on doublespeak; that is the charge that was made through witness Alison Des Forges and that is what she said. So, if I'm suggesting something, it would be to answer "yes". Mr. President, Honourable Judges, my question is to allow Mr. Renzaho to explain himself on the difficult issues. I'm not asking any leading questions. 
@MR. MOSES:
It might be more helpful to us all if it was framed in a way by pointing us to the transcript which my friend says such a comment was made, and asking for a comment on that. Otherwise, it's somewhat difficult to follow which particular part of the interview my friend is referring to. 
@MR. CANTIER:
My learned colleague, I have read through all the transcripts of Madam Alison Des Forges's cross-examination and examination-in-chief. I've read the -- the transcripts, but I didn't come with the exact references. But the issues of doublespeak was addressed by that witness, and it is a recurrent topic, especially in this trial. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, is there doublespeak in your intervention? Is there a hidden message there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
No, Mr. President, maybe I should give you my own understanding of the issue, because if you say something and people interpret it some other way, I think these are two different things. The doublespeak or double meaning with regard to the events that were happening, as people are saying -- well, it is true. There may have been people within the administration who were involved in the events. 
We have some witnesses who have come here and testified to cases that I learnt only here at this Tribunal. The person who observes while listening to a message -- a message on -- which asked the people not to be involved in excesses, and which sees another member of the administrative apparatus involved in criminal acts would -- and when such a person hears that measures should be taken against such persons that infringe on the law -- and, then, if he does not see the measures taken, then he compares the two: The message he heard, and the attitude of the administrative elements. 
Then, he feels that there is some double meaning, whereas he may then conclude that the person who gave out the message is manipulating the population or lying; that is the problem. So, having stated the problem, I would like to point out a few illustrations and extrapolate on what may have led to the charges against me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you do that, the follow-up by Maître Cantier would probably now have been -- but, all right, some persons might interpret your message in a particular way, and isn't it then a task for the person speaking to be absolutely clear to avoid misinterpretation? What is your comment on that? 
And then, Maître Cantier can decide whether he wants these examples that you are about to give afterwards. But what is the answer to that particular question I just asked you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Interpretation -- well, anybody can interpret it; that is what I said. A person who observed the members of an administrative structure committing criminal acts at a time when these officials give instructions -- and then, the person committing the act is not punished -- I feel that the observer may interpret it. I mean, we are all human and it may happen. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, what you think -- is that what you thought at the time of the event or is it your analysis after the fact right now? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is the analysis I make now. After listening to Madam Des Forges's commentary, I tried to interpret Madam Des Forges' analysis in the light of the events that I experienced. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, at the time of the events, because it is on that basis that you are being tried, were you aware -- were you precisely aware of that situation and that possible misunderstanding on the part of the population? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I believe that if I was aware that any member of the administration was engaged in criminal acts, I would not stop at telling the population the attitude to adopt in the face of such events. 
I would have also cited examples, and citing the example of the one who was carrying out criminal acts and punished him precisely to demonstrate that what I was saying was not just talk, but precise instructions that had to be respected. That is the problem. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Renzaho. I believe that, for now, your answer is sufficient for us. 
Now sir, during the events were you in contact with what we call here "the Interahamwe" or some of their leaders? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But there's the question, why? Whereas you were in charge of maintaining order and security and members of that organisation were at the origin of such insecurity, how do you explain that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I would like to say that the way things were done at the Kigali city préfecture, with regard to the youth movements of political parties, was in terms of peace -- the same as in times of war. 
In the past, before 6 April 1994, we had spoken to leaders of political parties when it came to problems related to the youth -- the youth of those parties. And in this case, with respect to the Interahamwe youth of the MRND, I will refer you to a memo I wrote to the chairman of the MRND in Kigali préfecture. I think you can find that document. 
If, at that time, I was doing what you say, how would I have had informal relations with anybody? Because that is the second part of the question: Who were the Interahamwe in April -- from April to July 1994? And that is the problem that compounds the situation: Who were the Interahamwe between April and July 1994? Because apart from the population of Kigali, who were surprised in the neighbourhood by the fighting, I'm saying that we had recorded movements of the population who came in from outside in huge numbers -- in bigger numbers than the -- the population of the city of Kigali. 
Imagine hundreds of thousands of people who came from Nyacyonga. And, later on, the people from Nyacyonga started coming into the city from 10 April 1994 -- or, 19-20, following the fall of the Byumba garrison, all the people who had fled to seek refuge with the soldiers now fled towards Kigali with the soldiers. And then, we had another wave; that wave came in at the same time with another wave from the east -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He mentioned a name, I didn't get that, Mr. President. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Then, after the 23rd, we had another wave of refugees from the refugees of Camp Kanombe because that garrison fell into the hands of the RPF. And so, this entire population came and settled in the small pocket of resistance that remained, and I have some trouble identifying that all these people would be Interahamwe. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You referred to the fall of a garrison. Could you just repeat its name? I'm not thinking of 
Camp Kanombe now, but the first reference you made? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I mentioned, Djumba (phonetic), B-Y-U-B-A (sic). 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, that is the city of Byumba, 69. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
But, Mr. Renzaho, you mentioned another garrison. I believe it was the first that fell following what 
you -- you told us. The first wave of the population that came into Kigali, I didn't hear that properly. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, it was -- it was the refugee camp, Nyacyonga, Rusiné. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, we heard that -- it's the name we didn't get. How do you spell that name, sir?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is number 409 on our list. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But, you see, the problem is not that name; that's well-known to all here. The problem is the word following Nyacyonga. What was that word? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I mentioned "Rwamagana". After the fall of Byumba, Rwamagana was affected, you know, with the fall of the eastern front and they were moving towards Kigali. 
@MR. CANTIER:
It is number 489 on the list, Rwamagana. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's leave it at that. That's fine, thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, in your position as the guarantor of peace and security, under what circumstances would you requisition the gendarmerie or the army? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. In my position as the guarantor of peace and security, during the war from 
April to July 1994, it was very difficult for me, because the gendarmerie, which customarily intervenes in cases of maintenance of law and order, in cases of -- of crowds, or union activities was not available. 
The low numbers that remained were spread out to refugee reception sites. But, I do recall that often when I actually requisitioned force, I was told that the gendarmerie units were also engaged in the frontline and that was the truth. 
And I may add that the gendarmerie brigades in the various neighbourhoods -- and those were the brigades that intervened to maintain order within the population generally -- received combat missions as the fighting moved to most of the neighbourhoods of the capital. So, there were no gendarmes most of the time to intervene. 
Now, talking about the army, I believe a witness actually talked about this in this case. I tried -- I turned everywhere. I asked for help too from the army, you know, through informal contacts, but I knew that, according to the procedure, I did not have direct access to the army for purposes of law and order. But it was the gendarmerie who, if overwhelmed by the situation, would have access to the army or to the ministry of national defence, which is the coordinator. 
But you understand that the situation did not give us respite to find a solution. So I turned where I could and sometimes I did not receive anything on account of the situation. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you briefly, but precisely, cite some examples where you obtained the assistance of the gendarmerie? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
There are not many examples to cite. I believe that, generally speaking, I obtained that refugee reception sites should be protected by an element of the gendarmerie. And the gendarmerie staff's strength was very low admittedly, and that explained some of the excesses that happened sometimes, but I managed to obtain that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Sorry, can you cite some of the refugee reception sites? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. These were Saint Paul, Sainte Famille, Hôtel des Mille Colline, the 
Lycée de Notre Dame de Citeaux, the Rwanga parish that was entrusted to a gendarmerie detachment from Nyamirambo, and other refugees were in the Saint Andre school -- and those are the sites I'm mentioning. And other sites by the force of circumstances were, rather, evacuated: Kiyovu, Celtar, and others, because the shelling was so much that the -- the -- the spreading out of the sites could not be managed. 
We couldn't do much to help them, so we moved them to Hôtel Mille Colline, and others went to (unintelligible) Sainte Famille. But those are some of the main refugee reception sites in the area that was still under government control. There were others in the areas controlled by the RPF, and I may cite some. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Remember to slow down when you are giving all these names. You mentioned a school that I don't think we've heard of often in this trial. Can you repeat that name and possibly spell it, if it's not on the spelling list, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, the school is Saint Andre; it is behind Charles Lwanga parish. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Sorry, Mr. Renzaho, it's 510 on the list, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, and then there was an enumeration. You mentioned Kiyovu, is that so? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Hotel Kiyovu, Mr. President. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Number 256, Hotel Kiyovu. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then there was another name after that one, can you help us, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, it's Celtar, C-E-L-T-E-R (sic). There were many people gathered there and they were evacuated. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Number 76, I believe. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I believe there was also Charles Lwanga that was cited; it's 261. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, on the counterbalance, can you cite a number of examples where you requested for intervention and they were not answered positively? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Charity begins at home; I'll talk about the CELA incident. Yesterday, I mentioned the circumstances in which I intervened at CELA. I will not go back on them, but what is certain is that when I got the call from the gendarmes who were at CELA, I asked why they had not called for reinforcements from their superiors. And they told me they had called Colonel Munyakazi who had not come. So, I sought to -- to cross-check that information, and I asked my secretary to find out the Muhima gendarmerie and find Colonel Munyakazi. That is what he did, and in the -- in the presence of members of the crisis committee in the secteur of the Kigali city, I spoke to Colonel Munyakazi. 
I put to him a problem that had cropped up at CELA, and called for his intervention as soon as possible. And he replied that the -- the problem was not his concern, and that the situation -- the way it appeared was the business of the civilian authority. And he said, "Maintenance of law and order was the business of the civilian authority". 
I answered, "Yes, that is true, but public force that can be used by the civilian authority in cases of excesses is the gendarmerie that you are. So to defuse the crisis, the civilian authority has to be on the spot and you have to understand that public force is your element who are on the ground". 
So, I proposed to him that they should go there -- or, send somebody higher up of the hierarchy there to represent authority, or to -- to backstop the lieutenant who was there. I also appointed officials from the commune to go to CELA and solve the incident. That is what we agreed. 
So, there you have a case where I -- I went up to an official and it didn't work; it didn't turn out well. Because later on, when I personally intervened, when I had asked him to go there because I was also going to be there, he did not come. There are other cases, and I may cite the case of 
Simonga (sic), who went to evacuate refugees at Nyamirambo. Because the situation was becoming untenable because of the fighting that was drawing near, and the convoy in which he was came up to the gendarmerie. There was a roadblock manned by excited civilians; they stopped him. Then he negotiated, saying that he was evacuating persons that had to be protected. 
Well, they didn't listen to him, and persons were brought down from the vehicle, taken to a primary school below Nyamirambo and were locked up there. And the -- the gendarmerie looked on. So, look at the -- witness. I would have wanted that the authority should impose itself at the time of the crime and move away the vehicle with its passengers and take it to the area where Simonga wanted to take it; it didn't work. There were other incidents that became habitual; I cannot cite them here, but the situation was serious. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this last incident was about Mr. Aloys Simpunga, wasn't it? Number 537 on the list, can you confirm that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, the incident took place in Nyamirambo (inaudible)... 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, now you have to listen: Was this Mr. Simpunga you just referred to, yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I sincerely apologise, I think I -- I didn't hear you well. But I doubted whether you wanted clarifications -- or, I thought you wanted clarifications on the Nyamirambo incident, I'm sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So is the answer to my question "yes"? 
You see, the English interpreter gave a pronunciation of the person's name which is not Simpunga. I need your confirmation that the person you referred to was Mr. Simpunga and not Mr. Simonga. Now, will you please assist us so we can move on? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
The name is Simpunga. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Now, the other issue: You referred to a word called "Celtar" when we asked you to spell something a couple of minutes ago. That is different from CELA, isn't it? Now, what is Celtar? That's what we got when you spelt it, can you help us, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
You -- you want to know what Celtar means. Well, it was a Protestant centre, more or less a cultural type of thing. It did also pastoral activities, but received people who might want to organise conferences, marriages. It was a centre to which people fled and where they sheltered. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good, thank you, remember to speak slowly. 
Here follows the next question. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, sometimes in spite of everyone's best efforts, there are difficulties in translation, and I myself wasn't following; I didn't know what it was exactly. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, now coming to resort to a public force, how -- after the 8th of April, the meeting you spoke of yesterday on the 8th in the morning -- how after the 8th of April 1994, did you exercise control over the police? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, it became very difficult. You'll understand because the people -- the policemen left with the councillors, and the system -- the rotational system was no longer possible. And where they were, they were sort of blocked. Apart from the smaller detachment that stayed in préfecture, we didn't see them, and I was telling them we didn't have any means of communication -- the normal means of communication, sort of -- radios, we didn't have any means to communicate with the various offices in various places. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Does that mean that after the 8th of April 1994 -- and, contrary to what had happened before, you could not muster the police force at the PVK? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, it was very difficult to muster the force at that time. And some police officers assigned to councillors were practically served exclusively for -- as bodyguards for the councillors, rather than helping them to go out and get close to the citizenry. That is the tendency I observed in the difficult circumstances; it is regrettable. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you participate in the negotiations that took place at the time after the 6th April -- that is, between the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, for the simple reason that I wasn't a soldier in service, and the delegation made up to negotiate with the RPF were soldiers or gendarme in service. But, I think -- and I think I said so yesterday, when the crisis committee was established at the outset of hostilities on the 7th, it was, as you put forward the idea, of doing our utmost to bring the two parties together to negotiate a ceasefire, because the conflagration was such that to stop the killing -- to stop the disorder was not possible with the intensification of combat. It was absolutely necessary to stop, and we proposed that a joint force of the APR and the RGF, the Rwandan government forces, under the auspices of the UNAMIR, might be put together and rapidly proceed to pacifying the country. That was the proposal, but the negotiations were such that I did not take part in. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, at this point, I should like to ask you if you are aware of a document authored by the ministry of defence, and summarising the situation of the Rwandan army officers? Can you see, 
Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, yes, I know that document, which is a battle order drawn up by the ministry of defence. Yes, I know it. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is volume 1, tab 33 I am referring to. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want Mr. Renzaho to have it in front of him? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No, no, he knows the document.

Mr. Renzaho, so this document, dated the 5th of March 1994, on what basis are -- are you in the document? If you don't remember, I'll tell you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, if it's the battle order drawn up by the ministry of defence, I'm there, in as much as the document lists all the officers, and identifies -- indicates their position, their post at the time -- at the time the document was prepared. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the battle order. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
And, indeed, you are here in this list as an officer put at the disposal of the MINADEF, the ministry of defence; do you remember that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I remember that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Therefore, Mr. Renzaho, I will go back with the following question in our attempt to make it clear to the Trial Chamber what was your role at the time of the events: What were your relations with the government? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you answer that question, Mr. Renzaho, could you indicate to us, Maître Cantier, which page we should look at in MINADEF-2 in order to find Mr. Renzaho, just so that the Bench has identified the relevant portion? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, it's the first two pages that are the most important, because they give the names of the highest-ranking officers, as well as the other ranks and their functions. So, on page 2, you see, concerning Mr. Renzaho, that he was mis à la disposition", at the dis -- put at the disposal. So he's got no military function as such. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the answer, Mr. Renzaho, do you remember the question? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, yes -- well, I'd like him to repeat the question, actually, in point of fact, yes. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Your relations with the government at that time? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
My relations with the government were very, very sketchy. So that means to say they were very difficult. You know that on the 12th of April 1994, unexpectedly, the government left. Very few people were informed that it was moving -- including me, meaning, including me, I was not informed. And I was obliged to hit the road to Gitarama every -- which I couldn't do -- everyday. And so, on a few occasions, I did indeed go to Gitarama. 
I saw people, but the difficult thing was that I couldn't do it all the time. Even the telephone link wasn't established, so there were difficulties. The place they went to had absolutely no command infrastructure, and it was complete isolation in respect of the situation in the interior. So, it was completely isolated from the exterior. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was there no telephone connection between Kigali and Gitarama from the 12th of April throughout the period the government was in Gitarama? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I can't actually confirm that, I never tried; I never used it. But -- except a colleague, and that was when we were in exile, told me that a friendly country -- to try and help, had supplied a satellite telephone to some authorities to be able to communicate -- I don't know. So, you see, I really -- I don't know. As far as I'm concerned, I was given no telephone from Kigali -- from Gitarama to Kigali. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:

So, Mr. Renzaho, you told us that your government -- your minister had not informed you of their departure? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that's what I'm telling you and it's true. When I learned that the government had left or was leaving, I saw the last ones to leave. About 11:30, when I said goodbye to my family, somebody said to me, "Do you know that the government is moving?" I said, "No, I know nothing about that". And so I went to the Hôtel des Diplomates and I saw the last one loading their suitcases in the cars, and leaving. It's as though there was an immediate threat. I couldn't understand; I -- I didn't understand a thing. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you. Mr. Renzaho, might I ask you, when you -- when you were left as the last representative of the state in Kigali, what did you think of it? What -- 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, first of all, let me tell you, I wasn't the only representative of the government because there were forces over which I had no authority, and I think Kigali's particular status is not comparable to the usual situation in other préfectures. 
It's true by affiliation, I was -- I was a representative of the ministry of the interior -- of the government. But there was the army, there was the gendarmerie. Those are entities -- autonomous entities over which I did not have any authority, and further -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What did you think of it? How did you see it? What was your appreciation of the situation and, in particular, with regard to yourself? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, let me tell you that it was -- personally, it was very hard to bear. It was a blow, a very, very hard blow. Maybe my heart is not as others is - but, I felt it personally as a great blow. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us how the population saw this departure of the government three days after it was instituted? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, let me tell you it was a -- it was a clear sign of the distress in which the Rwandan population found itself. And, I think, in general terms, the citizenry felt that the Rwandan state no longer existed, and we experienced situations where the citizens showed us that we had no legitimacy. I can't describe the scenes in which I personally participated where I was treated as a bandit by people I didn't know. It was -- it was the complete déchéance of the Rwandan state. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Coming back to you, yourself, at that time, what were the departments and the -- who were the main people working with you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The main department heads who worked with me were (inaudible)...Butera who was responsible for administration and legal affairs. There was Simpunga, Aloys, Aloysius, Aloys who was in charge of social affairs; and there was Nyamuhimba, who was in charge of the police force. There was 
Silvestre Munyakazi; there was also Munyanziza, Félicien in charge of accounting and his assistant -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I didn't get the name. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Dieudonné -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Dieudonné" something. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
$(Unintelligible)...and others who responded to my call, but many others could not get to the préfecture. 
If you want to tell me who else was close to me, there was the secretary who typed out all the correspondence at the time, Astérie. And there was Alfred, who was there for a while but left. And then there was the bourgmestre, Nyirinkwaya, Pierre Claver, who'd sought refuge at a préfecture. And then after the 12th, Bourgmestre Bizimana, yes -- no, yes, he did. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's break this up, shall we look at the names? We need Silvestre, and after Silvestre, there was an accountant, was that so? Just mention those two names. 
Can you help us, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Well, the first name Butera, Jean-Baptiste, number 66.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm now trying to identify the names we have problems with, not the easy ones. So the accountant, what was that name, please? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That's Félicien Munyanziza, number 327. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And he assisted, was it Dieudonné Nkurikiyinka, number 378, was that the testimony? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, that's what I said. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then there was the name of a bourgmestre. We need Pierre Claver's last name. Can you help us, which number is that again?

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you indicate the activities -- what were your daily activities at that time? What subjects could you deal with at the time? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I can't totally recall. Our activities -- in distress, everything comes up at the same time. I think we had to face the problem of movement. The people who wanted to flee from the fighting -- to flee from the town. We also had the problem of welcoming -- of receiving refugees at various sites. We had problems of public safety because we had to intervene here and there to help the people who called us for assistance calling for help. And we had to intervene when we were informed when information -- there was information that there was an imminent threat, we would try to intervene. 
So, there were problems of water, of provisions, food supplies. The town was cut off; we had to find food supplies. There was a problem of sanitation because the -- the workers were -- couldn't move from where they were. We had to work with the CHK and the Red Cross to get the hospital working and the few health centres still in existence. We had to try, also at one point to mobilise the pharmacists who had stocked supplies in their pharmacies to take them to the hospital -- to supply the hospital. I can't itemise all the problems because they were endless, innumerable, and attempts at solutions had to be found. I cannot give you an exhaustive list. Thank you very much. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, to cope with all these problems, were you at the préfecture all day long? Did you stay up till evening? Can you tell us how much time you devoted to that piece of work? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Time did not count any longer for me. Effectively, I devoted the bulk of my time to the préfecture because there were things to organise -- interventions to be carried out, decisions to be taken, and for most of the time, I stayed at the préfecture for most of that period. 
And as I have said, we did not have resources that we had in times of peace. In fact, most of the workers did not come. There were very few of us, and we had to organise ourselves to do the minimum as much as we could. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us if the assistance to the population that you just mentioned, while providing such assistance, did you give preference to any particular group? And in that connection, could you also talk about the issuing of laissez-passers? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I didn't give preference to any particular group. Any person who was in difficulty, who sought any service whatsoever in our préfecture, was received. With respect to the issuing of documents, we gave a positive reply to all requests. We were not selective in the issuing of such documents -- well, maybe something has happened elsewhere without my knowledge. But, personally, I set up a service in front of the main entrance of the building and assigned some of the refugees who were in there to help the others, and to do so quickly because I was always thinking of the possibility of shelling. That would not take long, and that was a small window that we had to -- to deal with the numerous crowds that came for those documents. And then, later on, we started having heavy shelling. But we made no distinction of the persons who came to ask us for those documents. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you knew that some people claimed that the laissez-passer system was set up to prevent persons of Tutsi origin from escaping from the capital. What is your answer to that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I'll reply that in crisis situations like that one, the delivery of documents to persons moving from one préfecture to the other was -- was the usual practice. It was not invented between April and July 1994. We had that system from the beginning of the war, since 1990. And when the Arusha negotiations started in July 1992, following the ceasefire accord that we had signed with the RPF, the government of Dr. Nsengiyaremye took that measure. And since everybody believed in peace, the measures were taken to stimulate the economy and help the movement of persons. 
So, the laissez-passer document have -- had always existed. In fact, I knew them in the first republic too, when the situation was even worse. Because the laissez-passers were a fixture: You could not move from one commune to another one without a laissez-passer. It was the second republic that abolished that measure. 
So, the laissez-passers in times of crisis have always existed in Rwanda; it was not an invention. It was a protective measure in that time of suspicion, brutal attacks on persons without any kind of verification. Someone who had a laissez-passer was supposed to have met with officials who had granted them permission to enter, but it was not directed against the Tutsis, because Tutsis came and I served them. 
I may tell you that the last of those persons who received a laissez-passer was the former chairman of the state council. I knew him, but I didn't know his family. He came at the end of the month of April, and the hoard of persons had moved out. We served him and we found an escort for him, and then he was escorted to the (unintelligible)...camp, it was Kibuye. And other persons helped from that point to move him -- it was Bukavu from Kibuye. Because the roads were closed off, so we made no distinction between people. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you give us the name of that person, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I don't recall his name, but I know that he was the chairman of the state council. But, frankly, I tried to -- to remember him, but I can't bring his name up. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which ethnicity did he have? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
He was Tutsi and his family, too, I think. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did the préfecture give out fuel coupons? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you for your question, Counsel. I found that charge in my indictment. The préfecture did not have stocks of fuel to share out. In the early days, Kigali lost that part of town where stocks of fuel was stored. Gatsata was already occupied and that was where fuel was stocked, and the others were far away in Kibuye. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Sorry, I should interrupt there. The Chamber has understood that the PVK was not a fuel station. But I asked a question on fuel coupons -- fuel coupons. I'm sorry to interrupt you. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, they are related -- how can I give fuel coupons when I don't have fuel stocks. Yes, there were fuel coupons for vehicles of the préfecture, and those vehicles were identified and numbered, and we went to fetch fuel in the army stores of fuel. There was a commission managed by the army; that commission managed and gave out fuel. That is why I didn't want to say that we -- we shared out petrol coupons when we didn't have stores of fuel. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, in many countries when there is an emergency, there is a system because there is a lack of certain commodities. There is a system that, for instance, civilian authorities may decide who shall get this or that. Now, was there such a system? 
With other words, was your system involved in the decision-making process to decide who should receive fuel coupons, and then, on the basis of receiving such coupons, they could go somewhere else and get the fuel? Was there such a system? Was your office involved in that? That is the question. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President, I'll answer your question. 
Our office was never involved in any organisation to manage the country's logistical situation as far as fuel was concerned -- like, managing fuel and authorising people to take certain quotas. 
I don't even know whether quotas were set, but all what was left in terms of stocks -- that is, filling stations in the city that still had fuel -- were taken over by the army. And to have a bit of fuel by a man who was in charge of the logistics commission -- because we had a logistics commission set up for some other purpose to supply the city of Kigali, and so my man went to meet the persons who managed that stock of fuel so as to service the vehicles of the préfecture. 
That is what I know. But, we did not know any distribution system or quotas for a category of people. I did not know of any kind of system like that to which the préfecture was involved. Thank you.

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I'll continue, and I will ask you the following question: The persons come and seek refuge at the PVK. You have discussed this issue, but in an indirect way; if these people came, how many people were there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, as from the 7th people came to seek refuge at the Kigali city préfecture. Some of them did not stay on a permanent basis at the préfecture. Some of them wanted to go elsewhere; for instance, Hôtel des Mille Collines; and some asked me to help move them to join their families in the centre of the country, for instance, Kabgayi; and others stayed on in the préfecture. And apart from the incident I mentioned, which fortunately did not lead to any casualties among the refugees, some of them were transferred to the Hôtel des Mille Collines; others went to the Notre Dame de Citeaux while waiting for the exchange of refugees, for those who wanted as part of such exchange to move elsewhere. Others stayed with me until 3 July. 
And I want to explain to the Chamber, on 25 June I went to Gisenyi for a very urgent mission where I held discussions and I was held back by some other problems. But the negative situation that was unfolding in Kigali prompted me to want to come back because I was concerned that the refugees that had been left at the préfecture could face problems, and I would not know what to do because we had taken in these people and something could happen in my absence. 
So I did everything. I came across columns of refugees that were leaving -- and then I came back three days after and we managed to control Kigali. I had the opportunity to take them to 
Hôtel des Mille Collines and then the others I took to the Lycée la Notre Dame de Citeaux. Then I was through with these people, and then we left Kigali. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, at that time where was your family? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I think my family -- I don't know at what precise moment you are talking about. Are you talking about June? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, we are talking about this trip that you made, and you mentioned end of June I believe? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And then you explained that you came back at that time because you were concerned about the refugees. So I was asking you where was your family at that same time, were they in Kigali, Gitarama, as we mentioned before, or elsewhere? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel, at that time in June my family was in Cyangugu. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you for that clarification. Mr. Renzaho, what was the ethnic origin of those refugees? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, their ethnicity includes Hutu and Tutsis. I don't know if there was Batwas amongst them. At some point I even received foreigners of European origin and mostly foreigners of African origin, who did not stay at the préfecture. But for Rwandans there were Hutus and Tutsis in the majority and they came from all over, but the majority from the centre and south of the country. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, could you give us a figure for those refugees because we understand that some stayed only for a while and some wanted you to send them to the other side; but can you give us the variation approximately, a figure, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. We kept about 150 persons at the préfecture. They were in the conference hall of the préfecture. And in addition to the workers that were there, they were in the main hall of the building and they also occupied some offices. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you. Mr. Renzaho, how do you explain the fact that people came to seek refuge at the préfecture, whereas parts of members of the state machinery were participating in the massacres, directly or indirectly? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, we were living in a period of distress and the population sought to protect themselves as best as they could and people came to seek refuge at the préfecture. Now regarding your assertion that the massacres were perpetrated by part of the state, people belonging to the state machinery, I don't know. Well, talking about animal diseases, we don't know the first animal that caught the disease. 
And all what I have been trying to demonstrate here, showing the convergence of the various populations that came into Kigali, it's not an illusion, it was real. And I would like to acknowledge, frankly, that talking about the state machinery, I was part of it. And since I am in front of this Honourable Chamber, it is my duty to say whether I received an order somewhere to kill or not, since we are talking about the state machinery, and my answer is: No. 
In my humble opinion, when some civil servants over whom I had some authority, have come here, I have not seen one of them who stated that I gave him an order to kill. So members of the state machinery who killed -- it is true soldiers could have belonged to a particular unit, but was it the unit commander who asked the soldier to go and kill? So, we don't have the evidence thereof. Gendarmes who did the same thing, we don't have any evidence. Some other civil servants was involved in the tragedy of Rwanda. Where did they get their orders from? I don't know. 
I merely observe the view, with your leave, that the government of Dismas Nsengiyaremye could not, in my humble opinion, ferment a plan that would lead to the extermination of the Tutsis because within that group there were many staff who were faithful to the RPF. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, we could come back on this in other questions. But the question on which I wanted you to react was: How do you explain that people come to seek refuge in a structure that could be deadly to them following what is being said today? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you answer, you just referred to this government of Dismas Nsengiyaremye, number 390, is that not so, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, and now the answer please. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I acknowledge that people came to seek refuge at the préfecture. Among those peoples there were my own civil servants, because, to speak the truth, I was there. There were also refugees at the préfecture. And there were people, foreigners, who came to seek refuge at the préfecture. I believe they were looking for protection, and the basic motivation was the quest for protection. And I don't have any doubt that if these people were convinced that we were dangerous, that we were criminals and could kill them, they would not have come. Because they were running away from the danger and they would not have come to our préfecture in the face of the same danger. Thank you.

Yes, I was in my office where I spent most of my time, because I expected problems through the crisis committee, so as to intervene on any issue with regard to some of the activities that were to be carried on behalf of the population. So I made myself available to be able to do something and help them.

My office was on the second floor of the building of the Kigali city préfecture, precisely -- the windows of my office were in the front façade of the building. And for persons who know Kigali, it was opposite the SORAS building. And when you are coming from the army side, opposite the Saint Michel Cathedral.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you and now the answer, Mr. Renzaho. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President. I did not stay in my office after 25 April 1994, on account of the shelling of the building of the Kigali city préfecture. In fact I narrowly escaped a rocket attack that missed the window and fell on the wall at the side of the window, and fell and then exploded in the main garden. 
So I went down to the ground floor and took a small office and stayed there for the rest of the time that I spent at the Kigali city préfecture. It was a small office -- I mean everybody saw that small office. Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, in your usual office, what means of communication did you have? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. In my old office I had two telephones. One was an intercom system. When I wanted any servant, I could telephone directly. Then there was a telephone with an external line. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you enjoy the same facilities in the office in which you moved later on in the ground floor? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not. In that small office I found an intercom set, just like every office of the préfecture had. And that is what I used and I went through the front desk. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When there was this shelling, around the 25th of April that resulted in your leaving the old office, was the office itself damaged in any way? I heard you tell us that the shells landed in the garden. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, Mr. President. There was quite severe damage. The main entrance, for example, all the windows were blown out and a higher floor near -- on the Rwandan TV side was destroyed, as well as the perimeter wall was destroyed. I suppose we were lucky in a way that we could go on working there, but it had been shelled several times. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the telephone connections in that office, were they affected by the shelling? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President. I know that the phones -- phone numbers beginning with 7 were working, although intermittently there were some problems. An attempt was made to repair it, because I had mobilised some technical staff to remedy that type of thing. So, numbers with the prefix 7 functioned.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, let's come back to your activities during the events. Can you tell us -- we will come back to that later -- of cases where you personally intervened on the ground? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The thing that springs immediately to mind is what I've already spoken of, on the 22nd of April at the CELA -- I don't need to repeat the circumstances under which I intervened. But, secondly, the incident -- perhaps not an incident as such, but a problem that required me to go there. I don't like to speak of it too much. But at the Nyirurema health centre. I don't want to dwell on it. There were people who had to be evacuated, important people who were in danger. There were orphans and the responsable was asking for means of transport, water, I provided him with that, and the matter seems to have been settled. I heard no complaints afterwards. 
And another incident in which I participated was quite fortuitous because I did not expect anything. I was on the way to Gitarama where I took Mr. Gamanyi to see his family. I left him at Kabgayi. And being there, I thought -- well, I said to myself, well, I might accomplish several things and go and see a few family members who were at Byimana, near the parish. 
And there was in fact my wife's aunt, and there I saw people who were under threat and who wanted to leave that place and go to seek refuge at Kabgayi. They told me of their problem and I said, well, look, I'm here. If I can do something. Try and get yourselves organised quickly, I don't have much time, and I'll take you to Kabgayi archbishopric. And that's what I did. It was by chance. I was only there to see what the situation was. 
And another situation in which I participated was that of Kanogo. As I told you of the circumstances, I don't need to repeat it at this stage because I spoke of it yesterday. I intervened and I was able to settle the matter with the help of other people. But I tried to explain to the Trial Chamber how difficult was the psychology -- the psychology of the people. It was evidently difficult to work with people that one did not know. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We heard of Kanogo, number 216, yesterday. But we need help with the health centre; is that number 419, Maitre Cantier? Or what was the name? 
@MR. CANTIER:

When you received the -- when you were alerted, you asked -- what did you ask the bourgmestre that he did not do? You've already told us. 
So, Mr. Renzaho, on those events, my question in the instance is with whom did you go there and at what time? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I went with my driver, two policemen who were escorting me, and I went in my Renault 21. I don't know which policemen were supposed to come with me, so I started off. But I heard later on other policemen followed me. 
So I left with those people and I arrived at the CELA through the small entrance, a small track that in fact runs along the northern side. It's difficult to explain, but I think a sketch was used, the higher part, the upper ground of the buildings where there was a small gate allowing access to the internal courtyard which was -- it was overlooked by a mound with a few bushes on top and a few banana trees within an enclosure that was below the OAU Boulevard, which ran from the roundabout to Gikondo and Kanombe. So, there was about 40 people --

Thank you, Counsel. The situation in which I found myself? Well, opposite -- I was faced with an aggression by a group of people who'd entered the plot and who were on that small hill I'd mentioned. They had machetes. They had kuku grass cutters and some of them even had rifles. And when I arrived they were cutting the grass and cleaning around the banana trees that were in that part of the plot. And in the middle there was some gendarme on the side walk, along which -- that I took to get into the plot. And lower down were the refugees, I saw some. 
When I arrived the gendarme came to greet me and we spoke for a few minutes. I asked them what was the situation? What was the problem? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but it is for clarification: How many gendarmes were there when you arrived? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I found about seven or eight gendarmes. I did not count them exactly, but there were seven or eight. And among them I saw a lieutenant, an officer, Kamana, Lieutenant Kamana. And also saw a sergeant major that I knew. He's from my home area and we're even vaguely related; he is the godfather of one of my children. Mugiraneza, Wellars, Sergeant Major Wellars Mugiraneza.

I had interrupted you, Mr. Renzaho. So, you arrived at the CELA and you told us that you met Lieutenant Sekamana, about six or seven gendarmes, the Sergeant Major Mugiraneza, Wellars. Please go on with your narrative. As of then, who were you talking with? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. After having received information as to the situation, the problem that had to be settled -- the matter to be settled was we had to approach the group of attackers and try to understand why they were attacking, what they were after, why they had come there. 
So, I went up to them. I went up the little hillock or mound and tried to start dialogue with them, but the gang were worked up to such an extent they didn't want to listen to me. I introduced them -- myself. I told them I was the préfet of Kigali town. And it was my duty to intervene and ask why these people had come to make trouble in the plot and for the people there and create a disturbance there. 
I asked them to come down from the mound or hillock and to make a semi-circle in front of me on the track by which I'd entered the plot which was still on the top side of the plot. They protested. They proffered insults, but I was firm, insistent. But the few gendarmes there could not resist those people, the 40 of them or so. And in such circumstances it's better not to disturb the beehive. And seeing that I was firm, they began to calm down. But really unwillingly. 
I asked them to hurry up because I had other things to do, and finally they did. They came down to the bottom, to the track at the bottom of the mound or hill. And I asked them to lineup in a semi-circle, which they did but with a very bad face. And I asked the gendarme present to surround them. They had arms. They were armed. I asked them to put their arms down, to put all that material down. 
Now the problem was to identify the leader and try and start a dialogue with those people. I asked: Who is your leader? And they all started shouting at me insults. And to a point where I said to myself, well, these people are putting me in a tight spot, maybe they don't want me to succeed. And I told them, "You are going to listen to me. I've got no problem with you except that you're breaking the law and I am doing my duty. Tell me who is your leader, or who can answer for you. I am coming up here to do my job and I'll be a normal citizen, but let him do it in public." 
That's where I saw one person emerge and asked the others in the group to keep quiet and listen to the préfet. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I am sorry, at this point did you know the person who emerged the group, step forward? Do we have his name? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Absolutely not, I didn't know him. You can't ask me who he was. It was the first time in my life I saw him. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, by your side, or in the group of attackers, was there a conseiller, either masculine or feminine? Were there people that you knew that were present, either behind or facing you with the assailants? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I say here in the presence of the Trial Chamber I saw no conseiller, the people mentioned in the indictment were not present at that place. I did not see Munyeshyaka. And I wonder even how I could've seen him under the circumstances in which I intervened. And I did not see 
Odette Nyirabagenzi, a conseiller from the Rugenge secteur, because the intervention took place without her having reported that was an incident. I did not see her on the spot. Nor did I see Mukandituye, to save time. Maybe if I had found someone who was an authority, who was known, the matter might have been solved more rapidly. But I saw no one with whom -- I saw no one who could be an interlocutor. 
May I continue? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Later, Mr. Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will continue at 11:30. 
The court is adjourned.

Maitre Cantier? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, we were talking about the (unintelligible). And you were explaining to the Chamber the discussion that you managed to establish with a person you're unable to identify and who apparently spoke on behalf of the assailants. Then I asked you whether you could recall the name of that person and whether the group was accompanied by other persons. 
Mr. Renzaho, at this stage of your narration did the bourgmestre come to where you were? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I learnt that he came, but my concern was focussed on what I had to do. Because the issue of the assailants had to be addressed and I was focussed on that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What was the outcome of the discussion that you managed to establish with the "leader" of the assailants? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I took the person who came up and presented himself as the leader of the group. I asked him to take -- to choose three other persons from the group, and we went slightly apart to some place that looked like a garage. And there the gendarme, the non-commissioned officer who was there, I initiated discussion with the people who were there and I asked them, "What is the purpose of your presence here? What is your problem?" 
Then they told me incidents that happened at CELA that had cost the life of two or three persons. In fact, the person who caused the last straw that led to the incident was killed the day before and the person left the commission centre towards Rugenge going through the area where there was the tollgate roadblock at the time. "So with these three persons killed, do you think it was the CELA community that did it? That is, infiltrated persons who came in and shot at passengers or passersby. Why did you not go and see gendarmes? Because there were gendarmes at the Sainte Famille." And then they replied, "No, we came to see the people who were hiding in this place. And the site was not identified. We could not see people here, that is, security officials. So we wanted to know what was happening." 
In short, I cannot narrate all the discussion that we had at that point, so I was able to ascertain that these people were coming under the pretext that people had been killed at CELA. Whether such persons were killed, it's possible because we had killers hiding all over. They burst into homes and killed people. That was true. But was it also true for that particular situation? I don't know. 
And these persons were asking that CELA should be controlled with persons assigned to it on a permanent basis, or that the persons be moved to another site where there were more refugees and under greater control. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Sorry, Mr. Renzaho, at that point, and for better understanding, did it mean that gendarmerie officers were not stationed on a permanent basis at CELA? Because I don't really understand what you mentioned, the gendarmes that you found there when you arrived. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel. I think it is true that gendarmes sent patrols there, but they were not there on a permanent basis. I talked it over with the gendarmes who were there and it was true that gendarmes were not assigned there on a permanent basis. 
And the difficulty of finding personnel to assign at that centre on a permanent basis prompted me to opt for the other solution; that is, I asked the refugees to be moved to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille. The gendarmes were saying that they were in small numbers and they could not split themselves into two. And I saw it was true, myself, because those who were there were really very few. 
So I told the other side, "This is what we are going to agree upon, you have done your job by reporting the problem to security officials. I am the representative of such officials. I will take charge of the situation and in this case your duties as citizens is over, so you'll oblige me by leaving this place and going home because your mission is over. We will take charge of the situation. I promise you, we'll move these persons to the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille centre." 
So we agreed on that decision and I asked the representative to go, and I left with him and the gendarmes who were there to see the group that was still stationed where we left them. We relayed the information to them and it was their representative who told them about the decision that was taken. He took them aside and told them. Some of them demonstrated. Others just hung their heads, maybe as a sign of consent. So I took the opportunity to tell the group that, "We were responsible for the measures that we had taken and we had taken those measures in consultation with you. You had done the right thing by coming to report the situation." 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, I think power is restored. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, in the scene that was unfolding, did you speak to the refugees, or one or more representatives of the refugees, to explain to them the decision that you had thought out or you had agreed upon with the representatives of the assailants? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, first, I had to make the group to go away, that is what I just said. So I dismissed the group. Some left abusing me, but they actually left. 
And when they left, I went back to inform -- to extend the message that the refugees had to be moved to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille. I was with the gendarmes staying near the garage. I invited some of the refugees, because I did not wait for everybody to be present. And I did not even know the exact number of refugees that were there. 
So they came and I asked Lakisana to communicate the measure to them. And I simply said that the first group had to leave in my presence and that the gendarmes were going to escort these people to Saint Paul. And that is what was done. 
And when the first group left, contrary to what the witness came here and said, these people did not pass through the tiny streets on which I had positioned people to get out on the third street to go to Sainte Famille. But they took the short cut, which moved from Saint Paul and follows a small corridor without actually moving on to the highway. The first group left before my own eyes. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Sorry, Mr. Renzaho, I have to ask you a question at this point. That first wave of departures, when did it happen and what did you do? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That departure took place at about 11 o'clock and I immediately considered that my work there was over and I took the vehicle and went back to the préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, at what time did you leave CELA? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I left CELA at the time when the first group starting leaving, at about 11 o'clock. It was at about 
11 o'clock that I left CELA, and that is correct. And I -- let me add, that I was at the préfecture and the gendarmes came and informed me -- neither the gendarme or anybody came to inform me that there was an incident later on. I learnt of it from accusations which came up later to which I reacted. The time is long past, but I learnt of it from external sources. That is the motivation of the incidents. I was not dreaming. I believe I was there and that is what I did. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you were there that morning for two hours from 9 to 11; have I understood it correctly? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, at CELA did you meet persons belonging to the family of Rwanga? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not even know the Rwanga family, and I only read about them in the statement that was given to me by the Prosecution. I did not know the family. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you know a person called Emmanuel Gihana, G-I-H-A-N-A? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I did not know that person, and to date I do not know him. And during my brief stop at CELA I've told you what I did. I did not speak to any refugee individually, separately. I only communicated to them the decision we had taken and I left. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you know a person called Vincent Mugiraneza, M-U-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A, Mugiraneza? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I knew that person. And Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza was an older person in the secondary school I attended. So since we were in the same region we used to take the same itinerary until he moved school because he did not continue with me. But I knew him much later when he took up a diplomatic post. So I knew that person. On several occasions I went to the ministry of foreign affairs where he worked and I knew him. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you meet him at CELA? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, maybe I will bore people by repeating I did not see that person, just as I did not see members of the Rwanga family, and I learnt of their existence only here. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, let us move to the issue of the distribution of arms. Did you distribute or have arms distributed as at 6th April 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I did not distribute or have any weapons distributed. I did not have any stock of arms at the préfecture. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Did you invite members of the commune administration to go and look for arms elsewhere? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I would like to recall to the Honourable Chamber that I had a police service. All security issues including issues related to arms, I could have used my police service to look for arms. And if such arms had to be distributed, then the police had to be in charge. So to answer your question, I would say no. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, how do you explain the proliferation of arms in the city of Kigali, and the charges that were brought against you on this issue on the distribution of arms? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I thank you for that question. And maybe it is time to address this issue on which most of the allegations concentrated. The proliferation of weapons is seen in every country at war. All countries at war experience a situation, and Rwanda was no exception. 
Under the circumstances that I described yesterday in which a country that had lived in peace, a pacifists' country, maybe the word is too strong, and which was suddenly exposed to a wave of aggression, whose military staff strength was 6,000 men, how could such a country cope with the situation? So it was obliged to undertake massive recruitment. And by the end of 1991 and early 1992 that staff strength moved to around about 25,000 men to cope with the various frontlines. So you understand that the system that you had for recruitment, training, could no longer be respected. And the consequence was immediate: a lack of quality for the trained soldiers. That is what I said yesterday and I don't want to repeat it. 
And the outcome of that situation was a near spontaneous proliferation of weapons. Soldiers deserted the frontline. Some criminals, who were recruited without following the regular procedure, used the opportunity to have access to arms. So there were arms coming from soldiers who were disseminating them in the population. I would also like to cite another source of arms. Well, before 6 April 1994, and probably before 1st October 1990, weapons had been brought into the country illegally through the clandestine networks of the RPF. 
And I would like to point to the evidence of a book published by Mr. Valens Kajeguhakwa that highlighted only one aspect. And that book was titled, Rwanda: A Land of Peace to a Land of Blood, and What After? In several excerpts you would realise there were networks that brought in weapons into the country, and he was one of the persons who created RPF networks in the country before the attack of 1 October 1990. So, in that way arms were brought into the country. 
So I will continue now with the situation that we faced with the installation of the third battalion of the RPF and the CND. One has to be blind to refuse to see the reality, not to see the situation as we experienced it in Kigali. These persons received supplies of arms and men from their base in Uganda and the entry was free because those weapons entered the headquarters of the RPF in Mulindi. And through timber transportation vehicles, those arms got into Kigali. And maybe not to take too much time I will say that the weapons proliferation situation in Kigali was already a cause of concern way back in January 1994. 
In many reports of UNAMIR the issue of the proliferation of arms in Kigali is mentioned. And this issue was raised at a meeting that I mentioned at the Kigali city préfecture, a meeting that took place in February 1994. The préfecture authorities had asked that they be able to participate and contribute to the protection of illegal arms and they asked for greater collaboration with UNAMIR. I am not making this up. There was the chief of staff of the army and the gendarmerie. And the issue of proliferation of arms was on the agenda. Unfortunately, the framework for collaboration was not established. But I must point out here the goodwill of all the persons involved to participate in the action to clean up the security situation in Kigali. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, at that time were there soldiers or gendarmes who had left the army or the gendarmerie? Were there deserters? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Are you talking about the situation before 6 April 1994? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, I am talking about the period of interest to us, because we're talking about weapons proliferation; were there gendarmes and members of the FAR, or even policemen, who had deserted? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The management of operations has always come up against such problems, you know, desertion of posts and so on. When you have an operational situation, these issues are there on a permanent basis because in the case of an attack by an -- adversary persons operating certain positions will be reversed. And it is not certain that these persons will reassemble entirely, including their weapons, after. And some of them take advantage of such situations to leave. 
All the more so because I've said from psychological and professional standpoints these people had not been trained the way we were used to training our soldiers. The time frame of training was too short and the combat requirements brought these people to the frontline too early. And I have no doubt that in the period before 6 April 1994, there were soldiers who had deserted. Moreover in the Kigali prison, I visited the Kigali centre prison and I saw soldiers, close to 800, who were in prison in Kigali with the same issue of indiscipline and, notably, desertion. 
So, what you are saying is true. Even more so, in the period after 6th April 1994, because that is what I tried to explain yesterday with the war that took us unawares, with lots of soldiers spread all over within their families, the various neighbourhoods in Kigali and out of Kigali, and who with the abruptness and escalation of the situation could not go back to their units. And I must assure you that these people constituted a serious threat to the country's security because amongst them there were big criminals who suddenly participated in killings, rapes, and so on. So the situation is very real and what you are saying is very, very real. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I am asking you this question because we have seen pictures of roadblocks where soldiers -- or apparently soldiers are standing together with civilians; so is that an explanation of that presence or are there other explanations? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It may be an explanation, but I don't know about the roadblock you are talking about. I don't know the people who were there. I don't have any facts to work upon to say with any accuracy whether -- who it was. But it is possible because you had all kinds of things within the population. It was possible. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, during the events did you go to the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille sites? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Yes, I went to the Saint Paul site and that of Sainte Famille, just once; and if I remember well, it was on 16 June in the afternoon. I accompanied General Aniyidoho to that site. He had a message to put across to the refugees, so we saw the church. We went through the buildings of Sainte Famille to Saint Paul. And then we moved around and I came back. So I visited the site on that date. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was number 16? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is correct, Mr. President, 1-6. General Aniyidoho. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
What was the precise function or post of General Aniyidoho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
General Aniyidoho was a deputy commander of the UNIMAR troops and he was essentially in charge of humanitarian issues. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you know about the book that General Aniyidoho wrote: Guns Over Kigali? There is only an English version of that book. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I've read that book. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, that document is found in our list. It is number 29. That document is two pages long. Mr. President, I would like to cite the passages that concern what Mr. Renzaho has talked about. They are found at the end of page 89, the last six lines. Then the first eight lines of number 90, page 90. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is something you want to tender as an exhibit later on? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If that is the case, maybe we do not have to read this excerpt from the book into the record. Maybe we can simply note that it is here. Then you can tender it and maybe you can ask Mr. Renzaho now whether he agrees with what is here. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, you have before you that passage in which General Aniyidoho narrates his intervention in your company at that site of Saint Paul, of Sainte Famille, on 16 June 1994. So can you tell the Chamber whether you agree with that account of events and what is your comment thereon? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I agree with the facts because the event took place. But my comment would be that there was an interruption in the process, in the transfer of refugees to the places where they wanted to go. And the problem was that RPF troops had shot at -- had fired upon the convoy, the UNAMIR convoy and so there was a suspension of the activities. Activities were suspended and then the UNAMIR authorities began contacting its partners in order to resume operations. Had just announced to the refugees that the very next day -- the very next day, the activities would resume, the transfer of the refugees to their place of choice. This is what was said to the refugees at Sainte Famille and Saint Paul. 
And I regret that only two hours after we were on the spot, the RPF had fired very heavy, 
deadly shelling on the site. Yes, 1,800 refugees were taken away. But many other people were killed, were massacred on the site. It has not been said, but that is the truth. In Saint Paul itself, and principally at the primary school where there were Hutus from Kagugu and Gisozi, and amongst whom were people displaced by the war. Those people were slaughtered with bayonets and knives. And others hearing the screams fled. 
But that's what happened in the night of the 16th to the 17th. And the attack ended at the break of day on the 17th. And we can go on later to discuss what happened later on the 17th.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you have an active role? Were you merely by the side of that general at the time of the visit on the 16th of June, or did you speak to the people? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I don't think I was the only one there, there was also the ICRC, there were journalists, there were many other people. But to answer quite directly to your question, I did not play any particular role because I did not hold a meeting with the people. We just stopped at various points to speak to the people and try and comfort them, appealing to them to be patient, to be brave, and telling them that tomorrow we will resume transferring refugees and doing what we can for it to go well. That was our message to the people. Otherwise, I didn't organise a meeting as such with the people, the refugees there. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you explained to us this morning that the people at Saint Paul and Sainte Famille were among the people PVK was taking care of. Now, who -- who was in charge of supervising those sites? Who at the PVK was in charge of supervising those sites? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
One of my assistants, Mr. Simbuga (sic), Aloys, was inter alia responsible for those sites, because there were other sites for which he was responsible. But he was there consistently because, first of all, the site was -- was where there was perhaps the greatest number of refugees. Because at Sainte Famille, even if people did gradually leave it to go other places, there were up to 18,000 people there, so it was a very big, important site. A lot of people there. So he was there practically every day. He also visited other sites, but he'd visit that one every day. Thank you, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you very much. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It was Simpunga, Aloys, who was inter alia responsible for that site, and he'd go there every day. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Was that site, or those sites, Saint Paul-Sainte Famille, did any major events occur there of which you were informed, of course, at the time? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Incidents were inevitable, but this could have been avoided, and that is the contrast I'd like to perhaps point out -- point to. The incidents occurred at the site several times. They were incidents connected to the war, because the site was shelled, as far as I know, on the 12th of April, the 16th of April; intense shelling on the 1st of May, the 3rd of May, and it was attacked in the night of the 16th to the 17th. 
Incidents connected with disturbances among the people, Hakizimana came here -- his version of the events might be different from what we really knew happened. But those incidents did occur at that site. 
So to answer your question, those incidents occurred, and the attacks drove me to see to what extent we could show the RPF very visibly that there were people and they should avoid going on continuing to shell those sites. That is how I tried to involve the UNAMIR officials in putting a unit there, posting a unit there, so that the UN flag could fly there. But the situation, as we knew, it was difficult, and it is possible that UNAMIR did not have sufficient personnel to post a unit there. It wasn't possible right until the end. There never was a unit posted there. But I know that teams of observers were instructed to frequently go there, but I would have liked the flag to be flown there to show the RPF that there were people there and that they should not shell the place. 
So the contrast is the following: It's that, precisely, there were people, there were those refugees, but some wondered why, for example, there wasn't a big unit posted there to protect the site. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, that was the question I was going to put to you. As far as UNAMIR is concerned, you have told us that -- explained that there wasn't a permanent presence, but that observers would pass. Now, as regards the gendarmerie, as of what date were gendarmes posted there, and how many were detached to guard those two sites? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I think the gendarme were there as of the 9th of April 1994, but not very many because there were not many available. There was not even a complete section, so it was about 11 people. What I know is that there was an officer -- commanding officer. The problem wasn't immediately of any significance inasmuch as it was sufficiently far from the battle front, from the front line, and those few gendarme would be enough to ensure supervision, and in the case of a crisis call for reinforcements to face up to the menace. But unfortunately, through lack of reserve units, reserve troops, they were not available. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us the name of the commanding officer in charge of the platoon, commanding the platoon? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. You spoke of a platoon. Well, a platoon, in the terminology -- or, the jargon I'm used to, a platoon would be 35 to 45 people. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'm sorry, Mr. Renzaho. My military studies are -- were a long time ago. Let us say the unit. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Right. The unit. Okay. Well, the officer on the spot, already named by Father Hakizimana -- well, whoever was in charge of the centre there -- was Iradukunda. But before him, probably other officers were posted there. But Iradukunda was inter alia in charge of the group. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What is the first letter of that name? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I-R-A-B-U-K-U-N-D-A (sic). Iradukunda. 
@MR. CANTIER:

Mr. Renzaho, it is point 3 of the document, paragraph 3, number 3, which mentions the shelling of the 1st of May and which shows the number of people killed and wounded. Is this the event you were referring to before? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, that is the event I was referring to. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you have any comment to make on this document that I have just submitted to you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I think this document confirms what I have just said. These were the most serious events recorded. But unfortunately, the site was in a secteur which was most often shelled by the troops on the other side, on the other hill, Kacyiru, Kimihurura. And maybe the shells overshot or undershot, but they would fall there. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you -- did you come to learn of a document from UNAMIR dated the 2nd of May 1994? It's document 20 in list 4. Another document that only exists in English.

@MR. CANTIER: 
It also mentions the incident, but in broader -- in more detail. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I know that when this occurred, there was some argument as to where the shelling was coming from, and I remember that some people were even saying that the shelling was by Rwandan government forces, which is impossible. The RGF couldn't shoot at themselves. That would be impossible. And the second report confirms exactly where the shelling was from and who was responsible for it, if my memory serves me right.

Mr. Renzaho, did you know who had taken responsibility for Saint Paul and Sainte Famille sites? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel. I knew from the reports I would receive from Simpunga that there were two priests responsible for the sites. And regarding the second one, in any case, there were -- there was, at any event -- there was an event that led to my contact with him by telephone. But to answer your question, yes, I knew that there were two priests, clergymen, one in charge of Saint Paul, the other in charge of Sainte Famille. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, could you give the Trial Chamber the names, respectively, of those two clergymen and the sites they were responsible for? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, might I not run the risk of revealing -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, no, no. Those people are known. You can mention their names here, but without more details. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
So it was Father Hakizimana, Célestin, at Saint Paul; and Sainte Famille it was Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, I was asking you, Mr. Renzaho, if you knew them. You answered no. But you did say that you had -- you did communicate with one of them at a certain stage. Can you tell us who it was, since we're talking of two clergymen? And, secondly, what was the purpose of the telephone conversation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka is the person in question, and the event occurred on the 10th of April 1994. And that is when the people had fled from the secteurs occupied by the RPF. And they came in great numbers to seek refuge at Sainte Famille, but they found already the first occupants in all the buildings, in the church, and in the adjacent premises. And those people's fury blinded them, and they attacked Father Munyeshyaka and told him to get the rich inhabitants out, under the pretext that they were Tutsi, and it was they who had suffered so much who should be able to stay there. The crowd was very -- was immense, and he took the telephone and called me, it was the only phone call I received, and he told me of the problem. And I answered that one should respect the principle of first come. You couldn't solve the problem by creating another problem. 
That being said, I sent a policeman or two. And when they got there, they found that Father Munyeshyaka had already found a solution to the problem. He'd succeeded in placing some of them in the primary school building at Sainte Famille, and others, as I had suggested to him, he told them to go and seek shelter in the numerous annexes in Nyarugenge on porches, or whatnot. But -- for the time being, as a temporary measure. That is what happened then. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you meet, physically, Father Munyeshyaka during the -- at the time of the events? Maybe in a meeting, did you get to meet him? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That priest was not known to me. He was a young priest, and I did not know him. I know that later on he asked for a vehicle, a truck, to move foodstuff (unintelligible). At first, the foodstuff was found in the warehouse of Caritas near La Rwandaise, and later on it was moved from the warehouse of Caritas to the Nyamirambo school. And I asked that he be assigned one of the trucks of the préfecture. That is my relationship with the priest, because I was impressed with his courage in the face of adversity. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This warehouse of Caritas was close to where, you said? Just repeat the location. Just -- 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Close to La Rwandaise. La Rwandaise was a company that was very visible so Caritas, was close to La Rwandaise. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I can't find it on the list. But it is a form of "rwandais" with an "E" at the end. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you knew of the attacks on these sites -- at least you knew of it here from witnesses who came here. The attacks were not like shellings that were mentioned, but incursions, attempts, or forays from Interahamwe militia. So can you tell us what you know about it? Were you informed at the time, and did you have to deal with such matters? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I may disappoint you, but I was not directly contacted to deal with that situation. And I may explain further. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, because it was stated here that a telephone call -- that you received a telephone call from one of the -- the officials that we've just talked about. You received a telephone call, and you did not act on that telephone call. Could you talk about that situation, notably mentioning the date or whether such a phone call was made or not? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
First I must tell you that sincerely, in my heart and in my conscience, I received no phone call from anybody asking me to help out at Sainte Famille or Saint Paul, so I don't see any date here. Because when the incident of the 14th happened, I was not in Kigali and I couldn't have been called on the 14th. And so what other incident could have happened that was not mentioned? I don't know. 
So was it the incident of the 17th of June 1994? Well, I have explained what happened on the night of 16th to the 17th June. Early in the morning -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I have to interrupt you, because that is not the question I asked. My question was precise: Did you receive a phone call from one of these responsible officials we mentioned asking you to intervene? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Second question: Did you receive a phone call from a priest, from a priest you know, and who also requested your intervention? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I learnt of all that after I came here. And to tell you the truth, during the period under consideration I did not receive any call from anybody. And I think that it is a priest that I knew with whom I lived during my secondary school days, a friend whom I knew very well. That allegation saddens me, because it is not in my nature, and I would really like to straighten things out. 
So that is why I sent our investigator back in the country to go and check out the information with the priests concerned. Then he learned that the priest was in Rwankuba parish, to the north of the former Kigali-rural. Because things have changed now. Unfortunately, when he got there, he was informed that the priest had died a few weeks before. 
So my curiosity for information could not be satisfied. So I don't know whether my memory has been blunted to the point where I cannot remember a phone call that I received, especially from a friend that I knew very well. Moreover, I do not know why I would not have reacted. If I could do it for others, why would I refuse to intervene at the Saint Paul centre at the request of somebody that I knew very well? So I think somehow there is a mistake that I cannot place my finger on. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, if such a phone call were made to the PVK, would it have been forwarded to you automatically? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I was not at the PVK all the time, sometimes I moved, and there were other persons to whom such a message could be forwarded. So the message would come into the secretariat of the préfecture, then it would be processed by the crisis committee, and the civil servant in charge would be found, or the message could be sent to Simpunga to intervene on that side, because he did it often. He was in permanent contact with the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille sites. So it was possible. I was not indispensable to do everything. That is why we were organised -- we were an organisation -- because organisation helps to lighten problems. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, we're still on the site, the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille site. Did you give orders on 14 June 1994 for a number of persons to be arrested, persons whose name you had drawn up on a list? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, you speak of the 14th of June 1994. If you are talking about that date, then I must tell the Chamber that I was not in Kigali, so I do not know who drew up that list. I never drew up any lists in the period April to July. What list? No. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you were aware of the incident, to put it lightly. So who do you hold responsible for it? Who drew up the list that has been mentioned by many witnesses, both Prosecution and Defence witnesses? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, allow me a little time to develop further on the incident of 14 June. It won't take much time. I'll try to be brief. 
Responsibility for that incident lies on the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune who received the information and processed it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'll interrupt you for some time. Did you give instructions, or orders, to that effect to the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge? Answer yes or no. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. I could not have given an order while I was away, no. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, now that you've answered clearly, could you give the explanations that you wanted to give, very briefly? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, the explanations have to do with the way the incident was handled. We do agree that the site was guarded by gendarmes. According to information that was sent to me, the incident was reported to the bourgmestre by the conseiller of the secteur on the 13th of June in the evening, that they had information on a possible attack on the Sainte Famille site. There were persons who were being looked for by people, and they were in that site. And thinking that it could prevent the incident, the bourgmestres probably prepared a memo for the gendarmerie before the population could storm the Saint Paul centre, because there were refugees and the consequences of such a move on them would be incalculable. So maybe that was his motivation. 
Now, concerning the way he intervened, maybe that would have been a problem. And according to the statement of Father Hakizimana (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) the following emerged: The petition written by the bourgmestre asking for the intervention of gendarmerie was intervened; otherwise, I don't see how the gendarmerie would intervene without seeing a request to that effect. In the execution of that operation, that I situate in the category of law and order operations, I think that is where the problem lies. 
The officer in charge of executing the mission came with a number of gendarme -- gendarmes. I don't have the exact figure. And it would appear that when they got to the Saint Paul centre, they included a group -- some members of the group of assailants who were there. Then they went and searched the centre to get the persons who were -- whose names we found on the famous list. 
And that is the crux of the matter. Because to involve members of the crowd of demonstrators in a search operation is already an infringement on the regular procedure, because inasmuch as a public force is in charge of an operation, it is out of the question to include some of the demonstrators. That is clear. And to add to it the information (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) from Father Hakizimana, he said that prior to that he had received information, and he asked the persons who were being looked for to hide themselves further off. It means that the search did not yield anything. And since they found nothing, it became a problem, and it was difficult to explain that to the crowd that was there, because some of the members of the crowd had been involved in the operation. That is what went out of hand. And it would appear that the officer was not courageous enough to take control of the situation, to ask for reinforcement; and from what I heard from the father, the officer fled. He escaped. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, there are two problems here. I have to interrupt you.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And one sentence which is problematic is the following: I'll read in English. Listen whether you said this: 
"The petition written by the bourgmestre asking for the intervention on gendarmerie was intervened". 
Did you say that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes. The petition written by the bourgmestre asking for the intervention of the gendarmerie was forwarded to the gendarmerie authorities, yes, asking for their intervention. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It was forwarded. Thank you. 
And then your problems, Mâitre Cantier. You mentioned two. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there is a problem with Mr. Renzaho's assertions on two occasions. Maybe the Chamber would look at that in a moment; two statements that reveal things that should not be known. I heard him twice. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we simply agree that his last long answer will not be transmitted by the video booth, and then we will analyse it in peace and quiet afterwards and decide which portions to be deleted. 
Thank you for that. 
Is this a good moment, Mâitre Cantier, or do you want to finish something before the break? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
A small question on what Mr. Renzaho has said so that things should be clear in our minds. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, your narration that you've just made, is it an analysis of the situation -- a present analysis of the situation, or is it an analysis that you did before? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. It is an analysis that I made, immediately, I had knowledge of that information, because I continued to work to see how that incident could have happened the way it did. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. That was my last little question, for purposes of time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. We will resume at three, and we understand that you are on schedule to finish today. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. And I believe that I will give my learned colleague the opportunity to begin his cross-examination very soon. I know he's impatient, and I'll give him the floor this afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
The Court is adjourned until 3 o'clock.

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I wish to continue and conclude on the episode of the 14th of June of 1994, and I wish to ask you how you heard about what had happened, and what was your reaction, if any, vis-à-vis the bourgmestre? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I heard about the incident on the 14th of June of 1994 through the refugees who were at the préfecture of Kigali town, upon my return from a mission. I had made a small trip to Cyangugu in order to see how my family was. And I heard that there had been an incident at Saint Paul's, and the refugees were angry at the bourgmestre of the commune. 
It was not necessary for me to summon him to my office, everything was settled outside of the building. Because immediately upon my arrival they surrounded me, they started gesticulating and saying that during my absence serious things had happened, and that there had even been refugees amongst them who had been displaced. So the incidents took place almost during the same period. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, sorry to interrupt, but when was it that what you're telling us about took place? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I came back to Kigali on the 15th in the evening, I entered the town, and when I was entering the building I saw the refugees who were sleeping over there, and they came to greet me and told me that some of them had been transferred to the Mille Collines hotel, and that an incident had also taken place at the Saint Paul's centre during which the bourgmestre had not acted in a responsible manner. I remember having gone to the meeting room where the largest number of refugees had been staying, and I indeed noticed that the number of refugees had decreased. I asked what had happened for this incident to take place. I was given explanations which I did not find convincing from him. And I must say that I was in a bad mood, and I was quite angry, and told him that such things were unacceptable and that in such circumstances he should have waited at least until my return, since I had accepted to shelter these people and that the decision to take some out was mine. No foreigner was to enter the premises in order to threaten the refugees. 
Regarding the incident in Saint Paul's, he simply told me that there had indeed been an incident, but he did not provide any details, and I was not given any comprehensive report to know how it started, what his reaction was, and how the incident concluded. 
Subsequently, Aloys Simpunga gave some information to me. It seems that on that occasion he went on the site. And he regretted the fact that the bourgmestre was not on the site at the moment -- or at the time when the incident had taken place. So this is what happened. I must say that I was disgusted, but it was not the only incident. I was faced with a difficult situation in that I had people at my disposal who were incompetent, and when any problem arose had as only objective their own safety. So this was a problem I was faced with. I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, are we to understand that during your absence there were other decisions made by the bourgmestre which were not agreeable to you? I do not know whether the Trial Chamber understood you correctly. In any case, I did not understand you correctly. I was simply putting a question to you on your reaction vis-à-vis that person when you heard about what had happened in Saint Paul's on the 14th of June. I believe you answered that question, but you did refer to other events. Could you very briefly tell us what those events are? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, the two events, the Saint Paul's incident and the first incident I referred to before the Saint Paul's incident, took place at the same time. When I came back from the mission, I met with refugees who told me that some of them had been abducted and transferred at the Mille Collines hotel. And at the same time, I was told that it was not the only incident that had occurred, and that there had been people who had been abducted from the Saint Paul's centre. So when I received the information, I also got the information on that second event. 
Now, as regards the initiative, it was an unfortunate act to transfer the people towards Mille Collines. The Mille Collines hotel was overcrowded, even if part of the Congolese people who were there had been transferred to the Congo. Mille Collines was overcrowded so we had no guarantee that any people who would be sent there would be treated well. So it was a bad initiative. That was my sentiment. 
And it was not the only thing. The way he behaved during the Saint Paul incident, I considered unfortunate. It was unfortunate that in such a matter the person in charge of the administration was not able to monitor the situation from its beginning to its end. And, in fact, we were told that the young people who were allegedly abducted -- or rather, who were abducted -- as was stated by a number of witnesses, were taken to one location and were killed. Or, whether there were negotiations so that some of the people who were abducted at Saint Paul's were heard over the airways of Radio Muhabura stating that one day they would come back with the RPF troops. 
So that is the last piece of information I was given. I heard this, and I saw it in an UNAMIR document. UNAMIR did conduct an investigation on this incident and found no conclusive evidence. But I could reach a conclusion because there was a presence of an administrative authority on the location. But, unfortunately, that administrative authority did not monitor the situation until its end, and that was the reason for my anger. It was an unfortunate initiative on his part. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I believe you had wished to intervene? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just proceed. Thank you. It was a bit too fast for a while, Mr. Renzaho, but then you slowed down again. Just remember the speed. Thank you.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you know the head of the intelligence service who was in Kigali from August of 1994 to June of 1995? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I know him. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you give us his name? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It is Mr. Sixbert Musangamfura. And during the time when I was préfet of the town of Kigali, he was the chief editor of the Isibo newspaper in Kigali and was quite well known. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Number 321 on our spelling list, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you know whether that person ever conducted investigations on the actions of Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, yes, I am aware of that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you know what were the conclusions of his investigation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. An investigation was conducted on the behaviour of Munyeshyaka during the events from April to June following a request made by the Rwandan authorities; and besides, by the president and the vice-president of the republic, as I was told. The investigation was conducted jointly by the military intelligence directorate and the civilian intelligence department that replaced the previous central intelligence department at a time when the state secretariat had just been created in order to monitor security matters in Rwanda. Musangamfura was appointed as head of the civilian branch of the intelligence service. So the investigation concluded that the charges brought against that priest were not valid. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you be more specific, Mr. Renzaho, when you're saying that the charges are not valid? For what reason? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When was this examination or investigation carried out? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
The investigations were conducted in 1995 after the department I referred to was created. And in 1996 the person concerned, that is to say, Sixbert Musangamfura, had to leave Rwanda. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the answer to Mâitre Cantier's question. He asked you to be more specific when you are saying that the charges were not valid. For what reason? 
@MR. MOSES: 
It may be that, Your Honour -- it does allow the question, but I do object to it because it seems to me that it's encouraging, in a back-door manner, once again, by inference, a criticism of the Prosecution witnesses and their credibility, possibly. I don't believe Mr. -- the person involved has actually indicated who he met. 
I have been disclosed some material, which is of a general nature, and it would seem to me that without knowing who he has spoken to, it is of little relevance. And even if he had spoken to people, it then raises the objection that I raised yesterday regarding an alleged criticism of any Prosecution witnesses through a back-door mode. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there any particular document entering into play here, Mâitre Cantier, or is this simply oral evidence? Let's start in that end. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, my wish was first to put these questions to Mr. Renzaho, and then subsequently propose documents to the Trial Chamber, as we usually do, which would confirm the statements by the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What are the possible documents we are approaching here? Are they in list 4, or somewhere else? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Without putting words into my learned friend (sic), they are, I believe, number 17 and 18 in folder number 1 of the Defence that they supplied. And they are process verbal and commission rogatoire.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mâitre Cantier, number 17 and 18 do indeed seem to refer to Mr. Musangamfura. These are the relevant documents. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. But before I put them to Mr. Renzaho, as we customarily do, wish to put questions to him on this issue before I request that the said documents be tendered into evidence so as to read out excerpts to Mr. Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But are we not, then, in the same situation as yesterday, with the only difference that this time you very wisely ask questions before you present the documents? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I believe I tried in this way to follow the ruling of the Trial Chamber, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But are you not, then, trying through this witness to introduce a document against a certain person who might have been used in proceedings previously in this Tribunal? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Not at all, Mr. President. The documents do not concern any other individual and only refer to the investigation that was requested from the head of Rwandan intelligence services and DMI, since these were two different organisations, on the suspicions on Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka. And, of course, he is not the one who is being tried here.

1530H 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which portion is relevant in document 17, and which part may be of relevance in document 18? Can you help us, please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, first of all, the whole document and its contents is relevant. The sentences I have underscored are on the second page of that document, and we only have it in French. It's the fourth paragraph where that person refers to the position he or she had held. 
The following page, the first and the fourth paragraphs were -- or, rather, in which that person tells us what his or her position was at the head of the intelligence service, and the mission entrusted to him or her regarding the activities of Munyeshyaka. 
The following page, first paragraph. And then in the third paragraph, the last sentence, "No evidence was found to support any of these charges." And the fourth paragraph, and more specifically the five first lines thereof. 
On the following page, the paragraph, or the sentence, "Thus people accused Munyeshyaka because he sought refuge in France, accused of supporting the Hutu Power." At the bottom of the page, the response, "The people who were speaking in favour of Munyeshyaka were reduced to silence." And what follows -- I'm sorry, I'm going too fast. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, that's fine. An indication is enough. Yes. 
Now, that is what is relevant in document 17; is that so? According to you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, and one last point on the last-but-one page. I believe it is the last sentence with the name of a person I do not wish to name, since it seems be -- to be someone who alleges himself or herself to be a victim, so that person says that she was not raped and that to her knowledge no one had been raped by Munyeshyaka. 
So, Mr. President, those are the sentences that I would like to insist on, but the whole document is relevant. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses, this is a document which does not concern directly a previous witness in this case. What is the objection, then, compared to the situation yesterday? Because here is a matter of disseminating information about someone else in the indictment, but not throwing doubt on the credibility of the previous witness in the case whose statements should have been put to him or her. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, if it was going to be left on that basis, namely that this was an interview of someone who conducted an investigation of who -- what witnesses he spoke to other than one person who is named who isn't our witness, perhaps there would be no objection. I am aware that there must be a reason for the Defence wishing this to go in, and it is without doubt, in my submission, because they will wish to rely upon it to then turn around and have a go at any of our witnesses and their credibility on the basis of this document, and to say that any such statements must have been invented because there has been an investigation of witnesses and nothing's shown. Otherwise, what probative value does the document have? It has absolutely no probative value if it isn't mentioning any of our witnesses. It can only be -- have any probative value if the Defence intend, down the line, to in fact use it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The purpose must be to say that Mr. Renzaho is not to blame, but another person is to blame -- or, Mr. Munyeshyaka -- sorry. Mr. Munyeshyaka is actually -- has not played the role as Prosecution witnesses have said he has done. But should then, according to your logic, this document have been put to every Prosecution witness that alleged that Mr. Munyeshyaka behaved in a wrong manner? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, it may simply be easier to proceed in the way Your Honour's suggesting, and I'll make submissions about weight at the end of the case. I must say, and must submit, that on what has been quoted there, it -- the purpose must be to have a back-door go at our Sainte Famille witnesses, who testified not only about the activities of Mr. Munyeshyaka, but also by -- on the activities of the Accused. And that clearly is, in my submission, the reason why my learned friend is -- is keen to introduce this document. But I won't take in any further. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But let me just ask you, did you notice the last reference by Maître Cantier? There he is referring to an episode concerning rape. It's on the penultimate page of the document. Does that raise an issue in connection with a particular Prosecution witness? That person did not testify? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Cantier, when did you come to know about these two documents? Specifically, before or after the Prosecution case? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Your Honour, the workload was so considerable and during successive periods that, when we compiled the documents and analysed them in order to prepare the Defence case, I cannot tell you with certainty when I got such documents, physically. But to answer you in a few words, my interest in this document, first and foremost, is Father Munyeshyaka, because he is mentioned in the conspiracy along with Munyeshyaka (sic). That is why I am interested in knowing what comes out of the charges brought against him. 
@JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And finally, why didn't you call the author of this document as a witness? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you for your question, Mr. President. We have experienced problems with witnesses, as I mentioned. On several occasions there were threats, and other witnesses just don't come because they do not wish to do so. The list would be a lengthy one, but you can well imagine that if I had been able to convince him to come here, he would have come to testify. And, of course, the Defence case would have been much stronger if he could have come to testify. Unfortunately that was not so, and this is why I need to make use of these documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This investigation by Mr. Musangamfura, did that lead to a written report? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I do not know about that. What I do know is that on -- on the basis of the two documents, the first one being document number 17, the interrogation of Mr. Musangamfura by a (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover) investigator in the town of (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover), following an international rogatory -- a French international rogatory commission. Mr. President, Your Honours, it obviously took place within the framework of the investigation launched in France against that priest. 
The second document is the summary report of the said investigation which has been produced by a judicial police officer, who is also implementing the decisions of a French investigative judge within the framework of a rogatory commission. And the name of that judge is on the document. 
But, Mr. President -- and I believe this is just an assumption on my part. You do know that Father Munyeshyaka was charged and judged in Rwanda. So I assume that what is being referred to by the witness, or at least by Mr. Musangamfura in his -- during his interrogation has to do with the investigation carried out on the case of Father Munyeshyaka. But this is merely an assumption; I don't know more about that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But Mr. Munyeshyaka was convicted in absentia, wasn't he, in Rwanda? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, in Rwanda. But in France -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Whereas -- whereas this documentation goes in the direction that Mr. Munyeshyaka did not commit criminal acts; is that so? That's the elements you have kindly indicated by showing us paragraphs. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, but it's a sequence. I shouldn't like to speak on other components of which I have no knowledge. But this is from the sequence of his proceedings -- judicial proceedings in France. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But if there is no written report from this investigation, all we have is inquiries and procès-verbal. Isn't that tantamount to, at least, if you want to tender this document later, to try to circumvent Rule 92 bis, an unwilling witness's statement will then be part of the record instead of hearing him directly before this Court, which is the key of the objection? I think this is the last question we have to ask you before we reflect on this situation. Isn't this an indirect way to have testimony -- admittedly only a statement -- but what you would have expected the witness to come to say before this Court, and then without cross-examination of the witness, nor any declaration to tell the truth? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I'm quite aware that the evidential material is brought by a witness that is called to testify and cross-examined. In the instant, the person is not here. But there's a document that is of important probative value for the Defence of Mr. Renzaho, and the -- the Bench can weigh it up. But as a lawyer I am -- must go to the end of my duty to defend, without transgressing, of course. This is not so much that person's testimony as an item of evidence. We have all sorts of documents on the record that have a bearing -- illustrate the accused person's conduct. It's -- it's not evidence that I'm trying to adduce surreptitiously. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is an interesting question. 
Mr. Renzaho, do you have knowledge about the role of Mr. Munyeshyaka which is not based on these two documents? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The role played by Munyeshyaka during the events of April 1994, well, I know that he took the refugees, many, many refugees, numerous refugees at Sainte Famille parish. And not only at Sainte Famille parish, but in fact he transported provisions and mobilised charity organisations for refugees in -- at other religious establishments, at Saint Paul, Sainte Famille parish, the CELA, the Lycée -- the Lycée Notre Dame de Cíteaux, and I'm speaking of Charles Lwanga church in Nyamirambo. Those were all church establishments, religious establishments, and it was Father Munyeshyaka who went to fetch provisions, foodstuffs, and distributed them. But he was exclusively in charge of the refugees at Sainte Famille parish. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. I see -- I see that this was not so helpful. 
Let me ask you, Maître Cantier. You want to solicit evidence from the Accused. Now, is there any evidence from the Accused that you want to have which is not based on these two documents? If the situation is simply that you want to let the Accused say what he has read in the documents, then we get into a difficult area. But if you want to know what this Accused knows, irrespective of these two documents, there is a slight difference. Do you see the difference? I do not know exactly what you want to solicit from the Accused. And if you could avoid this road which is pretty close to 92 bis, actually, and it falls outside 92 bis, then we would avoid the problem. Is there a way out, before we rule? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the questions I was putting to Mr. Renzaho, was -- I wanted to know whether he was aware of the manoeuvres with a view to accusing Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, which manoeuvres are denounced in this document, The procès-verbal of Musangamfura, Sixbert. And the Rwandan intelligence services were charged by he who was at the time vice-president of the republic to put together a file against Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, which is part of the criminal conspiracy of which Mr. Renzaho is accused. And what I wanted to do at the end of the questioning, as we usually do -- but my colleague could have objected then -- to tender this document as evidence in the knowledge that there are two documents, one being the procès-verbal of Mr. Musangamfura, Sixbert, and the other -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But, see, now you are doing exactly what we do not want. You are going into these two documents. 
Mr. Renzaho, listen to the question now: Do you have any knowledge whether there have been manoeuvres to falsely accuse Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka? Do you have any such knowledge based on your own knowledge, not what you have read in documents? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, I am absolutely convinced of it. I am certain, and I can give you examples. I know, for example, the elimination of the Catholic hierarchy in Kabgayi, on about the 15th of June or just before in 1994, is part of that reasoning. I have read considerable material on the situation regarding -- in respect of the question you've put, there is the book of Monseigneur Peraudin. There are books written by other clergymen on the church's position as seen by the present regime. I don't have the slightest doubt as to a policy wishing to diabolicise (sic) the Catholic church. And that is associated with the history of our country. If the social revolution of 1959 to '62 was originally denounced by the churches that felt that the regime of the time was unjust, iniquitous on the social, political, and cultural front, and asked that charity for all, justice for all be established in the country. So it is not for nothing that those who returned to take power had in mind certainly something else, something against the church that had put an end to the regime -- the (unintelligible) regime, the previous monarchal regime in Rwanda. 
Just four days ago a priest died in Butare, and he wasn't properly buried, he was thrown in a garbage pail where he was eaten by dogs. We've heard that news. So they had something against the Catholic church, and perhaps especially the Hutu clergymen who are denounced by their co-religionists (sic). Thank you, President. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The name mentioned before was 341, court reporter. Musangamfura, Sixbert. Sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In case you make a request to tender these two documents, Maître Cantier, we will deny them. We are not going to allow a request to tender these two documents, based on the fact that these are documents from a witness which is not appearing before the Court. He should have been called. 
But you have now obtained that the Accused, through his knowledge, has thrown light on an area which you consider important. Do you have any other questions within this area? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, forgive me, but the two documents are not of the same nature. The first document we are talking of is the procès-verbal d'interrogatoire of Mr. Musangamfura, Sixbert Eric, who, if you would have accepted, we would have called him to testify. But the second document is not a procès-verbal record of questioning. It's a procès-verbal de synthése, which is a summary prepared by a judicial police official after a rogatory mandate given to him by a magistrate. So they are not of the same nature. It is a police -- a judicial police report on instructions of a judge. So it is of a different nature, Mr. President, Your Honours. And I don't think, in my humble opinion, that the Trial Chamber should treat both documents in the same way. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You must not underestimate us, Maître Cantier. We see the difference between the two documents. But, you see, the substance also of the second document is to obtain the evidence of Mr. Sixbert Musangamfura, and that is the point in relation to 92 bis. But let us now leave this discussion. Our ruling in relation to both documents stands. That is our view, even if we have now listened with great interest to your additional remark, drawing our attention to the different character of the two documents. 
Now remains the issue whether you have any further questions to Mr. Renzaho in this area. Do you have that? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you think that Father Munyeshyaka was thus the target of this procedure, according to what we've just said, in his capacity as a priest, as a clergyman, or in some other capacity? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I am utterly, utterly convinced, and you have your -- yourself have heard the testimony of the witnesses who came here. That priest did something -- admirable things for those refugees, and I'd even go very far, I'd say that his absence at that place, at that specific time, would certainly have been a catastrophe. Because I do not see among his colleagues who would have dared to face danger and threats and go out and about as he did. So I'm sure and I'm certain that it's not for non-assistance to the refugees which would -- would justify the accusations against him. I think most sincerely that there must be a political reason to discredit that clergyman, as there has been against other priests. And I live with priests where I am at the UNDF, and we talk together. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, a question occurs to us that comes to mind: Do you remember what -- what Radio Muhabura would say about him? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, let me tell you that that radio generally considered the people who helped -- held in esteem the people that worked to their advantage. And before the 1st of May, they had nothing but praise for Father Munyeshyaka. Why? Not only because he took care of the refugees, but -- and this perhaps a revelation to the Honourable Judges here present -- he dared to transport food supplies from the government lines to the RPF zone in Kabuga, which was where all -- all the people were gathered together, that the RPF had removed from various districts of Kigali. And just up to then it was fine, he was the good disciple. But when he revealed his thoughts to a group of journalists who came to Sainte Famille by criticising the irresponsible shelling of the Sainte Famille, which we spoke of before, and then he was the subject of all the fury that fell on his head. That is the true situation. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was that the end of this sequence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
That was about Mr. -- Father Munyeshyaka. The extracts in the book, Noires fureurs, blancs menteurs, by someone called Pierre Pean, which would be -- which is quite interesting. But the whole chapter is devoted to Father Wenceslas. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Now, we need to make sure that we have not lost some elements here. The first issue was the reference to a monseigneur whose name we have not have spelt. Can we have some assistance there, please? 
You referred to that person in your long answer to me where I interrupted you, Mr. Renzaho. Can you just spell the name of the author of that book you referred to? He was a monseigneur, you said. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Peraudin. P-E-R-A-U-D-I-N. P-E-R-A-U-D-I-N. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. And then we had this name mentioned by Maître Cantier, the last name after Pierre is Pean, P-E-A-N, I understand. 
Then there is the matter concerning the person whose statements we have not allowed being tendered and used during the last sequence. There was a reference to his domicile. Now he is, of course, not a protected witness in this Tribunal, so that should be unproblematic, even if refugee status often is a bit sensitive. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, I can't assist as to whether he is protected under any other court order. That would be my only -- I'm unaware whether, for example, he has testified. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In view of the fact that we do not know whether this is a potential witness in this Tribunal, we think the most correct thing to do is to place the name of the town at 15:42:20 -- and I will provide the spelling later -- and the indication of the nationality of the investigator. So the trip carried out by investigators at 15:42:12, that will be placed under separate cover. 
Now you wanted to move on, Maître Cantier, to a new book; was that so? Do you want to help us with the spelling of the title of that book, since you read it into the record? I'm referring to Pierre Pean's book. I think that was what you read into the record. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes. You want the title, sir? Noires fureurs, blancs menteurs. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Which means Black fury, white liar. Black fury, white liar. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good. That's sufficient for the English transcripts. Then we have that. What is your next question, please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I was saying a whole chapter is devoted to Father Wenceslas, and I should like to tender this document, and merely submit to Mr. Renzaho one sentence, to tell us what he thinks of it. Which is the following, page 417 -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. Now, please identify the document so that we know what we are talking about, and then we will see whether this also raises a procedural issue. Is this in Defence volume 1, or list 4, or where are we? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It's in volume 2, tab 2. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I don't think we have this one. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, volume 2, tab 2. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Actually, the translation, seeing that it's in the plural, should be Black furies, white liars. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you to the interpreter. 
Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
With respect of this, Your Honour, I'm happy for -- I think I've had indicated a sentence. It's in French, and perhaps we'll have it read out before I concede too much. That page -- or, that line, it may be I have no objection. So far as the chapter is concerned, it refers to a number of people who are known to us, both during the Prosecution and the Defence phase. And if there is only one line that is going to be referred to, perhaps -- perhaps we can have a translation of that line and I'll indicate whether I object -- make any objection to that line. But it may be that I'm happy for the fact -- or, that passage to be asked about, but not the whole chapter. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You referred us to page 417. Which paragraph, please, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Page 417, third paragraph. "I will spare" -- (French spoken).
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's starting the words (French spoken), third paragraph -- or, second complete paragraph. 
@MR. CANTIER:
I have a terrible feeling that we are being totally censored. If we can produce no document -- this is a public -- public publication. It's a book that's been sold many thousand copies. If the Trial Chamber is not allowed to read what is in this chapter, well, then we can just sit down and let the Prosecutor prosecute all by himself. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There has been no ruling by the Trial Chamber in relation to this book. We now simply want to know what you want to use on page 417, and now you want to read out the paragraph (French spoken). Please go ahead. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it's because I do not want to unnecessarily lengthen your sittings that I have chosen a small sentence, while asking that the entire chapter be admitted, because it concerns someone who is part of the criminal conspiracy alleged by the Prosecution. And I do not think that it is at all -- it is not relative to Mr. Renzaho's defence. So I will read the sentence: 
"I will spare the reader all the favourable testimonies regarding Father Wenceslas that I have collected, with the exception of one that I have felt it necessary to publish because it is so paradoxical." 
That was the overall appreciation that I wanted to bring to the Trial Chamber's attention. Now, of course the journalist explains exactly what she means in this chapter, which is not all that long. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But we have admitted books and books and books in many, many trials. This is not an investigation or a statement from a particular witness; this is a book, so it's clear that you must be allowed to tender that document, Mr. Cantier. And I doubt whether there will be any objection. 
@MR. MOSES: 
If I could just point out a couple of things to Your Honours to assess. And the reason why I -- I do, is that on page 411 -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Paragraph? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Three. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It refers to a person. And I won't say any more. 
Similarly, it -- on page 414-15, it also refers -- page 414 on the third paragraph. I don't know how it's going to be used, and I've got to -- I've got to say, Your Honour, I'm at a disadvantage, because it all is in French, and my French is not marvelous. All I am saying and pointing out to Your Honours is that I'm -- I'm -- I am perhaps happy for that passage, and if it goes in as part of a -- the chapter, that is fine. If it is going -- other parts of the chapter, in particular those which refer to matters which might fall within Your Honours' -- within Trial Chamber I's ruling -- I mean, I don't know. And I -- I just wanted to raise Your Honours' awareness. That was the reason for my objection. It is because there is reference within the chapter to two persons. So if Your Honours consider it able to go in on -- and there are no issues of 92 bis, then I'm happy to allow it to go in. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We don't see any problems here. We will allow the chapter in. So you can just add this to your list of documents that you will later indicate you want to have tendered in connection with your examination-in-chief. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
The Defence takes due note of the interpretation of Rule 92 bis and will know how to use it properly and correctly without exception -- will apply it. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, are you aware of the indictment issued by this Tribunal against Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I have read it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, enough document questions. Do you -- did you note any allegations in that document -- accusations levelled against Father Wenceslas that would be close to those levelled against you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I found that in Wenceslas Munyeshyaka indictment, which, moreover, preceded mine, included allegations similar to those made in my indictment, and I asked myself, moreover, whether -- why it wouldn't have been so similar as to constitute a joint indictment. Nonetheless, I found certain allegations, certain things said in my indictment, slightly differently additional things said that left me completely dumbfounded, so that as far as I'm concerned, there was a problem. On the one hand, I couldn't not be aware of what I was accused of, but reading that indictment I was convinced that my initial reaction meant -- seemed to imply that people didn't -- were not aware of the situation on the ground, or something that I could not explain at all. Thank you, Counsel. I could perhaps -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Let me be more specific. Is there a specific allegation made against you in your indictment that is also made against Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka? If so, which one, and what comment would you like to make on that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, there was an accusation made against me regarding the kidnapping, abduction of people at the CELA that I handed over to Interahamwe to -- to be killed. And the people named there are, in particular, the family of Mrs. Rose Rwanga. That's what drew my attention in the first place. And in Munyeshyaka's indictment, I found that the matter is mentioned in a different way. 
In my indictment the two Rwanga children, the boys and their father, were presented as victims among the unfortunately people who'd been handed over to the Interahamwe to be killed on the 22nd of April 1994 at the CELA, and I would -- allegedly I heard Madam Rwanga's asking -- begging for indulgence, because I am from the same region as that unfortunate family. And in Munyeshyaka's indictment the two boys would have been killed in Munyeshyaka's presence on the 13th of April, which is already a bit strange.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho -- where, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
At Sainte Famille. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I was aware that this issue was going to be raised, and I am not in any way wanting to prevent the issue being raised, but I think it is only fair that it is done in a proper manner. An indictment is not evidence. Your Honours, I think, were given a copy of the Munyeshyaka indictment by -- in the last bundle, I think it's bundle 4. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, my apologies, I forgot to specify to the Trial Chamber that is on our list number 4 -- number 28, the indictment of Mr. Munyeshyaka, dated the 20th of July 2005, and which was only published during the course of the month of July. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the issue we are discussing now is which part of the indictment? 
@MR. MOSES:
In paragraphs 13, 14 and 15, and 25 is relevant as well, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and what is then your observation based on these four paragraphs, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, in 13, 14 and 15 there's reference in paragraph 13 to an 18-year-old Tutsi girl, the daughter of Rose Rwanga, unnamed. 
Paragraph 14 refers to a 20-year-old Tutsi boy, unnamed, the son of Rose Rwanga; and in 
paragraph 15, reference to a 22-year-old Tutsi girl, unnamed, daughter of Rose Rwanga, all alleged in the indictment to have been killed by Father Munyeshyaka on the 13th of April. 
In paragraph 25, there is a specific count that on the 17th of June at Sainte Famille parish, Munyeshyaka instigated the Interahamwe to kill a Tutsi girl named Hyacinthe Rwanga, alias Bébé, which is, as Your Honours would be aware, the allegation that we have led evidence about. 
So, it was raised on Friday and that's why on Monday we disclosed the supporting material for the indictment. And there was a single witness statement which was the basis of paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 that was disclosed on Monday with the name. 
Now, I am happy for Your Honours to see that statement because it was only recently provided to the Defence, and it may be that Your Honours consider that in fairness to the Defence, you will accept that that would go against the earlier -- the earlier ruling, but there are in terms of the issue that, I think Judge Egorov raised earlier, as to when the Defence obtained that information, I'm not objecting to Your Honours seeing the basis for the supporting material for those paragraphs. 
An indictment, of course, Your Honour -- there were, of course, I believe three or four statements supporting the allegation in paragraph 25; namely, that Hyacinthe Rwanga was killed on the 
17th of June. My concern, Your Honours, with the way in which this is going, and I want to alert my friends to it, is that if my friends wish -- I'm happy for that evidence -- that document to be shown to you, because I'm not wanting to hide it from the Trial Chamber. And, in fairness to the Defence, it may be that Your Honours wish to admit it to be able to weigh it up and to compare it with any other evidence. 
My concern and the issue I want to raise is that if they want to get into the supporting material for the basis of another indictment which isn't evidence, then I will seek to introduce the lot. And my learned friend has been served with it all, and he will be well aware that there is material in there which was not led, which may -- one, be corroborative; or secondly, inculpatory towards this Accused. 
So, I don't know how far my friend is wishing to take this matter. Your Honours will be well aware that with an indictment often the Prosecution will go and re-interview witnesses, and sometimes prior to trial, paragraphs are withdrawn -- as they were done in respect of this Accused's indictment. I'm simply raising the issue that this -- an indictment is a prima facie; that's why we have people coming before Your Honours for Your Honours to assess their evidence. It does not seem appropriate, with respect, for an Accused to start commenting on another indictment in a vacuum. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I was talking about censorship earlier on, but now it is complete censorship. Besides the Prosecutor -- after having telling you what I could not have admitted into evidence, is now telling me what I should have admitted into evidence. 
Up to now, I never requested any advice from the Office of the Prosecution, and I wish to inform the Prosecutor that the lengthy explanations that have not led to any objection -- but, that is the rule of the game. If you are on your feet, it is normally to raise an objection -- are in such a way of explaining -- of explaining your embarrassment, since in two indictments concerning two people who are supposedly part of a conspiracy, you have provided different names and different dates regarding the victims. 
I'm not going to give you my opinion on that, but I need to take note of it. And, for the time being -- and I am in charge of Mr. Renzaho's defence, I am only referring to the indictment. 
The Trial Chamber heard that the documents had been disclosed to me on Monday. 
The Trial Chamber knows where I am since Monday, and the Trial Chamber can imagine how easy it will be to deal with such documents. I am going to focus on the indictment. I am not going to make 
use -- because I did not have sufficient time to do so and I do not wish to do so -- I am not, as I was saying, going to use the other documents which were disclosed to me somewhat reluctantly. 
So, if I may, my learned colleague, let me continue with the examination of Mr. Renzaho. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have now noted the observations of both parties, and look forward to the next question. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Let me set aside this subject, Mr. President, Your Honours, regarding the charges brought against Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, and my following question to Mr. Renzaho is: 
$BY MR. CANTIER: 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you ever hear or receive any complaint regarding rapes that were allegedly committed at Sainte Famille and, more generally, in the town of Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, Counsel, I never heard such complaints. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, were you informed of any such acts which, according to a witness who testified before this Trial Chamber, were perpetrated by a member of the communal administration? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, on this matter let me tell you that I did not receive any complaint, and I was not given any information on the matter, if you are referring to the Biryogo secteur. But if I may say a few words on the issue, and I wish to refer once again to the case of the orphanage of the Calcutta charity sisters. 
You have heard the victim who stated that the event took place three or four days after the 7th, the 7th being the date on which that person went to the Calcutta orphanage. And she claims that I arrived with Interahamwe, and that I chased the refugees who were there. And regarding the women, injurious words have been used to describe my actions. 
Your Honours, let me state that on the 10th -- or, even the 11th, I had a specific schedule and I could not have been in two places at the same time, as I have been able to demonstrate before this 
Trial Chamber. 
So, if I take the example of the evidence provided here in order to prove that a crime was committed, I believe this is something that has been arranged, and I do not believe in it at all -- and there are many such arrangements. I do not have sufficient time to refer to all of them, but there were many such arrangements. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, let me put to you a specific question on the Calcutta sister's orphanage, but you -- I -- I wanted to put a question to you on this orphanage, but you answered before I put the question to you. 
Mr. Renzaho, are you aware of the circumstances under which the journalist Kameya disappeared? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I was not informed of such circumstances, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, even if you have already referred to the matter, could you tell us more specifically, what were your links with the conseiller, Odette, and the education inspector, Angeline? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The journalist just referred to, was that number 209, the journalist? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, number 209. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
And now the answer, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I did not have any special links with these two communal staff members. Why would I have specific links with them since there were 19 conseillers in the préfecture of Kigali town? 
It is only upon reading the indictment when I arrived here that I noted that it was written in my indictment. I did not have any specific or special link with these two staff members. 
Mukandituye, Angeline, was a primary education inspector, so that, in fact, she worked for the ministry of primary and secondary education, working in the Nyarugenge commune. So she should have been directly under the responsibility of that commune. 
The other person was the conseiller of the Rugenge secteur; she was a conseiller. The commune is governed by the law of the 23rd of November of 1963. I was never demoted to the rank of 
conseiller de secteur. I thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you on the 9th or the 10th of April -- we did not know precisely the date as given by the Prosecution witness who referred to this -- so did you go to Kanombe in the company of Interahamwe in order to attack the -- to attack Tutsis in the Akajagali business centre or trading centre? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you for your question, Counsel. No, my answer is no. During the afternoon of the 9th of April of 1994, my family joined me coming from Kanombe. So, what I did was that I went to have my family settle in at the Kiyovu hotel and I took care of practical problems. I do not see how I could have gone to Kanombe in order to terrorise or to kill Tutsi families in that commune. And besides, it is true that I'm here before you as an accused person; that is true. But, frankly speaking, my heart is not made of stone and even when you put fire on the stone, the stone will melt. How could one imagine such a thing, when at the same time I was sheltering refugees at my place of residence? How could one imagine that on that specific date I sent Brigadier Ayabagabo in order for him to organise the protection of the refugees who were staying at my place of residence. What I'm telling you is the truth. I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Brigadier Ayabagabo is number 21 on the spelling list. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what became of this brigadier? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
From the -- on the basis of the information -- the latest information I received on that person, he has allegedly died, and I am not aware of the circumstances of his death. I thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you are also charged with having instigated and having participated in an attack on the house of Elie, a FAR soldier in Nyarugenge on the 28th of April of 1994. What do you have to say in the face of such a charge brought against you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I thank you. I never went to Munyankindi's house and I don't even know where he resides. I did not give any order to anyone to go and kill the people who were at Munyankindi's, let alone head any attack against his residence. And you did specify that he was a soldier. Why did he not come to see me? Did I have any intentions against him? I don't know. 
We lived through very difficult times and to make one person responsible for all such events is not true. The situations I was faced with on a daily basis led to the deaths of human beings, and those were conditions that were difficult to bear in a normal society. This was what we were faced with on a daily basis. 
But it is with great sorrow that I say that one cannot imagine I could have any control on such actions, or even imagine that I could have participated in any killing when the situation was brought about by the sequence of events at the time. We did our best in order to prevent such actions being -- taking place. 
I am craving for your indulgence. Perhaps I was not able to do anything in the face of such a situation, I acknowledge that. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you go to the roadblock that was set up next to the Hotel Kiyovu in the company of Mr. Bagosora, Setako, and Nsengiyumva, on the 14th of June of 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And before the answer, Elie Munyankindi was number 325. 
Now, the answer, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I did not go to the roadblock next to the Kiyovu hotel on the 14th of June of 1994. Those who know me know that I'm not an adventurer. In view of the situation that prevailed at the time, I could not have gone to the Kiyovu hotel. Opposite on the Mburabuturo hill, on which the national -- the Rwandan national university building was, the RPF had settled. That hill is at a distance of 700 metres from the Kiyovu hotel as the crow flies, and all their weapons were pointing at the Kiyovu hotel. 
It would have been strange for authorities to go to this roadblock, which, in fact, is an imaginary one -- especially since the Kiyovu hotel was empty since July of 1994. The refugees who were there, as I stated before this Trial Chamber, were taken and grouped at the Mille Collines hotel where they could enjoy better protection. 
So, I received officers at the Kiyovu -- I would not have received any officers at the Kiyovu hotel, which was a place that had been deserted by everybody. What for? Let me tell you that this -- what I'm saying can be corroborated by other people. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This hill that you just referred, we have two versions. Could you just spell the name of it, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mburabuturo, it is M-B-U-R-A-B-U-T-U-R-O, Mburabuturo. Mburabuturo.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, the Kiyovu hotel -- you had referred to it, since you told us that you had housed your family there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is true, my family stayed there and left that hotel on the 12th of April of 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, were you aware of the existence of a document which was admitted into evidence in another trial, and which refers to a person who was allegedly with you on that day, and that person being Mr. Bagosora -- and as well as a photocopy of his passport? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I don't think it will come as any surprise that I'm objecting to Mr. Bagosora's passport of which I am aware there was considerable argument and debate in another trial that some of 
Your Honours are aware of as to his movements, and it is simply inappropriate in my submission. 
And it falls within 92 bis. 
If they wanted to call Mr. Bagosora to give evidence about his movements, they could choose to do so, and they have not done so. So, I am objecting to any introduction or reference to Mr. Bagosora's passport. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But why would a document, a passport amount to a declaration falling under 92 bis? 
@MR. MOSES:
Because it, I believe, will be used to try and contradict the Prosecution witness who says that 
Colonel Bagosora was present at Hotel Kiyovu on the 14th; that's the purpose as I understand it. I believe it has an exit stamp, but no entry stamp. 
And I have read some of the transcripts from the trial involved, and there was considerable debate about the comings and goings of Colonel Bagosora, and whether there were -- all the entries were recorded on the one document, whether they were all recorded. That's the -- it's -- it's a backdoor way, once again, to try and contradict a Prosecution witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, what I feared is that I fall under Rule 92 bis; it is a strict regime. This is a document which we have been able to recover, and I believe the onus is on the Trial Chamber to assess its relevance. 
Because if we were to follow your line of reasoning, any documentary evidence is indirectly some sort of testimony, Counsel for the Prosecution. And what I'm saying right now is also valid for some of the evidence I used earlier on -- at least, some of them, because, Counsel for the Prosecution, a document is always written by someone. It's always the result of somebody's work. And as a consequence, if the Trial Chamber was to rule in your favour, it would mean that it would be impossible to have admitted any documentary evidence, because any document is the fruit of a human being's work. 
We are dealing with this specific document right now. I believe the Trial Chamber will assess its relevance. We shall discuss, my learned friend, on your famous witness who had come wearing some head gear. We're all aware of this witness. Mr. Renzaho -- it's his right, and I wish to have this document tendered into evidence here. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It is now 5:03. Could you just give us an indication as to where you are in your examination-in-chief, Maître Cantier, how much is left once you have a ruling on this issue? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I believe I have between 20 minutes and 30 minutes left, if there are not too many obstacles in my way. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier, this passport, where do we find it? Is it in the fourth list? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it can be found in volume 1, tab 24 -- and besides, it bears the references of 
Mr. Bagosora's trial. I believe it was admitted into evidence through him, since his name appears as a witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you want the entire passport admitted or some particular page with a stamp? I suppose it's useful to have it in context, is that your point? Which page do you want us to focus on at any rate? I realise that there is no enumeration here, no page number, but maybe you could just count. I see that the passport itself has page numbers, and on each sheet we find two pages of the passport. Where do you want us to look? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That is correct, Mr. President, page 17 -- but, especially page 18, the entry to Seychelles on the 
4th of June 1974 (sic) and the exit on the 19th of June 1994. Because there is a page somewhere, it is page 19, quite precisely.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
18, 18, I'm sorry. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you just repeat the dates? 
@MR. CANTIER:
On page 18 of the passport, the Trial Chamber will note that there's an entry visa to Seychelles, dated 
4 June 1994. And there's an exit visa from the Seychelles airport on 19th of June 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
We will reflect and provide the required clarity tomorrow morning at 8:45. And then we will hear the rest of the examination-in-chief, take note of the list of Defence exhibits, which should kindly be distributed to all of us before we make a decision on the tendering of these documents, and then we will start with the cross-examination. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, that list will be very brief. It's ready, we have filled it out bit by bit, but I didn't understand what you were saying. When do you want us to put it in, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When you have made it ready. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Well, because when I finish -- conclude my examination-in-chief, we'll only need a few minutes to add the last document, so it will be done quite soon after I've concluded my cross-examination, because we have been listing them bit by bit as we proceed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is, indeed, the ideal solution so we are very pleased that can be done, thank you. 
The Court is then adjourned until tomorrow morning.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, the Court is in session. 
Good morning, Mr. Renzaho. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we continue your cross-examination -- your examination-in-chief today, I need your assistance in connection with a few loose ends. So, will you please help me in answering a few very precise questions very briefly. It's mostly about spelling and making sure that we get the record right. 
The first question is you referred yesterday to the fact that there was a refugee camp as Nyachionga (phonetic). Now after that word you said something that sounds like Lusanaire; could you help us with that word please, the spelling? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
With pleasure, Mr. President, Rusine is spelt R-U-S-I-N-E, Rusine. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. Then in connection with Saint Andre school you said that that was behind a parish. And that sounded like "Shalwanga". Can you help us with the spelling, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Charles is spelt C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Rwanga (sic), R-W-A-N-G-A (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have heard that before. Now, remember -- Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
In the English it come back as R-W-A-N-G-A, I thought the witness said "L". 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is with "L", isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I said "L". In fact the name comes from an Ugandan martyr whose name was Lwanga. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
And it is number 261 on our list. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
Then we moved on to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, and you told us that you were with the gendarmes staying near the garage. You invited some of the refugees because you did not wait for everybody to be present. You didn't know the exact number. 
And then you continued: "So they came and I asked" -- and the name following sounds like Lakisana 
"to communicate the measure to them." What was the name, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I remember the context, but as to the name "Lakisana". 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No one remembers? Then we leave it at that. It is probably not so important. 
You then referred to a book called "Rwanda: A Land of Peace to a Land of Blood, and What After?" That is written by an author named Valens, V-A-L-E-N-S. Can you please help us with the last name? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That's correct, Mr. President, his surname is Kageguhakwa, K-A-G-E-G-U-H-A-K-W-A. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Then you referred to people having taken refuge in Saint Paul, and principally at the primary school where there were Hutus from "Kabugucasos"; what was that name, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President. I referred to the locality of Kagugu and Gisozi, K-A-G-U-G-U and G-I-S-O-Z-I. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, the refugees came from two different places, that's the point, is that so? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
These are two neighbouring secteurs, one prolongs the other. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Charles Lwanga, is that in Nyamirambo? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was very helpful. Thank you very much indeed. We were a bit busy yesterday with all the evidence we needed to get on the record. Now it's all clear. 
Maître Cantier, yesterday you wanted to tender the passport of Mr. Bagasora. There was an objection. We have deliberated and we will overrule the objection and allow the document. Your observations will go to weight. 
What is your first question this morning, Maître Cantier?

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, two Prosecution witnesses, AFB and BOU, came to testify that in two separate locations on two different dates, the 7th and 21st of April, you had distributed weapons. What do you say in the face of these two charges? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
My answer is that I did not distribute any weapons on the 7th. I told the Trial Chamber all the activities I had carried out on that day. But I also heard, just as you did, what Witness AFB stated before this 
Trial Chamber. That situation he depicted is contrary to the schedule I had on that day. Let me add that his statement is made up of a number of statements that are totally unrealistic. 
Let me be more explicit, I did not know that person. On the 7th at 6:45 he alleges that he was requisitioned by two policemen, in order to follow an order I had given to the conseilller of that secteur, to summon him; that person being CUB. In order to commandeer both the driver and his vehicle and take them to the préfecture, that was not possible. 
On that date, that is to say on the 7th at 11 in the morning, the same witness stated that I went to fetch weapons at the Hôtel des Diplomates and, according to him, the weapons and the ammunition were given to me by General Kabiligi. 
At 11 on the 7th I was attending a meeting at the senior military school. There are documents that prove that fact, and I am stating that this is the truth. 
Let me add one element, if the weapons could have been given to me by General Kabiligi on the 7th; on the 7th he was not in Rwanda. These are facts that can be verified. This allegation, to my mind -- or perhaps a mistake was made, but this allegation is unfounded. It is not true. It is not realistic. 
Now as regards the date, I do not wish to react to all the statements made by that witness, because according to him I went around town to control roadblocks, distribute weapons and congratulate people who were manning the roadblocks, and so on and so forth. Let me tell you in full conscience all this is a figment of his imagination and do not correspond to any fact that actually occurred. I did not have the time to do these things and I was not there. 
I do not wish to insist on the allegation in his statement regarding the date of the 10th where I allegedly attended a meeting at Mr. Protais Zigiranyirazo's house where politicians and the leaders of Interahamwe were allegedly attending. Once again, this is a figment of his imagination. On the 10th I had a specific programme, which I mentioned here. On the 10th I did not see -- and I do not even know where Mr. Protais Zigiranyirazo's house was. I never set foot in his house, and that is the truth. 
Now as regards the other persons he has referred to, I read somewhere in the Radio Rwanda documents that on that same date and at the same time Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, along with other political leaders, was holding a meeting following which they gave a press conference at the 
Hôtel des Diplomates. I was not there. And the Hôtel des Diplomates is not Mr. Protais' house. 
So you understand that there are basic contradictions in his statement. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
On the 21st of April, Mr. Renzaho, and on the essential matter of weapons, according to Witness BUO -- 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
On the 21st of April I was allegedly taken in the vehicle by Colonel Munyakazi, in a vehicle which was supposedly provided by the Presidential Guard and was a pickup, in which there was allegedly weapons and ammunition as well as a detachment of gendarmes for our protection. And we allegedly went to Mrs. Mukandituye's place of residence around 8, if my memory serves me right. 
I wish to tell the Trial Chamber that to ask Colonel Munyakazi to come and fetch me at the préfecture, one would first have to assume that that person had any link whatsoever with me, and that before the 6th April of 1994 someone would have seen him. And especially from the 6th of April 1994, someone would have seen him come and visit me and speak with me at the préfecture of Kigali town. I cannot imagine how that person could have come to fetch me when I tried to have him collaborate with me and I was not successful. 
I gave you the example of the 22nd of April, and it was a specific case where his men in the field were asking for his intervention. I spoke to him personally on the telephone and he refused to intervene in the field. How could he have been kind enough to come and fetch me on the 21st? There was an attack that did not take place. 
You heard UI, being the pseudonym of that person, who stated he was the leader of the refugees who were at CELA. And he linked the fact that there was an incident on the 21st of April 1994 at CELA, or rather denied that such an incident took place. There was no incident. 
Since the statement of that person was referred to, I wish to tell you that Colonel Munyakazi's behaviour, his habits, in that he did not come to see me at the préfecture. He never colloborated with me. He was never seen at the préfecture. So it would be quite surprising that he might have had the intuition on the 21st to come and fetch me in order to organise this matter. But it would have been surprising that we could have discussed such a matter and then gone about our business. 
Where did the weapons come from? Did they come from the préfecture? And what about the pickup from the president's office? I don't know. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, you're repeating your case. But I believe this is not a fitting time to do so. Please tell the Trial Chamber, or answer the question that was put to you, which was to know whether you had gone to CELA on the 21st of April 1994 in the company of the persons who were mentioned by Witness BUO. Please answer by yes or no, please. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
My answer is no. And let me add something, Mr. Byrumbagara (phonetic), who has been referred to in the allegation, had not yet been called upon. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, did you have a close and regular co-operation with the ICRC throughout the events? You have had the opportunity to deal with that matter previously for ad hoc actions that -- I'm putting to you a broader question on your collaboration with the ICRC. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. Yes, I did my best in order to co-operate with the ICRC and I was quite proud, as I stated several times; I was quite proud of the work carried out by the ICRC. Their work was irreplaceable. I did not co-operate with the ICRC. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I wish to have shown to you a document which is in the Prosecution file, Exhibit P. 33, dated 29th of April -- interoffice memorandum. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Renzaho said: "This is item 5" -- or rather: "Point 5 of this document". 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have P. 33 or P. 35? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
P. 33, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have that in front of you. Now which portion should we look at? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Item 5 of the said document, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you found it, Mr. Renzaho?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Mr. President.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, this document, which we only have in English, in its English version, what comment can you make on item 5 which to summarise states that your collaboration with the ICRC was excellent? And at the same time, you were not in a capacity to control the actions of the militias, if my translation is correct. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. The truth of the matter is that the situation was beyond control for a number of factors which we tried to mention here. But it was still necessary, in spite of the chaos and the anarchy, to save human lives. So the ICRC was doing its best in order to try and save these lives. 
And I do know that we experienced difficulties with the ICRC in previous incidents, and it is probably what is being mentioned here. The ICRC representative expressed his concerns on the situation, that is true. His teams were tempered in their activities in the field. It was not the first time, it was not the second time. Every single time we were able to intervene in the field, we did so. And what he is saying here is true. I thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please remember the speed, Mr. Renzaho, it is a bit too fast now. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I shall make an effort, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you know Colonel Yaache, Y-A-A-C-H-E? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I do not know this individual. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you know Major MacNeil, M-A-C-N-E-I-L? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I did not personally meet that person. I did not speak to him face to face. But during the incident of the 3rd of May I got to hear of him because from what I was told he was the person in charge of the preparation of the refugee evacuation operation. The refugees were to leave the Mille Collines hotel to go to the RPF controlled area. But apart from that information I got, I never met that person and I never spoke to him. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, under such circumstances, how can you explain the content of Exhibit P. 29, which is in the Prosecution file and which refers to a meeting you allegedly held with Colonel Yaache and 
Major MacNeil on the 28th of April of 1994? 
@MR. CANTIER:
That is to say, Mr. President, Your Honours, that this document is dated 28 of April 1994, that is to say, the day before the meeting mentioned in the document I just dealt with, took place; that is to say P. 33 dated 29th of April 1994. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Counsel, I wish to answer your question. I do not recall having held any meeting with these 
two individuals, and I don't even know where such a meeting could have taken place. Was it in my office? I never held a meeting in my office with the UNAMIR staff. I did attend meetings organised by General Dallaire, usually at the Hôtel des Diplomates. And I was not the only person attending, I was usually with other officials, namely, army officials and members of the gendarmerie. 
Now as regards the content of this document, it is a report that was produced by the UNAMIR services. This report is referring to the events we were in the midst of; that is to say, the difficulties encountered by the UNAMIR teams because of the chaos that was reigning throughout the city because of the inflows of populations and the extremely negative atmosphere prevailing at the time. 
And perhaps this was meant -- or perhaps this is an indication of the reason why I referred a number of times to the situation where people were to understand that they had to give priority to actions aimed at providing assistance to those who needed that assistance, because it was chaos, people did as they pleased. 
My concern -- it was my concern to do my utmost to prevent the departure of the ICRC, because the ICRC provided us with everything. It was the ICRC that provided assistance to the thousands of refugees. They provided foodstuffs, they provided drugs. They also assisted in the transportation of the injured. And let me tell you that in light of what was done elsewhere, it was during that period that the ICRC even accepted to provide fuel. It did not only provide its services, it also provided fuel because there was a shortage of fuel. 
So, tell me what I could have done in order to forget that if the ICRC services, or the ICRC was to leave, the situation would become untenable. Perhaps some empty promises were made in order to reassure our partners for them to remain on the site. I thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But Maître Cantier's question is: How you can explain this document? This is a document written by a UN officer stating that you, the préfet of Kigali, had a meeting with Colonel Yaache and Major MacNeil. You were a prominent person. Everyone must have known you. Would they invent this? Could there be a mixture of personalities? How do you explain a written document saying that you did meet them between 1130 and 1400 hours? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, unfortunately, the only thing I can say is that Renzaho is myself. It is me, Renzaho. There is no other Renzaho. But I am not aware of that meeting. I did not participate in that meeting. 
If there was a document, a meeting always involves more than one person, and I had people who were involved in the field. 
I cannot imagine how I could have gone alone to a meeting dealing with humanitarian matters, when I had a deputy who was specifically entrusted with that task, who is not even referred to here, and he himself stated before this Trial Chamber that he did not participate in that meeting. 
So I believe it is an internal memorandum that was conveyed to his superiors by an officer and this was a person who was in charge of humanitarian matters. What I mean is that he would go and visit the centres sheltering refugees and would refer to problems occurring there. I did not participate in such a meeting when I had staff that was especially entrusted with such tasks on a daily basis. 
I did not attend this meeting. Perhaps my memory is failing me, but I do not see myself participating in that meeting. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, if I recall the discussions we had yesterday correctly, a Prosecution document which has been used on several occasions, and a document which is not signed, at least with the copy I have, in order to comply with the rules of procedure, would have required that the Prosecution call 
Colonel Yaache to testify and perhaps also Major MacNeil. 
This is merely an observation and I will come back to the matter subsequently. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, on a matter which was of great interest to the Trial Chamber, and which was important to all of us. Do you know or did you know the bourgmestre of Bicumbi? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, I did not know him. I did not know the new bourgmestre, I knew the previous one. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, I'm sorry, but I was not aware there was any change. I am referring to the bourgmestre who was there during the period which is of interest to us, that is to say, between the 
6th April and July of 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not know him. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you call the place where this bourgmestre had his office during the events? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I never phoned that location for any reason whatsoever. I don't see why I would have. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, I am in fact referring quite clearly to the matter of the tape. Did you recognise your voice when the tape was heard by the Trial Chamber on several occasions? Please answer simply by yes or no. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, when those events occurred from 7 April 1994, were you aware that a genocide was in the making? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you for that question. Counsel, I must tell you that the events that broke out in the night of 6 to 7 were not isolated. There was a succession of terrible events before that event. And, frankly, I don't know whether there is anybody who could have thought that the incident that happened on that night could lead to the outcome that we knew in Rwanda. I had no idea. 
And I've always had the hope, day in day out, that the country could break out of that situation. However, things went on as if fate was really against us, and all the factors that could serve as a source of hope simply disappeared one after the other. And from the 6th or the 7th who could have imagined that such an outcome would happen in Rwanda? I don't know. Or maybe, and this is an unverified assumption, unless on the 6th I had knowledge of any kind of plan for genocide in Rwanda, but I didn't. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, could you describe the events that happened during that period, April to July, today as genocide against the Tutsis? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I would like to say that I am neither qualified nor in a position to describe what happened in Rwanda as genocide. I believe that is the mission of this Tribunal, and that of history too. And I hope history will do its work. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, when did you learn of the massacres committed by the RPF on the Hutu population? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. I realise that widespread massacres have been committed by the RPF on the Hutu population; first, with the arrival of this population from the rural areas of the Kigali city préfecture; then as from the 8th, and later on the thousands of displaced persons and war refugees from Nyacyongo. And, as I said, there were two camps of war-displaced persons who were separated by distance of two and a half kilometres, and this was confirmed to me. 
With the arrival at the préfecture of the bourgmestre of Muhazi commune was a lot of persons. And he is the one who narrated all what happened to me since he had witnessed it. He had passed through all the Bicumbi communes, and communes that were neighbouring to Kigali, since we took him in. And he told us all what he had seen. 
He even granted an interview to the press. And I believe that interview should be in the records of the Tribunal. I had that confirmation from others and other eyewitnesses. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, can you tell the Chamber the date on which you met this person, the person you say witnessed these events? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I received that person on the 25th or 26th of April 1994, and he took a lot of time to cross the entire area that was occupied by RPF troops. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, were you aware of a report from the office of the high commissioner for refugees dated 10 October 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I read that report. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I'm looking through my papers, a bit untidy, to find the document we have disclosed. The document is only in English -- there's only an English version. 
Mr. President, we're getting to it. Sorry, it is 1, I think, of 19. Yes, the first folder, number 1 of 19. And the document that is of special interest, or the part that is of special interest in that report to us is 
page 4, page 4 of the report, since it has been written, the report used with the préfecture of Kigali. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what can you tell us, especially about the second paragraph of that document, that speaks of massacres during the meetings -- of massacres of families during meetings, that were actually traps set by the APR to massacre the civilian population? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The reference is R002911 -- R11. 
Counsel, I agree completely with the information found in this document. And I, personally, had occasion to hear witnesses who escaped from such operations in the course of the year 1996. 
Let's begin with Kigali as you want. True, I was responsible for Kigali. In the night to 6 to 7 April 1994 there were killings in Kigali. Senior officials of the administration and the army were killed in the city of Kigali. 
I would not bother you with all the names, in fact I would not be able to cite all of them. But bear in mind that at least some reports of some witnesses say that 280 persons were killed that night. The war did the rest. But to come back precisely to the issue here, any region that was overrun was combed entirely right down to the valleys, the banana plantations, everywhere. The hunting was done in the traditional way. 
And this was told to me by my maternal aunt -- my paternal aunt, sorry, that I meant there, that I met in May 1995. She had spent barely one month in that camp. It meant that from April 1994 to March 1995 she lived in her own region hiding, and she watched these organised manhunts and she had nowhere to hide, so she fled. This is what she told me and this was confirmed to me by other persons. 
The pacification meetings, as they were called, were entered assembling the population. As long as the inhabitants were not numerous, they had to build confidence within the population and give them essential commodities, which was salt, sugar and soap. And they had to go and look for other persons, maybe on the pretext that new identity cards were going to be distributed, or that people were going to get organised to prevent Interahamwe incursions. 
And when the number of the people swelled, they were surrounded and gunned down, they were killed. And that is what happened in the eastern region of Rwanda. In my own préfecture of origin, where I can't see any of my neighbours, all those old men who taught me or saw me when I was born, I don't see them. And I had confirmation that they were liquidated. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, on what basis were these massacres committed? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, basis or criteria -- the truth is that the Hutus who were there were the ones concerned. The strategy consisted in assembling people who were found in parties other than the MRND and others, because they knew troops accused those parties of having fought against the RPF. 
So they recruited people from the other parties and they gave them crash training and gave them weapons, and so they swelled the ranks of the RPF troops, because to overcome the entire country was a huge task. So they had to involve the local population. So they were hunting down the population everywhere and they went into hiding and then those who participated in that operation were assembled and gunned down. 
So that is the truth I wanted to tell you. It is something I heard with my own ears from people who experienced that situation, people I met in the camps. And to corroborate what is written in this report, others such as myself were able to observe that situation and write on them. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, what were your personal plans in mid-1993 and early 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, the proverb goes that "Man proposes but God disposes". But as far as I was concerned, there was no difference to me. 
True, at the end of 1993 I expressed the wish to my superiors that I wanted to be relieved of the post in which I found myself and I wanted to return to the army. Maybe not to stay there, but shortly thereafter to leave the army and devote myself to my family. And later on carry out activities that could have maintained my family. I think I had occasion to mention it here. We had -- we agreed to do it together because not only did I waste my time but I took away a lot of time from my family. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, when you mentioned these plans, do you recall the document from the ministry of defence dated 13 December 1993? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the first volume, 1, tab 8. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, Counsel, I am aware of that document. And it came after a letter that I wrote. Unfortunately, I can't lay my hands on that letter. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, so this document, the document I have cited, it's a three-page document, and it's found only in the French. Sorry, the document has four pages and it is page 3 that is of interest to us. There is a title on that page entitled: "Observations on the maintenance of officers placed at the disposal of other administrative structures." And the third name is, "Colonel Renzaho, Tharcisse, is waiting impatiently to be withdrawn." 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, have you found the document? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
"And with the approval of the ministry of defence. " It's on the third page, there is the name of 
Mr. Renzaho and the comments. And then the opinion of the ministry of defence approved, so he had to be withdrawn from the PVK. 
Mr. Renzaho, it happened that on 6 April 1994, you were still there, how do you explain that with respect to this approval that was given to your application? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel. This situation is blamed on the delays in the procedures, because it required that the president of the republic sign an order putting an end to my duties as the préfet of the city of Kigali. That is all that was remaining. All the others had been done. I was summoned to the office of the minister of the interior and I expressed to him my desire to be discharged -- to be relieved of my duties. I then showed him a letter I'd written before. And on that basis he wrote a memo to the minister of the republic asking him to follow through with my application to leave. 
Meanwhile a lot of events had occurred, very disturbing and very serious events, or maybe there were other events that had happened, but I was still waiting for the presidential order to relieve me of my duties, so I could leave. 
So, the events of 6 April actually met me in that situation. Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Precisely, Mr. Renzaho. Since we are on the issue: Why did you stay on in your office, for instance, on 12 April the government set the example by fleeing? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, why did I stay on? I don't know. There were moments of madness, maybe it was madness because I was tempted to leave. Then I told myself at some point, and it was my conscience that was prompting me, that if I left with the problems that were there, the people in distress, the people that I was seeing, somehow it would be some kind of betrayal. 
So I accepted, and I told myself I couldn't place my own interest before those of the population, all those people I saw suffering. Those who were dying; they were human beings. And I'd never thought that my life would be of a much higher value than those of other persons. It was a retaliation that had gone under. 
So, where would I flee to? That was a question I asked myself. It didn't last for long. Then I quickly understood that there was something to be done for the population. All the more so, as with the intensification of fighting, the encircling and the bits of hopes that we nourished, all that did not last for a week. And on the 12th we had been surrounded. My friends had left and everything was just drifting. 
There is even an UNAMIR officer who came by and told me: "Mr. Préfet" -- I was used to seeing him. He was a liaison officer of UNAMIR and he told me: "You are in trouble. You should take care of yourself. Everybody has left. You are alone here." 
Frankly, I remained for that purpose. There was no luxury position. No nice place where I had to sleep. There was nothing. I had to experience the misery of my people. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, well, you were not the master, would the solution not have been to surrender? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, the issue is a rather broad one, but I would like to tell you something. First, the capacity to influence decisions of others, the other officials, notably army officials or others, or gendarmerie officials, or political decision makers, it is a fact. 
But I will tell you something, something that may resemble what you mentioned about surrendering. It was clearly expressed on the 12th in the memo that was signed by the army high command. So, they proposed to the RPF that there be an immediate ceasefire on the fighting. Then dialogue set up unified units of the FAR and the APR (sic) to jointly carry out pacification operations. And there was no greater surrender or capitulation than that one. And, please, even that one was rejected. 
Everyone wanted complete military victory. And in the military theory that I learnt, that existed before 1870, as long as people took up arms to liberate the population, the interest of the population came before any other consideration. And I believe that if political problems are to be settled, victory has -- victory has to be total, then it will end in human disaster. 
That is all I have to say on this issue. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Renzaho, this is my last question: Do you regret having stayed on? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, partially. Counsel, do you recall the Myth of Sysiphus? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, I have read Albert Camus. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is precisely the impression I had, because in any case the people who have gone back have died, and I did not do the utmost to save the utmost number of people. I did the best I could, but the disaster still happened. So I had the misfortune to live throughout this period. But somehow I tell myself that this life on earth can only have meaning when it is used or placed at the service of other people. 
What would I have gained? What other substantial thing would I have gained to try -- by trying to go and hide somewhere or sit somewhere and live quietly? Besides I realise they would not have let me live quietly, knowing that somewhere there were people who were suffering. 
So, my attitude on this issue is ambivalent. I have a lot of regret for all these people who died for nothing, because it was unnecessary. Unnecessary in the sense that sooner or later people have to sit together and see what they have in common and do these things together. That is what I have always called megalomania, vanity. I don't have enough adjectives to describe it, human folly. 
It is very regrettable because we had the Arusha Accords. We could have implemented them. And if they were incomplete, we would have sought to improve them with time. Problems are created by humans and these problems have to be solved by humans. So, my attitude is ambivalent. 
I was more or less satisfied, as far as my conscience is concerned, I could do what I was able to. But I realise that all this did not do much with respect to the disasters. Could you imagine the people who died? And over four million of them on the move wandering throughout the country. Leaving -- people leave Rwanda and get to the Atlantic ocean on foot. Well, I thank you, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I'm through with my examination-in-chief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much indeed. That was the end of the examination-in-chief. 
Do you have the list of exhibits available, Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
It is ready, Mr. President. We shall print it on the spot. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If we could get a copy of that list and then distribute it to everyone in the courtroom, the Prosecution, Chamber. And once we've got it, we will go through the list and make sure that the formal tendering is being done. 
Cross-examination? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I wish to crave your indulgence and perhaps utter a few words and thank you for having very kindly listened to me. 
But, it is the only opportunity I was given to express myself. And, if I may, I wish to crave your indulgence for any errors I might have made here, which I'd also like to seize this opportunity for also having listened to me, because I had many things on my conscious that I would have liked to have expressed. And if I was able to say or to talk about my feelings, it is a good thing. 
I deeply regret all the misfortune that befell Rwanda and I believe that any experience is to the benefit of mankind. It makes it grow in wisdom and enables it to prevent such events taking place in the future. So this is my message to you, a message of gratitude and of encouragement in the fulfilment of the noble task that was entrusted to you. 
And I do hope that your Trial Chamber and this institution will be able to establish actions which will be of use to the Rwandan people. I thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
Mr. Moses. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours. Before I commence my questioning just a few brief introductory matters, and I'll ask for a bundle of some documents to be passed out amongst Your Honours and my learned friend. 
Also, if I can indicate at this stage that the Prosecution, at some effort at the beginning of the trial, provided to all the interpreters copies of exactly the bundles of exhibits that Your Honours and we have; apparently some of them are missing. We certainly don't have the facility to provide again other bundles of documents. But bearing in mind that the Accused has been speaking in French and I believe all the documents -- or most of them are -- I may be reading from the English. It might be of advantage for the French booth to have what folders of exhibits do exist so that I can -- if I'm referring to exhibits, they will have them. 
I have also handed out a handwritten document which just sets out for the parties and Your Honours numbers of Prosecution exhibits that I may refer to, whether I go into them in any depth or not will depend on answers given. But that's just to give everyone an idea where we're heading. I've given that list also to the registry so that they can hopefully also have some advance warning. Those are in respect of exhibits that have already been tendered. 
So, that's just an initial comment to Your Honours. 
If I can commence by speaking to the Accused and to say:

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, you will have seen me operate in this Court over the last few months and you will have seen that from time to time I have interrupted witnesses if I have felt that they are going off track. Just to indicate at the outset, that I may do the same with you. If you feel that there are matters, or if your counsel feels there are matters which you have been prevented from explaining in full of course, your lawyer will have the opportunity in re-examination to return to those matters. 
A number of my questions will only require yes or no answers. It's not to prevent you from giving further explanation if you feel such explanation is necessary, but in order for us to proceed in an efficient manner; if you do feel that an answer can be given with a single word, then it would be my invitation to you to do so. 
All right. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Your Honour, I wish to ask for a sheet of paper because my memory might fail me in light of all that's being said. So could I be given a piece of paper just to take a note of a name or any information? I do need some paper. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The registry is taking care of that now. Thank you.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, at the very outset of your testimony on Monday, in the very first words that you used, you described the events from April to July as "the Rwandan tragedy". For those of us who have been in this Court for some time it is an expression which is almost exclusively used by genocide deniers. 
Now, we have asked -- your Counsel has asked you about whether you accept there was a genocide; is it fair to say that your position is that you do not accept that there was a genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda from April to July 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. I gave my answer on the question. The institution in a position to do so is the Tribunal and I shall bow to the decision of the Tribunal. 
$(Pages 1 to 16 by Melissa Hook)
1015H 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm asking your opinion though, Witness. Do you accept that there was a genocide, yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do not have to accept it or deny it. I gave you my position. This is a legal matter, and history will determine what it was. Do you wish for me to give my opinion on an event that occurred, and in which I was an actor? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just so we are quite clear: You have no opinion as to whether it was a genocide, is that your position? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I believe that I have made a number of statements here. I'm afflicted and I was affected by these events. It was as if you were making a film that was being shown to me. I stated that I had deep regrets, but I -- and I'm crying inside even though you cannot see me crying. That is how we have been brought up. In my country, men do not cry, but it is not because you cannot see me crying that I am not crying. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, can I phrase it a little differently: Do you accept that Tutsi were targeted on account of their ethnicity, and that there was a campaign in Kigali-ville from April to July to destroy them as an ethnic group? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That the Tutsis were targeted when the events in Kigali broke out is obvious. The Hutus were 
killed -- and Hutus were killed in Kigali is also obvious. The campaign -- as for the campaign you are referring to, I'm not aware of it. I do know that efforts were made on both sides in order to restore peace, but those who were attempting to do so did not have the requisite means or resources to do so and the means or resources they might have used were not there. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You aren't seriously suggesting to the Trial Chamber that it was just the same for the Hutus in Kigali as it was for the Tutsi between April and July 1994, or are you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I tried to demonstrate that the situation that broke out in Kigali on the 6th was, in fact, the result of a number of events that had taken place during the period from 
January to April of 1994. There were a number of incidents that led to deaths and to -- and to the displacement of people. So, people were targeted because, as I stated before this Trial Chamber, the war developed with the constitution of one bloc against the war and against the RPF, and another one who was for the RPF. So, this is the reason for the attacks that occurred in Kigali, and it was not only in Kigali but throughout the country. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I think we have seen in the last three days that perhaps one of the reasons you were appointed as préfet, Mr. Renzaho, is that you were a -- and are a very good raconteur. But if you could get back to my question, which is: Do you -- are you seriously suggesting that it was just the same for Tutsi in Kigali-ville between April the 6th and July 1994 as it was for the Hutu? Are you able to answer that question? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I wish to apologise to you, Counsel for the Prosecution, but I have not truly understood your question. Could you please repeat it? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have mentioned, Mr. Renzaho that Tutsi were killed and Hutu were killed. The question is: Whether they were in the same situation in terms of being targeted from April to July in 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Certainly not, the Hutus and the Tutsis were not in the same situation and did not experience the events in the same way because, once again, one has to place oneself in the war context. It was a war that came from outside, and which was supplied by external forces. 
People who were attacked by their neighbours were, first of all, people who had sent their children to the RPF or who had any link whatsoever with the RPF. So, these events occurred in the context of war and of great fear. I am not taking responsibility for anyone's behaviour because individual behaviour under such circumstances can be controversial. Because of the individuals themselves, who were involved, as well as the behaviours of people, I am not in the mind of anyone to say that X did this or Y did that. I am not in their minds, but what I'm trying to tell you about is the state of mind that prevailed at the time of the situation. 
There were elements, which were -- or movements outside from Kigali which led to further disorder. And what people did, one cannot say that they did following instructions given by any specific person, and this is what I'm attempting to do, Counsel for the Prosecution, not in order to fabricate stories. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So is it your evidence that the only Tutsis who were having problems were those who had family members in the RPF? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am not stating that the -- only Tutsis who encountered problems were those who had members of their family who had joined the RPF, but they were those who were attacked at first. And all the people who came into town mixed the other ones up with potential RPF members. So, the situation deteriorated, but the first attacks were against people who were suspected of having links with the RPF. 
I can give you the example of your witness. You put a question -- or, the Defence put a question to BUO, and asked him whether some people from Rugenge who had been attacked had any links with the RPF. And that was his answer; he confirmed it and I believe it is true. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, you have still left me somewhat unclear, Mr. Renzaho. Do you accept, for example, that it was completely unsafe for Tutsi to move throughout the city of Kigali between the 6th of April and July when you left, whereas for those carrying Hutu identification cards, it was not nearly so unsafe? Do you agree with that proposition? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Did I ever say the contrary? Frankly, sir, I do not believe I did. It was a situation that evolved between the different components of our population, and which divided them progressively. And when the war broke out in Kigali, after three or four months of the presence of RPF elements, there was nothing to hide and we were moving towards the setting up of the transitional government. 
And, I believe, that what you're saying means that people attacked one another. And in the confusion, people confused Tutsis with others. If you saw a person with a beautiful face and considered him to be a Tutsi immediately, then you can understand that things were not going as they should. I am convinced that the Tutsis could not move throughout the city as you stated; that is true. I noted that because their first reaction was to flee towards sheltering centres, which were not organised by the administration. I was not the one who put the first refugees at the Mille Collines hotel. I took note of the fact that there were refugees at the Hôtel des Mille Collines, or that there were refugees at Saint Paul's or refugees at Sainte Famille and so on and so forth. 
So once they were identified, we tried to protect the sites and provide assistance. But as to push people to join -- to go to such locations, you will understand that it did not come from me, and that it was a reflex they had. 
Mr. President, I should note that the operational -- the commander for the Kigali operational sector said in his report of January of 1994, that the Tutsi populations had a tendency to seek shelter in locations that were protected by UNAMIR from that date, so you will understand that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, now we are in cross-examination. In examination-in-chief, you are given ample time to explain your points of view. But, when it now comes to cross-examination, when the questions are precise and very often only require a yes or no answer, then you must really make an attempt now. So, please be briefer. We have made such appeals to you also during the examination-in-chief, including your counsel, but now I must really insist. 
And the second remark: Remember the speed, please slow down. 
Here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you accept, Mr. Renzaho, that Tutsi civilians were viewed as accomplices of the RPF? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that was possible in the confusion that we were living through. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And it's fair to say, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho, from having heard your testimony in the last three days that you personally placed the vast majority of the blame for the events leading up to the 6th of April with the RPF. Is that correct? Is that a fair summary, and I only need a yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I do not properly understand your question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The events that you have described -- at least, between January and April the 6th that took place in Kigali, you place the blame fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the RPF, don't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that must have made you extremely angry towards the RPF and its accomplices, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I think -- and that is maybe what the RPF wanted. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you accept that there were even in the month of April alone as many as 67,000 bodies uplifted by your préfectoral authority in and around Kigali city, as was stated in the report that we -- in the document from Mr. Gaillard? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I have not read that document, but that doesn't mean that I'm denying the evidence that there were deaths in Kigali. But I don't know about the figure. It is true that the ICRC removed bodies, and it may know the figure of persons who died. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, in that document, and it's P. 106, Mr. Gaillard says that he was told in confidence the figure from a préfectoral person in the préfectoral authority. So, my question for you is: Were you, as préfet, not aware of the types of figures of bodies that were being collected in your region throughout April to July? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I don't know about the figure. I have explained to you the circumstances under which the removal of bodies was organised, and the ICRC conducted that operation. I was not the one who drew up the statistics on that occasion. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You were the most senior communal official in PVK. Did you never try to find out the extent of the civilian killings in Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I would have loved to do so, but I could not, Counsel, because time had not stopped its flight, and fighting was really at its most intense at the period under consideration. So, the work that you think should have been done could not have been done. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, when do you say the fighting was at its most intense, Witness? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I'd say that the fighting was always intense, with a small lull between the 9th and the 16th, and then intense shelling everywhere. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And are we talking April, when you say the 9th, and 10th, and the 16th? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is it your evidence today that it remained intense till the beginning of July when you evacuated from Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is very correct, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you said at the very end of your testimony that you were thanking the Trial Chamber because this was an opportunity for you to give your account of the events between April and July. Do you remember saying that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In fact, in 1997, after you had become aware of some of the allegations against you, you wrote an account of the events in Kigali from April to July, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I believe I did that. 
@MR. MOSES:
I'm wondering if -- Your Honour, it's the top document in the new bundle. I believe there's French and English. I'm wondering if the registry could just show Mr. Renzaho the document just so -- 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
I may come back to it later, Mr. Renzaho, I don't want to -- to go into it at the moment, but I just want to make sure that we are talking about the same document. 
I'm sorry, it's the second -- the second document and it's entitled, "Témoignage sur la tragedie".
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Testimonies on the tragedy". 
@MR. MOSES:
And it goes on, and I won't try and offend the French booth or the French speakers. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
All right -- and it's, I think, in the French about 26 pages long with it ending, "C'est à Brazzaville" on the 29th of April 1997, your name and "ancien préfet de la ville de Kigali". Is that right? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I may come back to it later, so I just wanted to make sure that we were on the same wavelength. 
So you can put that to one side for the moment. 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, do you agree that it was part of your responsibilities as préfet to keep the peace, maintain public order and the security of people and goods? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in that regard, you agree, don't you, that you had specific control over a police force in PVK; that's also correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, in normal times, yes. But, in the exceptional circumstances of April to July 1994, I have explained the difficulties that had cropped up in that area. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, do you accept that between April and July, there were sometimes a difference in terms of what the law stated and what actually was happening on the ground? I don't need any explanation or examples, but as a matter of principle, do you accept that proposition? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I accept it, and I said it was a period of anarchy. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You also had the power to requisition gendarmerie, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is true, but I've explained the difficulties here. 
@MR. MOSES: 
We've heard your explanation. 
How many requisitions did you make during the period of April to July 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I -- I didn't make the statistics, but the situation was what it was at the time, and such a request could be on a daily basis. But, they did not reply because there were difficulties related to staff strength and availability. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you accept that requisitions could not be challenged by the gendarmerie, unless the requisition was illegal? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I do acknowledge that; that is true. But you can only give what you have. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in terms of what was happening in April to July 1994, you could have ordered police to arrest those who were committing offences, couldn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, and that is what I did. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you've told us that you had signed the letter appointing a new conseiller in the secteur of Nyarugenge that was to replace Mr. Sezibera, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I hesitated a bit to answer that. Nyarugenge secteur should not be mixed up with Nyamirambo secteur, whose conseiller was Céleste Sezibera. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, putting that to one side, do you accept that Mr. Sezibera was removed from his position at the end of April 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that was done within the legal procedure provided for by the law of 23 November 1963. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And why, according to you, was he removed? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I'd like to recall here that the witness came and explained the circumstances under which that conseiller was replaced. He provided information he had received on the ground, and he was simply -- he was replaced simply because he preferred to take shelter at the time when fighting was moving closer to his secteur, and the population moved to protect the préfecture. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The date of the 1963 act was? Can you just repeat it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I spoke of the law of the commune, a law to govern communes and their functioning. It has been amended several times ever since, but I don't have all the provisions in mind. But -- but all the procedures are laid down in that law. 
I don't have the specific article, but I'm simply saying that Sezibera's replacement was done by his bourgmestre, and I accepted that he be replaced because he was not available. And by so doing, I was exercising my oversight authority. I was not the one who signed the arbitrary replacement of Sezibera. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The 23rd of November, wasn't it? It's just the date, Mr. Renzaho, I didn't hear you clearly. Did you say the "23rd of November" and then we'll move on? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree that other conseillers were appointed during the period of April to July 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Those who had died were replaced, yes, that's correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you replaced them? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, it was -- where it was possible to do so, I did so. I -- I approved the acts or the -- the moves made by the respective bourgmestres. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And Mr. Sezibera was replaced by a Mr. Kaboyi -- spelt K-A-B-O-Y-I, wasn't he? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, the name doesn't ring a bell; it is possible. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And Mr. Kaboyi was someone who had excelled in the area of killing Tutsi; that's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't have any evidence to prove that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, we've heard from both Prosecution and Defence witnesses, Mr. Renzaho, that you had been informed during the period of April to July of the activities of at least three conseillers who were said to be actively involved in organising militia; namely, the names given by your witnesses were: 
Mr Karekezi, Odette Nyirabagenzi, and Rose Karushara. Do you agree with what your own witnesses have said that you were advised of their activities during April to July? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, the person who said so -- I know that some persons actually came here before this Chamber, yes, that is a fact that I cannot deny. But, the person who said it, did he also tell you that he came and informed me? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, the record, I believe, will show that yes, he did. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, if he did so, then maybe I should explain -- 
@MR. CANTIER:
Sorry --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:

@MR. CANTIER:

I'll come back to it, maybe after lunch when I have located the exact passage in the transcript, 
Your Honours.

@MR. MOSES: 
Now, do you agree, Mr. Renzaho, that you were the most senior government official based permanently in Kigali after the interim government had left to go to Gitarama on the 12th of April? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I was not aware, and I did not receive any confirmation of that. If you want further explanations, I'll give them to you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, you've told us that the interim government went to Gitarama on the 12th of April; correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'll rephrase it. Were you the most senior civilian authority in Kigali-ville after that date who was based permanently in Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I was not the -- the highest government civil servant based in Kigali, and that is what I said. I was not aware of that, and I did not receive any order appointing me as the highest government civil servant based in Kigali.

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you accept as a matter of general understanding that people, quite apart from any legal powers that a person might have, can be powerful because of the position they hold or their personality? Do you agree with me in general terms with that statement? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am sorry, but I frankly did not understand your question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you accept that people can be powerful, and that people will obey certain people not just because of any legal instruments that might give a person power? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, it is true, that exists. I accept this proposition. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You were a good organiser, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
You are the one making such a statement. I do not know; I had superiors and they never made any specific observation to me on this matter. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, an important part of your job was to delegate, do you agree with that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I delegated when it was necessary to do so, and I did so because I could not be everywhere at the same time -- and because the situation required that immediate and urgent actions be conducted. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
We've heard from a number of witnesses, you will agree that you were often wearing your military uniform during the period 6th of April to July. Do you agree that you were often wearing your full colonel's uniform? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I accept that I was. It was a uniform that enabled me to move around. It was easier -- more reassuring for me to go out wearing my uniform than wearing civilian attire, because when I was wearing -- because even when I was wearing my military uniform I was sometimes not recognised. Imagine what would have happened if I were -- if I had been wearing civilian clothes everywhere. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, you weren't wearing, as you've stated, your colonel's uniform as a fashion statement or because you looked good in uniform, were you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Certainly not, Counsel for the Prosecution. That is not my type and it was not also something I would do given my age. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You wore it because it represented to those who you were coming in contact with -- be they military or civilian people, your rank and seniority. You were someone to be listened to and obeyed. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I do not accept your proposition and I wish to tell you that I never put my stars on my insignia. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I believe I'm just being handed the transcript of the relevant passage, which I'll -- 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness -- sorry, Mr. Renzaho, Witness UT described the activities or what that person had been told in relation to the militia and that the names that I referred to earlier of the three conseillers were those who were being supported and encouraged by the militia. My question to you is: Do you accept that you were told about the activities of any of your conseillers? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I wish to state -- and I'm repeating the answer I had provided -- I was expecting a report from the bourgmestre on the activities of specific conseillers and this report was not forthcoming. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness UT was asked in cross-examination:
"Presumably, you reported to your superior, the préfet, what you had been told about his conseillers."
The answer: "Yes, indeed, I reported to him on the situation in the roadblocks and in the city."
Question: "But specifically, you would have told him, wouldn't you, Witness, about the negative reports you were getting about three of his conseillers?"
And the answer: "Yes, I discussed that with him. I talked about the negative influence as I said, the negative influence on the young people manning the roadblocks." 
So I'll ask you again, Mr. Renzaho: Do you recall being told about the activities of your conseillers and the negative influence they were having in the area under your control? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, we are -- we were on the ground -- our two feet on the ground and we were experiencing a situation in Kigali which was negative, that is for sure. I am wondering whether any specific conseiller is involved here since the situation was bad throughout the secteurs; that is the first observation I can make. 
The second observation: The reports I might have received were reports on the situation prevailing. As for reports on individuals, I might -- or could have received such reports, that is true. But -- and perhaps this is your objective, what we're talking about is identifying the culprit and punishing him or her. And we are dealing with, in fact, who does what. We are talking about communal staff, which comes under the law I referred to previously, and for whom decisions are made within the communal council. 
The préfet has the right of oversight but can only intervene subsequently in order to approve or perhaps refuse the measure adopted, but that measure has to be taken somewhere along the line. I thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, do you remember having had a conversation with Witness UT about these matters? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I could receive information coming from all sides, but an individual or specific conversation on a person acting in that way -- well, what I can say is that if it was an isolated case amongst all the situations we were faced with, well, that is possible. But that was the general situation. Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So did you have such a conversation with UT? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I would not be able to give you a -- an answer in the affirmative regarding this case. I do not recall such a conversation, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you have any conseillers disciplined or arrested during the period April to July 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I did not have the requisite powers to discipline the conseillers. I could resort to the bourgmestres to request that a conseiller be sanctioned. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you resort to that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Obviously during the different meetings I had with the bourgmestres I asked them to keep a tight hand on their staff and that they redress the situation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, that is "no" to my specific question? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Regarding your question -- namely, ABX, I did not do that. I took note of the general situation; I asked the people in charge to get involved. I was not the bourgmestre of a commune which was resisting -- it being understood that the largest part of the commune had disappeared. I had not been demoted to the level of bourgmestre in order to fulfil his duties. The bourgmestre was present. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And no conseillers were arrested, were they, during the period of April to July 1994 for their involvement in the killings that were going on throughout Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Those conseillers -- whether they were alone or whether they had brigades or forces to perpetrate such acts -- the situation would not be as disastrous as the one we were faced with. I do not believe I saw any conseiller who was removed from his position or who was sanctioned for having perpetrated such acts. And I -- and nobody was ever brought to me who had been caught in the act of perpetrating such acts, and I had -- I don't believe I was ever asked to sanction anyone who had perpetrated such acts and who was brought to me. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And just getting back to my question: You never asked for any of the conseillers to be arrested, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Perhaps I was not a good préfet in this préfecture -- since I did not have a good intelligence service. But I was not given any specific information on the X case for any violent acts that might have been perpetrated in order for me to be able to take any legal administrative action in that regard. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree, Mr. Renzaho, that you were meeting with your conseillers regularly throughout April, May and June 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, the conseillers were the conseillers of the Nyarugenge commune. 
They came to see their bourgmestres, and on the occasion of the meetings I had with the bourgmestres, those conseillers were present. I can state that for a fact. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you state an answer to my question? Did you meet regularly with the conseillers throughout April, May and June? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Regularly, I wouldn't say so. I met with those conseillers in the presence of their bourgmestres when I had meetings with the bourgmestres. 
@MR. MOSES: 
After the meeting you say took place on the 8th of April, do you agree that there were several other meetings -- four or five during April 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, there were meetings throughout the period; that is true. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And at those meetings, it wasn't just the conseillers who were in attendance, there were sometimes military people? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I did not summon any soldiers to attend meetings at the préfecture. 
The people who were involved in security meetings are well-known, and I do not know whether soldiers came to meetings at the préfecture when there was no framework that involved them. Soldiers are managed by their units and by their general staff. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You told us on Monday, I believe, that on the 8th of April there were some senior military people at the meeting with the conseillers. Wasn't that your evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that is what I stated. But the soldiers who were there were there in -- because of their positions. Colonel Rutayisire, for example, who went to the meeting, was an officer who was working at the ministry of national defence, and it was his right to try to know what was being said there. He was probably looking for information and found ways of getting the information. This is how we came to mention his presence on that occasion. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And sometimes there would be members of political parties, as well, wouldn't there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I told you that under the circumstances that were prevailing in Kigali after the 6th, where all the top people left as rapidly as possible, I would not have been in a position to convene a meeting of political leaders to meet with them. 
I stated before this Trial Chamber on Monday or Tuesday, that I asked the communal authorities to involve all the groups that had any influence on fringes of the society in order for them to raise the awareness of the partisans to the need to maintain security in the locality, and I believe that was done. But, at the level of the préfecture I was faced with a number of difficulties, and I don't see how I could have convened a meeting with all of these people when they had already left. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, your governmental boss -- if I can use that expression -- was the prime minister, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, he was the head of the government; that is true. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And from the 8th of April through to the July that person was Jean Kambanda, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I beg to differ. Kambanda took his oath of office on the 9th, and for the rest of the period he was, indeed, the prime minister; that's true. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay. And you've told us that you'd visit Gitarama to see the government on various occasions during April to July; that's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I do know that, in general, one needs to look at the situation in relative terms. In all situations, one must take due account of the difficulties we were faced with at the time. 
It is true that I went to Gitarama, but when you're referring to several occasions, I don't think so. But for the period which is of interest to us, I might have gone there on three occasions perhaps. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Remember the speed, Mr. Renzaho, not too fast. 
The next question, please. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And Mr. Kambanda visited Kigali on a few occasions as well during that period, didn't he? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Frankly, I was so engrossed in the problems I was faced with that I did not monitor the schedule of Prime Minister Kambanda closely. However, I can state here that he passed through the préfecture once in the afternoon, and I recall that we talked for 30 minutes and then he left. And that was the only occasion when I saw him in Kigali. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, you're well aware, aren't you, of the various things that Mr. Kambanda has said about you after his arrest. That's the case, isn't it? You've seen what he had to say about you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am not aware of that, Counsel for the Prosecution. And as for what he said, it's his own business. I was not his cabinet director; I was not a close colleague of his. I am a minister of the interior, and -- well, I don't know. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The Prosecution disclosed various tapes of interviews with Mr. Kambanda to the Defence last year. 
Did you not consider it interesting to see what the prime minister had to say about you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't see -- I don't have any interest in that, absolutely not. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, I'll refer you to a couple of passages and ask for your comments on them, if I may. 
@MR. MOSES:
And, Your Honours, in the new bundle of documents it is number 5 -- I'm sorry, number 4. And the English transcript doesn't have numbers other than K numbers. And it's K0154891, and I'm wondering if the Accused could be provided with a copy of this document -- the French.

@MR. MOSES: 
If you could just read those two paragraphs and I'll ask you for a comment. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the wording of the first question you want him to read out so that we don't mix up the question? 
@MR. MOSES:
"Renzaho was the préfet of préfets, correct?" And then there is an answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you seen that, Mr. Renzaho? On page 31, the fifth line. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I am there. Do you wish for me to read it out? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Not at all. Do you agree with the comments from Mr. Kambanda that you were -- you had the radio at your disposal? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, Counsel for the Prosecution, please let me set the record straight. It should be understood that I will answer your questions, but Mr. Kambanda came to testify in most of the trials here. If he had things to say regarding myself, he could have come here. 
The second point I wish to raise: I saw Kambanda for the first time during the meeting of the préfets on the 11th of April of 1994. He left Kigali on the 12th of April of 1994. He came back in May, and that was the only occasion when I saw him in the afternoon, and that was the last time I saw him. And I wish to state that to give an opinion on someone you have never -- who has never come under your responsibility and you do not know is being pretentious. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, let's be quite clear, I'm just asking on a comment on what he says there. You can agree with it or disagree with. He said that you had the radio at your disposal. Do you agree with that or not? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Prosecution Counsel, the national radio was under the jurisdiction of the minister of information. I received no instructions that placed Radio Rwanda under my command. True, I sent messages through the radio, but was I the only one to do so? So that is my answer; my answer is no. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that. The next passage which I'd like you to comment on is in the same document. 
It's -- the English is K014884 (sic), and it's the twelfth line or paragraph down commencing with the words, "Can we take it that Renzaho had total control over Kigali at the time."
And Mr. Renzaho, in the French, it's on page 23. Do you have page 23 there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I've found it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
At about two-thirds of the way down, there is a question which has initials "M", "D" for Delta, beginning (French spoken)... 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Should we then consider..."
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, I've seen it.

Now, I'd just like you to read the following seven or eight lines, and then I'll ask you a question. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
"So, from there" --
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, you don't need to read it out aloud, just read it to yourself and I'll ask you a question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the English K number there, just to be absolutely certain, is K0154884. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you agree with the prime minister where he said -- agreed that it was clear that you had total control over Kigali at the time? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I'll respond in the negative. If I had control over the situation in Kigali, I would have remained in Kigali. And I don't know why he spoke about me, whereas there were soldiers who were fighting against the RPF. This situation is unreal -- in the sense that the person explaining it knows perfectly nothing about what was happening. That is the impression I have. But to speak of total control over Kigali, I think it's a bad joke. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that. 
Now, I just want to focus now on your relationship with the Interahamwe prior to April 1994. Do you accept, Mr. Renzaho, that you were involved in recruiting people for the Interahamwe as early as 1992? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, and to drive home the point, no. I don't know how many times I have to say that -- no. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, I need your help. I didn't understand your answer which is the same in both languages. 
"If I had control over the situation in Kigali, I would have remained in Kigali." 
What exactly did you mean by that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
What I mean is that as he says, if I had the possibility of controlling the situation in Kigali, we would not have been chased away like -- like chickens or like cowards. We would not have experienced so much destruction. We would have organised things and channeled them in the right direction; that is what I meant. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are partly referring to the presence of RPF forces in Kigali, and the fact that in July, the armed forces had to leave? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I am referring to the entire situation that we lived through: A situation of chaos characterised by fighting and killing; a situation where you had people coming from all over in total confusion and despair. That is the situation that I wanted to point out, Mr. President. 
@MR. MOSES:
I'm wondering if Mr. Renzaho could please be shown a document which is in the new bundle of documents, number 3. It's a document in French which is headed, "Mouvement democratique republicain".

And if you look on the French page 3 and 4, and in the English it's on page 5 and 6, it's -- sets out in the document the brains behind the Interahamwe, and it gives a list at the beginning of the persons considered to be in charge of recruiting amongst civilians. And there are some familiar names there. What I am interested in and want you to comment on is, under those charged with recruiting, from amongst the reservists, and it lists Colonel Serubuga, Colonel Sagatwa, S-A-G-A-T-W-A, Lieutenant Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, Colonel Bagosora, Lieutenant Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, with the comment: 
"Literally deranged after the media campaign accusing him of having appropriated the property of Kigali businessmen on the run. He is ready to go at any length to ensure that this city is set ablaze, as Nero did in the past." 
Now, you'll agree with me, having read that, Mr. Renzaho, it's not just Witness XXY who testified here who's suggesting you were involved in recruiting Interahamwe. The MDR party was making such an allegation in respect of you as early as May 1992, weren't they? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Prosecution witness (sic), can I answer? Thank you very much. And I think I will have to ask you to be a bit patient on this issue so I can provide the necessary explanation. The document comes from Mr. Anastase Gasana who, before he moved over to the MDR party, was the ideologist of the MRND party, in the same capacity as the other senior civil servants who belonged to the MRND and who moved into other opposition parties, and were forced to produce documents of this nature. I would take the case of Mfisi, Christophe, who coined the concept of Akazu, the death squads, and many others. So the context in which this document is written is very well circumscribed. 
And I am here before the Chamber; I would like to enlighten the Chamber to the fact that this same document was presented in Brussels during the meeting of political parties that are members of the democratic forum for change who were negotiating with the RPF for political cooperation. So an understanding was arrived at, and other ideas were expressed in that communiqué that came up on 3 June 1992. All these documents are available. 
Now, concerning my humble self sitting here before you, I would simply like to tell you that I faced difficulties; that can be imagined. The democratisation process, because on the 14 May we are in the aftermath of the setting up of the coalition government, headed by a prime minister from the opposition. So what is written here is really baseless, because the opposition had the majority in that government. And it was headed by a prime minister from the opposition. 
My difficulty at the time was not to give in from the standpoint of other insecurity, not to give in to blackmail and subversive activities or other activities that disrupted security in the city of Kigali. And I had the misfortune of not being a member of a party that could support me. That was the delicate position in which I found myself at the time. 
What he has said, he refers to a charge that was brought before this Chamber, and I believe that I explained how the property of traders was ruled upon by a government decision. I will leave aside the abusive allegations that have been made against me; it does not affect me in any way. But we are talking about 1992. And the strategy of taking over power, to the great displeasure of the people's wish, tended towards an overthrow of the institutions, at best, with the alliance with the RPF and a revolution. And as I have said here, I have had to contend with violent demonstrations, attacks on the institutions and the presidency. I cannot cite all the difficulties I faced that the period here. 
Now, let's go on to this central issue of recruitment. I think this is backbiting, or -- because Serubuga, who is mentioned here, was deputy chief of staff and he had been driven away by the political parties. And, in my humble opinion, in my position as the préfet of the city of Kigali, I did not have the possibility of recruiting reservists, as they are governed by the law. What would I recruit them for, for what army? That is what I don't understand. And to illustrate my point, I would like to inform the Chamber that I've learnt of witnesses who came before this Chamber, or in other Chambers of this Tribunal, there is a certain Munyandekwe (phonetic) -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
His microphone is off, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, I think -- I think we have to stop there, Mr. Renzaho. 
Do we agree that Christophe Mfisi's last name is spelt M-F-I-S-I? Is that correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:

You were involved, weren't you, Mr. Renzaho, with the recruiting of Interahamwe, including, through EFOTEC school, a meeting on Saint Juvénal's day 1993? Yes or no. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Prosecution Witness (sic), maybe I will take advantage of this to end what I was saying. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, you see, you gave us quite an elaborate explanation in relation to the previous answer, and now we want a yes or no answer to this Saint Juvénal celebration, or recruitment process, whatever happened. Can you please answer that question? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. And my answer would be very short: No. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And the Interahamwe, at least on one occasion in the latter part of 1993, left from your house to go for training by bus. Correct? Yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. Maybe they left from somewhere, but not from my home. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And some of their clothing was washed and hung outside your house as well, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I am not compelled to repeat what other witnesses have said before the Chamber. So I tell you no -- 
@MR. MOSES:
I'm wondering if the witness could be shown Prosecution Exhibit 20. It -- for Your Honours it's under tab 14. It's a letter dated the 3rd of December 1992. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you have that letter there in front of you, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And it was a letter from the prosecutor of the republic to the minister of justice, concerning activities of the Interahamwe. And the bit which I'm wanting to draw your attention to is perhaps two-thirds of the way down, the paragraph commencing (French spoken). And if you could quietly read that paragraph to yourself, and I'll then ask you a question. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am ready. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, that letter, you'll agree with me, is a few months after the date of the MDR document which we've just looked at. And in this letter, the prosecutor finds it astonishing that the préfet of Kigali and others named in the letter -- but he names you specifically -- have remained indifferent faced with those acts. That's what it -- in summary, that's what it says there. Do you agree with me? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I've read the paragraph. So what you say is actually found in the paragraph is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
$(Microphones overlapping) 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, I will ask my next question. It may be relevant to your answer. Would you agree with me that it wouldn't be so astonishing if the préfet was in fact involved in the training and recruiting and support of those same Interahamwe? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you for your question, Counsel for the Prosecution. But I am astonished at the interpretation that you give the situation. In the paragraph, the incident is happening in Kicukiro commune. And in that -- and in that commune, there was a bourgmestre. I am accused of receiving an administrative report from Kicukiro commune and refusing to act on it, whereas within the same period they have an urban council security structure that deals fully with the issue, and in which the state prosecutor's office of Kigali was involved. The situation is clear and unequivocal. If there were no other manoeuvres as there were at the time, tell me sincerely, what would stop officials from addressing a situation that broke out in a clearly identified area of the Kigali préfecture, whereas there was a coordination organ in which the officials concerned apparently met? So that is the situation that I find disturbing. 
Personally, I ascribe that way of looking at things to agitation, and there are various forms of agitation -- or, there were many forms of agitation at the time. Maybe that is not the issue under consideration at this time, but we should situate this issue in its proper perspective at the time. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. We'll move on now to the issue of control of the Interahamwe militia during the genocide. You will recall Witness BUO describing you as the chief of his chief, and that he had a lot of respect for you, as well as his immediate chief. Do you recall that evidence? Yes or no? It doesn't need an explanation, just a yes or no. Do you remember the evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do remember the witness, but I do -- I did not remember everything he said. But I do remember the witness. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, there has been a -- also a good deal of evidence, you will agree, during the course of this trial, that amongst those who were in charge and leading Interahamwe were Angeline, Odette, and Rose. You'll agree with me that there has been a good deal of evidence about that. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
People said what they wished to say here before the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, do you agree that those persons were in charge of Interahamwe? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do not know anything about that. My work consisted in managing the Kigali town préfecture with an infrastructure. I had civil servants under me within the préfecture, as well as the communal staff in the communes. That is what I can say, thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You had no idea, during the hundred days of the genocide, that these persons were in charge -- or, controlling any of the groups of militia that were causing problems; is that what you want the Trial Chamber to understand? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That I repeat myself, Counsel for the Prosecution, I believe I answered that question previously. But since you're giving me the floor, perhaps I can try to demonstrate to you that sometimes one needs to be cautious regarding specific people. If you are referring to BUO -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, I -- I'm not referring just to BUO. I'm referring to many witnesses, both Prosecution and Defence witnesses. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I was giving BUO as an example, because he stated that he went into his secteur on the 9th and he started -- frankly speaking, I never had any officers, even if they were -- did not receive sufficient training. I never had any officers such as this one. This was a matter on my conscience. I need to say that. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now the only issue is whether it is your view that you didn't know that Odette, Angeline, and Rose were playing a leading part in the Interahamwe activities during the hundred days. Is that the evidence, you didn't know in 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I was not aware of that, and I wish to confirm it. Had I known, I would have adopted the necessary measures. I can state that. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. The next document I'd like you to look at is further part of the interview with Mr. Kambanda. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's in the other document, Your Honours, that we have provided. Number 5, I believe. And the bit I want to have the Accused look at and read, and I will ask him for his comments, in the French it is on page K0322897, that's page 6 down the bottom. And for English, Your Honours, it's on page 6 also, K0154958. It's the ninth paragraph down with the -- commencing with a question, "Okay, perhaps it was possible for this person, just as Mr. Renzaho". 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, do you see in the French, Mr. Renzaho, it's the third paragraph from the bottom which commences, in French, "Okay, (French spoken)". And I would ask you to read from that point over to the next page, to the bottom of the fifth paragraph in French on the following page. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in the English, Your Honours, I'm focussing down to the fourth-to-bottom paragraph. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Let me know when you've finish reading that passage, Mr. Renzaho, and I will ask you a question for you to comment on. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I believe I've finished reading out the passage. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree with Mr. Kambanda's assessment that, whilst you were never officially designated to be the head of the Interahamwe, that that was the conclusion that he drew from what he had seen and observed you doing? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I disagree with what he says, and I have never agreed with Mr. Kambanda. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, if we could now look at Prosecution Exhibit 29, which is one that was referred to by my learned friend this morning. It's at tab 25 in the first bundle of exhibits. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I noted that in the Kambanda interview he uses the word "deduction". 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, this is the document that was shown to you this morning, of which you claimed no knowledge of such a meeting. You remember being shown that document, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I remember it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And I think you'd indicated that there would have been someone else perhaps present with you. Perhaps if I could ask you to look at paragraph 9. It's on the second page, where it says "Colonel Renzaho then had his préfet-adjoint, Mr. Simpunga, organise a meeting for 29 April, where the details of the plan could be worked out." 
Do you see that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I have read item 9. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And if one was to look at P. 33, which is at tab 29, that document, which will be shown to you, is in fact a memorandum which describes a meeting which in fact took place on the 29th of April involving Mr. Simpunga, Colonel Yaache, Major MacNeil, and others, doesn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's somewhat puzzling, Mr. Renzaho, that the document recording a meeting involving you, which refers to one of the decisions being taken, namely that a meeting will be organised for the 29th of April, actually then does take place as recorded in P. 33. Do you agree that's rather puzzling? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I agree with you, but the problem is not that it might be puzzling. The problem is that you are telling me about Colonel Yaache, whom I don't know. That is the problem. Perhaps I have aged in the meantime, but I believe one would have remembered someone one would have met. That is what is puzzling to me. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, P. 29, at page -- at paragraph 6, records you as having said that: 
"These elements" which refers to the previous paragraph, namely, the Interahamwe "were behind the late president and his aims for the country, but were representatives of various political groups. As such, he indicated that these elements were representing their individual political parties in the defence of the country." And therefore Mr. Kajuga did not control them all. 
Well, do you agree with that statement? I know you say you didn't have the meeting, but do you agree with the contents that were attributed to you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I can only agree with statements I made. Do you have any evidence that such words came out of my mouth? That is my question to you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, for the moment, I'm asking the questions, Mr. Renzaho, so perhaps you could answer my question. The words attributed to you, do they -- do they reflect your thinking, namely that Mr. Kajuga was not in control of all the militia? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I am saying no, I did not utter such words, and what is recounted here with regard to the situation shows quite clearly that the situation is much more complex than the authors of this document seem to say. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did Kabuga (sic) control all Interahamwe movements in April 1994, according to what you know? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Your Honours, I would like to apologise for not answering correctly. First of all, let me say that I am not aware of what one is referring to as Interahamwe. As for the powers of Kajuga over the Interahamwe, I don't know anything about that. So if I were to answer the question, it would mean that I had information. How could I have such information? I don't know anything about that. I do know that I witnessed inflows of population, and that even the usual inhabitants of the town of Kigali were not involved in the scenes of violence we witnessed in Kigali after the 6th of April. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you not know Mr. Kajuga? Is that your evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I knew Kajuga by name, I knew that there was one Kajuga, and I knew him because of his family that I knew quite well, because his elder brother is someone I knew quite well. And they are people who hail from my region. So that was -- I did not have any other specific knowledge of that person. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, the same document refers to you having said that the ICRC were perhaps exaggerating in their account of what the activities of the Interahamwe were, and it is -- it states here that you had also gone on to say that you were in charge of the forces within your area, that you indicated that due to a lack of trust in UNAMIR, neighbourhood militias had formed to protect themselves from the RPF, and that they were defending their neighbourhoods in concert with the overall aims of the government. That's what you said at that meeting; isn't that correct, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
My -- Counsel for the Prosecution, with all due respect, I might disappoint you, because I did not utter such words. And let me explain to you that the ICRC had normal and daily dealings with the préfecture of the city of Kigali. And in view of that, my subordinates worked with the ICRC, and the representative of the ICRC would phone -- would call me on the telephone regularly to tell me about his needs. So I do not believe I would have said that the ICRC was exaggerating. If it was exaggerating, I would have dealt with this matter with the ICRC. 
In addition, the forces that were in charge of the area, and who were fighting in the city of Kigali, as I might imagine, there were several such forces. We had the Rwandan armed forces that were fighting against the forces of the RPF that were present. But there was also -- but there were also all these gangs that were still in the city of Kigali. So what forces are we talking about, and over which force could I claim to have authority during those difficult times? I don't see what those forces might be. If the forces were accessible, I would have had access to them. But I must say that my answer is no. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that the reason you have a mental block in recalling this meeting is because you said things that you now wish you hadn't, because they have been recorded and are coming back to haunt you. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't believe I am senile yet, and I believe I do recall what I witnessed, what I did, and I do remember the very serious events we lived through. I have -- I am always saddened when I need to come back to such events. If there was any other place where I could go, I would do so, gladly. But I can tell you that I have no mental block whatsoever as far as I'm concerned, especially since the ICRC had excellent relations with the préfecture of Kigali. I did my best. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness's microphone is off. The interpreter cannot -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's all right, because the point now was simply to put to the witness what the Prosecution case is, and Mr. Renzaho has indicated that he maintains his view, and that is the point now. 
There are two minutes left. Can you get through one more question, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I can get through -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And an answer? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That I can't guarantee, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's do that. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you accept that these gangs that you have described were in fact made up of the youth militias of the MRND and CDR parties? Or is that something you don't know and aren't aware of? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I'm forced to reiterate what I stated, Counsel for the Prosecution. What was happening in the city of Kigali was much more complex and much -- and was much broader in scope than what you are referring to here. All the bandits who were killing and looting, were they from the MRND? I'm not trying to protect anybody. It was proven that the bandits -- was it proven that the bandits were people from the MRND and CDR? If that were the case, I would condemn them, as I have always condemned bandits. But I wish for you to observe that the situation in Kigali was much more complex than the situation you are describing. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's now 1 o'clock. We will adjourn to 3 o'clock. Tomorrow there is apparently scheduled a staff meeting concerning earthquakes. That starts at 10:30. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I wasn't intending to go, Your Honour, if that's any assistance. I don't know if my learned friends were. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is a problem we will have to come back to. 
The second issue is that at 12:30 tomorrow I have a status conference in another case, so at any rate we won't be able to sit until 1 or 2. So that is the situation. 
The third practical issue is that we have now received the list of exhibits from the Defence. Could I ask the Prosecution and the registry to have a look at this list in the break, and Mr. Matemanga will generally find out where the first Defence exhibit number will then start, with number 1, and tell us what the last exhibit number will be with number 28. And we will then ask the Prosecution whether there are any objections against these 28 exhibits being tendered, and if not we will very simply do this in writing by the registry without reading it into the record. But if you have a look at this list, Mr. Moses, to see whether this can be done in a very informal and simple way. 
Is there anything you want to say about this list, Maître Cantier? It is self-explanatory and easy to read. Anything you want to add? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President. I simply was on my feet because you were addressing the Defence, Mr. President. But there's nothing I wish to add. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So then we continue at 3 o'clock where the Bench will be sitting under 15 bis because Judge Egorov has another very important issue of a personal character. 
The Court is adjourned.

@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not provide him with petrol vouchers -- neither him nor anyone else. And the circumstances under which that person was released are known; I have set them forth here. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And Mr. Sukari, he was part of the civil defence in Nyakabanda secteur, wasn't he? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I know nothing of that. I know that he was an individual of which it was said that he was killing people, and that at the time when that information was revealed, it wasn't in Nyakabanda secteur, it was near Café Lion in Nyamirambo where fighting was under way.

Did you ever meet with the youth of the parties that made up the government between April the 6th and July 1994?

Now, Mr. Renzaho, this, the front cover sheet, is a memorandum from Dallaire to Annan dated the 25th of April 1994, and the cable refers to the fact that UNAMIR were able to monitor both Radio Rwanda and also from Radio Muhabura, M-U-H-A-B-U-R-A. And on page 2, in the third paragraph, it reports that "The préfet of Kigali town held a meeting with the youth of the parties which form the present government." 
Does that refresh your memory at all to the fact that you did hold a meeting with the youth of the parties? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I think that I'm aware of what I say, conscious of what I say. At that time I did not call a meeting of the youth wings of political parties, and there's a very good reason for that: I did not know them. I did not know them because the political parties were not organisations that were officially accredited to the préfecture of Kigali. I told you that at communal level I'd asked the communal authorities to involve the political parties present in their commune in the best possible way so as to administer the population. I had nothing apart from my civil servants. Call the political parties? Who? Most important people had left the town. And you ask me who was the president of the PSD youth wing? I don't know him. Who was the president of the youth wing of the MDR? I did not know him. The president of the youth wing of the PL party? I did not know them. So, please, Mr. Prosecutor, once more I think there are leaders -- some leaders of the youth wings of political parties who have testified here or there who say that I called at one time or another a meeting or held meetings with them. Thank you.

Well, do you recall, as is recorded in this memo, telling -- urging the youth to take weapons and defend the sovereignty of the country? Yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, after the prime minister issued his instructions in the phase when, after the 25th of May, there was recruitment and training of young people to beef up the army, and following which there were efforts to dislodge the RPF from Mburabuturo and Gisozi; that I did do. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But here we have apparently a transcription from what was said on Radio Rwanda on the 24th of April, listened to by UNAMIR, apparently transcribed, and then sent to New York. Why should such a mistake occur? Do you have any theory how this could happen? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, it was a long time ago, and maybe I don't -- in my head I can't recall the minor -- smallest incident. The least I could do, perhaps if you could present me with a tape recording of what I said at that meeting and what was said over Radio Rwanda. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you'll agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that that wording, namely, it's recorded there that you had urged the youth to take up weapons and defend the sovereignty of the country, is very similar to what was recorded in P. 27 where there was the meeting that you don't remember, or deny taking place, where you had also been recorded as having said that the militia were defending the sovereignty of the country, or words to that effect. It's very similar, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, you can establish similarity between what is available. The message in which I exhorted the youth to fight for the sovereignty is a message you can find in the speeches I made probably in the month of June, because I read it and I remember having said it. This report here, these are reports made by technical departments to -- for the benefit of their superiors. And I do not know to what extent, for what purpose the -- these reports were made. So I cannot give my approval to something in which I did not participate. If you want to ask -- ask me, for example, what was the leitmotiv of what I said, I would say that we were at war. We had been aggressed (sic), and we did not have an armistice agreement whereby we could ensure public safety. I have narrated before the Trial Chamber the steps we took in order to negotiate the cessation of hostilities, and we were not heard. Now, between life and death, one always chooses to survive, which is what we were trying to do. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, bearing in mind that you -- I take it from what you have said you accept having made similar statements in June. Do you agree it's possible that you did make such statements in April, but have forgotten them? Is that a possibility? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, in April, I think, in the first days to say how we were adapting, day by day, to the situation we -- into which we had been forced, I don't think at any point during that month on what occasion I would have said such words. Because, one, young people whom I exhorted in June indeed were not trained and sent to the battle front as they were in June. What creates some confusion in my mind, I don't see on what occasion I would have said such a thing. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And do you recall having encouraged the youth to arrest all the deserting soldiers, to disarm them, and kill them? Do you remember -- do you remember that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. I did say so, and I admit it. I said so at a time when soldiers were leaving positions to meld with the population, kill, steal, and run away. Well, it was a situation that I tried to alert the responsable to. I know that they tried to react against it, but disorder -- chaos was such that it was necessary to act within the population. We had to resist all the looters. I asked the population to resist them. All those people who attacked their neighbours, civilians -- it was civilians, too. And we had to attack, denounce, struggle against these people. We couldn't accept that someone wearing a uniform could come and commit crimes among the citizenry. That was the sense of that message. I acknowledge it; I did say so. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So the lack of judicial officers, which you've provided as a reason for one of the problems in dealing with the situation from April to July, didn't prevent you from asking the youth to arrest and kill mutineering soldiers without trial. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I should like to tell you that I left Rwanda in July 1994 without having heard a single complaint from the government that the civilian population was committing massacres. All those messages, you mustn't confuse them with the immediate resulting effect they could have among the citizenry. But it was a way of denouncing excesses. It would be very difficult for a civilian to attack an armed soldier, but it would not be difficult for two or three civilians to cry out and announce when they saw a soldier doing something. But I didn't see a list of soldiers who would have been killed by the population. These are things that I was saying to get the population to denounce those soldiers who were among them and committing crimes. To call the population to witness was not a bad thing, a criminal thing, I think. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Encouraging the youth to take the law into their own hands and kill deserting soldiers wasn't a bad thing as far as you're concerned; is that -- is that your evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is not what I have asserted, Mr. Prosecutor. The population that -- in a town, the citizens of a town were not young people. It was a mixture, young, old, men, women. They didn't change their nature of the situation. It was speaking of youth. Maybe you're speaking of a specific organisation, a known structure to which I could speak. But this was a message to the population at large. The events were taking place among the citizenry, and I asked that the citizens should denounce those things happening. That is all.

I would now ask the witness to be shown P. 47; it's in tab -- it's tab 1 of volume 2. It's a transcript of Radio Rwanda. I am going to be looking at page 3 in the English at the fifth paragraph. And for my learned friends and for the Accused, it's in the French, it's page 5, the third paragraph. And I am looking at the passage in the English which commences -- the sentence commencing, "As a matter of fact". Do you have that? Have you found that passage, Mr. Renzaho?

What page is that, Counsel? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Page 5 of the French, and you will see the third paragraph has your name at the top of it.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good. Here comes the question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
In that paragraph, Mr. Renzaho, it's correct, isn't it, that you were thanking conseillers, bourgmestres, leaders of political parties and youth leaders, and you say in the last sentence in respect of that paragraph, "The meetings held have been useful for us because we were not going to be able to do anything whatsoever without their participation"? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Have I denied the fact that I asked the communal authorities to involve members of political parties? What is here is true. It was public awareness of the entire population. That something had to be done, absolutely, to prevent killings in the population. That is what I saw; and, as a matter of fact, we succeeded in maintaining some measure of calm, but the situation deteriorated again on account of the shelling. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, the last sentence gives the impression that you held meetings with these groups. That's the point. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I held my meetings at the Kigali city préfecture. There were the refugees there, and everybody had access to those meetings. UNAMIR officials stopped by from time to time, so I couldn't hold those meetings without the knowledge of those concerned. That's what I am saying, and I am being truthful to myself and to you. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So there were leaders of political parties around? Is that right? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Political leaders were present at the communal level and possibly at the secteur level. I don't know how political parties are structured and their structures within the population, but they had their structures within the communes and secteurs. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. I'll leave that for the moment, and I will ask you to be shown Prosecution Exhibit 63. It's tab 17 of the second folder, radio transcripts from the 18th of June. 
@MR. MOSES:
In the English, I'd ask Your Honours to look at page 5, the second paragraph. And in French that's on page 6, the fourth paragraph. 
In French, it is page 6, the fourth paragraph, which commences in French (No interpretation). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
With other words, "I held a meeting". 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, sir. Yes. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
We'll be returning in a little bit more detail with what this meeting was about, Mr. Renzaho. But, for the moment, I just want to highlight and ask you whether you agree that you were describing that you held a meeting with the leaders of these youths, and with the conseillers of the secteurs, and the leaders of cellule committees and with nyumba kumi; in short, everybody? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I think I am kind of transposing myself into the situation for now. You are showing me a document. I have it here. 
But, sincerely, I am wondering, I don't know the dates on which a meeting was convened. But what about the date? I would like to see somebody who convenes a meeting of members, conseillers of communes, nyumba kumi, and the youth, and in a very exhaustive manner so as to not create problems, because if you invite members of the party and create problems. So what was this meeting all about at the préfecture? It is the principle of the whole thing that I doubt. 
Now, as to the documents I have said that a number of documents have been presented to me, but they have not been satisfactory to me because I have the impression that for one reason or the other something happened. But I would like to explain to you: Nyumba kumi means head of a ten-family unit; the head of cellule controls about 50 homes. And for the stretch of the Nyarugenge commune that remained in our control, how could one convene such persons where -- what was the venue of the meeting? Because, sincerely, I see huge obstacles, not only because the préfet had no precise framework to convene the nyumba kumi, heads of cellule, and all that, but also if it had to be done at the communal level, the préfet would attend; and in other areas we have noticed that during the period under consideration, any assembly was a fair target for firing, for attack. So I don't know . But, personally, I had never attended such a major meeting that brought together almost the entire population, because when you get down to the level of nyumba kumi you are talking about the entire population. Thanks. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It might be that you would like to have a look at the full transcript of that statement of yours, Mr. Renzaho, from the 18th of June before, perhaps, tomorrow, because I will be coming back to it in respect of a different context. And you may refresh your memory, particularly in respect to the comments you've made regarding the RPF attending Saint Paul's on the evening of the 17th. That may help you to refresh your memory. 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, in your evidence in-chief -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I can see, Mr. Renzaho, that you want to say something, but that was just something the Prosecutor said, it doesn't call for a comment. Whether you want to read a document overnight or not needs no follow-up in the courtroom. Let's just take the next question, now. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Did I understand your testimony this morning that you did not accept the evidence of AFB in respect of the meeting he described you having with Mr. Kajuga and Mr. Rutiganda on the 10th of April; is that right? You deny having attended such a meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I denied it, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did you know Mr. Rutiganda? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I met him at the UN detention facility. He is there. I know him. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You haven't seen him ever before? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In Kigali, I tell you that I had never seen that person. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, he was not present at the SOPEYCA, S-O-P-E-Y-C-A on the 3rd of May. Is that your evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I have no knowledge whatsoever as to whether that person was present at SOPEYCA. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And just one final question relating to, in general terms, the Interahamwe. You have said that you were not a member of the MRND party. Do you, at least, agree that you were a supporter of the MRND party? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I am going to repeat this again. I did not support any party, any political party. I had no political ambition and I was not the supporter of any party. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, it's just that you have heard from Prosecution witnesses saying that you clearly were. One of your friends, I believe it was as a Defence witness, indicated that you were an MRND supporter. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Was he a civil servant who had lived with me or somebody who knew me very closely? I cannot prevent people from having their opinions. But those opinions in the context in which we found ourselves, was it correct in a society that was in the grip of mistrust, crying, suspicion? So can we take the opinion of an individual to the effect that I belonged to a political party? Did I attend any rally, any political party rallies? What activities could I have undertaken to prove that I was a supporter or member of this or that political party? 
I would like to say that in 1992, for instance, the prime minister issued clear directives, and I do not know what I would have paid to continue to be a member of the MRND at the time when he was calling on state employees to desist from all those political activities. That is a fact. The document can be found. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
A final point on this matter -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, commence again, we lost you.

@MR. MOSES: 
One final point of this issue of your relationship with the MRND. I would ask you to be shown what Mr. Kambanda said about this, and it is on the document, side B, and in -- which is headed side B -- you may have -- do you have those in front of you Mr. Renzaho? It is one of the documents that you were shown this morning.

@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Here comes the question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree with the comment of the prime minister that you were a member of the MRND? Yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No -- (No interpretation). 
@MR. MOSES: 
I think "no" is sufficient for the moment. You have explained yourself previously. 
Do you see that the prime minister was asked whether there was not a rule that a member of the armed forces couldn't belong to a political party in Rwanda, and he indicated that it had been discussed at some point, he wasn't aware of such -- he didn't recall or was not aware of such a rule, but that the information he had was that, for Kigali, an exception had been made, and that it was an exception in which a soldier was being kept as préfet. Once again, Mr. Renzaho, we really just need a comment as to whether you agree or not with that statement. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I do not agree with that statement. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Now, we have dealt with the role that we say you were -- you had with the Interahamwe before and during the period of the genocide. I now want to focus on -- briefly, on your activities and involvement with the Interahamwe after the end of the genocide. 
Now, you will recall that documents have been produced. It's Prosecution Exhibit 103, relating to the formation of the RDR party in the Congo. You remember those documents, don't you, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I knew of it here. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Weren't you part of the umbrella committee of the RDR when it was formed in March 1995? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, and I see no crime in that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that was the decision-making, politico-military organ of the RDR party, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I believe that can be true. I don't have the full rules and regulations of the RDR with me. It is not on the basis of that document that you can actually discuss the functioning of the RDR in full, because we need the statute thereof. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in that same document, it was decided, was it not, that the Interahamwe must not be a parallel force, but be recruited into the FAR? That's what was decided, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I don't know. I don't know how it was stated. I don't have the references, for instance, the minutes of the meeting on that consideration. All what I know is that the threats to which the refugees were exposed made it in such a way that they had to organise themselves to survive. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the FAR was to be the military wing of the RDR. That was also decided, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, if I had the minutes of that meeting I could say something. I know that the RDR was an organisation that was set up for these hapless people who found themselves abroad, in a bid to get organised so as not to die. In fact, things did not delay. A short while after the camp was destroyed with shells and mortars, and people died before my eyes as (unintelligible). 
@MR. MOSES: 
I was hoping I wouldn't have to have the document shown to you, but I think as a matter of -- as you have asked for it, it's Prosecution Exhibit 103, A is the French and B is the English.
@MR. MOSES:
And, perhaps, whilst Madam Registrar is obtaining that, she could also take with her 104.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, if you can please look at Exhibit 103A, which is the French, it's the page with K number 0 -- K0239677, it's the -- it's under 6A titled "les problèmes des Interahamwe"; in the English, Your Honours, it's on page 8 of the English. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I can see point 6. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you agree that it was decided that the Interahamwe was not to be a parallel force, but to be incorporated into the FAR? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is what is written here, so it must be true. So you also have to look at the circumstances that prevailed then. People had weapons and were not part of any structure or known organisation, and these people indulged in criminal activities and actually bothered the refugees. So, by some means, these persons had to be integrated into a structure that was recognised. That was it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And following paragraph 6B, it is recorded that the FAR was to be the military wing of the RDR, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And under the following paragraph, 6C, entitled "Le dossier genocide", it was to be the RDR policy to hold the RPF as mainly responsible for the massacres? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, the events speak for themselves -- the facts speak for themselves. I think that any falsification sooner or later will appear in broad daylight to one and all. 
I don't understand what you are putting to me, if you say that at that time the RDR would have begun to imagine accusations or allegations against the RPF before the competent jurisdiction -- or the investigative historians can follow this up, but there are things that every Rwandan knows. Who can hide that? 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you signed on the 29th of April 1995, as a member of the FAR high command, a statement support for the RDR party, that's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Very certainly. I see no crime in that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the RDR did incorporate the Interahamwe into their ranks after the end of the genocide, didn't they -- formally? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I think that you won't find the solution with me. All I can give you -- all I can say is that the RDR was an organisation trying to give hopes to the refugees, trying to organise them, first, not to die, and the threat being a direct one, because after September 1996, terrible things happened, and I witnessed them throughout in the forest, and what preceded that. Now, if there are any guilty parties, I think that everyone has said that justice was free to find the guilty parties and punish them, but you are not going to forget that the title "Interahamwe," the term became collective. All the Hutu are Interahamwe, if you didn't know that. That is the political nuance. 
Now, really, everything that's hidden behind the term Interahamwe, is it guilty? I don't agree. It's -- to take a country and burn it down and say that the inhabitants committed crimes, then you would have a situation analogous to that of Original Sin, that someone committed a crime, and every descendant is a criminal. So I don't know --

Do you agree with the description given to you in the ICG report of December 2000, which is Prosecution Exhibit 106, which names you as a leader of the -- named you as a leader of the Interahamwe in the Congo at that time? That's just yes or no. I don't need a lengthy description, whether you accept it or not. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Unfortunately, Mr. Prosecutor, my character is not that I answer yes or no. This is an important question, but I will answer no. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Because the reason we have put these documents in, Mr. Renzaho, is, I am suggesting to you, that you were leading and involved in the Interahamwe, not only before the genocide, not only during the genocide, but also after the genocide you had control over those persons who were taking part in the massacres of Tutsi civilians in Kigali and elsewhere in Rwanda during July -- April to July 1994. Do you agree with that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Absolutely not. Absolutely not. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. We have now finished with that topic and we will move onto a new topic that has to be do with roadblocks. 
First of all, do you accept, Mr. Renzaho, that roadblocks were established throughout parts of Kigali within hours of the death of President Habyarimana? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
With the risk of disappointing you, yes, roadblocks existed. They were regularly erected in Kigali. It's true that on that day, after the announcement of the president's death, roadblocks were erected and the people who erected them were there around the CND, and that very evening the RPF left their barracks and went among the citizenry and deaths ensued. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, do you accept that other roadblocks were established in other parts of the city with persons whose intent was to target any Tutsi civilians who might pass through them? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I must tell you what my impressions were. When the roadblocks were erected, I do not know when it began, and when I had the time to renew contact with the administrative authorities, the roadblocks were throughout the town, and I think that they proliferated with the development of the combat and the people who were fleeing from combat and going to more peaceful areas. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I will get back to my question: Do you agree that roadblocks were set up for the purpose of targeting Tutsi civilians who might go through there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I acknowledge that people at the roadblocks were treated in a brutal fashion, among them Tutsis; but in my humble opinion, I must acknowledge the truth of what happened at the time. But I think that the people were not thinking of erecting roadblocks to await the Tutsi, because they lived with them in the neighbourhoods. In our country, the people lived together. In a village, you can have two Tutsi families and around Hutu families; they lived together. So if there are problems, conflicts between the one and the other, they have to erect roadblocks to await people there? 
I think you are speaking of something that result -- the result of excesses that -- of something that was triggered the first days spontaneously by the people in view of the fighting, the immediate threat. But excesses occurred, of course, and the people, instead of protecting each other, being responsible for each other, confused the attackers, the assailants, with everyone. Perhaps, some even took advantage of the situation to aggress inoffensive people, merely because of the confusion. And the people who were -- considered themselves special, were not well-intentioned, that's -- who considered themselves above the others, were not well-intentioned. That's how I explain that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, your answer now ran over 23 lines. And even if the reality can be complicated, you must make an effort to answer quickly because, you see, when you read now these 23 lines your point gets lost. It's impossible to know whether you agree or disagree with the proposition. 
So, now, the Prosecutor will ask the question again and either you answer or you refrain from answering, but we must now get to the point in some of the answers. Will you please help us? Here comes the question again, really.
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Were roadblocks set up in Kigali by persons for the purpose of targeting Tutsi, in your opinion? Yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I was not with them. I don't know. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in your previous answer, you were referring to excesses that took place at the roadblocks. That's doublespeak for killing, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Brutalities committed at the roadblocks was not only killing; people were -- had their money taken away from them, people were beaten and then allowed to go on their way. There were all sorts of wrong deeds. That is why I spoke of quite criminal conduct. But it wasn't only killing. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When did you become aware, according to you, Mr. Renzaho, that some people were using roadblocks to kill Tutsis at the roadblocks? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That question was put to me in the morning -- or maybe it was yesterday. I answered in saying that I learned of the phenomenon after the 10th -- after the 10th of April. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You would agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that there would be nothing wrong, of itself, in either setting up roadblocks or distributing weapons in a time of armed conflict? Do you agree with that proposition? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, a country that is attacked has the right to defend itself, I think. And what you have just suggested could happen, if it isn't concealing a crime.
@MR. MOSES: 
There would have been something wrong, however, wouldn't there, Mr. Renzaho, in asking for roadblocks to be established and distributing weapons at a point in time when you were in -- when the person was aware that such items and such things as roadblocks were being used by civilians to kill innocent Tutsi civilians? You will also agree with me on that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I tell you that anyone who was -- had such notions should, first of all, take care of preliminaries, which is to say to give the order for such roadblocks to be erected and then distribute weapons. Roadblocks with the mission to kill and then to distribute weapons, yes, indeed, it would be most criminal. Was that the case in Rwanda? 
@MR. MOSES: 
We will come to that in a minute. 
Now, you will agree with me, also, won't you, Mr. Renzaho, that the Tutsi, in general, were referred to, both by yourselves and others on the radio, as "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi"? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It wasn't I who invented the expression. It was adopted after the start of the RPF war, and I think the illusion was clear: Those who were attacking at that time were the same that had attacked in the 60s; thus, there was a heightened -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's microphone has gone off. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, you have to answer the question. Did you use that term, yes or no, in that way? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, I used it, as others used it.
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, and, in that respect, I would ask the trial -- my learned -- that the witness be shown Prosecution Exhibit 57, which is under tab 11, English page 21, third paragraph; the French is page 25, fourth paragraph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Tab in which folder? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, second folder, it's radio transcripts. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could you please repeat the page references? 
@MR. MOSES: 
The English page is page 21, third paragraph, and the sentence I am looking at is -- commences -- it starts with "Moreover, the people" to the end of that paragraph. And in the French, it's page 25, the fourth paragraph. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, this is a Radio Rwanda transcript. In the same transcript there is an interview with you, and it is followed by an interview with Mr. Rwajekare, R-W-A-J-E-K-A-R-E. And on the radio station that you were broadcasting about Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, Mr. Rwajekare was telling people that there is only one problem now, the problem between the Hutu and the Tutsi. He went on to say that this is not a war between political parties, for the time being, the general problem is to fight against the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, against the Tutsi. 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, clearly for those persons listening to you, they understood, didn't they, that Inyenzi-Inkotanyi referred to all Tutsi? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
You are referring to a gentleman whom I don't know, and what he says commits himself. He is not one of my civil servants whom I had ordered to go and say things on the radio. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What you read out now was Mr. Rwajekare's statement? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
I won't -- there is another similar statement, and I won't go through doing that, but that's on page 22, the second paragraph of the English, and in the French, page 27, second paragraph, where Mr. Rwajekare was telling the listeners of Radio Rwanda that the Inyenzi -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am making an objection because I don't really see, unless we go to the once, or twice or thrice removed, how can you ascribe to Mr. Renzaho what someone who is not part of his administrative staff, who is not in the indictment -- if you go into this sort of thing it's going to take a lot of time. But I don't see why you mention this person with whom Mr. Renzaho was -- had no relations and for whom he is not responsible. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You did draw our attention to this paragraph on 5th March 2006; we are aware of them. But what does that assist us -- in what way in relation to the views of the Accused? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Your Honours, clearly as the préfet, who is using those terms on the radio, it's of interest, in the Prosecution's submission, as to what meanings those -- that term meant. And it is our submission that, clearly, it referred to all Tutsi, and that was the message that was going out to the people. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So, my question for you, having seen that statement which was on Radio Rwanda, where you were regularly reporting, is that the people who were listening to you would have clearly understood that when you referred to: "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi", you were referring to Tutsi. Because that's the message that was going out on the radio, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is not the message that was being put over Radio Rwanda. And if you go through the communiqués that I made, I even occasionally asked the people to be extremely careful in what they were doing, so as not to confuse the RPF fighter with the rest of the Tutsi population that lived with them. And there is many of those messages, communiqués, so I do not agree with what is asserted here. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, I am suggesting to you that you never, never said on the radio that people should not kill Tutsis simply on the basis of their ethnicity. You, as préfet, never sent that message out, did you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, would you give me a little time just to collect my communiqués and show them to you? Perhaps not in the present -- at the present sitting, but I will show them to you.

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, you told us in the course of your evidence-in-chief that you had not requested roadblocks to be established; that's your evidence, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I was not the one who gave the order for the roadblocks to be erected. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm going to read you an extract from Prosecution Exhibit 50. It is under tab 4 from the 12th of April, and it's -- I think it's only in English, page 9. 
Madam Registrar, I'll try and deal with it by reading the passage out. If the witness does not accept 
my -- 
This was a passage that was referred to briefly in your evidence-in-chief. And you are quoted here as saying on the 12th of April -- from line 4 -- at line 2: "We request of them to make patrols within their quarters like usual. They ought to come together and look for their traditional tools they are used to and defend themselves. I should like to request of them now, each quarter should try and organise itself and make a communal work within quarters by cutting off branches, searching empty houses, check out in the nearby swamp that no Inyenzi hid there. They ought to do this so they get the hope that nobody is hidden inside. They must cut those branches, check in gutters and houses overgrown with weeds. Then at night they have to be watchful so they find nobody inside houses and kill him or something else. People must come together within quarters. On the streets leading to their quarters, it would be a good thing to block them with roadblocks. They can look after them, choose people they really trust and who have papers and put them there." 
That is on the 12th April, after the date that you say it was apparent to you that Tutsis were being killed at roadblocks. And you're asking the people to set up roadblocks, telling them it would be a good thing, isn't that right? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I will answer you. I would not change from what I said before. At that time we had requirements. First, there was the requirements of the war that was still raging on. And on the 12th, Kigali was completely surrounded. There is a UNAMIR report that attests to that. And then the government left Kigali on account of the insecurity. 
The second thing is the erection of roadblocks, and those roadblocks existed before. Do not forget that on the 10th I'd sent out a message asking for the population to abolish these roadblocks during the day. But the message did not go across because the problems persisted and the war continued and I had no cause to fight with those who were manning the roadblocks. 
So to claim that I asked the population to erect roadblocks on the 12th is not correct, because the entire city was covered with roadblocks. But I mentioned vigilance because the surrounding -- the incursion of aggressive troops meant that the threat was getting right down to the timing about those that remained and that still had not been attacked. 
So, I will not get into the technical details of the fighting, but it could happen if infiltrated persons, through street fighting, could get into houses that were uninhabited and -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I am going to stop you. But my question was about the erection of roadblocks. In the passage that I've read you, you were telling the population that it would be a good thing to set up roadblocks, isn't that right? That is what you told the population on the 12th of April. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I'll repeat, Counsel, that roadblocks existed before. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'll repeat my question. Isn't it correct that you were telling the population on the 12th of April that it would be a good thing for them to establish roadblocks? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
What you read there is correct, but those roadblocks existed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did those roadblocks exist from the 6th to the 12th? Or was it the situation that there had been roadblocks in the past? What did you mean by the sentence: "But these roadblocks existed"? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, we are talking about the period of the attack and the RPF offensive. So roadblocks were set up as from the night of the 6th to the 7th. And then it spread, and they were spread all over the city up until the 12th. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maitre Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I would like to raise an objection, because I have here the text to which counsel for the Prosecution is referring. And it was repeated two or three times that in that text Mr. Renzaho called for the setting up of roadblocks. 
That text is in English, but my English is not best. But I don't see it written in the text -- in the text that the counsel for the Prosecution is citing. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have the English version in front of you now? Do you see the sentence starting with 
"on the streets"? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I'm sorry, what line is that? I have the English version here, the first page. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are on page 9 and we are at line 10: "On the streets leading", the end of that sentence, what do you think about that formulation? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, well, maybe you should put that to Mr. Renzaho. I am looking at the precise reference that was cited by the counsel for the Prosecution to carry on the discussion. But I can't take the place of Mr. Renzaho to answer that question. But if you want --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are saying: What is the basis for Mr. Moses saying so? And I'm saying I think actually if you read the last part of that sentence, that's the one, but in order to be a bit diplomatic instead of saying: "Isn't it there?", I said, "What did you think about it?" 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President, for your concern in my regard. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you want to proceed, Mr. Moses? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You see that statement on the 12th of April, Mr. Renzaho, is consistent with what Prosecution witnesses have said what you were asking them to do in their secteurs at around that same period of time, isn't it? It's corroborative of what the Prosecution witnesses say you were telling them to do, which was to set up roadblocks in their secteurs? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I will repeat what I said: To my mind, that is the reality of what I saw. The roadblocks were there, they existed all through the city. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You didn't have any problem with the roadblocks, is that what you're telling us? There was no difficulty so far as you were concerned with roadblocks existing? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I have been sitting in front of the Chamber for close to a week now, and I have discussed security issues at length, security issues that we faced, and not once do I recall saying what you are ascribing to me. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, you didn't think it was a good thing to have roadblocks; yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, while we -- it was important to be concerned with the security issue, but the extension of the security concern was the protection of people because the whole thing was getting widespread. We had troops that had taken defensive positions out of the city on the hills to face the RPF, far away then. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'm not talking about fighting the RPF in the hills far away. I'm asking you whether you thought it was a good thing that persons were manning these roadblocks erected around Kigali from the 10th of April onwards; was that something that you wanted to happen? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I simply called on the population to be vigilant and I asked them to do that because there were incursions and the attacks were coming into the mechanism. That is all. There is a UNAMIR report that talks about the situation. You could read that. The report is very exhaustive in that connection. 
@MR. MOSES: 
On the 14th of April, and it's P. 51, tab 5, English, page 10, and about five or six lines from the bottom; and in French it is page 24, fourth paragraph. I'll read from the English, and then if you disagree or have any problems with it, Mr. Renzaho, we can point you to it. 
You say to the population: "So we will hold meetings tomorrow and I asked the citizens, especially those intuitions that they have to come for. All the citizens do not have to attend those meetings because the citizens have to conduct patrols and have their roadblocks that they are guarding at which they must remain." 
You're telling the population for persons to stay on the roadblocks on the 14th of April, aren't you, 
Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. And on the 8th, I asked the commune authorities to take control of the situation that prevailed in the commune, and that is quite correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So as far as you are concerned, you were wanting people to man the roadblocks? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The population exposed to the war front, spontaneously set up the roadblocks and were manning them already. 
@MR. MOSES: 
With the greatest of respect, Mr. Renzaho, that does not answer my question. You were happy in wanting people to man those roadblocks on the 14th of April, weren't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
What else did they have to protect themselves? In as much as people were exposed to the firing and the incursions of the troops that were attacking them, and the danger was there. Those roadblocks, even though they just started spontaneously, they were there. And it was a reality on which I had to count. I had no means of security or guaranteeing their security. There was no way of abolishing those roadblocks. 
So, first, we had to look at those who exercised authority at those roadblocks, but it didn't work and the roadblocks remained, and they had to be managed somehow and they were managed at the level of the various neighbourhoods and the population -- I believe we had a witness here, HIN, who told us how the people relayed one another at the roadblocks. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That was at a time when you knew that those same roadblocks were being used to target Tutsi, it was after the 10th of April? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Am I forbidden from asking a question? I was going to ask you -- ask you for advice on what I would have done. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now your question, Mr. Moses. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You gave instructions to persons manning those roadblocks on what documents they should check for persons going through, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I had a discussion with a journalist and I believe we addressed that issue. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you were instructing the population to check persons' identity cards. And that they also needed laissez-passers, isn't that correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The laissez-passers were delivered under circumstances that I tried to explain here. I do not think that it constituted a problem. All the more so, as the people who passed by had laissez-passers to continue within the country. So, generally, people who would pass by with laissez-passers were heading for the interior of the country. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Laissez-passers didn't record the ethnicity of the person, did they? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is what we did. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Identity cards did indicate the ethnicity of people, didn't they? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That was the law. I couldn't change it, well, unless law was reviewed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
But you knew that people with Tutsi identity cards were having excesses delivered to them at roadblocks, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not quite understand that question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, I used a term you had. Tutsis were being killed at roadblocks and they were being identified because they were having to show identity cards with their ethnicity on them; correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I don't know at my level whether the documents I gave out were intended to have those people travel to their various destinations. Now, the identity papers they had were theirs. But I must say that many of them discarded them, and we've had witnesses here who have said that they found documents saying that those papers were lost. But I did not have the power to replace official documents that was delivered to citizens. What could I do? 
@MR. MOSES: 
For now could you answer my question, please, Mr. Renzaho? Were you aware -- or you were aware, weren't you, that Tutsis were having -- being killed at roadblocks because they were showing their identity cards showing that they were Tutsi. That was common knowledge? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That's true, even without seeking to check the identity card, the persons have declared before this Chamber that faces that resembled those of Tutsis faced problems, people who had such faces. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Not just people with faces, Mr. Renzaho, people who had identity documents showing their ethnicity; that's also true, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I believe that what you're saying is correct. If a person had an identity card that could be checked, and in addition to that, somebody could -- somebody's facial features could reveal that they were Tutsi. That's the reality that we experienced. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yet you made it a requirement and gave instructions to those persons at the roadblocks, that persons needed to show their identity cards? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
There are ways of operation at roadblocks and documents are always checked, whether I say so or not. It's the same thing. And maybe the crime here would be to say that these persons who have this status should be brutalised. I believe Rwandans have always had identity cards and roadblocks were not restricted to the period between April and July 1994. Throughout the war, we have been used to the phenomenon of roadblocks and people have always passed without problems. Perhaps we should wonder -- ask ourselves why people carry on like this. 
@MR. MOSES:
I note the time, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You remember this earthquake meeting? The problem is that it might be argued that it would be good for staff to be present when it comes to matters like that. And that, unfortunately, could slow us down. 
Where are you in your cross-examination now? I note that you are at P. 51. I'm wondering whether we should carry on a bit longer today in order to make up for the meeting tomorrow. 
Before doing so, do you have an estimate based on the rhythm so far? Let's assume that we sit tomorrow from 8:45 to 10:20, and then there will be a need probably for some of Monday. Or what is your estimate? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honours, it hasn't been as fast as I'd anticipated, it's fair to say. I've gone through perhaps -- or will certainly have by a little bit longer, a third of the questions. I think the last third will not -- will be a lot quicker. So I'm certainly expecting to finish on Monday. It may not be till Monday afternoon, but it will be on Monday. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When will Mr. Lugan start his testimony, Defence? From when is he ready? And did you mention approximately four hours for him? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, what we planned was to start on Monday in the afternoon with Professor Lugan, and the estimated time was five or six hours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then we have the voir dire of about one hour plus additional time, so that means that Lugan will take more than a day for the two parties. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, two issues there: One, I think the voir dire will be perhaps 40, 45 minutes. But that will in fact include most of the questions that I intend to ask Mr. Lugan, should he be qualified. 
If Your Honours do qualify him, and my approach in general terms if he is qualified -- my approach would then be to say his statement can go on and I'd be then happy to cross-examine him on the statement. I've certainly not been advised that there are additional material that my learned friend wishes to extract from Mr. Lugan, other than that in his statement. But perhaps, should Your Honours qualify him, it is a way in which matters could be sped up. If that assists the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maitre Cantier, will there be additional documents coming up with regard Professor Lugan's testimony? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Let me consult a bit before answering you.
Yes, Mr. President. There are two or three documents that we hoped to use, but these documents have already been disclosed. They are part of the batch of documents that we've disclosed. They are not new documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What we have heard so far seems to indicate we have control over the segment. But why don't we continue for a little while and we'll see how this develops, Mr. Moses. It won't be too long. 
@MR. MOSES:
I'll see if I can locate the last question, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, from what I understand from your testimony, do you we understand that roadblocks were established to locate "infiltrators"? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I tell you how I saw the situation. Those who erected the roadblocks feared that assailants would come to their place and kill without any warning, without any alert for those who can run or for those who could obtain the intervention of the force -- security forces, because the RPF had taken -- Rwandan government forces had taken up positions around the neighbourhoods. I think that was the fear in people's minds. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, just the last passage that I read you from the 14th of April, you were telling people to be on the roadblocks. Why were you telling them to do that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Quite simply because the day I said that the town was completely encircled and the troops coming from the north began to come into the town directly, the north, northwest. That was the reality of the moment. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Weren't you -- I'm sorry. I'll rephrase that question. Were you aware of any person who was arrested for being an infiltrator in any of the roadblocks set up in Kigali? Because you'll agree I don't believe that we've heard of any such person being arrested during April to July? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, what we are telling you is not the fruit of imagination. I've even read in your archives here transcripts of Radio Rwanda where there were interviews of APR soldiers who'd been arrested in Gimiramiya (phonetic) secteur, and we spoke of others. And to be even more explicit, and to be concrete, I can mention a series of raids that were made within the FAR lines, RGF lines. They went -- paratroopers dropped where they wanted to attack. There was infiltrators to the open areas, that's how it is done. And there's also cases of soldiers questioned by military intelligence. Intelligence -- if there is transcriptions, I can find them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
How many alleged infiltrators were arrested by those civilians manning those -- those civilians manning the barriers in your préfecture, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not have any mechanism for picking up those people that were stopped. There was an RGF line of defence around the neighbourhood and if people were arrested they'd be taken to those soldiers. We did not have a central mechanism at the préfecture to collect those people. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So the answer is: None. You are not aware of any people arrested by civilians at roadblocks. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not receive any such persons at the préfecture. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It seems to me this is a good moment to stop and we will then continue tomorrow morning at 8:45. The court is adjourned.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, yesterday we were ending -- we were talking about roadblocks. We'll try and finish that topic quite quickly. Do you recall -- there was a speaker on Radio Rwanda on the 19th of April? 
@MR. MOSES:
It's in P. 52, I won't show it to the Accused. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
He was referring to the listeners the fact that you had had a meeting with pharmacists. Do you remember? Did you have such a meeting with pharmacists? I don't need to know the details about the meeting, but do you agree that you had such a meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, it was at the time we were trying to reorganise our various technical services to help them -- the citizenry. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, the speaker had said that Préfet Renzaho asked the pharmacists not to be discouraged, but to continue importing essential drugs as usual. And that "Concerning the war our country is experiencing now, Préfet Renzaho called, once again, on the residents of Kigali town to step up their efforts in order to ensure their security, manning roadblocks, and conducting night patrols to prevent the enemy infiltrations". 
I just need to know whether you agree that you made such a call for the people to do those things. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, not once, several times I said that, because the situation was ambivalent. There was the war and there was people's safety -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, I am going to start interrupting you a bit now, because all I needed to know was that you had said such a thing -- and thank you for answering that. 
Mr. Renzaho, can you assist the Trial Chamber in what instructions you gave the people as to do with infiltrators if they found them? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The instructions -- the orders were clear. I think, in one of the messages I delivered, you can find those instructions. I asked that people who were suspect, after being checked, be handed over to the authorities for appropriate legal proceedings -- judicial proceedings. I think you'll find it one of the messages I delivered. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sure your counsel will refer us all to it if it so exists. But the reason I'm interested in that, Mr. Renzaho, is why you'd be making such a comment if, as according to you, those structures didn't exist. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I don't know which structures you're referring to.
@MR. MOSES: 
The legal ones that you say you were going to have the persons go through.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I think you're referring to the message of the 19th of April 1994, if I'm not mistaken. Allow me to inform you that it was right after the outbreak of hostilities the judicial apparatus, more or less, disappeared, but the préfecture tried to help them to resume their activities. By the 19th of April, what is certain is that those structures were not yet operational. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, you're asking the population to arrest infiltrators, but, according to you, there are no such structures in place to deal with arrests? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, the situation was such that the people were committed and facing up to RPF-troops incursion -- by their side. There was the defence apparatus of the army -- and the people who could be arrested should be taken to the army's military defence structure. The army could take care of those people and then transfer them to places where the war had not reached. But, I don't see the connection between the fact that people were being attacked and what you are, in contrast, saying that the judicial apparatus didn't exist. So, what were we to do? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, I'm suggesting to you that what happened is that all persons who were "infiltrators", namely, the Tutsi civilians, were killed. They weren't arrested at all. And that nowhere have you, in fact, in the transcripts said that infiltrators are to be arrested. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, that is your opinion. You can't propose people or names to me among those who were killed. The infiltrators are a fact. From April to July, I can show you a whole series of UNAMIR reports referring to infiltrators. They had observers -- military officers observing, and you knew what was happening. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, now, in respect of the requirement for laissez-passers and identity cards at the roadblocks, 
I believe you accepted yesterday that you had, as is recorded in various transcripts, given speeches on the radio to confirm that those documents were required. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
And as far as that is concerned, I don't see where the crime is. The documents were official, established by law. The law hadn't been changed; that was the practice current not only in Kigali, but throughout the country. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'll take that as a "yes". 
@MR. MOSES:
And I'm just wondering if, very briefly, Madam Registrar can show to you P. 63, and in the French, it's the top two paragraphs of page 3. In the English, it's on page 2, the fourth paragraph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this is in which volume? 
@MR. MOSES:
It's in volume 2, Your Honours. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Which tab? 
@MR. MOSES:
Seventeen. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thanks. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, have you got the top of page 3? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, I am on page 3. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And if you read the first two paragraphs to yourself, do you confirm that that is one of the times that you spoke about the requirements for laissez-passers and identity cards? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I confirm what I just said: These documents were current practice in Rwanda; it wasn't specific to the period April to July, 1994 -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry to interrupt you again. All I wanted to know is that what is recorded there is what you said. 
It's all I need to know. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, can I ask you for a small dispensation? A favour? I'm here to defend myself. It's been years now I've been waiting for the opportunity to defend myself. Now I'm here -- it's four years I've been here. Now that I have the opportunity to defend myself, you don't want me to do so? 
I don't understand. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, the Chamber is in total control here, and we are ensuring that you are given ample opportunity to defend yourself. But, at the same time we must also be certain that we get what we need in an efficient way, and that we avoid repetition or explanations that will not necessarily lead to a result. 
Now, Mr. Moses, P. 63. 
@MR. MOSES:
P. 63. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's good. 
What is your next question?
@MR. MOSES:
All I wanted was a confirmation from the witness that that's what he said on that occasion. It's as far as I want to take it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, did you say what is written in the transcripts here? Is that a correct reflection of what you said on that occasion? That is the question now. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Well, I can't absolutely be certain that it's a faithful transcription. But what is sure is that we always talked about those travel documents, which were usual in Rwanda. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, forgive me. 
Mr. Renzaho, do you have this document before you? Is it the document in question -- the paragraphs in question, are they, indeed, before you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, he spoke of number 3 -- page 3. I think that the pages K036832 -- 732, K0368732.
@MR. CANTIER:
And perhaps the Prosecution could specify the date of the document? It might not -- it might be of use. 
@MR. MOSES:
It's already on the record, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you repeat the date for the benefit of Maître Cantier, so that we are all absolutely certain about that? 
@MR. MOSES:
18th of June 1994. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So this reference to laissez-passers, do you recall having made such a reference, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, yes, and I issued such at the préfecture. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And just also finally, briefly, in this same document, can I refer you to the end of that -- or, towards the end of that same speech, and it is on page 10 of that document in the French, K0368739, the third and fourth paragraphs in the French. And in the English, it is on page 7, the fourth and 
fifth paragraphs. 
Do you have the paragraphs there, Mr. Renzaho? The first paragraphs commences with the words, 
"Il faut que ces jeunes".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
"Those youths must follow". 
And the answer? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
The third paragraph, "Il faut que ces jeunes suivent bon conseil."
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Those young people must follow the good advice".
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Can you just read those two following paragraphs, and the only question I need you to answer is whether you agree that that is what you said on that occasion? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, it's quite possible. I don't -- my mind -- my memory is not like that of a computer that recalls exactly what I said, but it would not be foreign to what I would say. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, thank you for that. 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, bearing in mind that you have told us that you did make it a requirement for persons to obtain travel documents from the préfectoral office, and bearing in mind that was at a time -- and at times when you were aware that Tutsi were being targeted at roadblocks, it would have been very apparent to you that the only people who could safely get to the préfectoral office were those with Hutu identity cards. That's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, you were not in Kigali -- and if you'll allow me to tell you what was happening, I will tell you, but if you want me to bow to your reasoning, I cannot do so. 
What you're saying takes no account of the situation, because in view -- it was because of the lack of security that led the people since the end of -- the end of 1993, the feeling of insecurity was permanent. We had centres for refugees -- sheltering refugees. People who felt threatened, in danger, felt obliged to flee, to seek refuge somewhere, and that's what I tried to explain here. I think that arbitrarily to analyse the situation without taking into due account of the context, as you are doing, 
Mr. Prosecutor -- well, I'm very sorry, but the result is to transform the reality that we experienced. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, this is a good example, Mr. Renzaho. Now, you were allowed to develop your reasoning in connection with that question, but it didn't really answer the question.
The only people who could safely get to the préfectoral office were those with Hutu identity cards. 
Is that correct or is it not correct? Now, what is your view in relation to that question, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
My point of view is not to -- I wouldn't state it categorically as such. What I just said is to show that most Tutsi were afraid to go very far; they sought safe places to take shelter. But, I'm not saying that at the préfecture I did not receive Tutsi to whom I did not issue documents and who went away again. 
So, the situation isn't as cut and dried as the -- as he was trying to put it. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
But you do agree, Mr. Renzaho, that given the situation at the time it was difficult for the Tutsis to come to the préfecture to get the travel documents? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Your Honour, I agree -- I agree fully, but what I'm speaking of there reflects -- was to seek shelter somewhere. So the general trend was not to wander around the town. Thank you. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And by reason of these roadblocks that were established, those Tutsis who remained in their houses became sitting ducks and were easy targets to be killed, weren't they? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I've told you we made efforts to defend the sites we had identified. Now, did all the people who seek -- who sought refuge go to those sites or did they seek shelter with third parties? Certainly, there are some who went to seek shelter with third parties. But, I can't tell you that I gave an order to him or her to go here or there. 
You have to take account of what happened -- what was happening at the time in the context of that war -- unless, you want to accuse me of having triggered the events. But I experienced them while deploring them with all the citizenry of Kigali préfecture. I wasn't responsible for it. If lightning struck us, would I be the one who ordered it? What would be our relative responsibility -- all of us here, in such a case? I couldn't have foreseen it, and that was the situation at the time. It's very regrettable; it was a tragedy. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, the context in Kigali, Mr. Renzaho, is that in April, May and June, it was unsafe for Tutsis to remain in their houses because they were being targeted by reason of their ethnicity. Do you agree with that general proposition -- nothing to do with you at this stage, but just that general proposition? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In general terms, that was the situation, but you heard the testimony of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover); that wasn't just talk. So, the situation was complex, but, in general terms, that was the situation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Right -- and do you agree with what Dr. Des Forges said, that as opposed to the rest of the country, in Kigali it was slightly safer for Tutsis to go to centres because Kigali was the capital, and there was some international focus on some of those centres? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I'm very embarrassed to answer that. It's very embarrassing and, once more, I will beg you to allow me to answer -- to give me a few moments to answer correctly that assertion - if you would allow me to do so. If you don't, then I would say merely that the assertion, as Madam Des Forges made it, would be pertinent had it come from someone who'd lived through the events with us in Kigali. Books -- we've read; we know what they say. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a reference to a name at 09:18:54. 
@MR. MOSES:
I believe he gave evidence without a pseudonym. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is Prosecution witness -- no, this is Defence witness 15, isn't it? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, but my recollection was that he waived his witness protection.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, can you confirm that he waived his witness protection? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I would need to check that in the instance. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
My impression, according to the registry note, Mr. Matemanga, is that he did not. 
I think we have to place that under separate cover. And, let me also say that the spelling of that name was different from what we heard, and I will provide the right spelling to those concerned, and it will then be placed under seal. 
Thank you very much, Defence. 
May I ask you, while you are still on your feet I want now to come back to that floating issue from yesterday, which I indicated at the beginning of the session. 
Maître Cantier, you referred to a particular bourgmestre in your examination-in-chief on Thursday, the 30th of August. And the sentence reads: "Do you know or did you know the bourgmestre of..." 
And then we have phonetically "Buturimbi". Can you help us with the exact term there, what was really your reference there? 
@MR. CANTIER:
It was Bicumbi -- Bicumbi, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's number 33 on the Defence list, thank you. 
Then a question to you, Mr. Renzaho, you were asked about the massacres committed by the RPF on the Hutu population, and there was then a sequence where you referred to the arrival at the préfecture of the bourgmestre of...and then we have the "Muhazi" commune. Is that what you said? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I spoke of Muhazi commune. M-U-H-A -- shall I spell it? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could it be number 302 on the Defence spelling list, Maître Cantier? 
M-U-H-A-Z-I, is that the right pronunciation or spelling, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Quite, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then followed a new sentence, you said: "He had passed through all the..." and we have "Musubichumbu" communes. Can you just say what you said there, please, help us with the spellings? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I spoke of "Bicumbi" commune.

And that is number 33, and that's that, thank you very much.
Now, we can continue.

You told KZ -- Witness KZ in early May to send the refugees at Saint Paul's back home, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, no -- that I never said to anyone. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You'll agree that if, in fact, you had said such a thing, it would -- as some witnesses have described -- amounted to a death sentence for such persons? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, and I was quite convinced of that, and I could not do so because at the same time, on various occasions, I was helping people to leave where they were for safer gathering points. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'm suggesting to you that when witness KZ said he could not do so such a thing, you said to him in French, the expression, "Je m'en fous", "I don't care", and you hung up the telephone on him. 
You find it funny, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Non. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Good.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, I don't find it amusing. It's a very serious thing -- that it's all the more serious that such a lie could be asserted by a (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover). I will tell you I never saw that (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) before I saw him here in this court -- that (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover). Please understand that. And he never called me on the telephone. That's it.

Perhaps, Your Honours, to be safe the last part of that answer should be placed under seal. In the context that the question was asked; it could lead to an identification.

@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, I want to move on to another topic now, and that's the issue of civil defence. You said in your evidence-in-chief that there was no civil defence programme implemented in Kigali during 
April, May and June. That's correct, isn't it? That was your evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that is what I said. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you had referred to you, but were not shown, correspondence between General Nsabimana and yourself from the -- dated the 30th and 31st of March respectively?

That is correct.

I'm wondering if Madam Registrar could please show to the witness, Prosecution Exhibit 24. It's in the first bundle of documents at tab 19. 
$(Pages 1 to 9 by Jean Baigent)

@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you're -- you're familiar with that document, aren't you, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, this is a report that was written by the general chief of staff of the Rwandan army. Yes, I know this document. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Concerning a meeting held on the 29th of March 1994 with persons including yourself, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And concerning a civil defence programme? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. But the civil defence programme was not implemented. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the document's headed "très secret", "very secret", correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I have worked in the army, and such documents are always classified top secret; that is customary. Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that's because it was an illegal programme, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I don't know what you mean by "illegal". The report is for the minister of national defence and the members of the government. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, the Arusha Accords didn't allow for such training of persons and arming of civilians, did it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The Arusha Accords, since you are referring to them -- may I, in light of the specific question you have put to me, elaborate on the issue and try to tell you what I'm aware of regarding this matter? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, all I want to know from you at this stage is whether you agree or disagree that the Arusha Accords allowed for such a programme. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can't answer yes to a question whether you agree or disagree. You must choose. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, he put a specific question to me, were -- "Did the Arusha Accords prohibit military training?" And my answer was yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When the question is summarised that way, the answer is clear. Thank you. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And the meeting and programme agreed on was hidden from the prime minister, also, wasn't it? The prime minister wasn't copied into that correspondence. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I don't know about that. The person concerned was the general chief of staff who sent the report to his minister. Now, on this matter, if you're not aware of it, let me tell you that during the said period there was a restricted security council with a number of ministers, and this council was headed by the prime minister. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
At paragraph 4 in that letter, "The operational cells were to be assigned to search for and neutralise infiltrators." "Neutralise" means kill them, doesn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. I never heard that the definition of neutralise in the dictionary was to kill. One can neutralise somebody or something using different means. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
If it meant arrest, you would -- it would have said "arrest", wouldn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Arrest is one stage in a series of measures that might be undertaken. For example, someone is arrested -- or, one can arrest somebody if one has information on that person. So one has to get the information, one has to locate that person, and then decide to arrest that person. So I believe there are a number of concurrent measures, and the idea here was to prevent the infiltrators from reaching the objective they had, that is to say, to kill and to sabotage. 
And for the period under consideration -- we are referring to the 31st. On the 31st, precisely, Gatumba was murdered in the Bilyogo secteur by the RPF agents, and this created problems. There was a riot within the population. Subsequently three people were killed, and many Tutsis had to flee the secteur in order to seek refuge at Nyamirambo. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'll put to one side at the moment that it's reporting on a meeting of the 29th, not a meeting of the 31st. But I would now ask you to look at paragraph 7 where it states that "MINADEF and MININTER will be contacted so as to make weapons available for distribution to selected civilian personnel." MININTER was the department that you were seconded to, wasn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That's correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And we've heard a good deal of evidence that weapons were provided after the 6th of April, both from the préfecture office and MINADEF, haven't we? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, we have heard -- I have heard, just as you have, and other parties here in the Trial Chamber, people saying such things. But in order to corroborate this charge, you brought AFB before me. And I was able to prove the validity of such an allegation. Who knows whether there's any basis to these allegations? That is what I have tried to demonstrate. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And at paragraph 10 of that document, it's suggested that the pop -- "The bourgmestres instruct the population in traditional weapons: Swords, spears, machetes, bows and arrows." These were the weapons of choice, weren't they, Mr. Renzaho, for civilians killing innocent Tutsis in Kigali from April to July 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
First of all, we are referring to a document which is describing a project, Counsel for the Prosecution, a project which was never implemented. So let us not mix up matters here. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You'll agree with me, won't you, Mr. Renzaho, that use of a machete could have no legitimate use against -- to defend the civilian population against the RPF, who were well armed with guns, and well trained, from what some Defence witnesses have said. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I see that you are going to the heart of the matter: The war. And some things need to be taken into account. First of all, the tools you are referring to, the machetes, et cetera, are tools that were customarily used by any Rwandan family. And people were used -- people would use them for their domestic work and for other purposes. Now, whether we are dealing with other objectives here, that is secondary. The Rwandan population is a population of farmers. They would work in the fields, they would look for firewood, so these were tools that were customarily used by Rwandan families. 
And with regard to the war you are referring to, this is proof that these people did not have anything else to defend themselves. If there had been such a distribution of weapons and large-scale training of youths, and if the youths had been provided with weapons, why would people have resorted to the use of machetes and clubs in order to defend themselves? So that is the situation that is in contradiction with the allegations which, to my mind, have been set up after the events. It is a vision, with hindsight, of the events that took place in Rwanda. So, of course, one can imagine any -- anything that was not possible at the time when the events broke out in the country. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that it's quite clear that the use of such traditional tools for work would only be of use if your work was the killing of innocent civilians, unarmed civilians. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Absolutely not. You're not going to bring back the Rwandan tragedy to only the events between -- in April of 1994, a time during which populations tried to protect their hill, their village. It started from the 1990s -- 1991 up to 1994. So people erected roadblocks, people organised patrols using the implements they had at home. I do not know whether, in 1991 or in 1992, there were deaths. But I do know that in the Kayonza commune, and in the Kigarama commune, which is my commune of origin, RPF fighters were arrested by the populations, you see. So I believe that people will use the tools that are available to them in order to protect themselves if they don't have anything else. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And -- 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Mr. Renzaho, I would still like to have your comments on this paragraph, because I have listened to the explanations you have given. It is true that those are the traditional tools that are used in Rwanda, like most parts of Africa. But in this context, it goes on to say, "Because of the insufficiency of arms, the population should be encouraged to use these other tools as weapons." So what do you have to say about that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Your Honour, what I'm saying is that the interpretation you're making is correct, because this is a matter for the whole country, and people would do their best in order to ensure the monitoring of the area in which they were. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, the procedure that would be adopted by yourself, if you wanted weapons, would be to contact MINADEF to obtain weapons. You'll agree that that is the procedure that would be undergone prior to April 1994? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, Counsel for the Prosecution. The procedure I should have adopted in order to request for weapons -- and I did so for the police -- would have been to write to the minister of the interior requesting for him to intervene at the level of the government and his defence counterpart in order to request such -- to ask for such weapons. 
Regarding the weapons for the police -- and there is existing correspondence on the subject -- we mentioned the problems we had to provide weapons to all of the policemen in the préfecture. Because out of 250 policemen, as I stated here, only 100 or so had firearms. And our wish was to provide firearms to all of them. There has been an exchange of correspondence with the ministry of the interior which was not able to provide all the weapons we needed to us. So this is the procedure. 
@MR. MOSES: 
If you look at Prosecution Exhibit -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are moving on to a new exhibit now. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we leave this exhibit, Mr. Renzaho, you had a general remark in relation to one of the questions where you have to help me. You said that, first of all, you have to bear in mind that this is a project which was never implemented. Please explain what you mean by that. Because if you look at the first paragraph here, this is a letter which seems to convey conclusions following a meeting by a group chaired by Major General Nsabimana, and where the prefect of Kigali and the operational commander of Kigali were all present. And the purpose of the meeting was to refine the plan of self-defence; that follows from the first and second paragraph. 
And then you will note wordings as, in the third paragraph, "The meeting decided as follows". So this seems to be decisions to be followed. In view of that wording, what did you mean by saying that this was not implemented? Could you explain that, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you, Mr. President. What I mean, quite simply, is that the conclusions that are being conveyed to the ministry of defence by the general chief of staff was to (unintelligible) a number of decisions being taken by the government. And only those decisions could provide an implementation framework for this civil defence system. There was the need for a law, or at least a presidential act or decree, to establish the framework. The resources also had to be earmarked. It was -- would have been necessary to call the reservists to duty. 
And, in the example I gave, there should have been, for example, the definition of defence sectors in the vicinity of the Kigali préfecture because of the military camps or groupings that were here and there in the vicinity of Kigali. So it was a programme which was not implemented as of the 6th of April of 1994. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm wondering if the witness could be shown Prosecution Exhibit 17. It's under tab 11 of the first bundle of Prosecution exhibits. It's a letter from the Accused to the minister of defence dated 4th March 1992. 
Well, perhaps if I can ask questions. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you recall writing to the minister of defence asking for arms, and authorisation to carry arms, for a number of your conseillers and bourgmestres? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, indeed, I do remember it. I did send that letter, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So at least on that occasion, you'll agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that you requested arms from the ministry of defence. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I did, and I did after consulting with the minister of the interior in view of the insecurity in which these administrative officials were living. And they had expressed the wish to be protected. And it is the normal way of going about it when one is to -- asking for a weapon to be lent, one must first be authorised to have such a weapon. And that authorisation was given by the ministry of national defence. There was a specific department to that effect. And the same department lent the -- the conseillers and the bourgmestres -- I believe there were 20 or so, 20 or 21 people -- lent them these weapons for a specific period, and they were to give the weapons back once the situation would have improved. So that was the situation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's not what the letter says, is it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In the letter, unless my memory fails me -- I don't have the letter here in front of me -- but I believe that that letter was seeking authorisation for these persons to have weapons, and was also requesting that weapons be lent to them for the period we are referring to. And I received the support of the minister of the interior, because we had discussed the matter together beforehand. And he was the one who asked his counterpart to settle this matter. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The letter is now being placed in front of you, Mr. Renzaho. Any particular part of it you want to refer to? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
What I wish to say is that, in this letter, there is the confirmation of what I stated. We asked, for people who were within the population and were exposed to insecurity, that they be authorised to have a weapon, and that the ministry of defence lend them a firearm. And the minister of the interior supported this request because we had discussed it beforehand. Thank you.

Was that letter copied to the minister of interior? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
My apologies. We had talked about the principle -- earlier on we had talked about the general situation in our presentation. It was on the basis of that discussion that the minister gave me the authorisation to send me this letter, because he had already discussed the matter with his counterpart from the national defence. So this is how things happened. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And you'll have also seen letters from the prime minister and the minister of the interior, which were dated the 25th of May 1994, that was sent to all préfets regarding civil defence. Do you accept that you received such documents, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I saw the said documents after I left the country. This to show you how difficult it was for me to make contact with governmental services, yes, I did indeed, afterwards, see the directive of the prime minister on defence, and the implementation letter of the ministry of the interior regarding the same directives. But I saw them after I left. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And when you saw the letter from the minister of the interior dated 25 May, do you recall having read that he had written to all préfets on the 25th of May saying that the préfets should establish lists of people who have received or should receive firearms, including their names, et cetera. Do you recall that that was in the letter? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I did see this mentioned in the letter, that is true, but the letter reached me belatedly. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And it's fair to say that that is indicative of the fact that the government had already arranged for the distribution of firearms to some people prior to that date. Do you agree with that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I can only talk about Kigali town where I was throughout the events. I am not aware of what was happening elsewhere. As far as I'm concerned, if you put questions -- specific questions to me on the second phase -- and perhaps this should indeed be a question that should be put to me, because I believe it would enable the Trial Chamber to better understand the defence situation. But I can testify to what I was a witness to in Kigali, thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm wondering if the witness could be shown Prosecution Exhibit 54. It's tab -- under tab 8 of the second bundle of exhibits. It's from the 22nd of April. And I'm, in the English, looking at page 14, and in the French it's page 20, the third paragraph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't you place on record what this is while we are finding the document. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's a Radio Rwanda broadcast from the 22nd of April, where the Accused introduces an officer who's an -- he says has been appointed to work with him, to help coordinate the efforts of the population and operations by the military. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, do you recall introducing on the radio, on the 22nd of April 1994, an R -- FAR officer by the name of Esdras Mushimiyimana, M-U-S-H-I-M-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do not recall having done so, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, you've got the transcript there, Mr. Renzaho. Don't you recall taking the opportunity to introduce the officer who had been appointed -- and I'm reading from paragraph 2 of the French -- of the English -- "to work with me. He is going to help you and me to coordinate the efforts of the population and the operations by the military." 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I can see this transcript, but is the date correct? And, besides, I do not know that person. That is quite clear. I need to be given clarifications on that person, and Major Bivamvagara that I received at the préfecture -- wouldn't that be Bivamvagara? Because Bivamvagara's name was Patrice. So somewhere I believe there is some confusion, and I don't understand. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, can you help the Trial Chamber understand also, Mr. Renzaho, because this same exhibit, and a passage from it, was put to you by the Defence in the evidence-in-chief, and you conceded that it was you on the radio at that point in time. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I am entitled to wonder whether it is indeed the date of the 22nd, because on the 22nd I had no reserve officer who had been called to duty at the préfecture. There are official documents. There is the telegram which was calling the reservists to duty, and which was dated 1st of May. And that is what I stated before the Trial Chamber. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You see, in the paragraph where, after you have introduced the officer, he introduces himself, and he says, "We will be working together to see how we can improve on the civil defence system in the course of the meetings that I will soon be having with you." Do you see that, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I see it, but that's not the question, that's not the problem. The problem is, first of all I didn't see this person, nor do I see that particular role at that time. But if you'll allow me just an instant, I will give you a small explanation. Am I allowed to do so? 
Right. On the 22nd of May -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, before you go further, you have talked about the 22nd of May. So that there is no mistake, this document is from the 22nd of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And staff -- 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
$(Microphones overlapping) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Hold on. This earthquake meeting. I saw that persons are requested to be seated there around 10:15. So we should now not get into a very long sequence. 
But let -- there is time to clarify one issue, and that's the date of this document. You have mentioned the 22nd. But if you look at page 5 of the English version, and it's the same in French with another page numeration, of course, reference is made to something being read out and apparently dated the 24th of April. So Mr. Renzaho seems to be right in the sense that this transmission must be after the 22nd. Do we have any other indications as to the exact time of this transmission? Maybe that could be looked into. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Can I point to, Your Honour, on page 15 of the English. It starts "Your Excellencies, 15 days ago, to be precise, RPF resumed hostilities here in the city of Kigali." So Your Honour is -- may be correct in terms of the transmission; I can't comment on that. But in terms of that being a passage from the Accused, it's referring to "Fifteen days ago, to be precise, RPF resumed hostilities." We know they started fighting again on the 7th. That's where -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We now have, in the transcripts, exactly what we were about to start with, and we will do that on Monday morning at 8:45. 
Are there any practical issues that need to be sorted out before we end for today? That doesn't seem to be the case. 
The Court is adjourned.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, when we broke on Friday, I was referring you to a passage from Exhibit P. 54. And in fact I was referring you to the paragraph subsequent to a paragraph that you had been read in the course ever your evidence-in-chief. Do you remember that? It's page 20 of the French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you found it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, sir, I am hesitating. The -- the page, page 20 in French is not even in French, it is in English. And I can't find the page, exactly. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
It is page 20 in French, K0246838. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Counsel, I have seen the page. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, as I just indicated to you, there was a passage read by your counsel in the course of your evidence-in-chief where you had said: 
"That is why I would call on you to make every effort so that the organisation of patrols should be improved, so that opportunity should not take advantage of it to attack the innocent population. We have started noticing some of such criminal acts in several secteurs where some youths are colluding with reckless soldiers to attack members of the population, so that the population" -- sorry "of the population, extort money, and loot houses." 
Now, that passage was read out to you during the course of your evidence-in-chief, and not only did you not say, "No, that's not me", you gave a lengthy explanation about that passage during which you had said, amongst other things, "If I had some other means to react other than speech, other than speaking, I would have used those means." 
Do you remember answering that question and giving an explanation about that passage to your counsel? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do recall, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You see, it's only in the following paragraph of the same speech, Mr. Renzaho, that you indicate that you're going to introduce a military officer, who you then do, who says, amongst other things, "We will be working together to see how we can improve on the civil-defence system in the course of the meetings that I will soon be having with you." 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, that's not consistent, is it, with the position you take, namely, that there was no civil-defence system introduced. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I thank you for your question, and I would like to use this opportunity, first, to place that text in its proper perspective. That text was put to me recently by counsel for Defence, and I was asked to say how I intended to follow up the recommendations of the meeting of 8 April 1994. I then said that the meeting with the bourgmestre would allow me to know exactly what was happening within the population, and to see if the measures that had been taken were actually applied within the population. That meeting is precisely within that framework. I have thought it out, and I've tried to refresh my memory, and I believe it is precisely in that context in which the message should be placed. 
Now, concerning your allegation to the effect that a civil-defence system was in place, I would like to point out to you that the situation that broke out on 6 April did not change positively so as to warrant a removal of those roadblocks. Worse still, it was impossible for us to carry out effective actions to abolish those roadblocks and organise them in a satisfactory manner. If you are referring to my statements here, then you feel that I express some regret for -- or, that not enough was done to rectify that situation. 
Now you are referring to an officer who is there. I do not recall the presence of that officer, but one thing is certain: This situation we faced was such that events happened in a -- in a rush. Please allow me time to give you the necessary facts so you can understand the situation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'm sorry to interrupt you. But in your -- the course of your evidence-in-chief, and at the beginning of my cross-examination on the issue of civil defence, you said that there was no civil-defence system in Kigali during April to July. Are you now saying that that's not right, that in fact there was a civil-defence system? Yes or no. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. No, and I do confirm that there was no civil-defence system. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, thank you for your explanation, we'll take it -- what we can from it. 
The next passage that I would like to refer you to is another passage that was put to you during the course of your evidence-in-chief, and it's from Prosecution Exhibit 56. It's under tab 10. It's a -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses. Before we move on. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This page 20 in French which you have just dealt with in P. 54, it's found where in the English version? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour. The passage I was reading from was the last two lines on page 13, and it goes over the page to the first four lines of page 14. And then the next two paragraphs are the introduction of the officer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the reference to the civil defence? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Is in the course of the speech by the officer, he isn't -- who introduces him, Esdras Mushimiyimana, the end of the first line in that paragraph and into the second line. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, in what he is quoted to say does not use "civil defence", but the other officer introducing that officer is using that term. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
And now P. 56. That's which tab? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's tab 10, Your Honours. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Firstly, Mr. Renzaho, for the French, it's on page 19, the second paragraph. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in the English, Your Honours, it commences on page 12, the third paragraph. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
While you're finding it, Mr. Renzaho, I'll refresh your memory with what it states there. It was read to you by your counsel, and you were asked questions by him and by Judge Møse about it. It was a passage where you had said: 
"It is therefore necessary that directives adopted in this regard are complied with. It is for this reason that we have decided to arrest all those who rape and want to commit criminal acts so as to punish them. For example, we punished about three people. It means that we have started to check whether these directives are complied with." 
Now, you recall that being put to you and you accepted that that is what you had said; correct, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, those are my words. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, bearing in mind the importance you place on putting something in context, can we look at the question which was asked of you? 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in the English it is in fact the first paragraph of page 12, Your Honours. And in the French, it's page 18, it's the last paragraph of page 18 going on to the first paragraph of page 19. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Or, rather, it's the penultimate paragraph on page 18. The question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You're right. Thank you, sir. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Whilst you're finding that, Mr. Renzaho, I'll -- I'll read out the first couple of lines of that question. The person interviewing you says: 
"Thank you. One other thing about which we would request you to remind listeners of Radio Rwanda is security at roadblocks. It is noticed that those entrusted with materiel, like firearms, are behaving irresponsibly at roadblocks." 
That's the part I would like, first of all, to ask you a question about, Mr. Renzaho. Would you agree with me that the interviewer describes firearms as materiel entrusted to those at roadblocks? Is that right? Yes or no. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is how it is written. But, Counsel, once more I would like to express reservations. That transcription is actually transcriptions of audio cassettes that were not given to me. And I do not intend to attribute things to people, but I've discovered a number of irregularities in some documents that have been presented to me. Notably, the famous cassette which talks of a conversation I had with the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, which is not even in my commune. I found the same trains in some documents that I have with me. So, please, I believe that the transcription, bearing in mind what somebody said could be found in there -- but I think it is my speech and it is true -- but in the present state of the transcriptions, I think. But that does not stop you from answering me questions, I would like to answer them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
I would like to record for the record, however, that on the 10th of January this year, full audio copies of all documents produced were provided to the Trial Chamber and to the Defence. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, if you look at the first paragraph of your answer, and in respect of that it is the final paragraph of page 18 in the French -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
-- and in the English, Your Honours, I'm looking at the second paragraph of page 12. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
The last line of your reply says this -- you've been talking about meetings with officials. You say: 
"Together they examined the issue of security for their cellule and deal with distribution and well thought out use of civil-defence materiel at their disposal." 
So, Mr. Renzaho, I'm suggesting to you that in your answer, which is in the paragraph prior to the one you accept being you, you are talking about distribution of civil-defence materiel. And bearing in mind the question that you are asked linking firearms as being materiel, I'm suggesting to you that you were talking about the distribution of firearms. What do you say to that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I am before the Chamber right here, and all through this trial I have not seen anybody who has actually testified that I gave them weapons at the préfecture. Those who have come to make allegations that we have explained thoroughly, what else do you want me to say? That I should invent that weapons were distributed at the préfecture? I was not alone at the préfecture. All what we did, we did with the intention of preserving the security of the population. And there were many of us -- at least those that were available at the préfecture. 
So I insist on what I have told you, and I have tried to explain to you what happened. I did not distribute weapons at the préfecture. Be that as it may, I tried to explain the complexity of that situation. Firearms were available within the population. I saw them. When I went to intervene at CELA, I saw arms. When I went to Kanombe, there were arms. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, I'm sorry to interrupt you -- I'm sorry to interrupt you again, but I've read a passage from what you have said, and I'm wanting to know whether you agree that you said it. You talked about civil-defence materiel being distributed, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
On what occasion? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho, now we read out a sentence to you, that was what Mr. Moses did. And the last few words in that sentence was "use of civil-defence materiel". Now, did you use that word? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I could use the word "civil defence" if such a system existed. If it is the reaction of the population in the face of danger, in the face of the RPF offensive, be it at the outlying areas, that is, with the entry of RPF troops into populous neighbourhoods, or its entry within the FAR military mechanism, can I stop people in that case from defending themselves? But the system as such, that included organisation, and that appeared in the directive of the prime minister on 25 May 1994 I know nothing about. There was no structure. The speech that I purportedly delivered in the presence of bourgmestres, in that message I insist on the fact that there was still a lot of confusion in their jurisdictions, and that they were not working hard enough to set up crisis committees in their areas of jurisdiction. That message was given out on 21 April. And you agree with me that 21 April was a well-advanced date with regard to the operations in Kigali. And so we are far from the situation that we want to place out of the population, because the war was within the population itself. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you did use the word "civil defence" in that speech? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do not recollect very well. If that is what it says, if it comes up with respect to organisation, how could I have used a concept that does not refer to anything? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, to further refresh your memory, Mr. Renzaho, can we look at the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the English on the same page, and in the French it is page 19, the first line of the third paragraph. And it says: "Actually" -- you said: "Actually, there are people who believe that the civil-defence materiel being distributed is their private property." 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, that is what I said. But I retort -- I give you back what I said a while ago. Are these words mine? Because I signed documents and handed them over, I signed communiqués that you can use. But the words that have been reproduced by a radio programme, now, check and see what happened. At any rate, I think it will be rather obscure for me, and I'm not claiming that there were no weapons within the population, since I saw those weapons. Now, the problem is, how did the weapons get there? Because the weapons were there at the roadblocks. Was it the préfecture that distributed those weapons? That is the question. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Mr. Renzaho, you will assist this Chamber better if you answer questions instead of asking questions and being evasive. They have asked you this question many times, you don't give us any definite answer. You go round and round and come back to the point, and end up asking us a question. So how do we know? You are the person in the position to answer the questions. You are the one to tell us whether those words were issued by you or not. Don't pose a question to the Chamber. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And, finally in respect of this transcript, Mr. Renzaho, can I refer you to a passage in the fifth paragraph of the same page on the English, starting with the words "Civil defence". And in the French it is in the middle of the fourth paragraph on page 19 of the French. And this is what you said, Mr. Renzaho: 
"Civil defence materiel belongs to members of the population, because it was provided by the state. It must serve the interests of members of the population equitably and appropriately." 
It's quite clear, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho, from your own mouth, that the state was providing civil-defence materiel to members of the population? That's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
If it is the state that gave out those -- the materiel, then point to the member of the government who gave out the materiel. Once more, I am telling you that this materiel -- well, I saw firearms within the population. I saw firearms at the roadblocks. I don't know the origin of these arms, and I tried to explain the phenomenon as it was. Had weapons been given to somebody? Because you needed structure for these weapons to be distributed. But I saw the arms, and the situation we were going through had a number of uncontrollable situations. There were deserting soldiers, gendarmes, and soldiers who came from all over the communes that had been overrun. 
At the time when that statement was made on 21 -- that is, the statement you claim I made, if that statement were made on the 18th or 19th, then they would have crossed the RPF lines and come into Kigali. All that crowd was in the city. How do you expect that weapons would not circulate within the population? The weapons were there. The problem, to my mind, is the use of such weapons. And I'm saying, "Please, don't start to create an unavoidable situation here." If weapons are to be used, they had to be used to protect the population. No more, no less. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'd now like to move on to another radio broadcast, another one which had been put to you during the course of your evidence-in-chief and which you did not disagree that it was you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's P. 61, Your Honours, under tab 15, from the 8th of June 1994, referring on the English page 5, second paragraph; and French it's on page 22, the fourth paragraph. If you could provide the French to Mr. Renzaho. And it's on page 22, the first line of the fourth paragraph in French. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Whilst you're finding it, Mr. Renzaho, I will read you what it says at the commencement of that paragraph. It says: "In continuation" -- you say: 
"In continuation, I will now address another subject, namely, the organisation of civil defence. As you know, our youths are currently fighting fiercely in their respective secteurs." 
Do you remember saying that, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I do recall, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. And two paragraphs further down in the English, it's the top of the fourth paragraph. And in the French it's on page 23, the second paragraph, this is what you say: 
"What I want, in the final analysis, is that civil defence, which has been in existence for some time now, should be organised." 
That's what you've said on the 8th of June, Mr. Renzaho, that civil defence had been in existence for some time. Correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, you actually say 8 June. It is correct on 8 June we received directives from the prime minister. On 25 September (sic) he said a team of officers was appointed to take care of recruitment training of soldiers that was -- were required by the army, and they were used in the city on various fronts. And that is what it is all about. And I do confirm to you that I actually said that. And I -- I gave a quotation on the attack that they carried out in Gisozi on Mount Mburabuturo, and other fronts, notably behind the Saint Antoine school. These people were used by the army, they were trained by the army. So I don't see any civil-defence structure as such, as existed in other préfectures. I don't see those structures existed in Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Both in French and English we heard you say the 25th of September, but you meant, of course, the 25th of May as the directive of the prime minister. Can you just confirm that with a yes? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Mr. President. I do apologise. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then there was a location called Gisozi. Can you spell that to us? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Mr. President. Gisozi, G-I-S-O-Z-I. Gisozi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Is this directive the one that you told the Trial Chamber on Thursday or Friday that you didn't receive until after you'd left Rwanda, or had never seen before? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Precisely. I saw that directive out of the country. And I would like to tell you again that the team of officers that came, came from the army staff command that was sent to the préfecture. That team did not receive directives from me, they received a mission from the army and they executed that mission. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
But it's you talking about it, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho, on the 8th of June, saying that civil defence had been in existence for some time now. That's not consistent at all, is it, with your claim that civil defence didn't exist? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I have -- may have been blind, maybe, or I was not in Kigali, then I'm talking to you about things I don't know about. But, concretely, that civil defence did not exist in Kigali as such. I may also use this opportunity to say that the rules of engagement, within the framework of the accord that was in force as of 6 April, provided that the Rwandan armed forces, in order to bow the way to the advance of the RPF troops, came in late. They even came and set up their positions in the peripheries of populous neighbourhoods. And it is that complexity that made it such that cohabitation between the soldiers and the population created problems -- all the more so as this was seen in the setting up of irregular roadblocks. 
And the officers that you mentioned were sent to address the various issues with the local authorities. That is why I presented that officer there, because I presented the issue to the officials, saying that the anarchy had to be addressed, and then the officer was going to report to his bosses who had sent him. He did not even stop at the préfecture. That is the enlightenment I wanted to make. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did civil defence, in real life, exist in Kigali from a certain point in time? Or did it never exist? Was it really implemented from a certain date? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I would like to be candid with you, Mr. President. Civil defence, to be implemented, needed a legal framework, instructions from the government. And those instructions came with the directive of the prime minister that asked for structures, because structures no longer existed in Kigali, because the people who fled -- the people who could be part of the organs, for instance, the civil defence committees. I don't see them. So we had a situation where people were taken unawares. We tried to reorganise the population in their homes by instilling order. But because of the intensification of the fighting, we did not succeed. And the statements that have been mentioned actually illustrate the situation very well, because I sought to know from the bourgmestres what the situation was, what we could do to further improve the situation. But that is a situation we had until the end, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, the legal framework came on the 25th of May, not before; is that the evidence? With other words, civil defence was implemented with effect from the 25th of May; is that the evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, all over the country, yes, that is how it went. But in my area, I had no real basis to organise such a thing. All the more so as the army was rather interested in persons who would go to reinforce the staff training that was completely eroded. That is it, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So a civil-defence system was implemented on a general basis from the 25th of May, but not in Kigali. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In Kigali, we maintained -- or, tried to organise the situation in the anarchy that we knew from the beginning. But we did not succeed in setting up the proper structures as provided for in civil defence. That is what I meant. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you started to organise the situation in the anarchy, with other words, you started to set up a civil-defence system in Kigali from the 25th of May onwards, but did not succeed. That's how I interpret your answer. Is that a correct interpretation? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, the organisation undertook to eradicate anarchy began with our first meeting with the communal authorities on the 8th, and after that date we tried to make some order, prevent excesses in the neighbourhood and on the roadblocks. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when you say the 8th, you mean the 8th of which month? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The 8th of April, the date of my first meeting with the communal authorities. The 8th of April 1994, in a meeting I held with the communal representatives and the members of the urban council. So we were consistently trying to establish order, but the various shifts and movements in the town, the combat, did not make it possible to improve the situation significantly. Every time there was a new reversal, that brought to nought our efforts to re-establish order and safety. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But these attempts, with effect from the 8th of April, did they include civil defence attempts? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, I must again state here, in various neighbourhoods, we had people who had established roadblocks, and those roadblocks we tried to get to the bottom of them, the origin. They were anarchical and caused much disorder. And that's what we applied ourselves to. And there were gangs who attacked in various neighbourhoods, also, to kill, to steal. That was the situation we tried to handle, confront. So it was a situation of excesses that we had to bring under the control of the local authorities, but we did not succeed in doing so. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, can we now have the answer to the question. Did civil defence exist in Kigali, or not, during the events? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Your Honour, madam, I want to tell you that civil defence, as prescribed by the prime minister, did not exist in Kigali. After the -- the outbreak of hostilities of the night -- in the night of the 6th to the 7th, and with the ensuing unfolding of events, it -- it was the logic in which we were imprisoned. Elsewhere there wasn't war. The war came elsewhere later, and they had the time to apply the instructions of the prime minister. But in Kigali everything went up on the same day, it exploded in the same day. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But, if it didn't exist, how can you then, on the 8th of June, say that the civil defence which has been in existence for some time should be organised? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The situation I've tried to describe, I've described to the best of my abilities. But I don't know whether it merits the term "civil defence". Because organised by who, and along -- according to what model? That is the problem I have with my understanding. However, it's true that they had set up roadblocks in various neighbourhoods. The roadblocks existed, and people manned them in turn. All the witnesses who have come here to testify have said so. But what -- in what structure? In the framework of what structure? Who were the authorities? Was it authorities who'd consulted each other and decided to proceed by A, B, C, D? No, I cannot answer clearly that question, which would have been a proper -- the installation of a proper system. But such a system did not exist -- such a structure did not exist. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
We'll move on, Mr. Renzaho, to another transcript that you were shown. It's P. 61 -- I'm sorry, we'll move on to P. 62, if we can. 
@MR. MOSES:
That's tab 16, for the 18th of June. English, page 3, and third -- the second or third paragraph, Your Honours. It commences "We have therefore asked". And in the French it is page 26, third paragraph going on to page 27, first paragraph. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
I'll read you the sentence I want to focus on, Mr. Renzaho, and ask you questions about it. You said on that occasion: 
"We have therefore asked those in charge of civil defence in the cellules and in the secteurs to issue permits for movement, because these are people who come to see us in order to obtain fuel for use in those vehicles." 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, first question is that it's clear, isn't it, that there are people in charge of civil defence in the cellules and in the secteurs? Correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In the words you've referred to, I spoke of the establishment of crisis committees to manage the situation in the various secteurs. If that's what you're referring to, yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, we can see -- we'll be able to see at a later point what is actually written there, Mr. Renzaho. 
But the other important factor is, Mr. Renzaho, is the fact that these people who were involved in civil defence were coming to see you to get fuel, weren't they? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I was at the préfecture with other people. If the people -- if people tell you that the préfecture had a stock of fuel, you probably would accuse me of being a liar. I have explained all the problems in relation to fuel. We had the possibility of obtaining a bit of fuel from the army, because everything that remained had been requisitioned by the army. I had no stock of fuel, Mr. Prosecutor. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Well, I'd also now like you to -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What -- what did you mean by that, "We had the possibility of obtaining a bit of fuel from the army"? What did you mean by that sentence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, I should like to tell you that it was possible for me to send my vehicle to go and obtain fuel from the army. That's what I mean. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Only for préfectoral purposes, or for people who came to ask for fuel at the préfecture? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. President, I think we have to try and put ourselves in that place at that time. Not only did the war block all borders with our neighbouring -- neighbouring countries, but immediately led to the conquering of all strategic fuel stocks of the country. I don't think it would be realistic to imagine that a government department, whoever it was, could have accepted to distribute fuel to anyone who wanted to go about their business. I don't know anything about that, and I don't see the possibility there was no fuel in Kigali, nor was there any fuel supplies, nor was there any drinks. That is what I can tell you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
The préfecture was providing fuel, wasn't it, not only to the civil defence people, but to préfectoral vehicles, and also, can I suggest, too, vehicles from other government departments who were not préfectoral vehicles, such as ORINFOR -- O-R-I-N-F-O-R; that's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I know of no such case. Please, Mr. Prosecutor, I never dealt with any such case. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'd ask you then to be shown, please, Prosecution Exhibit 34. It's in tab 30 of volume 1. 
And just to put on the record, this is a letter dated the 1st of May 1994, addressed to Mr. Jean Baptiste Butera, signed by you, in which you remove him from his responsibilities of being the liaison officer with the ministry of defence. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And for Your Honours' purpose, I'm looking at the final paragraph. 
That's 44. I'm sorry, I thought I had said P. 34, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said P. 34, and it is P. 34. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Tab 30. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, do you recognise this letter, Mr. Renzaho? It's got your signature on it on the second page. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The microphone, please. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, quite. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, in the final paragraph of the first page, you cite examples of -- and the reasons why you are removing Mr. Butera from his position of liaison officer with the ministry of defence. And you state that: 
"Today," that's referring to the 1st of May "for example, you'd refused to provide petrol to the vehicles of hygiene and of ORINFOR". And as justification, you -- Mr. Butera had said he was not the dog of the préfet. 
You remember that letter, don't you, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It's signed by myself, yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mmm. Well, Mr. Renzaho, that's an example, isn't it, of the préfecture providing fuel for ORINFOR. That wasn't a préfectoral vehicle, it was an ORINFOR vehicle, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I think we can't really indulge in a game of denial or acknowledgement. I am, in general terms, a responsible man, and I will say to you that, as stated, it was the army that had held the fuel, and this letter does not say the opposite. It is possible that official vehicles might come to the préfecture on duty and ask for some fuel. He, as liaison officer, should go to see if there is any fuel at the army to serve the vehicles, to supply the vehicle. But when you tell me that perhaps I supplied fuel to people coming from anywhere, I don't know where, well, you'll understand that the situation was difficult. If it's difficult to provide a government vehicle with fuel, I don't see how one could be generously, or with largesse, supplying fuel to other vehicles. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that answer, Mr. Renzaho. I would now ask you if could be shown and look at -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I understand that there is no translation of P. 34. 
Could you read, Mr. Renzaho, the last paragraph, (French spoken), into the record, so that we just have the English translation. I think we should read it in context. Can you help us, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Oui, Monsieur le Président. 
"For example, you're not authorised to refuse to provide fuel -- you're not allowed to refuse fuel to official vehicles on official duty under the pretext that you will supply them when appropriate. Today, for example, you refused fuel to public hygiene or sanitation and ORINFOR vehicles on duty. As a justification, you said you were not the préfet's dog. That is why the functions you -- ascribed to you as liaison officer are withdrawn and you will be replaced by Mr. Utazirubanda, Apollinaire. I would ask you consequently to hand over -- to hand back all instruments provided to you for the work that you had -- with which you were tasked." 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. Now that surname is spelt U-T-A-Z-I-R-U-B-A-N-D-A. Apollinaire. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, do you want us to do the whole letter? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there anything else we need to read from this letter, according to the parties? Not at this stage, all right. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
It's quite clear from the letter, however, Mr. Renzaho, that it was Mr. Butera who was providing the fuel. That's what you say: "You refused to provide fuel". 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I think it is quite clear, Mr. Prosecutor, that Mr. Butera was the liaison officer. He refused to drive the vehicle to the army to ask for fuel. He didn't have any stock. He was a liaison officer. If he had stock, he couldn't have refused it. But there would be no point in pointing out that he was the liaison officer with those who did hold the fuel stocks. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Just to round off the issue of civil defence, Mr. Renzaho, I'm wondering if you could please look at the document you wrote in Congo-Brazzaville in 1997, headed up "Testimony on the bloody tragedy of the people of Kigali from 6 April 1994". 
@MR. MOSES: 
It is one of the documents, Your Honours, that was provided at the commencement of the cross-examination, and it was shown to the Accused early on, and he accepted that he had. 
And for Your Honours, I'm going to focus on page 13 of the English under the heading "Distribution of weapons to civilians". 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And, Mr. Renzaho, if you could please turn to page 22 of the French document. Page 22, under the heading (French spoken). Do you have it in front of you, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Oui, Monsieur le Procureur. 
@MR. MOSES: 
This is what you said in 1997: 
"The national defence, which was fighting a widespread war, implemented a structured and organised civil-defence programme for the mobilisation of youth volunteers and their rapid training to prepare them for secteur-based operations. Recruits were -- who were enrolled could have weapons. Apart from this, I cannot imagine where a préfet could have weapons. An officer was placed in every préfecture. For this purpose, he collaborated directly in military operations. Civil defence is a practical system, even in other countries. In the case of Rwanda, it seemed to respond to a reality regarding which, following the Arusha peace accord, the government resolutely began a peace process by demobilising and not enlisting new recruits." 
That's what you wrote in 1997, correct, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you'll agree, therefore, that a structured and organised civil-defence programme was implemented. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
This paragraph refers to the prime minister's instructions of the 25th of May 1994. And it matches what I said at the time in 1994. An officer and a team were appointed, and he went to the general staff. But without the knowledge of the préfecture, he recruited young people who served in the Rwandan armed forces on various fronts. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You'll agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that in 1997 you certainly didn't indicate that civil defence was not implemented in your own préfecture, did you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I don't see how I could tackle the question directly, except that I said an officer was appointed for Kigali town, and what he did I've spoken of here on several times. He did proceed with recruitment and training of young people who then went to serve in the ranks of the army, the army who clothed and supplied and fed them. I really can't say much more. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, if we look at what Mr. Kambanda said about civil defence in Kigali, I would like your comments. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And I'm going to refer Your Honours to -- it's side B, K0154885, line 5 downwards. And in the French it's on page 24, line 9 onwards. 
I don't know if the registry can assist. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is another of the documents you distributed at the beginning. It's in the same folder. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, since this goes back to the use of this document, and in fact the use of this statement, the interviews of Mr. Kambanda by the Prosecutor, this document should have been disclosed to us before. But there were -- there were -- he did so only after (sic) the cross-examination. The OTP had this document, and I would have loved to have disclosure of it in a timely manner so as to prepare for it, and not to be -- to be confronted at the cross-examination without having to prepare -- to present it to Mr. Renzaho. That is the objection I'm making to the use of this document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I note that there is a difference between the English and French version of what Maître Cantier just said. I will now repeat the sentence in French as he formulated it: "It was only after (sic) the cross-examination." (French spoken). 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Oh, "before". Thank you, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
"It was only before the cross-examination". 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Comments? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Standard practice, Your Honour. Nothing's been requested of the Defence -- by the Defence prior to -- to that. And I'm actually checking, because I'm certainly aware some of the Kambanda tapes were disclosed at the end of last year, I believe. But, in any event, it doesn't prevent the Prosecutor from using such documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your objection goes on record, but we have to overrule it. It is true that it is allowed to put documents to a witness and disclose it in connection with the commencement of cross-examination. That has been the practice for many years in this Tribunal. This said, it's often suggested that some documents be distributed a bit earlier, but if that could jeopardise the purpose of cross-examination, it is not required. 
So what, now, is the question? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, in that passage there -- and I'll avoid reading the entire passage on to the record -- he says that you were there for civil defence, just as the soldiers were there to fight the war, and he was asked about the activities of the civil defence. And he said: "In reality, they carried out the massacres." 
And it goes on down there, and you can see what he was asked about, and Mr. Kambanda said -- or, was asked:
"Okay, when you say Renzaho controlled the town..." Kambanda says, "He was in charge of the civil defence, and knowing what the civil defence did at the time, it can be said that Renzaho carried out the massacres. But we can't simply say 'Renzaho massacres'." 
Do you agree with the prime minister that you were in charge, in fact, with civil defence, and it was the civil-defence programme that carried out the massacres in Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I regret to disappoint you; I do not agree with what the prime minister says. And I would like to say that the example of the prime minister that you are using is not appropriate. First, that person is from the opposition. That created a lot of problems in Kigali. Two, I did not live with the prime minister to make an observation or an authority. I saw him on the 11th at a meeting, that is what I said, and immediately the government moved to Gitarama. And then I saw him again briefly for 30 minutes when he stopped at the préfecture in May. So, tell me, how can he make me the centre of civil defence? He was the one who signed the directives that came out. Did I attend the government meeting that prepared the draft for the prime minister's signature? Sincerely, I think that this man pleaded guilty. He is your witness, and I think it is my right to claim that that person should come here before the Chamber and say so, so I will give -- have the opportunity to ask him questions, thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just one point of clarification: You say that the prime minister was a member of the opposition. I didn't think you were a member of any party, Mr. Renzaho. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not belong to any party, and I regret that all through the multiparty politics period I did not know that man. I did not see him. I dealt with the serving prime minister. I saw him when he was appointed after the death of the president. And if you place him in the same category as Gasana with the documents that are presented to me here, I would say the same thing. These are people who had their own ways of doing things and seeing things. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I put to you, finally on this topic, Mr. Renzaho, the reason you are so anxious to disavow any involvement or knowledge with civil defence is because you know very well that civil defence was another name for carrying out the killings, and you were in charge of it in Kigali. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I've explained to you in what way I was involved in the tragic events of Kigali. If you have been following me from the 6th, then you would know on a minute-by-minute basis how I was dragged into the Kigali events. Now, tell me sincerely, if knowing a situation that was going to happen involving the civil defence, I would have accepted to live in times of torment in the face of an overwhelming and a terrible situation where nobody could do anything? Because I was there on the ground and I was a victim of the situation myself. So you think I would have created a situation in which I would be humiliated? So it is difficult to answer that, Counsel. I thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Moving on to a new topic, that of rape. Do you agree, Mr. Renzaho, that as early as mid-April 1994, you were getting reports of women being raped in Kigali. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I received information on what was happening during a meeting with the bourgmestres, notably, that of Nyarugenge, who was generally there with his conseiller. So I received the information. I received information, but in my capacity I would have preferred that people be brought to me so I could punish them. That is what of interest -- is what of interest to me. So what could have happened anywhere? I mean, in what sense? What was the evidence? That is the problem. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when was that meeting? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I just realised that there was a meeting that happened on the 21st, and I do not recall all the meetings that happened. But 21st April. That is it. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And we've heard evidence, haven't we, from a number of Prosecution witnesses that you were given regular reports about individual persons who had been -- Tutsi women who had been raped? Do you agree with that or not? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, when somebody comes -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho -- 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am not -- I do not agree. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do not agree with that proposition, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And your advice on the radio -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
I won't -- at this stage I won't put it -- the transcript to Mr. Renzaho to try and save some time, Your Honour. But at P. 54 under tab 8, page 15 of the English, third paragraph at -- commencing "These people who come to rape children and women". And in French it's page 22, I believe the third paragraph. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you recall saying this, Mr. Renzaho, on the radio: 
"These people who come to rape children and women in the quarters must absolutely be thrown out. Chase them away. Besides, in times like these, do not bother yourself with too many questions. We are saying that you should shoot those who want to interfere with the security of the people. Anyone with a gun should shoot. That is it." 
Do you accept that you said that?

@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I did not know. I cannot recall it. So it is not really very correct. It is possible 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Where would you be asking that the rapists be chased away to, Mr. Renzaho? Next door? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Please, I did not quite understand your question. I did not understand your question, sir. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In the passage that I read out to you, you had indicated that those who were raping should be chased away, and my question for you was, where you thought that the rapists should be chased away to? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I believe that our concern in the situation we experienced had to do with the neutralisation of all these persons who were committing crimes within the population. That is the idea we had, and that is what I remember of that statement. 
Now, where to chase them to? They had to be arrested and brought before the courts, but the courts were not working. And in the various neighbourhoods the local authorities could seek assistance from the military authorities that were there. Now, chase them out to send them where? That is the problem I put to you. Where would they have been sent to? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No one was arrested for rape under your watch as préfet of Kigali between April and July 1994, were they? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I regret to say that nobody was brought before me on charges of rape and then I let them free or tolerated them. The préfet is not able -- is not a conseiller, is not a chef de cellule, he is not all of that. So I think we should face the reality of things. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The reality of things, Mr. Renzaho, was that your whole approach was consistent with that attributed to you by Prosecution Witness AWO, who said that you had told and spoken to Hutu men and called Tutsi women "food". That's consistent with the approach that you took during that period, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I never used that word ever since I came out of my mother's womb; and I do confirm that to you. 
And regarding that incident that you mentioned of Calcutta, I gave explanations that I consider satisfactory. First, I was not there. Then, if you are talking about the 10th or the 11th or even the 12th, I was not at the orphanage of the sisters of charity of Calcutta. I don't even know where the orphanage was found. And to use that as a hammer and to strike on my head, not knowing whether my head would stay, please, I don't know, because the charge is baseless. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, moving onto a new topic and your movements in the first two or three days of the genocide. According to you, there had been a state of war from October 1990 up until and including the 6th of April, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Sorry, I may not have been attentive, I did not get that question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
According to you, the country was in a state of war from October 1990 up until the 6th of April, at least, and then continuing; but I am focussing on the 6th of April. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
Now, according to your testimony, you had been living in your house for almost two years. According to the Prosecution evidence, you had been there for almost one year, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It is not correct. It is not correct. I had been living there since May 1992. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's almost two years, according to you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You were the most senior communal official, préfectoral official in the capital, correct, for all that time? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am sorry, Counsel, I don't understand the question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You were préfet during all that period, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
It's simply nonsense for you to suggest that you were unable to contact anyone after you left your office from your house for almost two years in a period of war, because you didn't have your phone connected. That's nonsense, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Call it what you like, you have the right to. But the circumstances that I describe here are very clear. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And on the morning -- well, I am suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that you had a telephone that was in good working order. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It wasn't in good working order. That is what I said, and others have said so too. 
@MR. MOSES: 
On the morning of the 7th, as I understand your testimony, you fortunately were -- decided to dress in military uniform, then fortunately found out about a meeting of senior military officers that you decided to attend, and that by the end of that meeting, which you had to ask permission to join, you were placed on the crisis committee. That's a summary of what you said in evidence in chief, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I believe that should be it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the meeting at ESM started around 10:15, didn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I believe that is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that would have provided you with ample time to collect weapons at around 10 o'clock from Hôtel des Diplomates and go to the préfectoral office and to ESM, because they were all very close to one another, weren't they? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I believe what you allege there is not correct. And I have stated the time at which I got to the préfecture office and the persons with whom I conversed. And all those persons are not dead. I believe they are alive; I mean, persons who know and have it precisely, and they can be contacted. Therefore, it is not correct. I could have not gone simultaneously to look for weapons at the Hôtel des Diplomats. And, please, the weapons at the Hôtel des Diplomats, according to the witness who mentioned it, were handed out at 11 a.m., not before ten minutes past ten. So I remember what he said. I think what you say is not correct, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The record will speak for itself on that issue. 
At ESM the meeting you attended, were you told about the murder of the prime minister? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I believe that if I listened carefully the issue was raised at about 11 a.m., and it happened when the explosions were going off in Camp Kigali concerning the incident with the Blue Berets. The camp commander got into the meeting hall and narrated what was happening at Camp Kigali, saying that he had tried to cope with the situation but the riot had grown out of hand and he could not cope with it. It was on that occasion that the issue was raised. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was the camp commander? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
He was Colonel Nubaha, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And he narrated orally to all participants what was happening in Camp Kigali with the soldiers there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
No, when he entered the hall he addressed the rostrum. Since the hall was kind of small, we could hear what he was saying. He spoke to those on the rostrum. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Who was on the rostrum, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I saw General Ndindiliyimana, Colonel Bagosora and General Dallaire. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And were you also made aware of the murders that were taking place of the other members of the government? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, later on. Yes, at a meeting of the crisis committee in the evening of 7 April 1994. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And you say you were also aware that ten Belgian soldiers were being killed just 2- or 300 metres from where you were having the meeting; is that correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, I didn't measure, but it could have been something like that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, my question is, you were told of what was going on a short distance from where the meeting took place? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
When the camp commander came in and briefed the officials of the meeting, yes. But, before, we had heard explosions but we did not know what they were, and I remember the attitude of some officers who were saying that maybe we have been ambushed, so we should get out quickly from this ambush. But we didn't know what it was all about. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now, in the afternoon of the 8th of April, did you go home before nightfall? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that was after you had done a tour of the roadblocks between two and three in the afternoon, as Witness AFB has said; isn't that correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is very incorrect, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Let's move on to CELA, if we can. You will agree with me that you were present at CELA for two hours? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, yes. From 9:00 to about 11 a.m. I don't know if I left at exactly 11 a.m. or a few minutes to 11, but that is correct, I was there within that period. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you accept, as was said by Witness UI, he met you outside the gate and in fact handed over to you a list of the names of those who had taken refuge at CELA? Do you remember that happening? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
You are speaking of Witness U? I don't know. Maybe it is even UI you are talking about. No, I did not see him. I did not speak to him, no. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You see, according to the Prosecution witnesses, persons were put to one side under the excuse that they were accomplices and then they were taken away and killed. You will agree that's a summary of what a number of Prosecution witnesses have said? Whether you agree with them or not, that's a short version of what they allege. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And according to you, there was no sorting out of infiltrators? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not take part in any such scene, Counsel. I did not witness any such event. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You didn't ask anyone who was there to sort out infiltrators? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. That was not my mission, no. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Because you will agree with me, if you had, that would be consistent with the account that the Prosecution witnesses have given, namely, that you did and were involved in getting others there to sort people out? You will agree with me that that would be consistent? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am not in the habit of making assumptions. I was speaking of concrete things that happened to me. Things did not happen that way. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay. Did Commander Nyamuhimba go with you to CELA on the 22nd of April? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do not know. I explained the circumstances under which I intervened and the way I did that. I did not take time to identify the persons who were with me. I don't know. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. We have heard your explanation in the course of your evidence in chief. I would like to refresh your memory with what you said in your statement that you made in 1997. And so, if you could, please look at, in the French, it's on page 20, the final two paragraphs.
@MR. MOSES:
And in English, Your Honour, the description starts at the bottom two -- it's the last two paragraphs of page 11, but I am going to be focussing on, particularly, the first two paragraphs of page 12. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, Mr. Renzaho, I would like to read to you a sentence which commences -- it's the last sentence on the bottom of page 11, Your Honours:
"I called Lieutenant Colonel Munyakazi again, telling him to perform his duty and that I would immediately go there with the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, Jean Baptiste Bizimana, the chief of police, Major Nyamuhimba, and a few other civil servants. At the scene, the situation was very tense. Lieutenant Munyakazi did not come to the place."
This is the next bit which I would like to read and ask some comments on: 
"With so much difficulty, I was able to establish dialogue with the attackers who agreed to allow the gendarmerie to check whether there were infiltrators among the refugees." 
Do you see that Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, did you, in fact, have the gendarmerie check whether there were infiltrators among the refugees? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I think the situation is very, very clear. It was necessary to take back to the hands of the authorities a situation that had gotten out of hand. And when questioned about this, I said that in discussing with the representatives of the group for what reason they'd taken those people at the CELA, and they said of killers in hiding who had killed three of their people. So, the thing was, now that the authorities were handling the matter, the crowd should go home, the citizenry should return to their homes. And that's what I managed to obtain. 
@MR. MOSES: 
But, Mr. Renzaho, here it says that you were able to establish dialogue with the attackers who agreed to allow the gendarmerie to check whether there were infiltrators amongst the refugees. It's not what you told us in the course of your evidence in chief, is it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It is exactly what I said, because when we discussed, in an aside, in the presence of the man leading the gendarmerie -- the officer leading, I asked those people who had attacked the CELA site what was the point of their incursion, and they said that people among them had been killed there. And I said, well, can we agree that those who were killed doing the task we've undertaken can end, as of the moment the people with authority take matters back in hand, return to your homes and we will handle the matter. And that is what they accepted. I think that's what I said. Perhaps if I didn't -- if I didn't say so, it would have been a mistake, but I am sure that's what I said. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, did the gendarmerie then check for infiltrators, is that what you are saying? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Not at all. After having sent the attackers home, I invited the citizenry to go with the gendarmes' escort -- the people to go to Sainte Famille escorted by the gendarmerie. That's what I did, and then I left. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There were some names in what you read out, Mr. Moses. It was Jean Baptiste Bizimana and Major Nyamuhimba, and that was all in the enumeration. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why should you mention in 1997 that there were a check of infiltrators if there was none? Why did you write this? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Mr. President, I have reflected exactly what happened when I came to that site and managed to establish dialogue with the attackers. They told me that some of them had been killed nearby, and consequently, among the crowd there must be people with arms who were firing at them. That was what they were claiming. And to solve matters I said, "Well, okay, now we are here, we represent authority -- public authority -- the state, you have finished what was your duty to do in bringing the matter to our attention, you may now go home." And I told the officer there to bring -- you could see them within the crowd. The leaders told them that they would move with the gendarme escort to Saint Paul-Sainte Famille. The first ones began to leave before my eyes, and then I turned on my heels and left.
@MR. MOSES:
I am sorry, Your Honour, I don't know that that answers Your Honour's questions. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Why did you write about the fact that you'd negotiated with the attackers who agreed to allow the gendarmerie to check to see if there were infiltrators? Why did you write that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Because that is the truth. That's what happened. That was their claim. That was how they would justify their aggression; that there were people among them who were firing at them. So I had to answer that specific point. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, then, there was a check, then? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
My main purpose was to get the attackers to leave. That was the immediate purpose. On that pretext or another pretext, they were the threat, and so I sought -- I mean, to get them to disperse, to go home. I told them, "We are taking matters in hand, you can go home". That was the point. And they did; they then went home. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You see, what you describe there is, in fact, you will agree, consistent with what Prosecution witnesses say happened; namely, that people were separated on the basis that they were suspected infiltrators and taken off to be killed. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I think the situation is quite the contrary to your theory. According to the witnesses, the witnesses said that an attack organised by the councillor, and Abbé Munyeshyaka, Mukandituye, et cetera, et cetera, with my cooperation; the attack was led by me, that I arrived at the CELA at the head of these people who were attacking the refugees, and I would then have proceeded to select a number of people, separated them, put them in the inside courtyard, make them kneel down, and everything that they said. I have tried to narrate the circumstances under which I intervened. And what I did is what I am telling you here. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you didn't know any of those persons at CELA, is that your evidence? Any of the refugees? You didn't see anyone you knew? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I didn't know anyone. Maybe if I had had the time to spend some time with the refugees, I might have identified a few people, but I didn't have the time; I didn't have the opportunity. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And, so, a number of our -- the Prosecution witnesses who mentioned the fact that you spoke to Mr. Mugiraneza, M-U-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A, is just a lucky guess from their point of view that it's someone who you admitted, in fact, knowing in the course of your evidence in chief? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I think I have been questioned on this matter under examination-in-chief; my memory hasn't quite abandoned me. And I answered it, that Mugiraneza, if that is the person who worked at the ministry of foreign affairs, whom I knew very well, whom I would visit at his office. I'd never seen him at home at his residence, but I knew him well. Because in the past he had studied for a while at the school where I followed him, and we would sometimes walk together because we came from the same home area. So that person, I knew him.
But, now, on the matter of the 22nd of April 1994, in full awareness I tell you that I did not see that person. As I came, I left. I did not have a conversation with any of the refugees, apart from communicating to them the decision taken. I don't know. I heard it here for the first time. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, you were aware of the allegation against you, as early as 1997, weren't you, Mr. Renzaho, because you were writing this document as somewhat of a self-serving description of the events that took place in Kigali between April and July? You have been aware of the allegation of your involvement at CELA for ten years, haven't you? At least ten years? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct, and I have read many books, much literature on Rwanda's dramatic situation. I have read reports put together by various NGOs. I have read all that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The truth of the matter, Mr. Renzaho, is that you were there on the morning of the 22nd of April with communal police, gendarmerie, communal officials and other members of the population, and that you did have the refugees selected on suspicion of infiltration as a ruse to have them taken away to be killed. That's the truth, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I think you err. You are in error. If you persist in thinking so, it is further error. Quite simply, remember the circumstances under which I intervened. It was in Nyarugenge commune, and Nyarugenge had its bourgmestre; and he himself in his testimony, to show the importance he attached to it because he did want to stress that he was the first to come there. But, unfortunately, that's not true. 
However, let us remember that it was in a commune where the bourgmestre should intervene, and the bourgmestre did come there. That is a fact. 
Now, tell me, in what cases a préfet is to play the role of turtle, bringing a bourgmestre on his back to come to a commune? It is completely topsy-turvy. That's why I had to go there, and I have explained why, and I really don't think I should say any more. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I am now moving on to Saint Paul's. Shall I commence? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a long sequence? 
@MR. MOSES: 
We are making a lot better progress today I am pleased to advise the Trial Chamber. It's -- it will take a wee bit of time, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will have the 11 o'clock break now, then. The Court is adjourned. We will resume at 11:20

Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, you heard Witnesses ALG and BUO both say that you were at the gates of the Saint Paul centre on the morning of the 14th of June. You heard them both say that, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I don't remember hearing ALG saying or BUO saying that I was at the gate of Saint Paul. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, you don't remember ALG saying that he had a conversation with you and you'd just returned via Gitarama, and you had advised him that his wife had just had a baby? Do you remember that testimony now? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, I remember. But it wasn't -- that wasn't the way he said it. He said I was coming from behind, and I wasn't yet -- I was behind him in a car and he heard my car and he stopped, and that's when we allegedly spoke together, at least that's what I heard, but not at the gates of Saint Paul's, no. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Your evidence and your evidence in chief was, however, that you didn't return to Kigali until the evening of the 15th of April. Is that -- that's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Quite correct, Mr. Prosecutor; that's absolutely correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what time did you get back, according to you, to Kigali? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
In the evening of the 15th, and I remember very well. We didn't even have any more electricity in Kigali, so it was dark. People did as they could to have a bit of light, so it was in the evening of the 15th. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And what day did you depart from Cyangugu, the same day? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Not at all. It -- just a bit before; it took about three-four hours (sic). 
@MR. MOSES: 
Just so I am clear, it took you three or four hours from Cyangugu to Kigali; correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Perhaps, I did not express myself correctly or I was misunderstood. I said the trip to and from Cyangugu took three or four days. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'll ask: When was it that you left Cyangugu? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I think I left Cyangugu on the 14th, and I have the impression I took the Zaire-nil divide road and I entered via Gisenyi. I came down from Gisenyi through Gitarama. That's how I entered the town. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just for the record, so that it shall not be argued that the witness contradicted himself. He did say in his first response, "three to four days". 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So what time in the morning did you leave Cyangugu on the 14th, according to you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Really, I don't recall quite completely, but generally when I travelled I left early, so that would be between eight and nine. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, according to you, you were with your family on the morning of the 14th of June in Cyangugu between eight and nine; is that right?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It's possible. It's possible. I left in the morning. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You will agree that there has been no notice of alibi filed in respect of this incident has there, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The incident at Saint Paul, the incident of the 14th of June, I think I even mentioned a UN report. There was an intelligence officer who made an enquiry into what happened at Sainte Famille and Saint Paul concerning that incident. And I saw two things in that report; first of all, he stated that he called a meeting as to continuing the movement -- the transfer of refugees to the RPF zone. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a problem of communication. The question is simply whether you would agree that, in the present case, there has not been, procedurally, any notice of alibi by the Defence in relation to this incident. Do you have any comment on that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I am just speaking in my defence. I am not a legal expert. I don't know. Maybe we can give that alibi. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
According to you, you were with your wife and children in Cyangugu on the morning of the 14th of June; is that right? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I left Cyangugu in the morning following the Zaire-nil divide up to Gisenyi, and from Gisenyi I went to Kigali. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, you know very well that's not the question I asked you. The question was, were you with your wife and children on the morning of the 14th of April in Cyangugu -- 14th of June, I am sorry?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That is correct. I told them goodbye that morning. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We need help with your itinerary. You said, "I left Cyangugu in the morning," and then you followed a particular road or itinerary up to Gisenyi. Can you repeat that answer? We don't have it in the two languages. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
I said that I left Cyangugu for Kibuye. I took the Kimonyo (phonetic) hill for Gisenyi, and then from Gisenyi the next year (sic) I left for Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That word; we need help with that word. 
"I took the..." What did you take? Can you spell it, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
The Cyangugu-Kibuye road, and then from Kibuye I took the Congo-nil hill, that is, the road that leads directly to Gisenyi. And from Gisenyi the next day I went to Kigali, Congo-nil, crête de Congo-nil. So it is spelt. Congo, then a dash and nil, N-I-L; that is, it's a slope, kind of. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the word crête also comes in there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Should I spell crête, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We just want the record clear. We now have Congo-nil thanks to your spelling. But in a previous version, I also heard the French word crête. Now, if you used it, please help us so that we get all three elements of that name so that we can move on. Will you help us, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President. It is spelt, crête-Congo-nil: So C-R-E with a small cap over E, then T-E. Congo-nil. It is the line, the upper slope.

You will agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that you are the only person that has testified in the course of your defence to you being present in Cyangugu on the 14th -- morning of the 14th of June? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
What I am telling you here is the truth. My family was in Cyangugu on that date, and I have explained the meeting at which my representatives in the committee to organise the repatriation of refugees were present. I wasn't there. And that is what is mentioned in the report I gave you; the report I presented to you. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, and on the 15th of June, when you got back in the evening and there were no lights, do I take it that you didn't have any meetings at that point in time, to the best of your recollection? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
When I returned in the evening of the 15th, there was no meeting. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
I would now ask that the witness be shown Prosecution Exhibit P. 40. It's under tab 5A of volume 1, and it's an interoffice memorandum, a UNAMIR document, Your Honours. And I am looking at the third page, it's paragraph O -- K000326. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say volume 1, Prosecution exhibits? 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's correct. It goes up to 30, and then after 30 it goes into 1A, 2A.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, this is a memorandum dated the 15th of June, a UNAMIR document, and at paragraph O, the writer records this: 
"Finally, this morning, I received from the préfet of Kigali a letter dated the 14th of June 1994, which states that in their opinion the evacuation at Sainte Famille was unilateral as opposed to bilateral, as no trucks were moving to the RGF side." 
Do you see that, Mr. Renzaho?
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes, yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I see it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You see, if they received a letter dated the 14th of June from you we're suggesting to you that you were in Kigali on the 14th of June? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I think that there is a principle that I learnt a long while ago: Authority is never absent. So I had a number of people, since there was a bourgmestre of the commune and persons who participated in the coordination meeting for the exchange of refugees. As, so, in the same report, it is stated that representatives of the préfet took part at that meeting. It does not say that he himself took part in the meeting. So the letter may have been written, but I was not the one who wrote it. I was not there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So this letter was from the institution, the prefect, but you, the person, was not there, you had delegated your power, someone else was acting? Is that the evidence? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And if we look at the next exhibit, which is Exhibit P. 41 under tab 6A, which is a UNAMIR report from Dallaire to Annan covering the period of 6 o'clock in the morning till 6:00 at night, and if I can refer you to page 3, the bottom paragraph, it's L0006963, this document records the following: 
"The CMO held a meeting with the COSRGF, ops officer gendarmerie, and the préfet of Kigali city at Hotel Diplomat." 
Once again, Mr. Renzaho, this is recording a meeting taking place between you and others on the 15th of June at a time when you say you were not in Kigali.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It is the same principle. It was a meeting -- was it a meeting at the Hôtel des Diplomates? I don't know; I did not take part at that meeting. But if it was a meeting that prepared evacuation operations, because that is where I got the report when I returned, I knew that my men attended that meeting.
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, we have heard that you were made aware of the fact that people were taken from Saint Paul on that day and killed, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I returned in the evening, in the dark, except for a few storm lanterns that were in the main hall of the building. And immediately I was assailed by refugees who were complaining and saying that a major incident had taken place at the préfecture. They told me about the departure of some refugees that were at the Kigali préfecture, and they also mentioned the kidnapping of persons at the Saint Paul centre. So I received them there, and I remember that later on, in a report that I saw, that is, a report of the questioning of Nikuze, and Nkulikiyinka, Dieudonné, I saw something to the same effect. So I was informed by refugees on the spot when I returned. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the second name after Nikuze? Can you just repeat that name, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Nikuze -- N-I-K-U -- is that not the one, sir? Astérie Nikuze. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, just listen, please. Nikuze is easy. I just want to make sure that the second person you referred to is the one we have correctly identified. Could you repeat the second person's name, please? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Dieudonné. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And neither the bourgmestre nor the conseiller who had asked for these people, the night before, to be arrested, nothing happened to them, did it, Mr. Renzaho? You didn't arrest either the conseiller or the bourgmestre; yes or no? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
They are still alive, I haven't killed them. 
@MR. MOSES: 
They weren't arrested though, were they? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
There was no legal system, Mr. Counsel, and I have discussed this issue at length. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And they remained in their positions until you left Kigali; that's correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
As you yourself can observe in the report that you showed, the UN report, the investigation was not conclusive, and from the deduction from the witnesses that you had here, you could not have the feeling that the end of that incident was -- is clearly perceived. I received information to the effect that these people, through a bargain, were included in the group of persons transferred to the RPF side and that some of them even declared on Radio Muhabura that they were going to come back; this time they will be coming back with the attacking troops. We were conducting investigations, and you will agree with me that the situation was so complex that carrying out an investigation required a lot of time. We were in June, and at the end of June we were leaving the city. Can you at least give me the benefit of not having enough time to apply the indispensable sanctions, and that I did not have the indispensable structures to implement such sanctions. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, I am in fact suggesting to you that the reason nothing happened to anyone is because you were there at Saint Paul's on the morning of the 14th of June, telling ALG that you would take care of things, and then went on to tell those militia, including BUO, to carry out the attack. That's why nothing was done to investigate or punish anyone there because you were right at the heart of it. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I will tell you exactly what I heard from the testimonies that I heard with everybody here present. In the testimony of Witness KZ --
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho I am sorry, I don't need you to go through all the testimony. I have put a simple proposition to you which you either agree with or you don't agree with.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
You say it is simple; I do not accept it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And just for the record, the Dieudonné you referred to a couple of minutes ago was Mr. Nkulikiyinka, number 376; is that so, Mr. Renzaho?

@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, on the early morning of the 17th of June, you found out that the RPF had come and rescued some of the refugees from Saint Paul's, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not have the opportunity to realise that because I did not go there. I spent the night watching because the artillery had fired all night long. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When do you say you found out about the RPF incursion at Saint Paul's? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, listening to the firing that had broken out at about midnight and which continued until morning, and the firing went right up to the top of the plateau, so I was expecting an attack to overrun that position. So I heard it like everybody else did. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So was that the early hours of the morning of the 17th of June, then? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I am saying that the firing broke out at about midnight, shortly before midnight, and continued until dawn of the 17th, in the morning. 
@MR. MOSES: 
When did you find out that people had been taken from Saint Paul's? Was that early in the morning of the 17th of June? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I will tell you my reaction; what I did. 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, no, I don't want to know your reaction, Mr. Renzaho. All I want to know is when. When did you find out that people had been taken from Saint Paul's? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
At about 11 a.m. on 17 June 1994, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you had been called, in fact, earlier that morning by one of the priests from Saint Paul's, hadn't you, Father Paulin? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is incorrect, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, you have heard Witness KZ describe how he was present when Mr. -- when Father Paulin called you, and that Father Paulin got off the phone and told others at Saint Paul's that the priests at Saint Paul's had been hiding Inyenzi and deserved their fate? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is a statement of your Witness KZ. But I am telling you that I received no telephone call. And if Father Paulin was still alive -- and I said that I sent somebody to check, and that the father, the priest had died two weeks before -- I just wanted to have things clear in my mind. What you were told was not correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
What KZ said about Father Paulin having been a schoolmate of yours was true, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
He was not in my batch at school. He was younger, but he is somebody I knew very well. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You were extremely angry at the RPF having gone in the early hours of the 17th of June to take away the Tutsi refugees from Saint Paul's weren't you, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, the statements I made I included in the interview I had with Radio Rwanda on 17 June 1994. It is in that interview that I expressed all what I thought about the attack. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, well, perhaps it's an appropriate time to look at what you said on the 18th of June, in fact. 
@MR. MOSES:
And that's P. 63, Your Honours, page -- it's at tab 18, English is page 6, the fifth paragraph, and in the French, it's on page 9 in the first paragraph. 
And as it's being brought over, it's the very final document, the final tab, Your Honour, in the -- and, Your Honour, I am going to read out from the sentence beginning, "Look at what happened in Kabgayi," it's the second sentence of the fifth paragraph. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
This is what you said, Mr. Renzaho:
"Look at what happened in Kabgayi and here at the Saint Paul pastoral centre where they killed and injured many others. There they killed the inhabitants, except for their kind, whom they took with them." 
That's what you said on the 18th of June, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And when you talk about "their kind", you are talking about Tutsi, aren't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is correct. And I am telling you that that is how it happened, because those that were not selected by the intelligence service were simply killed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
But, Mr. Renzaho, you will agree that you are portraying the Tutsis as not your kind, aren't you? They are the RPF kind. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Those who agreed to go over to the RPF had the right to do so. But in other times, it was possible to indicate to the population that people had the right to go where they wanted, so that should be clear. Now, if they wanted to go over to the RPF, it meant that they felt more secure with the RPF. That is an obvious fact that I cannot deny. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The RPF and the Tutsi refugees, they were all Inyenzi, weren't they? All the same kind? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did not say that. I would not like words to be put in my mouth. That is not it. I didn't say so. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You certainty weren't addressing, on the radio, on the 18th, those persons of the kind who were at Saint Paul's centre, were you? You were addressing Hutus? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, we still had persons -- we still had lots of Tutsi refugees at Hôtel des Mille Collines and at the Kigali city préfecture offices. They were also at the Notre Dame de Cîteaux and Charles Lwanga in Nyamirambo; there were lots of people. So the only operation that was conducted in the night of 16th to 17th could not take away everybody that was still on our side to the RPF. So there were still persons who had to be evacuated to the RPF side. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You see, Mr. Renzaho, when you look at what you'd said here, when you hear what Witness KZ said about what you had told Father Paulin in the morning of the 17th of June, it's all very consistent, isn't it, with what happened subsequently; namely, attacks were led but by you on those Tutsi refugees who remained at Sainte Famille as a retaliation of what the RPF and their kind had done? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, for the Prosecution, you have made an assertion that requires to be examined carefully. In previous questions that you have asked me to the effect to know whether I was there on the spot, I told you that I was not there because the operation that was carried out on that site in the night of 16 to 17 June 1994 was a proper military operation, and that operation was successful as normal law and order operations, as we know them. And those who planned that operation have never told us at what time that operation was supposed to end. So I don't know how I would have presumed to go to the site, not knowing what had happened and not knowing what to do, since I had neither the means of carrying out any action, and since the people had been taken away in any case. And, so, I don't know if your assertion has any basis that will convince me that, really, on that night, for an attack that ended at dawn, I mobilised resources and prepared a counterattack on people who had already left. There were the Rwandan armed forces who could attack the Saint Paul site. The attack soldiers of the RPF broke through the FAR lines. From that point on, the operation was purely military, and it did not concern me. 
And I have never received a complaint from the army to claim that I had usurped their duties and interfered in military matters at Saint Paul. So, it is an assertion that requires careful consideration, Mr. Prosecutor. Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When Mr. Moses read out a quote from this exhibit, we should probably repeat that the first sentence was, "Look at what happened in Kabgayi". That was the word. And then there was another word which was pronounced a bit fast, that was Charles Lwanga, with other words, number 261. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Moving on to another topic, and it's the intercept of the telephone conversation that you had with Mr. Rugambarara which you denied here. That's the next topic I want to address briefly. Can we agree on a few things regarding what is said in the radio -- in the telephone intercept, even if we can't agree on the fact that it was you, Mr. Renzaho? Firstly, would you agree that the speaker, the bourgmestre, is speaking to a préfet? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I heard it, yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the préfet is talking about sending troops from the town to Kigali-rural, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I did understand there was a request for intervention of armed forces towards the area that was attacked. That's what I heard. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Very well. You will agree also that the person who is named as the préfet -- or called the préfet is telling the bourgmestre for -- that persons should be exterminated? That was the word that was used, wasn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I think the conversation was in Kinyarwanda. I don't know -- the translation is perhaps the sore point, I don't know. I don't know. There are different ways of interpreting words in Kinyarwanda. So perhaps you are taking the translation that fits your theory. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I am relying on the official translation, Mr. Renzaho. You disagree that the Kinyarwandan words used mean "to exterminate"? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do not agree, Mr. Prosecutor, all the more so since on the date of 18th, 19th and 20th I know that the entire region was occupied by the RPF. 
I received the bourgmestre, Rutagangwa (phonetic), Jean Marie Vianney, whose statement I have over Radio Rwanda here; he spoke of what was happening. He spoke to all Rwandans. And what he was saying was quite true. So how do you want to convince me that we spoke of extermination, of a situation where an entire region was already occupied by the RPF? Extermination by whom? That is the problem. And it's true there was extermination underway, that's true. But it was the RPF that was exterminating. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, is it your view that the words mubakindagure rwose does not mean "exterminate them", linguistically, leaving aside the context? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
It doesn't mean extermination. Maybe it means -- it depends on the context. If you hit hard on someone, you say muta -- you say "I hit him, I struck him, I gave him a blow". Mubakindagure doesn't mean to kill, it means to strike very hard, a drive, a strike, a blow; it doesn't necessarily mean the death of a person receiving the blow. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you help me understand, Mr. Renzaho, are you saying now it was you but you were meaning something different than the translation that we have been given? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No. First of all, you mustn't regard Bicumbi as being part of Kigali-rural. I had enough problems on my plate in Kigali. Why and how could I concern myself with what was happening in this very distant commune that wasn't part of my daily concerns, my daily duties? 
Secondly, I think that the events, such as people narrate them, would involve the -- a certain amount of infrastructure being in place. I am saying that on the 7th, the telephone, even to Kanombe, in any rural areas, did not operate. I couldn't speak to my family. Numbers beginning with 7 were faulty from the 7th at 8 o'clock in the morning. Did I have a switchboard at the préfecture? 
I don't understand, Mr. Prosecutor, and I cannot commit myself to a situation where I don't see myself at all. Moreover -- and I should like to finish with this -- something I do not manage to seize. Your cassette was used, I know, in another trial. They could not identify who had recorded the cassette. In my specific case, the man who was brought here showed everything -- explained everything, except that he was the author -- original, authentic author of the cassette, and he didn't even bring an original cassette. So there is something confused around this that leads me to think that somewhere or other there is manipulation. Thank you very much. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, at the beginning of the witness's answer he used an expression that the interpreter did not get. Something about a slice of cake on the tongue. I don't know if it's important or not, if you want it repeated. But we did not interpret the expression, not fully understanding it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for drawing our attention to it. I think we can leave it a bit unclear, just that part. Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So the reason you are saying you didn't contact your family on the 7th was not because they didn't have a telephone, but you are saying the numbers with 7 in Kanombe weren't working? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am telling you that 7 already wasn't working, Kanombe included, in the eastern section of those using the 8; 7 only functioned in town, the former town, the heart of the town, the traditional city itself. But you couldn't call anywhere else with the telephones, the lines were faulty. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Kigali-rural is not, can I suggest, a long way off from where you were préfet; it's a neighbouring commune? That's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is not correct, Mr. Prosecutor. If you are speaking of Bicumbi, Bicumbi is even further than Kanombe. It's of course, neighbouring Kanombe, but further on. In relation to the town, it's quite far away. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the préfet of Kigali-rural was Mr. Karera, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
The préfet of Kigali-rural, yes, he was appointed a préfet sometime between April and July 1994. I cannot recall the exact date. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And around the 15th to 20th of April, he was in Kigali was he? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, really, if I could answer in the affirmative I would do so, but I have nothing to go on. I have no way to answer you on this.

$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, bearing in mind the context of what is recorded, and you have wanted to hide context throughout your testimony, you will agree with me, would you not, that in terms of who it might be, who was a préfet, talking of troops being sent from town to Kigali-rural, it would really either have to be you or 
Mr. Karera, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I know absolutely nothing about that. I can speak for myself. As far as I was concerned, I couldn't speak of a virtual situation which I did not know of, so it was not me that spoke in all that business. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And we have heard, haven't we, from four persons who have known both you and Mr. Karera well, who all say it was you on the tape; and they're right, aren't they, it's clearly you speaking on that tape? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, that it would be right, I doubt very much. I wouldn't be contesting that if they were right. And then to say who someone is speaking on a cassette, well, really. Were they there with the person? I don't know. So I don't understand the assertion, on what grounds it makes such an assertion, that someone spoke -- someone who spoke is this or that person. 
And the specialists have given me to understand that manipulation exists, fabrication, intonation of the voice, then you say it's someone else. All the more so since this sort of document, and I have checked, was handed over by the general secretariat of the RPF. No one can convince me of the opposite. And from that point of view the document must be a fake; whether it's one way or another, it's a fabrication. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And are you aware that in fact, just as the tape says, that troops are going to be sent to Bicumbi, that in fact FAR troops were sent to that particular commune at that approximate time? Are you aware that in fact the reality was consistent with what is recorded on that tape? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I know nothing of it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, if I can ask you to look at P. 27. 
@MR. MOSES:
It's at tab 23, Your Honours. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Volume 1? 
@MR. MOSES:
Volume 1, thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
We have already looked at this particular document in respect of the third matter that is recorded on page 2 of it. It's regarding monitoring of Radio Rwanda news. What I'd like to have you look at is in fact paragraph 1 from the 24th of April, 1900 hours. 
It says, "The Rwandese army keeps firm in fighting against the enemy. This was announced by the ministry of defence. The same ministry goes on stating that RPF soldiers kill innocent people as it was done today in a displaced camp in Bicumbi commune, some 30 kilometres from Kigali going east. It affirms that the RPF continued to shell" - that's probably as far as we need to go. 
Now, I'm happy to read the rest of it just for completeness. It affirms that RPF continued to shell into Kigali town to set fear into the civilians. For this reason it calls on all the population to be aware and to point out any suspected RPF sympathiser or any RPF soldier to the RGF.
Now, Mr. Renzaho, especially looking at that final part, it's clear that as of the 24th of April, would you agree, it's talking about events in Bicumbi commune and it is calling on the population to point out any suspected RPF sympathiser or RPF soldier to the RGF? The RGF were in Bicumbi commune around the 24th April, just a few days after the telephone conversation was recorded.
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Do you want me to answer or make a comment? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm suggesting to you that that report on the radio, asking the population around Bicumbi where the RPF was to point people out to the RGF soldiers is consistent with what was on the tape, namely, there was a unit being sent from Kigali town to Bicumbi compound a few days prior to that news report? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I really have nothing to say. I'm completely out of the loop. I don't know if I'd been in any way involved, I could say, yes, I know this, we did this or that. But I know nought, I know nothing about it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that you were -- it is you on that telephone conversation that was recorded and that you were telling the bourgmestre there to make sure that the people were exterminated, "Exterminate them truly", that's what you said, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I won't be - say such a thing. Sing, sing, maybe we listen to your song, but really I'm happy to have to say what I say. I know nothing about it. This bourgmestre of Bicumbi, do you know the first time I saw him was in exile? You speak to someone you know. I never said those things and I've repeated it on several occasions. I said yet again -- I said nothing of what you said. I just do not see myself in the frame you paint. 
@MR. MOSES: 
To a new topic, Mr. Renzaho, very briefly: It's correct, isn't it, that you had persons going around the neighbourhood in Rugenge, R-U-G-E-N-G-E, looking for suspected infiltrators, looking for Inyenzi, looking for Tutsi, including those at Elie Munyankindi's house on about the 28th April? You had persons going around doing those things, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, I'm here before the Trial Chamber, and I should like to say that I never had any unit of hunters, or any other specialised unit to go and seek out infiltrators. I had no unit. I told you how many policemen I had. My only force was that. 
As for the rest of it, the population which was at home, how could I find people to go and seek infiltrators? I had no units whose task it was, and all those who were with me can bear testimony to that. That is what I say to you. 
Now coming to the reality through which we lived at the time of the events, you perhaps are talking of the presence of infiltrators in Kigali town. Well, of course, there were. That is certain. And some of your experts say so. You only need to read Dr. Des Forges, she speaks of it, and 
Professor Filip Reyntjens mentions it too. I even have a film, if you allowed me to show it, I'd show you whether Mr. Jean Pierre Bugabi (phonetic), Mr. Ruzibiza who wrote a book -- a UNAMIR officer discussed this very, very delicate question and contrary to what people might think, yes, there were infiltrators in Kigali. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think he said.

@MR. MOSES: 
I was specifically asking about an incident in Elie Munyankindi's house and I take it from your answer that the answer is: No, you didn't? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, Mr. Prosecutor. No, I know nothing about it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just for clarity, Mr. Rugambarara was the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, true, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Yes, he should have been the bourgmestre of Bicumbi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But Bicumbi is in Kigali-rural, that's your evidence, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And I'm further suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that you also had a journalist known as 
André Kamaye, K-A-M-A-Y-E, he was hunted down and killed, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I've found that in the indictment you gave me. Yes, I read that, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And you had him hunted down and killed, didn't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, and, believe me, I had other duties to attend to, rather than run after somebody, whereas I was in charge of other persons. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And that Akajigari, A-K-A-J-I-G-A-R-I, on about the 9th April, you were also present when Interahamwe were entering the homes of Tutsis in that area to kill them, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, I was not present, Counsel. And I've had occasion to say something about this, I did so yesterday, yes, thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And in respect to a meeting that took place at Hotel Kiyovu in June, the reasons you provided in your evidence in-chief for you not taking part in such an incident were that it was not in your nature, you're not an adventurer, and you would not receive officers at Hotel Kiyovu; those were the reasons you gave in your evidence in-chief, correct? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I would have found a lot more fundamental reasons, maybe it was the tiredness that destracted me, but I feel that the first reason was that I was not there. I was not in Kigali and was not there. 
The second reason is that the hotel for quite sometime had not been functioning. And not only was it not functioning, but at the period under consideration it was in the line of fire of the machine guns that were stationed 500 metres from there on the Muruhuto (phonetic) hill. 
And talking about the persons with whom I am charged, I immensely regret, and I must say so here, be it Colonel Bagosora, Colonel Ephrem Setako, Anatole Nsengiyumva, none of them can assert before people that they talked to me before 6 April and before that period. And what I'm telling you is only sincere. These persons, who curiously are situated with me at Hotel Kiyovu, were not there with me at the Hotel Kiyovu on 14 June 1994. Bagosora was away on mission, out of the country for a long time. And Anatole was then head of a secteur and an operational sector in Gisenyi. I wonder if he had the time to come to Kigali for such a commonplace incident as a roadblock at the Hotel Kiyovu. So one does not really see reasons why people should meet there. 
Setako was negotiating with the RPF at the UNAMIR headquarters. We even have documents to attest to that. They can come here and confirm that. So I am saying if you put this together, I'll have a reason to tell you, Counsel, that I did not take part in that incident. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, well, Mr. Renzaho, you forgot to mention in your evidence in-chief that you were saying that you were out of Kigali at the relevant time, and your story is just coming apart, isn't that right? You're trying to patch it up. You were in Kigali on the 14th and 15th of June, weren't you? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I've told you that I was not in Kigali on 14 June. I don't have any other means to make that clear to you, I was not there. Besides, have you tried to look again at the attitude of Witness AF when he was narrating about Hotel Kiyovu? Is it likely? Is it probable? 
In the interval, I have contacted the former owner of Hotel Kiyovu who gave me very precious information on this issue. And if it is necessary, I will communicate that information to you. So I'm telling you again and again, that the Hotel Kiyovu incident did not take place. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that you were working together with many persons who shared your commitment to commit genocide of the Tutsi in Kigali during April to July. They included Father Wenceslas, Rose, Angeline, Odette, all of those names that we've become quite familiar with during the course of the testimony. And that you worked together with those persons and others to commit genocide. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, I would like to tell you that tragedies are not mere illusions, tragedies are not imagined, tragedies involve the killing of people and happened in broad daylight. Tragedies do not even seek to hide evidence because they are obvious. 
The tragedy that we experienced in Kigali from April to July 1994, I've tried to go through it all with you and the Chamber here, and I believe I have not found enough words to express that tragedy. I think it is beyond any kind of play acting. If there was any evidence that could involve me with any group of persons with whom I agreed or planned to carry out an extermination campaign against the Tutsis, then I will not even ask to leave this hall; I'll ask that my head be cut off right here before you. 
And what I've tried to demonstrate proves clearly that not only did these people not have any relationship with me at the time, but also at the material moment I was not alone. There are people who contend that I was with this or that person and did this or that thing. 
Counsel, sincerely, I believe, I do regret that if I had more bad people material I would disclose them to you because I am one of the main persons who suffers a lot from what happened in Rwanda. And if I could, I would do everything to get to the bottom of all these things. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
Did Your Honour have a question? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, the truth of the situation is that you and the militia soldiers and gendarmes who were working for you and together with you, carried out a plan which was the destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group, the accomplices, that is correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, you certainly have an objective to attain. That notwithstanding, I would like to tell you something. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, no -- to be honest, no. I'm sorry. Do you agree with the proposition I put forward? I take it from your evidence that you don't; but I just want to have that recorded on the record? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do not agree with your proposition and you are the one who is saying that the proposition is simple. 
@MR. MOSES:
All right. Your Honours, I'm getting towards the end of the cross-examination. There are a number of matters that I just want to go through briefly from his 1997 statement and then wrap up with a final proposition. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
So, I would ask, Mr. Renzaho, that you take another look at the statements you prepared from 1997, and I want to briefly and quickly to go through a number of passages in it. If the witness -- I don't know if he has the statement from 1997, testimony on the bloody tragedy of the people of Kigali from 6 April? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have this document in front of you, Mr. Renzaho? Page? 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, if I can refer the witness to -- it is page 4 of the English version below the second paragraph, "The meeting adopted the following emergency measures". And the French -- looking at page 6 of the French after the second paragraph with The meeting adopts. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you see in that document you listed, I believe, nine measures to be taken as part of a plan at the meeting on -- that you say took place on the 8th of April; do you see those there? And, in particular at number 8, you talk about action against looting. Do you see that, Mr. Renzaho? The action against looting is on page 7, and you say that this action was taken against looting in collaboration with the army. You talk about a contingent set aside to deal with the looting; do you see that, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I do see it, Counsel. 
@MR. MOSES: 
There's no action plan with the army or anyone else to stop killing, is there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I am not authorised to speak on behalf of the army, which had its commanders. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, you have stated that the meeting there was adopting a process where you in conjunction with the army were going to have people set aside to stop looting. There is nothing in your action plan that you have recorded there to deal with -- involve anyone to stop killing. There is to stop looting, but not to stop killing; that's correct, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel, may I say that looting went hand-in-hand with killing. If there was looting, notably in the populous neighbourhoods, then it was accompanied by killing, that is a fact. And you did not give me time to tell you what I had to say on the name of the sub-lieutenant that appears in that document. It was precisely upon insistence that people, the local authorities, instead of working just anyhow, had somebody who dealt with the issues and who referred to the military authorities on the ground who intervened. That was the mission of that young man and we intervened with the elements of the gendarmerie. 
But as the fighting went on, the gendarmerie unit was engaged in battle and was no longer available. And it already mentions how the local community could use -- to instill order in the neighbourhoods could work. 
And I also forgot to tell you that since the army had no other possibility of intervening, since it came in late, positioned its lines just outside the populous neighbourhoods, that collaboration was therefore necessary. 
@MR. MOSES: 
But you'll agree with me that there was no action plan put in place to deal specifically with the killings, was there? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is the plan I'm telling you about because intervention in the neighbourhoods was precisely to get at killers and looters. That is what I was talking about. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Protection of property was far more important to you, wasn't it, than protection of the innocent Tutsi civilian population because they were just Inyenzi? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
No, Counsel. I've heard that comment from Madam Des Forges. I (unintelligible) against that gratuitous assertion. The property first belonged to the persons that had been prosecuted (sic), the Tutsis in the neighbourhoods that were defending -- well, apart from the few cases in the commission -- Egena centre that was brought up. That centre was attacked on a number of occasions and as we came in several times and disposed of them, as well as in the neighbourhoods. So that is the problem we had. That is what we had to do to protect those people. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have in English that the property belonged to the persons that had been "prosecuted"; is that what you said in French? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
That is it, Mr. President. The property belonged to the persons who were persecuted, who were unsafe. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Persecuted, thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
The next statement I went to refer you to, Mr. Renzaho, is in the English, page 7, the final 
two paragraphs. And in the French it's on page 12. It is the third to bottom paragraph, Mr. Renzaho, commencing with the word "avec". 
Let me refresh you with what you said in 1997 about the situation in Kigali, "With the supervision of the people, PVK authorities could practically control the situation from 17 April 1994 because there were no longer massacres in Kigali town. Fortunately, that situation came with the stability of the battlefront, which remained almost stable until 4 July 1994; that is, the day civilians evacuated from Kigali." 
Now, that's what you said in 1997, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
It is true, that is what is written. But there are two aspects. First, the stability -- the stabilisation of the situation, which at the end of the month of April was relatively under control in the neighbourhoods. If there were killings, then really they were outbursts in keeping with the information we received. But generally -- and you can receive confirmation for this in the report of the ICRC at the time. 
So, this situation was coming under control in the neighbourhoods with respect to the killings. But with regard to the fighting, I don't know. There's clearly a mistake, because fighting continued, that is certain. Fighting continued especially towards Nyamirambo and the south of Mount Kigali and probably towards the interior of the country, maybe to close off the little outlet that was the outside world. So, I mean, the fighting did not stop. Since I personally had to place my head on the ground and creep up to Mount Kigali. I mean the firing was so intense. So there must be something not quite correct there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, Mr. Renzaho, the only thing not correct is what you've been telling this Court. This is consistent, isn't it, with what the prime minister said, namely, that you had Kigali under your control? It's consistent with that, isn't it? The PVK authorities could practically control the situation from 17 April? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
That is not correct, Counsel. And this -- your personality, the prime minister, if he had the courage to stay on, he would have spoken in this area with some authority. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the witness you called, remember last week? I think it was Witness PAT. He agreed with the proposition I put to him, that if the war front was stable from the 17th of April, there's no reason why the military and others couldn't take down and control the situation in Kigali; in fact, that's what the situation was. It was only that the communal authorities and the military didn't want to stop what was going on; that's the situation, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Your scenario is not realistic. First, from the operational military standpoint in Kigali, if I spoke to you about the hurried recruitment of soldiers who went to reinforce the army, it means that the army was entirely eroded. And I heard that officer, he took up command of the unit that was in Mount Kigali, that had lost almost 75 per cent of its force. 
So, how do you expect me to accept your proposition? It is not correct. The Rwandan troops had to face the RPF troops that were reinforced and that continued to receive reinforcements from outside. And I show you that the situation continued to worsen until we left Kigali. So, there was no force to wage war on the citizens or to compel them to dismantle the roadblocks. You understand that if it were possible, the army would have done that well before, but it was not possible. 
@MR. MOSES: 
That's not what you said in 1997, is it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
What is written here is not gospel, all the more so as we were in a situation of distress. We were emerging from death and we told ourselves that the little that we had in our heads we could put down in writing. So don't take it as the gospel. It was not written in optimum conditions that would enable anybody to write a very consistent and exhaustive text. Please, I do ask that of you. 
@MR. MOSES:
I note it is about 1 o'clock. If I can just indicate, I only have one more matter to put to him from this statement. Then I have a concluding matter which might take perhaps ten minutes. So, I would expect I would be approximately 15 to 20 minutes at most after the lunch break, if that's of any assistance or guidance to my learned friend. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for that information. Could you, just like the Defence, put on a piece of paper the documents you want to tender? I think of those you had in your bundle you have used four new documents and you may wish to assist Mr. Matemanga with those four. 
We will then have re-examination. I leave it to the Defence to -- based on the time of re-examination to consider whether there will be time for Mr. Lugan to start his testimony today and when he should be called. Do you have a preliminary response to that question? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, if the Prosecution sticks to his timeframe, the timeframe he's given us, I believe we could start with the history expert this afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If that's the case, we must make sure that he's available from around 3:30 or 4, what would be your -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, we will inform you. Since he was scheduled to start this afternoon, then he should be available. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good, the Court is adjourned to 3 o'clock. 
$(Court recessed from 1301H to 1502H) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon. 
We'll now hear the last part of the cross-examination. 
Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Renzaho, looking at the same document, your statement from 1997, I'd ask you, please, to look at page 18 in the French. And it's the second paragraph commencing (French spoken). And in the English, it's on page 10 about the seventh paragraph. It's under the heading, "Relationship with international community". 
It's just one sentence I want to read to you, Mr. Renzaho, and ask for a comment. There you say, "Moreover, I did my best to protect property belonging to various embassies until the evacuation from Kigali. Certainly as from then on I could no longer do anything." 
Now, a simple question, Mr. Renzaho: What did you do to protect the property of the embassies? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Thank you. I noted that in Kigali there were a number of embassies that had left some staff behind and I tried to provide assistance, especially to the embassy of Tanzania, the embassy of Germany, the embassy of France, the headquarters of the European Union community, and a number of other buildings, especially the Korean embassy, I believe, towards Rwanga. We did our utmost in order to strengthen the protection team of these embassies. 
Furthermore, within the framework of the logistics committee that had been set up, I tried to recover all the vehicles of NGOs that had been abandoned here and there on the streets and the vehicles were assembled in the UNDP parking in Kigali. Up until the 3rd of July the parking lot was full. So this is what we tried to do. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In terms -- perhaps I'll be more specific, if I can. In terms of protecting the property of the embassies, which is what we are talking about in that paragraph, did you place guards at the embassies to protect their property? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
We provided assistance to the guards that were there and we patrolled the different locations and we did provide additional security. And besides there were refugees who tried to seek refuge in these locations, a few of them. There were a few refugees there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. I'll leave that. 
Mr. Renzaho, you will recall the questions I put to one of the Defence witnesses regarding a comment that General Ndindiliymana had made to General Dallaire around the 20th of May 1994, where 
General Ndindiliymana had told General Dallaire not to trust you, you remember that? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So General Ndindiliymana didn't trust you, did he? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
I don't know what it means: Trust somebody. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Okay. We'll move on to another issue, and I'd ask you to look at Prosecution Exhibit 22 at tab 17. It is a UNAMIR interoffice memorandum signed by General Dallaire dated 27th January 1994. And it's only in English, Your Honour. This was a memorandum requesting to establish a small radio monitoring and translation centre in UNAMIR. 
And in paragraph 2, halfway down, General Dallaire gives us one of the reasons for requesting such a unit, "For example, it came to my attention that the préfet of Kigali stated on the Kinyarwanda radio station that the RPF is sheltering the persons in the CND who committed recent murders in Kigali. This type of statement is inflammatory and untrue, but can only be refuted by UNAMIR if we know about it in an accurate and timely manner." 
It's clear from that document also, I suggest, Mr. Renzaho, that General Dallaire is recording the fact that he believes you to have been making untrue statements over the radio in January 1994; do you agree that is what the document shows? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Well, you have just read it out and I could not respond otherwise, that is what is written. But is it the truth? We are on the 27th January of 1994. On the 27th of January of 1994 the war had not reached the city of Kigali yet. How would it have come to my mind to denounce bombings in the town when there had been no fighting in Kigali? There were murders, that is true. There were acts of violence. There were armed attacks, but I would never have just denounced shelling of neighbourhoods when on 27th January 1994 the war had not yet reached the city of Kigali. Thank you. I think this is yet another example of manipulation. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And the prime minister, Kambanda, was asked about whether you were someone to be trusted; that is on side B, K0154886. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and we will come to that. But the point in this document is that it is argued that there is an untrue statement on the radio concerning persons in the CND who committed recent murders in Kigali; did you make such a statement? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
All my statements on Radio Rwanda have been put on transcripts, and I wonder why some of them are available and others are not. What you should remember is that I intervened when it was necessary to do so. 
Just to tell you that I did not replace the authorities who were to rule on specific cases, such as the minister of information or any other official who was in Kigali. So, I do not recall having made such a statement. I don't recall, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the Kambanda statement. 
@MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. It is in the side B document KO154886, the first four -- first two questions and answers. And in the French, it`s on page 25 commencing with the words (French spoken). 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
In this passage, which I'll read, Mr. Kambanda was asked about you, "Was he" -- referring to you -- "someone you trusted? Could you say he was honest and told you the truth? Or, was he someone whose word you couldn't take as such?" The answer given was, "No, I couldn't say he was telling me the truth." I believe the French says, "I couldn't say that out loud either, but I knew he wasn't telling me the truth." 
That's what is recorded there, Mr. Renzaho. And can I suggest to you that the picture built up by the comments from the head of gendarmerie, the head of UNAMIR, and the prime minister are of someone, namely yourself, who is making false statements and is not to be trusted. And that's an accurate picture of you, isn't it? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I wish to answer your question, but give me sufficient time to answer your question correctly. First of all, the allusion you're making to the general chief of staff of the gendarmerie is his responsibility and the responsibility of the person he discussed it with. Every single time 
General Dallaire required my services he contacted me and he asked me to attend meetings he organised. And there was never a time when he submitted a problem to my attention which I did not try to solve. If he had any specific observation to make to me, I believe he would have done so. 
Now, as regards the chief of staff of the gendarmerie, in particular, I wish to observe that I'm not here -- I know that he is here and that he is also standing trial. I am not here to say anything that might have some bearing on his case. But let me merely note that I was not employed by him and that in most of the cases for which I had to ask for the intervention of the gendarmerie, he was not there, and these interventions were successful. 
So my question is, quite frankly, on the basis of what information he could judge a person he has never even talked to? And I believe this is not typical of him. It might happen. He's my elder, and I don't think he is the kind of man who would say anything -- just anything, anything that would come to his head without any reason. 
As for Kambanda, I am going to repeat once again that I saw Kambanda again on the 
11th of April 1994. This man was a political activist. I had never had any dealings with him. I did not know him. On the 12th he left. On what basis can he say that he trusts me or doesn't trust me? On what basis did he ever trust me with a mission I did not carry out? Or did we ever exchange words or nothing? I don't see when such thing happened. 
And I will even go further: In another trial that took place here there was an individual who was asked to testify and who recounted horrible things regarding this meeting of the 11th of April 1994. I would have preferred for that person to be facing me and to repeat what that person said. Unfortunately, I was not present. But other people who were present confounded him completely. 
So what is one to believe? This is manipulation. People are saying I am not to be trusted. I have worked with people who have always trusted me. I have friends who even to this day in the prison trust me. I have not betrayed anybody. I have not tried to harm anybody. This is my nature. And I'm not of those people who will say the truth with brutality, with too much brutality. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The truth is, Mr. Renzaho, you committed genocide in Kigali between April and July 1994 and that your attitude towards the Tutsi in Kigali throughout that period was that of "je m'en fou", I don't care. That's the truth, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I believe you should show more humility, and history will show that. Forgive me for saying such a thing to you. I believe you should not make any premature judgement. Time will tell. I know what I did and I am too modest because, as I stated previously, what happened to Rwanda was nothing that the small country deserved. 
And if you consider that all the chain of events which have led to the downfall of this country are to be attributed to me, well, I believe you can then make such a statement. But otherwise, let me tell you in full conscience that I do not give any credence to what you have just stated. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, that is the end of the cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. Do you have the list of exhibits available? 
@MR. MOSES:
I do, Your Honour. It's only -- there are a number of documents listed in this document. It is only numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 that were in fact used during the course of the cross-examination. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could the Defence be given a copy of this document? 
@MR. MOSES:
Absolutely. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This seems accurately to reflect the documents that were used during cross-examination. Any problems or objections with the tendering of these four documents, Defence? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, we are looking at the list, and I believe we don't have any problem with it, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much indeed. 
Mr. Matemanga, will you tell us what is the first next Prosecution number? 
@MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 114. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So number 2 becomes P. 114, number 3, 115, number 4, 116 and number 5, 117. 
@MR. MOSES:
Just in respect to that, the first document and the last two documents both have an English and a French. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the French and B for the English in P. 114 and P. 116 and P. 117.
$(Exhibit No. P. 114A and P. 114B admitted) 
$(Exhibit No. P. 115A and P. 115B admitted)

$(Exhibit No. P. 117A and P. 117B admitted) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before giving the Defence the floor for re-examination, I think it might be useful to address the issue of Mr. Lugan. You will recall, Mr. Moses, that you indicated that there were two possible scenarios for the way you would approach the expert. We have the expert report. We also have your notice under 
Rule 94 bis where you dispute the witness's qualification as an expert, where you do not accept the report as an expert witness statement and where you wish to cross-examine Mr. Lugan. 
It is, of course, up to you whether you would wish to carry out a voir dire and go into these matters. But you may be aware that our Chamber has heard Professor Lugan on two occasions in Ndindabahizi and Military I. In Ndindabahizi it was undisputed that he was an expert and in Military II it was disputed, but we ruled in favour of his expert status. So, you may wish to consider the situation. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm well aware -- well aware of that situation. Your Honours, I'm happy for perhaps a middle approach if my friends are happy with it. That is -- I won't concede, they can simply tender the CV. On the basis of Your Honours' earlier rulings, I assume, it's fair to say, you would qualify 
Mr. Lugan. And really there are some questions I would like to ask him which there may be objection to on the basis that they should have been raised in respect of his qualification. 
Now, I'm happy for it all to be put in one group of questions as long as I'm not prevented from doing so during the course of his cross-examination. That would, I think, speed matters up. It would mean that we don't have to go through the procedure of a voir dire, I simply would not -- they could tender his CV, I would concede, but not ask any questions. And then during the course of my cross-examination, I could deal with some of the matters which I was intending to cover in the voir dire. 
Now, if Your Honours were happy with that and the Defence are -- then the other thing that could speed matters up, as I indicated last week, is, on the basis that Your Honours found him to be an expert, I'd be happy for his report at that stage to be tendered and he simply be asked any questions -- follow-up questions, as it may be. 
Does that assist, Your Honours? I don't know. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that is a step in the right direction. And we will come back to this immediately before 
Mr. Lugan will testify. This was just so that no one will be taken with surprise and can plan the most expedient way to carry out examination and cross-examination on the next witness. 
Defence, you have the floor for re-examination. 
$(Pages 37 to 50 by Melissa Hook)
1530H 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not wish to put any additional question to the witness, 
Mr. Renzaho.
But, may I broach the subject of Mr. Lugan, since it has just been referred to? I am trying to follow my learned colleague. From the accusation in his explanations, and if I understand him correctly, he is not contesting the expert status of Mr. Lugan. If I understood him correctly, that is not exactly what was stated -- either we should engage in a discussion on the subject or we shouldn't. 
If you wish, and this is what I understood, if you wish to attempt to discredit Professor Lugan on the substance of his report, this might be dealt with during the cross-examination. But for the time being, I wish to have your clear position on his qualification as an expert; it being understood, Mr. President and Your Honours, that we do have the CV of Professor Lugan here in our files and that we are in a position to provide it. 
As far as Mr. Renzaho is concerned, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not have any re-examination. As for Mr. Lugan, I am trying to understand exactly what my learned colleague from the Prosecution wishes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will come back to that. 
Mr. Renzaho, we have now heard your examination-in-chief, cross and re-examination, and this means that your examination has come to an end. We would like to thank you very much and you can now resume your seat together with the Defence team on the right-hand side. Thank you very much. 
@THARCISSE RENZAHO:
Thank you, Mr. President, I wish to thank the Trial Chamber for having kindly listened to me, and wish it an excellent work. Thank you very much.
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses, could you, in a very brief form, recapitulate your position in relation to Mr. Lugan, very briefly, please? 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour, there are some questions which I had proposed to ask during a voir dire session, which I am happy to place in the body of my cross-examination of Mr. Lugan. 
My only concern with that is that I am not prevented from asking some questions regarding his world view, which may be -- which may be relevant to his interpretation as an historian. 
Now I can deal with those matters in cross-examination of -- and what I was proposing, Your Honour, is that in order to save time, if Mr. Lugan is sworn in and shown -- and produces his CV, I was proposing that I do not cross-examine him, and there would be no need for a voir dire, but that I would not concede, formally, his expertise, Your Honours' would then rule and he would then be -- and I am aware, Your Honour, that the Trial Chamber has found him to be an expert in the past. And so I'm not wanting to belabour the point for the -- just for the sake of it. So I would assume, Your Honours, 
would -- on the basis of his CV -- find him to be an expert; we could then proceed with his 
evidence in chief, and I could cross-examine and include some of the matters I had intended to ask during the course of his voir dire in the body of my cross-examination. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That would clarify the matter. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, if questions will be put to Mr. Lugan on the world in general, and his world view -- which is the term used by my learned colleague -- I shall wait until I hear the specific question, because I believe this will prolong the proceedings. 
In order to make matters simple, I believe we can deal immediately with the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination. And I cannot tell you beforehand, my learned friend, whether I will accept these questions on the witness's world view. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The normal situation will continue, namely, that objections are made after having heard the questions, but we note then the position of the Prosecution and we call in the next witness, namely, Mr. Lugan. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, if it is of any assistance to the Trial Chamber, we had an English translation of the last portion of -- an official translation of the last 16 or so pages of the French report. We didn't have time to have it all translated into English, but if having that final portion, which was dealing specifically with the issue of the Accused, if providing that to the Trial Chamber is of assistance, we can do that now. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We would appreciate that and, of course, the Defence will also get a copy of the English, an unofficial translation of the last 16 pages. Thank you. 
@MR. MOSES:
There are six copies here, Your Honours: Three for Your Honours, one for the registry I believe, and one for the Defence -- and one for the Accused.

@WITNESS LUGAN:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a witness before this Tribunal, the exact status will be clarified in a couple of minutes. 
You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.

There is a CV of the witness, isn't there? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, we've gone to fetch it -- it will be here soon. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And hopefully the interpreters will get a copy, which they don't have as yet. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It would be good to have it very soon, actually now. 
@MR. CANTIER:
I fully agree with the Trial Chamber; it's a small error, a technical -- a technical fault. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you have a few introductory questions in parallel with the photocopying of the CV so that you could start, Maître Cantier?

$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, in view of the conversation that took place here, the question of your qualifications is no longer in doubt, that we are going to proceed with examination-in-chief and cross-examination as is the custom or as is customary.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is not exactly the case. We need now to be presented with the witness's CV and an overview of his qualifications, but those questions could be reduced to a minimum if we had the copy of the CV. 
Don't you want now to introduce the witness to the Chamber, highlight his professional activities in 
oral form now, while we are waiting for the CV? And then the Chamber will rule on his expert status without much ado, and then we will start with the examination-in-chief proper. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, I had not quite understood where we stood, but now, however, I do. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, my first question, Mr. Expert, concerns your professional -- professional itinerary, and can you tell the Trial Chamber what you -- what tertiary distinctions you've -- qualifications you've acquired, especially the most recent ones? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
The most recent -- the most recent date? From 30 years ago, I have a state doctorate in history. I am at the end of my career, so my qualification was obtained sometime ago. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
On what subjects did -- on what subjects were you dealing with that you -- that you obtained this doctorate? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I was studying Rwanda and my last memoir was a study of Rwandan economic and social history, more particularly, trading in Rwandan custom, and my doctoral thesis, which was several volumes long, between the servitude of the hoe and the bewitchment by cows -- or, bewitchments involving cows, a historical history of Rwanda.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President, that's off the cuff.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we need a repetition of that. The title of the thesis, will we find that on the CV? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you say it once more, only the title? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would you like it in French also, Mr. President or should we let him say --
@WITNESS LUGAN:
So, it's an enigmatic title, but it demonstrates the dualism of society -- traditional Rwandan society. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
So we'll try to translate it now.
@WITNESS LUGAN:
It is between the servitude of the hoe and the witchery -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'd have to think about that one. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
The witchery associated with cows, rural -- traditional -- the traditional rural world in Rwanda. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you to the interpreter for the efforts in connection with this enigmatic exercise. 
The next point? 
@MR. CANTIER:
I do agree, Mr. President. We have Professor Lugan's CV that we are in the process of photocopying as many copies as necessary. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, my next question is: In addition to these written works, did you continue your studies in relation -- in respect of Rwanda? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, Counsel, I have made reports -- for example, to the ICTR here, and I have written three works -- three books on the subject which are all three on my CV. 
There's an overall history of Rwanda that I am -- reneged upon, especially -- that I retract, especially part of it pertaining to contemporary history. 
Then, another work entitled, "Genocide, the church and Rwanda", I also retract part of what I've written there in view of what has unfolded since. And a book for which I take full responsibility, the present status of my research specifically devoted to or dealing with the French army in Rwanda, entitled, "François Mitterrand, the French army and Rwanda". And, finally, the last of my works which appeared a few months ago, "Rwanda, counter-investigation on the genocide". In addition to which I have published a certain number of articles, and given interviews here and there -- without my specific teaching of Rwanda history before the trainees of the main French military academies. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Professor. Let us come to your specific activities as a teaching -- as an academic teach -- with regard to your teaching, what -- and the institutions where it takes place? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
My alma mater is University Lyon III, Lyon III, where I deal exclusively -- I teach exclusively 
African history and Rwandan history at the level of masters and doctorates. 
In addition to which I am -- I chair the seminar on African history at the interarmy defence college -- in fact, that's the new title of the École de guerre where we teach history, both French and African. And I teach at the IHEDN, which is the Institut des hautes études de la défence nationale, I-H-E-D-N, the higher -- the defence college of higher military studies, the defence college of higher military studies. 
And lastly, I teach at the CHEM, C-H-E-M, which is the Centre des hautes études militaires, which is the highest level at which I teach, because there I train higher ranks -- colonels already awaiting their stars to be appointed generals. So that is the highest level of training in the French army, and I have 12 to 15 trainees -- seminarists. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a reference to "CID" in your CV. Have you told us what that abbreviation stands for? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, Mr. President, I'll give it to you in full: Collège interarmée de défence, interarmy defence college -- interarmy defence college, which is a barbarous term for what we still call in traditional terms, 
"l'école de guerre", roughly translated as "war school". 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Professor, does that mean beyond your historical competence or competencies in history, you also have competencies -- or, you're also competent in the military arts? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, if you're asking me to teach trainees how to pack their stomach parachute, I could do so, but that is not what I do. I don't teach them how to use arms. I -- what I convene is in the academic courses of the higher ranks. So I know the military spheres and, I am of course aware of everything that might have a bearing on the commitment -- the reality or legends in relation to the French presence in Rwanda, and more particularly, in respect of the conflict of -- from 1990 to 1994 - the 1990 to 1994 conflict. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Professor, could you tell us what methods you did employ in undertaking your work, and I am thinking in particular of your written works with respect -- in respect of the situation in Rwanda, let us say, after the 1980s? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Well, as any other scientist, I use a certain number and type of sources -- written sources, oral sources, primary sources, secondary sources and, of course, what is in constant evolution. And I think one of the original aspects of my work is to attempt, to the extent possible, to keep track of things as they evolve, which means I work considerably with the lengthy proceedings underway here at the ICTR. 
And I must say that for some years the proceedings -- the documentation produced, the expert's report and others that are sent to me make it possible for me to advance considerably in this field. So I'm in osmosis with what is being written here at the ICTR and I'm open to all available sources. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you think in view of the work you've done, and you continue doing what you have produced, do you think -- and are producing -- do you think you are in a position to enlighten the Trial Chamber, to bring light to bear to the benefit of the Trial Chamber in respect of what happened in Rwanda after 1990, and more particularly, with respect to the role or position of the Accused? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Very modestly, but the Trial Chamber will be the judge of that. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I think that with respect to the CV and the question of qualification, I have finished. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any questions at this stage, Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honours, as I have indicated earlier, the Prosecution's position is that we don't accept, but we're not going to make any submissions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you been in Rwanda after 1994, Mr. Witness? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Mr. President, as I had the opportunity to tell you a few months back, the answer is no. I also said that I was very near to Rwanda, but I did not actually return to Rwanda itself. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, the fact that we may have met in the same courtroom previously, we still need to place everything on record in the present case. 
But, if you have not been to Rwanda since 1994, were you in Rwanda in 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
No, Mr. President, in 1994 I was -- in 1994, I was in Africa but in another part of it, because at the time when the tragic events occurred in Rwanda, there was a great hope abroad in the southern part of the continent, in South Africa, and I was on the spot to see the changes -- the mutation that unfolded there at that time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And were you in Rwanda before 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, Mr. President, I -- I think altogether I spent about 11 years, give or take a few months. If my memory serves me right, I arrived in Rwanda in September 1972 and I left in July or August 1983. So, I stayed about 11 years over that period, and I was at the time professor of African history -- African and Rwandan history at the Université Nationale du Rwanda -- the UNR, the Rwandan National University. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Knowing now that you were 11 years in Rwanda before '94, but that you have not visited Rwanda in '94 or after '94, what is it then which makes you qualified as an expert before this Tribunal? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
I think I have two-fold knowledge of Rwanda. Firstly, knowledge on the ground; I think I'm amongst all the experts -- apart from the missionaries -- I'm amongst all the experts who have testified before you. 
I can name a few: Filip Reyntjens, Alison Des Forges, André Guichaoua, Chrétien -- the one who stayed the longest in Rwanda, Chrétien himself never was in Rwanda; he was in Burundi. Guichaoua came a bit later. 
Also, I'm the only Frenchman to have written a state doctoral thesis -- a state historical doctorate thesis on ancient Rwanda -- historical Rwanda. And what distinguishes me from all the other experts is that I work on the long term in history -- historical Rwanda and present Rwanda because everything is connected. 
Add to that the facts that I have worked considerably in all the archives -- the existing archives on the contemporary situation. In all modesty, as I've said before, I think I have a minimum -- I do know a substantial minimum about Rwanda and, more particularly, the period in question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have in front of us the CV of Professor Lugan who has been teaching at the institutions mentioned during the questioning by Maître Cantier. He has written three books of a certain relevance to the matters at hand. He has been in Rwanda for 11 years. Admittedly, he was not there in '94 or later, but that is not an absolute requirement for becoming an expert. Also other experts may not have been there in '94 and, indeed, only in brief periods thereafter. 
This Chamber has previously found Professor Lugan to fulfil the criteria of being an expert both in Ndindabahizi and Military I. We are reaching the same conclusion now. Another matter will be a concrete evaluation of the testimony based on the entire file. But when it comes to the status, we will grant you expert status before this Tribunal, Professor Lugan, and you will now be examined in chief by Maître Cantier, who has the floor. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If at all -- it would be useful, Mr. President, we still don't have a copy of the CV in the booths. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear that, Mr. Matemanga? Please make sure that the booths have the CV. 
You have the report? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's on its way, I believe -- oh, the report, we have it in French. Has an English translation been finished? We seem to have quite a bit of stuff. Thank you.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Expert Witness, we shall not deal with the history of Rwanda prior to the events that are of interest to us -- and which are of interest for this trial, even if, indeed, you can provide some responses on the matter. My first question will be to ask you who, to your mind, launched the war of 
October of 1990 in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
According to me, this is -- should not be the question. We are in front of something that cannot be questioned, and has not been questioned. The war was launched on the 1st of October of 1990 by the armed wing of the Rwandan patriotic front, which was the APR. When it crossed the border into Rwanda from Uganda in the extreme north-eastern part of Rwanda -- in the northern part of the national Akagera park at Kagitumba -- do I need to spell out all the names or is the Trial Chamber familiar enough with the names? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber and everyone in the courtroom are familiar with most of the names, thanks to all the experience represented in this room, but if there is a name or two that we do not know, we will ask you to spell it, thank you. 
So we have noted the answer as to who started the war. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
What was the composition of these troops and what was their origin? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I wish to refer to the writings of the best expert of the RPF, who is Prunier, and I also wish to refer to the information notes that we were able to get from the French side or the Rwandan side -- the forces that attacked when crossing the border at Kagitumba are made up, for the most part, of units of groups or individuals, who up to then, had been members of the Ugandan army -- most of them. With one particularity in that there were not any ordinary members of the Rwandan army, but were, rather, members that had one thing in common: They were the first generation offspring of the Tutsi who had fled Rwanda during the events that occurred throughout the independence and post-independence period, who had sought refuge in Uganda, in a specific region in that country, which is the region of the former kingdom of Ankolé, spelt A-N-K-O-L-É, acute, in French. 
This Ankolé region is peculiar because it is, in fact, the extension towards the north of Rwanda and in this Ankolé region, there a population which is related to the Tutsis of Rwanda, the Himas, H-I-M-A. And throughout the long civil wars that would take place in Uganda, these Tutsis, these Rwandan Tutsis took the side of one of the Ugandan warlords, the present president, Museveni, who is a Hima, and who recruited 70 per cent of his troops within two ethnic national troops: The Baganda, a population from Uganda, and the Tutsi as well as the Hima. 
President Museveni won the war. President Museveni came to power and had in his army between 
25 to 30 per cent of Rwandan Tutsis, and this is at all levels, even the highest levels. It is these Rwandan Tutsis who were members of the Ugandan army who, in fact, deserted that army and attacked at Kagitumba on the 1st of October. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This "Kagitumba", is that with a G or D? Can you spell it once more slowly, please? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Kagitumba K-A-G -- it's a G, Kagitumba. It is the border post which is located at the extreme northern point of Rwanda, Kagitumba. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now "Baganda", can you spell that please? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. Baganda is spelt B-A-G-A-N-D-A. The Baganda are the subjects of the Buganda kingdom. B-U-G-A-N-D-A. Buganda, Baganda. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now we probably agree that Hima is written, H-I-M-A, is that so? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, Mr. President, there is a problem with Hima because further north -- and further south there are Hemas, the name of which is spelt H-E-M-A. But in the present case in point it is Hima, H-I-M-A.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for this. Unless absolutely necessary, when I'm asking you to assist us with the spelling, please only give the spelling without any additional comments. 
And now we will hear Maître Cantier's next question. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, this conflict you have just referred to, is it, as -- and your answer has to be provided as an historian -- is it an internal conflict within Rwanda or is it an international conflict? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Both, Counsel, both, because we are dealing with a conflict which engages Rwandan refugees who attacked their homeland; that is to say, an internal conflict. But these Rwandan refugees are 
members -- or were members of the army of a foreign country. And throughout the war, from 
October of 1990 up to the victory of the Rwandan patriotic army in July 1994, the base for these fighters will be Uganda. The logistics, medical base will be in Uganda, and also the place where they will go back to, because this will occur on two or three opportunities -- and perhaps we shall refer to it subsequently. So, it is not only an internal conflict, but also an international conflict. So it is quite difficult to provide any other answer than the one I just provided. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now Professor, you are well versed with the proceedings in this courtroom. Can I ask you: One, to speak slowly; and B, to be brief, and brevity is really important. 
Here comes the follow-up question. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, did this war of 1990 -- or, rather, was this war of 1990 at the origin of the events that this Tribunal is dealing with -- that is to say, the event that occurred in 1994?
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, Counsel -- I am being brief, Counsel, yes.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, well, Mr. Expert Witness, in order to improve the quality of our proceedings I am speaking to you in French. You understand what I mean immediately, but please observe a pause between the question and your answer because the interpretation has to take place -- even if your answer is yes or no. 
So you have answered "Yes" to my question. Could you briefly tell us what is the link between this war of 1990, and the events that occurred in Rwanda -- and, more specifically, from the 6th of April of 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Once again, I shall be very brief and I shall give you four dates: The war starts on the 1st of October, but it did not end with the defeat of the Rwandan patriotic army. It continued with three peak events: 22nd of January of 1992, Ruhengeri attack; 5th of June of 1992, the attack on Byumba; the 
8th of February 1993, the attack in the direction of Kigali. So the war continued with the final point of the campaign, the attack launched on Kigali on the 7th of April of 1994. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, you have just given us the main episodes of the war throughout that period. Can you tell the Trial Chamber what were the consequences of this situation on -- on interethnic relations in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Well, the four dates I have provided, I have tried to set up a framework. Each of these attacks from the Rwandan patriotic army -- and let me specify that none of the attacks came from the camp of the Rwandan armed forces -- each of the attacks I referred to would lead to large-scale movements of population with many displaced persons. And attack after attack, there is a problem that would be at the heart of the matter, which is that of the displaced persons. Because Rwanda is a small country, geographically speaking, and the regions that are the most affected by the war are, in fact, the most densely populated areas of the three northern préfectures, which are Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Byumba. 
So, the first consequences of these attacks will be social in nature, because on the axis towards Kigali, there will be very large refugee camps that will be established. The second type of consequence -- they are political in nature -- because since 1991, Rwanda had launched multiparty politics. And the war, with the destruction it brought in its wake, and with the consequences of this war will completely disrupt the democratisation process. I consider -- and I have already said so in my writings, that to compel Rwanda to democratise in a war context was an irresponsible attitude. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I was about to put a question to you on political developments, but if you have something to add, 
Mr. Expert Witness, please go ahead. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, I am willing to answer your question. I could speak about it for hours, but my -- I believe, it would be better for me to be specific and brief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question you were asked was a bit more specific than the answer -- namely, what was the consequences of the situation on interethnic relations in Rwanda? With other words, the consequences of the war, and isn't the core that that led to increased tension? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
That was a third part of my answer. In addition to the social aspects and the economic aspects that we will not refer to, there was the problem of internal relations amongst the different parts -- or components of the Rwandan population. 
I must say that my analysis has somewhat evolved on this matter. With hindsight, it is possible to see that the period -- the Habyarimana era was an era of ethnic pacification. I shall not go into details of that, but it was so to the point, that some were led to think that the ethnic evil had been done away with and this ethnic evil will be awakened, because of the war -- and because of multi-party democracy. Because the two elements will add on to one another and, perhaps, we can go into further details on the matter subsequently. 
For a number of Rwandan Hutus, the attack by the RPF will seem to be -- whether they were right or wrong -- but the weight of mentalities played a part, and this attack would appear as an attempt to put in question the 1959 revolution; that is to say, the accession of the Hutu majority to power. I'm answering in brief, but of course I'm fully available to you in order to go further into details on this matter. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Expert Witness, you have talked about the military situation. The specific question I wish to put to you and to which you have already partly answered has to do with the role of the democratisation process -- the interethnic relations in the country. And please add on to what you had started saying without repeating yourself. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I wish to respectfully request from the President, if I can go further into this point, but I would need at least five or six minutes to do so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a long time. 
What do you need, Maître Cantier? Please assist the expert witness so that you get what you need for the case. 
$(Pages 51 to 62 by Jean Baigent)
1630H 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, my first question was put on the consequences of the war episodes, and inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda. The expert witness made an aside and talked about the consequences of democratisation. We interrupted him, and I would now like to -- the witness to be able to conclude his contribution, as rapidly as possible, on the consequences of democratisation on inter-ethnic relations. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Late 1991, democratisation was launched with a clear trend towards multiparty democracy. But the context is a context of war, so that several political poles will emerge, that of the attackers, the Rwandan patriotic army, which at the time made use of a strategy which was the conquest of power. But, of course, no mention is made of that. They will, instead of that, have democratic claims in order to try and destroy what one might call the Hutu bloc in order to weaken the Hutu population, that is to say the 80 per cent of the population, as compared to the 20 per cent represented by the Tutsi. 
Second bloc, or pole, that of the Hutu opponents. I am going to set aside the small parties and focus on the main ones. The democratic movement, which in some ways is at the head of the PARMEHUTU of the first republic, and from the beginning the war will bring about a break within this party. All the members of the party want to overthrow General Habyarimana, but all the members of that party are not willing -- or, rather, are not ready, in the name of their fight against Habyarimana, to give the power to the RPF. So the different trends will oppose one another within the MDR. 
As the war unfolds, and as the multiparty -- multiparty democracy system accelerated, because what is paradoxical, and what is incredible from the political standpoint, is that the war will not in any way hinder the advent of multiparty democracy. The precipice is in front, and everybody is running towards that precipice. 
Third pole, which might be called the presidential movement, with all those faithful to President Habyarimana and the official movement. This bloc will adopt the same policy as the RPF. It will attempt to represent the main group facing the opponents, and will try to weaken its direct opponent, which is not the RPF, because from the electoral standpoint, the RPF only represented 20 per cent with the Tutsis. Its opponent was the MDR, representing the Hutus from their central part of the country. 
So that everyone will officially play the democratic game, while cheating, in order to please international bodies, in order to please President Mitterrand. Because President Habyarimana depended on French military assistance, which was one of the prerequisites for democracy. So everybody will play the game of pluralism and democracy, whereas all of them are standing by their positions. So that was the key, and this was brought about by the context of the war. So one could not look at one without the other. 
And let me make an aside on this issue. For me, my main point of divergence with Alison Des Forges, who minimised constantly in work, which is very respectable, but which minimises -- or, she has begun to change her position gradually, that reality of the war. If you're not entirely immersed in the war situation at the time, you're advancing on only one leg. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
A question for you, Mr. Expert, which has concerned the Trial Chamber, all of us: That term "Inyenzi". From what you know of it, what is the meaning? Is it pejorative? Could you tell us, the historian that you are, how do you understand the term? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, you have given me the opportunity to give you a perfect example of the unfolding of historical knowledge. History is never written, otherwise it's a religion. In the case of Inyenzi, we are before a perfect illustration, perfect example. I, first and foremost, for many years I wrote that Inyenzi was an invention by the Hutu to designate in a pejorative way the Tutsi who, like cockroaches, attack at night. You don't see them, and in the morning they're on the walls of the houses. And I wrote it -- I wrote it in my previous works. And history moves on. History moves on, and we learn, in rapid succession, that the concept of Inyenzi is anacronym. It's an acronym invented as a standard by the Tutsi. 
Of course, I won't give you all the references, but -- it would take us too far from the subject at hand. But we have the interview given in an RPF newspaper by the one who founded the Inyenzi, and whose name was Aloys Ngurumbe, N-G-U-R-U-M-B-E. Ngurumbe, Aloys, or Aloisius, who in 1961 created the Inyenzi, and in the RPF newspaper in 1992 gave the origins of the word. You see, this is absolutely fascinating. It shows that between received wisdom and historical truth, from time to time we have to face up to concrete reality. And I would say that in regards to Rwanda, that is the stage we are as far as everything is concerned. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Doctor, Professor, in your work on Rwanda before 1994, does the name "Mr. Renzaho" appear anywhere? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, in the civil service organisational table. He was an important military authority at the time when he held an important military -- significant military rank. And then, of course, when he was part of the civil service. He was known among the other préfets of Rwanda, or the other colonels. Colonel Renzaho was particularly well known to me because he'd taken part, practically in the beginning, if I remember correctly, of the establishment of an excellent unit of Rwandan army where several French military colleagues, officers, served, the paracommando battalion. And that is why I knew him in -- well, there's no other reason, apart from those. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert, are you in a position today to tell us who was the organiser, or the organisers of the attack that resulted in the death of President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Well, Counsel, no professional historian can tell you that he is -- can identify. But he will answer, as I am about to answer, that there is a consensus among all experts, including Alison Des Forges, including Guichaoua, including Reyntjens, which appears to be to ascribe paternity of the incident to the RPF. On what do we base? In the present stage of knowledge and documents in our possession, a certain number of historical -- scientific facts, excuse me, that are extremely useful. There are the confessions of a number of RPF dissidents, where I don't need to name them; we know them. And the order -- the decision rendered by Judge Bruguière who seems to establish with a great deal of precision, that -- contrary to what the Prosecution has stated before and no longer states, that it wasn't the work of extremist Hutus who shot down the plane in order to have a coup d'etat and take over the reigns of power and implement of programme genocide. That is no longer claimed; that is ancient history. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Professor, what was the purpose pursued by the author or authors of this attack? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
If -- and I will say it again. If the attack was committed by those who at present are in power in Kigali, by the RPF, that is to say, or at least by certain members of the RPF, the attack is part of a strategy. I come back to the question of democratisation and multiparty politics. Let us clearly put ourselves squarely in the context of the times at that time. 
The RPF is predominating in the field as of the moment the French army withdraws. The Arusha Accords were signed, the RPF obtains practically 50 per cent of the army and a significant number of ministerial posts, but the RPF has lost. It has lost. Contrary to what many have asserted, the RPF has lost. 
And why has it lost? Because President Habyarimana understood that, contrary to what some experts still understand, he was -- he did not want to block the Arusha Accords, he wanted, on the contrary, to implement them completely as soon as possible. He wanted to go to the end of their implementation. Which is why, in the weeks preceding his assassination, he makes all the concessions. And it's the RPF that then holds back, because the RPF is faced with a big question mark. The ethnic reality comes through. Because what is due to happen at the end of the Arusha process? Elections. Now, whatever the scenario, even if the Hutu parties are divided, 80 per cent Hutu, in democratic terms, will always weigh more than 20 per cent Tutsi. 
So, the RPF leaders must go to the final phase of their strategy to conquer power, which is to resume hostilities. Which is now possible for three reasons: Firstly, the French have left. Remember, the condition -- non-negotiable condition to the establishment of the last phases of implementation of the Arusha Accords, the departure of the French. There will, therefore, no longer be French soldiers on the ground to bolster the RGF. 
Secondly, the Rwandan army's completely disorganised. The Rwandan army lacks ordnance, lacks ammunition. There is no resupply, there is no re -- building up of stocks for three months. And thirdly, the campaign, the disinformation and denigration campaign, smear -- campaign of smearing President Habyarimana and the tall stories about Akazu, the lies about the death squads, the impostures regarding the lists -- the pretence regarding lists, all this an attempt to make a Hitler, or whatever you want, of Habyarimana. So, as of then, they know very well, the leaders of the RPF, that no one will come to Habyarimana's support, to Habyarimana's rescue. 
So they decapitate Rwanda in committing this act -- attack, in committing that act -- perpetrating that attack at the very most delicate moment in the transition. Now, what is the most delicate point in the transition? We are between two systems. We are emerging from the constitution of 1991, and we're not yet under the constitutional principles of Arusha. There is only one element ensuring the transition, and that is the president. And he's the one who is killed. As of that time, the rest ensues.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning. The Court is in session. 
Good morning, Professor Lugan. 
Today, it is important to remember brevity, as I said a couple of times yesterday. 
And, Maître Cantier, as you know, the Bench has worked on the Rwandan issues for many years. We know quite a bit about the general situation in Rwanda, the political context, the history, the etymology, the word Inyenzi; all this is known to us. What we probably think could be useful in this case is, if you want to focus on matters of direct relevance to Mr. Renzaho. Please bear that in mind. The expert report is self-explanatory. It will be tendered as an exhibit. But you may wish to go into further details in relation to some of the portions of the expert report, if you think that is useful for the case. 
Please proceed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President, for your recommendations. It is, indeed, the main purpose for the coming of Professor Lugan as an expert witness, which is to enlighten the Trial Chamber on the specific role of the Accused in the matter. And after putting one last question to the witness, I shall go straight to that matter. It being understood that the role ascribed to him and his effective role are to be taken into account given the context that was prevailing in the town of Kigali throughout the events.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Professor, yesterday, as we were reminded by the President, we looked into the background of the situation. I have one or two additional questions to put to you which are purely historical in nature, and then we shall go onto matters which pertain more particularly to the préfet of the capital city. 
Mr. Expert Witness, my last question yesterday was to know what was the objective of the authors of the attack against the president. And the following question, which to my mind is important, is as follows: Could the perpetrators of the attack expect the events that took place from the 6th of April 1994 in the evening onwards? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
This is an essential question and it will probably open new perspectives, even of a judicial nature, because we are faced with a problem. Either the RPF -- it is, indeed, this group that assassinated President Habyarimana -- launched a process which would lead to what we witnessed, and did so knowingly, and in the specific case in point the Defence are upholding the official theory is completely reversed and turns against the RPF. 
Let me be more explicit. The RPF tells us that the Hutu extremists had planned and programmed the genocide of Tutsis. But this genocide, if it had been planned, started the day following the assassination of President Habyarimana over the ensuing days. If the genocide was planned, the RPF is responsible for launching this genocide. So it is a position which is difficult to hold, especially since we are aware of the fact that the RPF was fully apprised of all the things that were happening on the government side, on the side of the Rwandan armed forces. And so we need to put matters into context. 
What is the other assumption? The other assumption is that the genocide was not planned, and it is the thesis that I uphold. I consider that the RPF is exonerated, because the RPF knew that serious events were going to take place, killings, and I cannot imagine that the RPF might have made the decision to assassinate President Habyarimana, if it had known that the genocide had been planned. I cannot go beyond this response. Of course, we are dealing with a hypothesis. Was I clear in my answer? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, thank you, Professor. 
In order to be quite clear on an essential matter before this Tribunal, which is that of the existence of a genocide or lack thereof, can you tell the Trial Chamber in a few words whether, in full conscience, you consider that there was a genocide of the Tutsis that took place from the 6th of April of 1994 onwards? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, you are aware of the fact that the existence of the genocide has been established through judicial notice by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTR.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, I am asking the question to the historian, and I am asking the historian to provide us with his analysis and his conclusions on the existence of this genocide. You have produced writings on the matter. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
As far as I am concerned, the situation is quite clear. As I often stated before this Trial Chamber, it is obvious that there was a genocide. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, let us now move onto the issue of planning of the genocide, which is of importance to Mr. Renzaho, since he is accused of having participated in the genocide, and according to the Prosecution case that this genocide was planned. Do you believe on the basis of the research you were able to conduct, and throughout your work, that there was, indeed, a planning of this genocide that we have just referred to? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I am assertive in my answer, which is no, just as I was in your previous question when my answer was yes. There was a genocide, according to the present state of knowledge; and I wish to insist on that point. In view of the present state of knowledge, nothing enables anyone to state that this genocide was planned. 
And I will go even further. The last expert brought by the Prosecution who was supporting the hypothesis of a planned genocide, Mrs. Alison Des Forges, stated before this very Trial Chamber, and after extensive research on the matter, that she had not been able to demonstrate that the genocide was planned. What is strange is that in her testimonies, she also states that she's more and more convinced that such a genocide was planned. It seems to be inconsistent with any legal or scientific reasoning. So this is my answer to your question. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert, were you able in your research to determine whether Mr. Renzaho had participated in the discussions that took place amongst the senior officers of the Rwandan army during the night of the 6th to the 7th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
To my knowledge, Préfet Renzaho did not participate in these discussions. As far as I know, he was not present at that meeting, unless I am mistaken. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, do you know whether Préfet Renzaho participated in the meeting of the main military leaders that was held on the 7th of April of 1994, in the morning? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
On the minutes of this meeting, the name of Préfet Renzaho appears, but upon reading the summary of the discussions I have not seen any significant intervention from Préfet Renzaho, but it seems that he was indeed present at that meeting. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we now referring to the meeting at ESM in the morning from around 10:00 and 11:00?
@WITNESS LUGAN:
We are referring to the first meeting that was held in the morning, and indeed with military leaders. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you have seen the minutes from that meeting? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
I saw the name, I believe. If my memory serves me right, I believe I saw the name of Préfet Renzaho. Perhaps it will be necessary for me to take a look at my notes, but yes, I do believe I did see his name, unless I am mistaken. 
I am insisting on that fact, unless I am mistaken, because I cannot be certain about anything. Perhaps I could be granted two minutes to take a look at my notes, because I might be more specific? I do not have an absolute and inviolate knowledge of the situation.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary at this stage. Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, Professor, there is no discussion on this matter. It was just a follow-up question. 
Mr. Expert Witness, did you know what were the responsibilities of the préfet of the capital city in the area of maintenance of law and order, as well as security? This is not a legal matter I am putting to you; it's just a factual question. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, the role of any préfet is the maintenance and restoration of public order. And among his or her many duties there is that one, indeed. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, in light of the Arusha Accords, which you mentioned briefly yesterday, was there any other authority than the préfet who had similar duties in the town of Kigali? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Well, it's a good thing that you are referring to similar duties, because there is, indeed, UNAMIR that had duties that were of the same nature, even though they were not exactly the same. UNAMIR had among its main duties to contribute -- I believe that was the word used in its terms of reference -- to contribute to security, to law and order, and so on and so forth. So it can be said that there are two bodies, two structures, two organisations, which I believe we shall come back to the matter because we will have to show the organisational differences at that level. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Professor, perhaps you can make these observations regarding the organisational issue you have just referred to. Perhaps you could provide details immediately, since we are dealing with the subject. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, Counsel. Préfet Renzaho was responsible for the maintenance and restoration of public order without having the requisite means to do so, in view of the peculiar situation prevailing from the 7th of April, in the morning onwards. Whereas UNAMIR had the necessary means, but was bound by the clause of non -- of military -- of nonmilitary intervention. So we are faced with one of the other major contradictions of the Rwandan tragedy. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I shall put to you a number of additional questions on this matter which are at the heart of our concerns, that is to say, notably the resources or means that were available to Préfet Renzaho in order for him to discharge his duties of maintenance of law and order and security. 
Mr. Expert Witness, do you have a specific idea of the resources that were at the disposal of the préfet? What forces were at the disposal of the préfet at the capital? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
In times of peace, under normal circumstances, the préfet had no force at his disposal. The only possibility for him would be to commandeer forces -- law enforcement forces that are mainly the gendarmerie. But he has absolutely no authority over the gendarmerie and cannot command them. The forces commanded their own hierarchy. He does not have any authority, either on the army or on military units. So what possibility has he of commandeering forces? 
And regarding normal police activities, such as traffic control and so on and so forth, he had at his disposal a force that was mentioned several times before this Trial Chamber and which is well known to it, which is the communal police. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you tell the Trial Chamber if you were aware how many communal policemen there were at the time? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
In Kigali, of course? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, of course. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
In Kigali, in theory, there were some 250 to 300 communal policemen. But what is interesting is that these police will disappear into thin air during the night from the 6th to the 7th, so that only a dozen of communal policemen will be available. I cannot give you any specific numbers. In my report, I am referring to some 30 or 40-odd policemen, but it is a figure which needs to be confirmed. What I can tell you regarding the communal police officers, and I asked questions to my French informers and notably officers of the French gendarmerie who had retrained the members of the Rwandan gendarmerie, I asked them -- and it appears in my report; I asked them about their military value of this communal police force, and they were evasive, to say the least. Besides, the communal policemen only had weapons that were obsolete and they had no real training. No, it was a communal or municipal police as we have in any major city who are taking care about wandering dogs, about policing the market, and so on and so forth. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, what were the forces of UNAMIR posted in Kigali town on the 6th of April in 1994 in the evening, and it is related to the question I had already put to you on the specific mission of UNAMIR in Kigali, which was to contribute to the maintenance of law and order? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
If you take into account the outskirts with Kanombe, notably, we can estimate -- and this will be a realistic estimate -- that there was a minimum of 1,200 operational men. As for the -- and that was the force that could be used in the region, with the possibility of sending units more towards the north -- or, rather, with the possibility of bringing back to Kigali other forces that were posted towards the north. Amongst these forces some were perfectly operational, and I am referring more specifically, as we all know, to the Belgian units, the Tunisian units and the Ghanaian units. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, let us now move onto the 6th of April, in the evening, after the announcement of president -- the president's assassination. Were there any units deployed in the city of Kigali in order to prevent any disruption? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, are you referring to the Rwandan armed forces or to UNAMIR? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We are talking about maintenance of order and security, since this was the prerogative of the préfet of the capital city. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
It is surprising to note that during several hours nothing happened: No soldiers patrolling, no disruption, no notable unrest. And I am using, in order to make this response, the testimonies by General Dallaire, who moved around in Kigali, and who for several hours did not mention any military activity, as well as Colonel Maurin, or other witnesses. 
What happened was that a plan, a well-oiled plan that was defined in 1992 and upgraded in 1993 with the assistance of French soldiers, was set up. And the objective of this plan was the protection of the higher Kigali region; that is to say, the normal posts within the outskirts of Kigali. And the military posts we see in Kigali during the few hours after the attack are positions that are provided for in the plan for the defence of Kigali. But there were two innovations, strengthening of forces around the strategic junctions around the Nyarugenge plateau and around the defence areas -- defence areas or positions in the CND area where the Rwandan patriotic army had its barracks. 
As regards UNAMIR, what strikes me is that during all these hours, and the hours that will follow, there is a total lack of coordination. There is no leader. There is no one commanding over the men. And there was a serious problem of commandment, and this will explain many of the things that will occur subsequently. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, when did the unrest break out in the city of Kigali? I am not referring to the acts of war; that will be the subject of a question I will put to you subsequently. I am referring to the unrest in Kigali from the 6th, in the evening. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
On the 6th, in the evening, there was no unrest in the city of Kigali. The disruption will start, according to the information available, between -- until a few months ago, I still believed that everything started around 5:00, 5:30, 6:00 in the morning, but today I believe that the unrest started earlier in the night. It seems that it was around 3:30 or 4:00 in the morning that the first gunshots were heard around the CND. And, after that, around 7:00 in the morning, that the killings of officials started. After that, we do not know what happened, and we can only see any clear event which was observed in the beginning of the afternoon with the launching of the war process, and the attendant consequences. 
But, if I may, Counsel, I wish to state, and I believe my approach is somewhat different from that of those you have been able to hear in front of this Trial Chamber. I wish to say that these events were not written, and it was not destiny that such events should take place. Because if we backtrack a little bit, and this is explained extensively on page 48 of my report in its French version, in the middle of the night, when the meeting that was held with senior political leaders came to an end, the situation was under control. 
The situation was under control. The military leaders discussed extensively with Mr. Booh-Booh, who proposed a solution in order to resolve the crisis. The soldiers agreed with General Dallaire. And General Dallaire was requested to inform the RPF that anything that might be -- or any action that might be undertaken by the government forces was aimed at putting the Arusha Accords process back on track. 
If we take the example of Colonel Bagosora, in the middle of the night he went back home and went to bed because the situation was under control. And the situation will know a clear reversal when the RPF decides to launch the ultimate phase in its policy of conquest, that is to say, the general offensive. And from then on, no one will be able to control the events in Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The source of Colonel Bagosora going to bed, is that his testimony? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Well, it's simply a way of speaking because, in fact, he didn't go to bed he went to take a shower. It was just an image I was making use of. I believe I have worked at length on the specific case of Colonel Bagosora, and I believe I have been able to demonstrate that contrary to what was written by Reyntjens, there was no hidden agenda. I explained it at length before this Trial Chamber. I am deeply convinced that there is a sequence of events which is legal, which is mine, and one that is pure fantasy, which is that of my colleague and friend, Reyntjens. 
All that to say that when the meeting that followed the meeting with Mr. Booh-Booh came to an end, the city of Kigali was calm, simply because in spite of the horrible tragedy that had just befell Rwanda, the spirit of reaction and responsibility of the soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces made it possible to calm the volcanoes that might erupt. And I'm saying that the situation was under control. Nothing happened. And, once again -- once again, the launching of the activities -- sorry, the launching of hostilities came from the RPF with shots. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone is off. The interpreters cannot hear his testimony. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have answered my question about the source. That's fine. Thank you. 
What is the next question, please? 
Do you have a question, Judge Egorov?
@JUDGE EGOROV:
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just push the button. 
So, now, it is Maître Cantier to ask the next question, please. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am much obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, there is one matter that is in my mind, and I believe is in the minds of all of us present here, because I believe that we are all convinced that this genocide could have been avoided. Even if the situation was under control as you state, why is it that the United Nations forces did not deploy in the capital city as a preventive measure in order to show its men and deter any action from troublemakers, since we know that they will indeed act from the 7th onwards? Why was there not such a reaction on the part of the military leaders, and especially the military leader of the UNAMIR forces? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Mr. Booh-Booh is quite clear on the matter, and he clearly states that his subordinate made a mistake. He clearly states that his subordinate did not report to him and that his subordinate did not mind his own business. Instead of acting as a soldier, and instead of adopting military measures in coordination with the Rwandan armed forces, and perhaps in coordination with the Rwandan patriotic army, he completely went out of his prerogatives; and instead of remaining at his post of command during the night of the 6th to the 7th, he moved around Kigali and participated in the meeting of political -- of military leaders during which he appeared as a political leader, since he pronounced himself in favour of Agathe Uwilingiyimana. This is the responsibility of Dallaire. He was not fulfilling the part that was his. 
Subsequently, when the military situation will evolve to the stage we are all aware of, his hesitations, his incapacity to act, and I would say his absence of self-control, will be the origin of the tragedy. And for any historian who is somewhat versed in military matters, it is almost indecent to see or to witness the role given by the media to General Dallaire, a positive role, when General Dallaire has significant responsibility in the development of this tragedy. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
$(Microphones overlapping) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But didn't UNAMIR have a mandate limited by the Security Council? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Mr. President, your question is quite a normal one and is quite legal in nature. But, Mr. President, when one is a military leader, when you have a mandate that is binding to you, and when you have people who are being killed under your very eyes, well, your duty is to go beyond your mandate. And in any war situation and in any similar situation, a leader makes use of the resources available to him and does not shield behind legal matters, which is an easy alibi to hide one's irresponsibility. And in the specific case of the death of the Belgian Blue Helmets, I do not hesitate to say that it is a show of true cowardice, because what -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, he should have violated the mandate of the Security Council?
Please don't use words like that in the courtroom. Cowardice is a very strong word, we don't like it. 
But should he have violated the mandate? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Mr. President, I believe I have used this strong word on purpose, which shocked you. I am alluding to a very specific event. When a leader passes by and sees two of his men being lynched and he does not intervene to the peril of his own life, it is a behaviour which is unacceptable in any army throughout the world. That is all.
Now I wish to withdraw what I said. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Professor, we are not dealing with the matter at hand.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, as you stated, this is a question to which I would personally want to have an answer. I was not referring to any war acts, but I was referring to the deployment of UNAMIR within the framework of the maintenance of order and security, which was one of the terms of reference of UNAMIR, the deployment of UNAMIR forces in Kigali in whole or in part, which from what we know was not yet affected by any unrest from the evening of the 6th of April. So that was the question I put to Professor Lugan, and his explanation on what might be considered a serious fault.
@WITNESS LUGAN:
The Court has been presented with a map of Kigali. Kigali has two plateaus, a lower zone and a passage area. It is obvious that if UNAMIR had deployed in Kigali and displayed its force, its mere presence, that would have reassured the population to start with. When it was seen that the population was abandoned to itself, they had to take initiatives because nobody was defending them. 
Secondly -- and this is really fundamental -- that deployment would have dissuaded the RPF from attacking because it would have faced an international force that would have placed it in a back posture. 
That is why, Mr. President, I am very hard on General Dallaire because he had all the means at his disposal; first, as part of his terms of reference; and, secondly, once the nightmare had started, he had to go beyond those terms of reference, because, I mean, he was not assisting a person in danger.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Well, Professor, it is on that precise question, a prior deployment before the commencement of the killings -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier, we are not so interested in Professor Lugan giving evaluations of Alison Des Forges's personality or General Dallaire's behaviour. Can you help us to steer his testimony in relation to the core of the case, please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Professor, please let us avoid controversies with regard to some of the players or the analysis of the tragedy. 
My question deals directly with the case of Mr. Renzaho because it affects the security situation of the city of Kigali. My question, Mr. Expert, please, in a very concise manner, can you tell us, when fighting started in the city of Kigali, as you mentioned, what was the progress, what was the development of such fighting in the days that followed? And it is for that reason that I asked you to prepare a map that will help us to visualise and better understand the evolution of the military situation, then I will ask you a question on the impact of that situation on security in the city of Kigali. 
So, Expert, can you briefly tell us something about the evolution of the fighting in the city of Kigali? I believe that with the help of your map, we will make out the zones that remained under control of the republic. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I apologise to the Chamber for the document I am going to present. Because it is handwritten, it is not a perfect map. How am I going to do this? Is there a camera or something? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you a sketch in front of you there? Can you just show it to me so that I know the size of the document? All right. We could try the screen and see whether it is at all possible, but the best way would have been to have made photocopies and distributed it to everyone in the courtroom. Let's try the screen. 
But maybe it is possible for you to start orally, based on the map, and then we can come back to the sketch afterwards. 
Why don't you try this without walking over to the screen? We will see whether we need you to move. 
What is your answer? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, sir, a few technical constraints. It's all right, but the problem is that to understand the map there are colours and we don't have a system of colour photocopying.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Expert, I believe you have the map you have prepared before you. So you can tell us, since we know a lot here in this Chamber; we know a lot about the city of Kigali. Can you tell us something about the evolution of the situation on the military front in the city of Kigali? And I insist on Kigali. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
While you start doing that --
Mr. Matemanga, maybe you could take the map and show it to the Prosecution, and then we will also have a look at it, on the Bench, and the Defence as well, while the witness is explaining what he is about to do. So, please take the map.
You can manage without the map for a couple of seconds.
Just let us have a look at it, please. 
What's your first question, Maître? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, the fighting that began on 7 April 1994, what were the zones that were affected, especially in the Kigali city préfecture by the fighting? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Well, since we are in the military domain, you are asking me to jump on the sides in the night without a map. I see that experts in parachutes are smiling. 
Mr. President, humbly, can I have my map back? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you will get it back in a moment. But I am sure you remember which zones were particularly affected. Do you remember? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
All right. Fighting resumed the night of the 6th to the 7th. There is a debate on the exact moment. So, enable me to try to fine-tune the moment between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. in the morning. So, firing resumed at the CND area, and an APR offensive started from the CND. And that offensive lasted until 9 April. That's the first phase. 
I can make out four major phases in the fighting in Kigali. Four phases: The first phase from 7 to 9 April; a major turning point on 11 April; another turning point on 5 or 6 May; and the last phase, between the 1st and 3rd of July. So let us look at each of these phases. 
The APR operation was perfectly well prepared. From the tactical standpoint it was a model. From the CND headquarters there were two movements that started: One was targeted towards the Presidential Guard, and the other advanced towards the UNAMIR barracks at the Amahoro stadium, towards the airport. And this is happening early in the morning. It's hard to place the exact time, but the movement is over by the afternoon. And, at the same time, from the north, two columns are advancing. The first column moves very fast with a specific mission, reinforce the APR contingent, which in the first phase seeks to expand the CND perimeter. And that column advances directly towards the CND in a two-pronged movement: One moves toward the gendarmerie camp, which on my map is on point 1; and the other one moves toward the gendarmerie command post in Kimihurura, point 2 on my map. And, in the morning of the 8th, we are still in phase 1, the major column coming from the north takes a turn towards Remera and towards the UNAMIR barracks. 
From that moment on, the situation is very clear. The FAR are cut in two, split in two, because the airport road is no longer safe and that presents a double advantage to the attackers. The first is that they have weakened any possibility of help or support from the airport. And the second major advantage is that the best contingent of the FAR, that is, the paracommando battalion, or a part thereof that is available, is based in Kanombe so that paracommando battalion, for the rest of the whole battle, is -- it will be trying to defend Kanombe airport and not Kigali. So that was a major advantage for the RPF. 
The second phase -
$BY MR. CANTIER: 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert, do you say that the first phase ends on the 8th of April? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Up until 9th of April. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
So what is it that you have marked on the map? Have you indicated secteurs that fell under control of the RPF and the front line? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes. If I can show you my map, I will show you the front line. The front line from the CND will not change much until the end of the fighting. The front line would shift. In other words, the RPF is faced by the gendarmerie. Because the gendarmerie is fighting against the RPF, they will not be in the streets maintaining order. So, the RPF has in front of it the gendarmerie and the Presidential Guard and some other units. So the RPA will seek to go around and finally surround. So when you look at the map you will see some kind of encircling movement. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, at this time, having this explanation without seeing the document, could we not try something with the presentation of the map on the overhead projector, otherwise the explanations without the map will be lengthy and not very comprehensive? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let's try that now.
Mr. Matemanga, can you make everything ready? Let's see now whether the camera there can zoom in or whether the measurements on the map are too small. We will see. 
Please move over, Professor. Okay. Yes.
Now, do you want to point on the things here? Then you have to move over there and point? Will you do that, please? Professor, if you want -- you see, it doesn't help that you point on your screen, you must point over there, if there is anything you want to indicate to us. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Well, to make it simple, there are three phases. The first phase in red, there; the initial phase, during which the RPA obtains two outcomes, it expands its perimeter; second outcome, it obtains reinforcements; and the third one, it threatens freedom of movement towards Kanombe. That phase ends on 9 April. 
And the situation as at 11 April, I will not describe it to you. I will not describe the period from 9 to 11 to you because I don't have enough documents. But I will describe the situation from the 11th. 
From the 11th is the orange colour position of the RPA. The RPA has isolated Camp Kami there, which is very important because the military police was based in Camp Kami -- the military police that was responsible for law and order in case of mutiny within the troops. And the RPA takes control of the entire zone there, the zone that faces the city of Kigali, marked in orange colour. 
And between 11 April and 6 May, there is permanent shelling because the FAR front line; they would resist. And, then, the RPA goes around the positions there and completely encircles the city of Kigali, in blue. And what demonstrates the great mastery of the RPF strategies, their professionalism, is that they do not attack directly those defending Kigali, they leave a small passage for exit that will be used on 2 and 3 July. So as not to embark on a major military discussion, I will just mention the major thesis. The result is that Kigali city is subjected to various forms of military operations, permanent bombing and shelling.
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Professor, for your precision, for describing the decisive military situation over the four or five days. 
Now, Professor, our objective there is to discuss the security situation in the city of Kigali. According to your observations and research, what was the impact of that fighting on the security situation in the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
One can see clearly that in all the zones under control of the RPF, the RPF kills and massacres, and often with the use of lists, because in the Rwandan tragedy there were lists. But not on the side -- but not used by the side that people tend to place them. There were massacres, so the population fled. Urban dwellers moved towards the Nyarugenge plateau. 
But, in addition to that, there is a nightmarish situation. You shouldn't forget that we are at war. For years, and as I said yesterday, each of the RPF's offensives pushed towards Kigali hundreds of thousands of refugees. So, Counsel, you have to see one thing: The population of Kigali is about 100,000 persons and then it moved up to about 300,000 or more persons. So this city with that population received hundreds of thousands of refugees. And the worst part is that from the 8th or the 9th or thereabouts, the RPF, which is advancing from the north, actually empties the major refugee camps that are found a few kilometres to the north of Kigali, and refugees moved into the bottleneck of Kigali. Unlike what has been told to us, not all of them came to Kigali, some went towards Gitarama, but the bulk of them came to Kigali. So you have a double mass of refugees in Kigali and Kigali dwellers in the zone under control of the RPF, and the refugees that are seeking shelter in Kigali. So it is an unmanageable, unbelievable situation, and all of that is happening in a context of war. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Expert, for that clarification on displaced persons and refugees. 
Mr. Expert Witness, what do you know about the infiltrations carried out by the RPF behind the lines, as you have pointed out also on the map? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, let us be clear on this. I did not work directly on that topic, so I will have to rely on a number of factors, notably, what my excellent colleague Reyntjens told me, as well as the writings of Alison Des Forges and Guichaoua, and, of course, the detailed account of Ruzibiza. So it is on the basis of these four sources that I do confirm that since I didn't carry out specific research on that topic, and I will mention that there is a near obsession in our presence, because when one listens to the radio programmes of the RPF and when one observes its propaganda measures, one realises that the RPF seeks to demoralise the enemy by saying "We know everything, completely everything about what you are doing, so we are in there, everywhere." So there is a bit of fantasy, too, and all of that is linked up. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert, in your opinion, was that situation likely to foster the emergence or the magnifying of this whole issue of a fifth column within the city of Kigali, the city that Mr. Renzaho as a responsible person was in charge of?
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
We are actually facing a situation of a fifth column.
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, from what you know, can you explain to us how this process could be manifested in the minds and in the gestures of the Kigali city inhabitants? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Essentially, it is seen through the phenomenon of the infiltrated persons. The idea is that the RPF had its men in civilian dress within the defence perimeter of the FAR. And these infiltrated persons, who do their work, manipulation and misinformation and all that -- and the problem was even more urgent and real in a besieged capital. So if you look at it from a fundamental and psychological standpoint, there is the context of the heavy historical context that was coming back. That had been kind of shifted in the time of President Habyarimana, but it resurfaced at this time. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Therefore, Professor, with respect to interethnic relations, the projection of this psychology, how did it manifest? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I did not study the psychology of the killers. I believe we have good documents, some research work, notably the book of Jean Hatzfeld. But, to the historian, what is important and essential is to realise that, clearly, within the mass of refugees, the people who have lost everything, the mountain dwellers of Bakiga, who since 1991 have been living in makeshift dwellings on the sides of the roads, the Hutu peasant who is so attached to his territory, firmly established in his area and who is forced to abandon everything, to him, it is the unthinkable that is happening. He has to flee. He is uprooted from his origins. And it is obvious that among these refugees, there are persons who go mad, mad with hatred. So, well, we are not going to make value judgements, but these are observations. And this context in which we find banditry -- and we will come back on banditry by and by because it also explains a number of things. It explains what Préfet Renzaho would say on what was happening. So it led to an explosion. So it is not possible to look at this tragedy from a calm and clinical manner; we have to see what the situation actually represents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we agree that Bakiga, which you referred to, is spelt B-A-K-I-G-A? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now we need the spelling of the author, his first name was Jean. Please spell his surname for us? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Hatzfeld, H-A-Z-F-E-L-D (sic). He has written a number of books on the mentality of the killers. He notably wrote a successful book in France. I don't know the title of the translation in English, it is known in the French as Une saison de machetes -- The Season of Machetes. I am not talking about Hatzfeld's judgements, I am talking about the psychological work he has done. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you remember our gentleman's agreement yesterday? When I ask you for spelling, please give us the spelling, not the additional information. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I am laughing because of the translation, Mr. President, Your Honours. It was kind of amusing, "gentleman's agreement" -- the translation of gentleman's agreement.

@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, you've just indicated the context in which Préfet Renzaho found himself with this mission of maintaining public order and security at that time with the use of the mutual forces, that is the gendarmerie, could he have access to those forces? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
In times of peace if there was a riot or unrest in Kigali, which would not be a city at war, which would not be under attack from foreign forces, what would Préfet Renzaho do in such a case? Well, he would requisition the law enforcement agencies. And who was in charge of law and order? The gendarmerie. But in that case it was not possible. There was no gendarmerie to speak of. The gendarmerie was fighting at the front and could not take men from the front in order to come and restore law and order in Kigali. The gendarmerie intervention unit was isolated from the town of Kigali because of the attack by the Rwandan patriotic front. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
To which unit are you referring to? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I'm referring to the police unit, which was at the Kami camp, which is the military police unit, which is not in a position to intervene. And in Kigali, only the territorial brigades were left. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are spinning out of control now. Please remember the pause. Please remember the speed. Thank you. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Mr. President, I shall do my utmost. And in order not to waste the Trial Chamber's time, I shall be brief. 
It was no longer possible to requisition the gendarmerie, but there were a number of gendarmes that were left in Kigali. They were the gendarmes from the territorial neighbourhood brigades. They were very few, some ten men. So that the maintenance and restoration of public order, MROP, maintenance, restoration, public order, which was the duty of the gendarmerie, was not able -- was not possible, because there was no gendarmerie forces left. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert, at the stage of your examination we have now reached, could you tell the Trial Chamber what, to your mind, were the prerequisites for the restoration of order and security in the city of Kigali, after the resumption of hostilities, after the 7th of April, of course? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
There is only one, the ceasefire -- the cessation of hostilities. Why? So that the gendarmerie units that were at the front could be brought back to tasks of maintenance of law and order in Kigali. But as long as the expert -- the gendarmes, sorry, were at the front fighting, they could not desert the front lines in order to go and restore order in Kigali. The first priority was to avoid having the enemy pass the governmental lines. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness Expert, if there was such a ceasefire, who was for it and who was against it, who refused it or accepted it? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Well, this ceasefire was proposed a number of times. On every single occasion it was refused or violated by the Rwandan patriotic army. In order to save time, I wish to refer you to page 52 of my report where I give the list of the eight episodes regarding refusals of ceasefire or violations thereof. 
Mr. President, am I following your instructions? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, to perfection. At the end there, there are seven dashes I think, so there are seven episodes, is that so? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, indeed, seven events, Mr. President. I go up to the 15th of June in Tunis. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. Expert Witness, in your opinion, why were there such refusals from the Rwandan patriotic army, if we understood you correctly? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, the Rwandan patriotic army's going to win the war. At the time when the war is about to be won, the Rwandan patriotic army is not going to hand the victory over to its enemy. Because if there was a reversal in the Arusha Accords, at the end of the process there should be elections and at the end of the elections the 20 per cent Tutsis will not weigh as much as the 80 per cent of Hutus. 
Let me speak at a slower place for the stenographers. 
The APR has victory in sight. Its strategy is being successful, so the Rwandan patriotic army cannot accept the ceasefire. Because if there was a ceasefire the international forces would be positioned as buffer forces and we would go back to the situation that prevailed before the Arusha Accords at the end of which there will be elections and the 80 per cent of Hutus, even if they are divided, will prevail over the 20 per cent of Tutsis, even if they are united. It is as simple as that. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, earlier on when I was asking you whether those who had launched the holocaust were aware of the impact and of the consequences of their actions, you provided an answer that was not clear cut. But from the 8th or 9th of April, are the leaders of the Rwandan patriotic army, and its members, aware of the situation prevailing in Kigali town; that is to say, the killings and the beginning of the genocide? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, your question enables me to be more specific about a point regarding what you said; you said that my answer was not clear cut. Well, that is because I am logical. As far as I am concerned, there was no planned genocide. So the Rwandan patriotic army when it -- by assassinating 
President Habyarimana could not have launched a genocide that had not been planned, or it would mean that the RPA is entirely responsible for the events. That is quite logical and simple. 
Subsequently, what happened, and this is a new element in my research, and something I would not have referred to, or upheld, a few months ago. But after having interviewed, a number of military -- of Rwandan survivors who were soldiers, I realised that the few units of the governmental forces did fight with almost nothing at their disposal, practically no ammunition. From the 8th, in the morning, there was no longer any artillery that went back to Ruhengeri. 
So the Rwandan armed forces fought on their front line, which I showed on the map earlier on, on the CND, Faisal and Gitarama road access will not move. Why? Because the Rwandan patriotic forces were not able to cross that line; all their attacks were stopped. 
As for the attack on Kanombe and the paracommando battalion, it is going to staunchly resist. It will lose almost all of its supervisory forces, as well as a large part of its troops. With the few resources available to the Rwandan armed forces, they will still try to resist. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, thank you. The president was asking you to slow your pace once again for our friends, the interpreters and the stenographers. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I am not amongst those who see everything in black and white. I do not have a religious vision of history, but rather a realistic vision of history. And it is not because I am stating that there was no planned genocide by those that have been dubbed Hutu extremists that I'm authorised to say that the RPF let the genocide happen without doing anything. So, indeed, I accept this definition you gave of my response which was not clear cut, Counsel.
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, we're now going to move to a matter which has retained our attention in this case in an extensive manner, which is the matter of the roadblocks in the city of Kigali. 
Mr. Expert Witness, first of all, this phenomenon of the appearance of roadblocks, in the recent history of Rwanda, that is before 1994, had you already observed this phenomenon? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Not only did I observe it, but I also witnessed it. I was in Rwanda in February of 1973 when a number of events took place and I was present and I witnessed this phenomenon. So I know what a roadblock is. But at the time there were no massacres and we were not in a war situation. The phenomenon was recurrent. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Really it should be possible to speak more slowly. Everyone else is able to do so. Please do. 
Now, we have two versions in the two languages now. As to when your visit took place in February in a given country, was it in 1973 that you went to Rwanda, or was it in 1993 that you went to Rwanda? What did you say? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
I was a professor in Rwanda in 1973 and events broke out in February. And during the course of these events, I was able to witness the setting up of roadblocks. There were such roadblocks erected throughout history and I discussed the matter at length with a French officer, Colonel Robardey. I referred to in my report, R-O-B-A-R-D-E-Y, R-O-B-A-R-D-E-Y. 
Colonel Robardey, who re-organised the Rwandan gendarmerie and who participated in the setting up in 1992, if my memory serves me right, of a defence plan for the city of Kigali. And in the mind of Colonel Robardey and of the Rwandan general staff, one had to do the utmost in order to avoid a situation whereby the population would be forced to set up roadblocks. 
And it is for that reason, as I refer to in my report, that the defence plan for the city of Kigali provided for checkpoints around Kigali in order to avoid any unrest in the city of Kigali. But this plan exploded, so to speak, during the night of the 6th April, since the unrest started within the city of Kigali and the war broke out also within Kigali. Was I clear enough? 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Expert Witness. This phenomenon of the roadblocks, as you were able to observe before the 6th of April, would it come about following decisions from the government? Were there orders given to the population to set up roadblocks? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
In the present state of my knowledge and given the grey areas of this case, it seems that these roadblocks were referring to the roadblocks in Kigali during the period after the 6th April; do we agree, Counsel? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
No, sorry. I was putting to you a general question, since you referred to the existence of roadblocks throughout the history of Rwanda. I was asking you whether the setting up of these roadblocks during previous events were the result of decisions made by the authorities; yes or no? So we are dealing with the period prior to the 6th April. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, I am unable to answer your question. I can tell you I saw roadblocks, but I did not study the matter. So I do not know. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, this brings us now to the period after the 6th of April. We all agree on the fact that roadblocks mushroomed throughout the city. So, to your mind, was there any decision on the part of the government or on the part of the préfet on the setting up of such roadblocks? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
On what date, Counsel? What is your time frame? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
We are talking about the period from the 7th April. I put the question to you on the situation before -- 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Because from the 6th of April the situation is going to evolve. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
7th of April. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
7th of April, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You must stop these exchanges; interrupting each other at the same time. It makes the situation impossible for our friends in the courtroom. Pause. It's all written in the nine rules you have in front of you. Now, follow them. 
What is the answer? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
It seems that the roadblocks were set up in a spontaneous manner, in a very peculiar context, which is that of a city in chaos. There is no maintenance of law and order. UNAMIR has disappeared into thin air. The disciplined or organised units are at the front and the city is being looted. We have extensive evidence regarding these events. The roadblocks, or the setting thereof, should be interpreted as a sign of despair on the part of the population. The population was distraught and was left to its own devices and was not expecting any assistance from anybody. And that is the main reason for this fact. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, in the course of your research were you able to determine whether RPF infiltrators had been able to man these roadblocks or be in Interahamwe militia groups? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Ruzibiza provides extensive details on this phenomenon, and I wish to refer you to his testimony, or rather to his book. This book is a wealth of details and provides very important names. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, are you referring to the part of your report on pages 30 to 31? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Partly, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, did you see the communiqué of Préfet Renzaho on the matter dated 
10th of April of 1994, or do you recall -- or do you remember the contents of this communiqué regarding roadblocks? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Could I be given a copy of the communiqué, if you please? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Just one moment, I shall do that. 
Very well, we shall continue with another matter and I shall come back to this point subsequently, so as not to delay the proceedings. 
Still on the matter of the situation prevailing in the city of Kigali, especially with regard to law and order and security, during the course of your research were you able to determine whether there were any deserters from the army or the gendarmerie or possibly the communal police within the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Were you able to look into the number of people involved in this phenomenon? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, by definition one does not know how many deserters or mutineers there are. Let us say that the phenomenon was amplified after the 6th of April, but that it was already present before the events. And we note, and that will be a constant concern of the PVK, we note the desire to put an end to the criminal acts perpetrated by those who could be called, and that would be an euphemism, unruly soldiers. They were everywhere. They killed, they raped, they looted. But I should say that this is not a new phenomenon. If you so wish, we shall refer to it later on with the report of the person in charge of security under the government of Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
To come back to the phenomenon of roadblocks, are you able, in view of your research, past and present, to give us a clear idea of the people who might have manned such roadblocks? 
Mr. Expert Witness, the Trial Chamber has seen -- we have seen pictures, we've seen photographs, which I'm not showing to you, but I'm asking you whether you can describe this "population" and its origins. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
This is an impossible task because there were many roadblocks. The roadblocks could be manned by people who had things in common but who were different. I want to not mix up the military roadblocks, that were official and legal, with the roadblocks -- of which there were two types, either roadblocks set up by populations in neighbourhoods who were trying to defend themselves against bandits; and roadblocks that were set up by the bandits in order to hold the population to ransom. And this is the reason for which I cannot go any further than what I have just stated. If you -- Counsel, if you are looking for the communiqué, could you please refer to my memory and give me its salient points? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
From what I am being told it is Exhibit P. 49, which is a communiqué in which on the 10th of April -- we discussed it, but we are experiencing some difficulty in locating it. So it's a communiqué in which the préfet makes an appeal with regard to the roadblocks. 
@MR. CANTIER:
So it is Exhibit P. 49, Mr. President, Your Honours, which we have analysed at length. And in its 
third paragraph the préfet says, and I quote, "The roadblocks set up and manned by the population in the different neighbourhoods of the city are prohibited during the day. They can be erected during nighttime under the direct supervision of the security committee set up in the neighbourhood under the authority of the local officials. " 
$BY MR.CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Do you recall this communiqué? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I do, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert, do you know if that request made by the préfet to the population was actually heeded? If not, why? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Not all the roadblocks were dismantled, far from it. Simply because in Kigali at the time there was a state of complete anarchy and law and order had broken down. 
So one who had administrative authority, Préfet Renzaho, who did his best with the puny resources at his disposal to intervene. And what was the only means he had? Since he had no physical means, the only means, therefore, was to speak, to try to carry on two tasks at the same time. The first was to avoid the spread of demoralisation that could lead to a military defeat, so that means the population should not panic more. And, secondly, try to check or limit the disaster, and try also to curb the uncontrolled nature of the groups that were carrying out atrocities in Kigali. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, we have examined, notably, when the Prosecution was cross-examining 
Mr. Renzaho, a speech, or precisely an interview, granted by Mr. Renzaho two days after, 12th April 1994, in which he called on the population to be vigilant at the roadblocks and also to erect others. So this is on 12th April. So do you see any contradiction with the communiqué of 10 April 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I would like to make a small comment, which is important from the standpoint of methodology. 
Mr. President, I gave in this report, in the month of June, because I was made to understand that we were into the completion strategy and that we had to move fast. I was wrong because, for the first time, I'm given a report before the cross-examination. Of course, I am going to answer all those questions, but that procedure does not facilitate the work of the expert. Because this far, I used to interfere infine with all the documents. 
Having said that, we have here two elements. And if I can put it that way, there is a mix up. There is a mix up between two things that are completely different. Two legal notions that are radically different. There's a confusion between the defence of the territory and the maintenance and restoration of public order. 
Now, we are talking -- we are in Kigali, and we're facing a double situation which plays on these 
two elements. First, the conventional defence of the territory against an enemy that is attacking, and at the same time a complete breakdown of the law and order structures leaning towards anarchy. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is an objection. 
@MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm objecting because I do not think it is appropriate for this witness to comment on an explanation. The Accused has provided an explanation as to why he said what he did on the 
12th of April. It's not for anyone else to second guess the Accused as to why he said such things. 
Your Honours have heard directly from the Accused and, with the greatest of respect, it's not a matter which this witness can assist Your Honour in respect of. Your Honour has heard an explanation from the Accused directly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to comment on your submission of the report. It follows from Rule 94 bis that you have to submit your report 21 days prior to the date on which an expert is expected to testify, so everything is absolutely normal.
Now, what is it you can tell us about what the Accused meant by what he said? What is your basis for that? Do you, Maitre Cantier, need this expert to interpret statements by the Accused? That is the objection by the Prosecution. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, that was not the objective of my question at all. I am not here as a history expert to comment on the statements that may have been made by Mr. Renzaho, notably during his cross-examination. 
There is a document that has been presented to the Chamber, the radio interview granted by 
Mr. Renzaho, and it is on the situation of 12th April that my question is based. Could the expert have an opinion on the meaning of such a statement, but it is not a comment on the commentary. I mean it is not that at all. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which part of the document are you referring to now? What are we discussing? It's a document containing many pages. Which page are you in? On which page are you? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
There is a document we have, Exhibit P. 50, Mr. President. There is no French version to that document. And at the request of the Prosecution we analysed that exhibit, which is a transcription of a statement made by Mr. Renzaho on the radio. And in his statement he calls on the population to be vigilant at the roadblocks. Well, from what we understood -- I don't want to mention that because it will give the witness a clue. 
But my question is: How does he explain the préfet's call for vigilance at the roadblocks and the ban that he mentioned two days before in his communiqué? 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, all the Defence counsel asked was: What can you say about the apparent contradiction between Renzaho's formal communiqué, saying that there should be no roadblocks during the day except at night? And then this other one, where he's saying that the population should be vigilant and should install roadblocks. That's all that we want to hear. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Thank you, Your Honour. That question is very clear. I understand it now. Very simply because the military situation changed on 11 April, and we are into the second phase. I did not understand the question before, now I do. Because on 11 April, phase two of my plan of attack on Kigali, the RPF expanded it's perimeter and really tried to invade the south of Kigali. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
And what direct consequences could that have on the situation in the city of Kigali with respect to security? That is our concern. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
First consequence, which is a military one, and which further brought in more refugees into the zone still under control of the legal authorities, and with the added concern of seeing infiltrators coming in, and then we come back to this issue of the fifth column. 
So, Counsel, I will apologise because I did not quite understand your question. But it is clear that there is a situation that keeps evolving constantly depending on the outcome of the fighting and the strategy applied on the ground by Rwandan patriotic army. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Witness, in our system I cannot ask you leading questions. You give so many indications that I just have to rephrase and target my questions. 
Witness, on 12 April something happened within the government since we are talking about that date? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, undoubtedly, you are referring to the departure of the government. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, that is the question. We are on that date and we are talking about that particular event. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
The date of 12 April is important. Why? Because ultimately Préfet Renzaho, who was all alone with no resources, he no longer even had the moral support that was given to him by the presence of the government. So we are looking at a situation of complete abandonment. And it is obvious that, in the face of all this, Préfet Renzaho had to face a very simple choice, either he took the easy way out and left, and in that case he would not have been here today. Or, as a man of duty, a soldier and a civil servant of the republic, then he would assume his responsibility even when he had nothing, greatness and service of the military function and the administrative function. Am I clear, Counsel? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, and to conclude on the departure of the government and the situation in which it left Mr. Renzaho, the reasons for that departure, for that flight of the government on the 12th of April? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
We know them very well. The government was afraid of being captured by the encircling offensive around Kigali and that clearly demonstrates that we were in a constantly shifting military situation. The military situation that explains everything. I will come back to what I've said a few times before. The key to everything is the war. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you. Mr. Expert Witness, we are now going to talk about the issue of civil defence. Could you tell the Chamber briefly the origin of that concept? Is it of Rwandan origin, or does it come from elsewhere? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I have written at length on this in my report and I would not waste the time of the Court. I'll simply say in all armies in the world - or, most armies of the world, I'm sorry, there is that phenomenon that exists. To go back in history, all the Yugoslavian armies were organised on that basis. The Swiss army operates largely on that basis. And for us, in France, we have -- we have the principle of the operational defence of the territory, DOT. 
What was the philosophy behind it? And I'm sorry, I have to digress a bit to explain the principle. If I am going too far, Mr. President, then you can stop me, but I think it is important to explain it. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, what is of interest to us is to understand the principle of this system which you claim to be universal; you could summarise it. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
The principle is simple. It is based on the idea that the front line forces may not be able to stop an invasion for various possible reasons. So the army organises a system that would serve as some kind of second line whose intention is to kind of absorb, or snare, the attacker. It's a military system. Do you want me to continue to explain further? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I believe your summary helps us to understand. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
In the case of Rwanda, where we have a great difference in numbers of the attackers and the defenders, because we know that the RPA had very few troops and they were tactically well used, but there were very few of them. And they had to face a Rwandan army that was in greater numbers, but not as well tactically managed. So the numbers all over the country that were military supervised had to survive, thanks to the front line troops. That is simple and well understood. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, how is this concept, that is simple and well-known -- how did it enter Rwanda? At what time? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
To be clear, that principle was never really applied, and that is partly why the government forces lost the war. Nonetheless, a nucleus of civil defence was set up in the north of Rwanda and specifically in the Mutara region. But civil defence was never really set up, even though some major declarations or statements were made. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, I will ask you a specific question on what you are talking about: Witness, 1993-1994, on the eve of the events that are of concern to us, were there -- within the Rwandan government was there a civil defence plan to be organised at the national level? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Some reflection was carried out, sometimes in a very in-depth manner and with some initial application here and there. But there was really no setting up of the civil defence. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, you are aware of the exchange of correspondence at the end of March 1994 between the préfet of the city of Kigali and the ministry of defence; do you recall that exchange of correspondence? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, these are documents that are familiar to us, notably 
P. 24 and P. 25. 
$WITNESS: 
Counsel, I know these documents very well because I mentioned them in my report, at length I must add. 
@MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, I am referring to Exhibit P. 25.
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Sorry, can I have the document, please? Because I don't have P. 24. Sorry, I do have it. I am sorry. I have the document. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Witness, does that document outline the civil defence plan, or not, as it came from the army chief of staff, Déogratias Nsabimana, because that letter is addressed by the army chief of his minister of defence on 30 March 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, Counsel. That document falls in line, or fits into the military hierarchy that we are talking about. Would you like me to comment on it? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you give us a summary of the type of organisation that is mentioned in that letter with respect to the military situation? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have this as an exhibit in the case. It is more or less self-explanatory. Please now do not repeat what is in this letter, but simply comment briefly on it. Will you do that? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
That is correct, Mr. President. I will make a brief quotation and then I'll withdraw, "Popular defence whose structure is made up of soldiers who live out of the camps." And, of course, I will not add to that. So, a military structure. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
And without limiting that document to a single sentence, what, from the geographical standpoint, was the structure of that organisation? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, it was clearly military. Since the section became a cellule and the cellule become a section from the military standpoint, it was completely dependent on the army. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, are you aware of the correspondence sent on 31 March 1994 by the préfet of the city of Kigali to the army chief of staff? I believe I gave you that document. It is P. 25 of the Prosecution's evidence. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I have it here before me, Counsel. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
What is the meaning of the document? Not there, but within the context of things. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
It is a letter that has three lines accompanied by lists of names of persons, and I think the document too is self-explanatory. It needs no comment. It says, "I am sending you a list of reservists chosen for civil defence." 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will then have the 11 o'clock break. Based on the progress I assume you will have finished before lunch, approximately? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, just so. I believe another half hour will enable us to get to the end of our examination and will relieve all of us. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you, Mr. Moses, you have approximately for your cross-examination an estimation of --
@MR. MOSES:
Perhaps an hour. I have taken out a lot of questions. Last night I went through again and revised -- it may be slightly more than an hour, but I hope not. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine. Then we know we have control, and that was simply the purpose of these questions. We will then resume at 11:25.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Obliged, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, we were dealing with the matter of civil defence. According to you, are there any elements or clues enabling one to believe that in the minds of the designers of this civil defence -- the one we referred to a moment ago -- provisions were made for it to be the instrument of the genocide? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
My answer is clearly in the negative. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Could you briefly and specifically tell us why you have reached such a conclusion, since we have heard here in this courtroom the Prosecution expert witness who claimed the contrary? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Once again, I do not wish to waste the Trial Chamber's time. I wish for you to refer to my report; there's a whole chapter in my report devoted to that subject. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But, right now, Mr. Expert Witness, could you summarise for the benefit of the Trial Chamber your conclusions so that we might be informed? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
We are, with civil defence, faced with a military concept, making it possible to avoid a defeat. It is a military-war structure, which is set up to fight against a well-identified enemy, and I wish to refer you to chapter 1B of my report. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
But, Mr. Expert Witness, in that specific regard, when you are referring to the enemy, are you including, as claimed by the Prosecution, in this concept of the enemy, the population of Tutsi origin? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
In the civil defence concept, and on the basis of its definitions in the documents you have submitted to my attention this morning, it is obvious that we are referring to a competent enemy with the possibility, thanks to civil defence, to strengthen the army so to speak. 
But let us go further -- let us go further. The Arusha Accords had been signed. The theoretical disarmament was observed by the Rwandan armed forces for the most part, but the intelligence services of the Rwandan army noted that there were preparations going on on the side of the 
Rwandan patriotic army. The government armed forces complied with the accords, and launched a demobilisation process and accepted to consign their weapons, and were not supplied in ammunition or equipment. 
So, the Rwandan military authorities were in an untenable situation on the eve of the 6th of April, and this is the meaning of the document we referred to this morning. They are aware -- and this is confirmed by Colonel Marchal -- that this attack from the RPA is in the air. And the authorities are aware of the fact that the Rwandan armed forces will not be able to face such an offensive. So -- so, an attempt will be made, an attempt which will not be successful, to set up this process of operational defence of the territory. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, you have already partly answered that question. But, let me put the specific question to you at this moment: The civil-defence system, as we have just looked at it, had it been set up as at the 6th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
No, because if it had been in place, the military situation would have been quite different. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Can you tell the Trial Chamber, in what way it would have been different? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
If civil defence had been set up in Rwanda, the long columns -- and we are at the heart of military strategy, and at the very heart of the definition of territorial operational defence, what would the groups organised militarily have done? Those that were behind the enemy lines -- well, they would have cut off the major communication lines of the APR towards Kigali, and counter-guerrillas would then have been effective. So that the Rwandan patriotic army would have been cut off from its bases, and this would have enabled the Rwandan government forces to attack. The general chief of staff was wrong in not setting up a civil defence throughout the territory in order for the enemy forces to end up in a quagmire and to be attacked from the south. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, to your knowledge did the authorities and the PVK, in particular, in the town of Kigali try on one occasion or several occasions to organise the population for it to be able to defend itself? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, we're still within the framework of civil defence. You are asking me whether in PVK -- or, taking into account the specific case of the préfet of Kigali there was any attempts to organise civil defence because this is, indeed, what we're talking about. Is it clear? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, to tell you the truth, in this Trial Chamber we have heard about different concepts and it is sometimes difficult for us to have a clear idea of the picture, of the different concepts that were dealt with were civil defence, popular defence, self defence, civilian-self defence, and my question is whether, to your knowledge, there was any attempt to organise or set up one of the three concepts? 
If, indeed, we're dealing with concepts that can be specifically identified. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, I fully understand your question. We are all faced with a problem on the matter, because indeed, there are semantical differences, so that any superficial observer or a biased observer will try to hide the true picture in order to make this phenomenon ambiguous. 
So, in order to try and be as objective as possible, let us refer to the only existing definition, which is contained in the documents we were referring to earlier on -- that is to say, military civil defence, and I will be quite clear on the matter. There was no implementation of any civil-defence system based on that definition. Besides, the préfet of Kigali was not in a position to implement such a scheme since resources were necessary -- resources that would have been provided by the ministry of defence, but that was not the case. 
It was also necessary to apply the military structure to the cellule level. It was also necessary for the operational commander of Kigali to provide weapons, ammunition, rations to the men who would be involved in the process. And, none of these elements I referred to were met. So there was no civil defence in Kigali; no territorial defence structure was ever set up. 
Let me come back to the two definitions of maintenance of order I gave earlier on, and I can understand some observers and their confusion, because it is no easy task. For us French people, it is quite easy because we are born, so to speak, in this system of maintenance of law and order, with the gendarmerie in charge of public order, and operational -- territorial operational defence systems. 
But I can understand that it can be difficult for people who are not used to the system. 
So two things are being mixed up here: The territorial defence, civil defence are being mixed up with the more or less covert or structured -- or fought against improvisations aimed at maintaining and restoring public order in a specific context. That is to say that the forces entrusted with such a mission no longer exist. I don't think I can go beyond what I have just explained in my answer. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Expert Witness, in so doing I was referring to a document, and there are a number of them, but I was referring to one document in particular, Exhibit P. 53, which is a transcription of a radio intervention by Mr. Renzaho. And to be more specific, the references of this exhibit are K0145896, K0145897. In the French version -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have it in front of us, the French version. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. MOSES:
Sorry, could we have the English? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Naturally, my learned colleague, we are looking for such references, my apologies. I would not like to take bad habits here. 
In order to make your task easier regarding the English references, perhaps we could refer to the minutes since this radio programme has references in terms of minutes. The short excerpts I wish to use can be found at 3 minutes and 3 seconds. As well as the following -- on the following page at 
6 minutes and 9 seconds, so I believe we no longer have the language barrier here. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Professor, let me refer to two excerpts, so as not to take too much time, two excerpts in which 
Mr. Renzaho refers to activities that are called self defence or civil defence activities. So, under reference -- under the reference of 3 minutes and 3 seconds, it is indicated in the second paragraph, and I quote: 
"That is why it is necessary for the security committees to be set up in specific locations. These committees shall bear the name of crisis committee, and those are the committees that will supervise the patrols."
Mr. Expert Witness, what do you know about the committees, which apparently have two names: 
Crisis committee, security committee? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
May I answer? Well, I do know the document quite well, of course, since I referred to it in my report, and it is true that it is the principle of interpretation of the text and also of this semantical drift. It is obvious that one can use such elements artificially, but I could mention others to say that civil defence was set up. But what I'm saying is that it was not the case. It was not civil defence that was implemented. 
In this indescribable chaos, it was an attempt -- at least, when reading the inventions on the radio of Préfet Renzaho, which were quite interesting. The double idea that appears -- or, of the two concerns that are obvious are as follows: Try to control what is -- what can still be controlled; and the other idea, and I have no order of priority for both of them, they both come at the same level, the other one being: How to ensure a minimum level of security in the face of the looters, deserters, bandits -- let us call them however we please. Some of which might also, in addition, be infiltrators trying to make things even worse. 
So this is a war method that is quite well known. One tries to disorganise the enemy so as -- so that it will take away from the front soldiers in order to protect their hinterland, and leave the front without defence. So, Préfet Renzaho was in an extremely uncomfortable situation; he was faced with an unmanageable situation. He cannot abandon; he has to give the impression that there's a minimum level of order, when we know that it's no longer the case, and this is why he makes such statements that are aimed at boosting the morale of the troops. Well, I'm rather referring to the population that is distraught; that is being shelled because we have not referred to it, but -- but during that same period, there were bombs falling on Kigali. So that is the explanation which, to my mind, is quite simple. 
Let us not to attempt to interpret the tragic circumstances on the basis of assumptions or conclusions. Let us try to be realistic; let us look at things as they happened on the ground. Let us look at the situation, and let us not attempt to come up with -- I don't know which mechanism hiding in the background and plotting because this plot is imaginary. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. Expert Witness, and this will be my last question on the matter, in the same interview on the next page, K015 -- 145897, and for the benefit of the Judges and the Prosecution, the excerpt starts at 5 minutes and 2 seconds. There's a 2nd lieutenant who takes the floor, and Mr. Renzaho, since both of them are speaking on the radio -- so, at 6 minutes and 9 seconds, the second paragraph, Mr. Renzaho says what follows, and I quote: 
"I was referring earlier on to this issue of the committees. The committees are -- are entrusted with the task of assisting the conseiller in the maintenance of law and of security within the population. 
"I would like the committees to work correctly and to select trustworthy people."
And let me go on the next paragraph, and I quote: 
"These committees will be in charge of the control of these people that we will put in patrols. These people we will put in..." 
And this is a word in Kinyarwanda, but we understand it, "bariyeri"-- that is to say, the roadblocks, "these people who are to protect the population." 
Mr. Expert Witness, how do you understand these two excerpts? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
The first excerpt, if we look at the date of the verbal intervention of the préfet, Renzaho, such structures do not exist. So, if one were to claim that reference was being made to civil defence, which is something I question, this would mean that on that date they had not yet been set up -- the first element. 
The second element, Counsel, I go further than the paragraph you have quoted, I can mention other paragraphs. There is one underlying idea that can be found throughout the interventions of Préfet Renzaho: Fight against banditry, control of those who are raping women and children. I'm quoting from the text, and I wish to refer you to page K0145898. K0145898, where there is one sentence -- 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Expert Witness, since you're quoting from the French version, for the benefit of our English-speaking friends, it would be more indicative for you to refer to the minutes as I did earlier on, and in that way we can all know where we are. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Between 9 minutes and 6 seconds, and 11 minutes and 1 second. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If we look at the French version, 145898, there are four paragraphs on that page. Which paragraph do you want to quote from? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Mr. President, I wish to quote two excerpts from the last two paragraphs of the French version. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, go ahead. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
And I quote: 
"These committees are not being set up in order to chase the Inyenzi. The purpose of these committees is not to chase the Inyenzis, but they must be set up in order to monitor" -- and let me interrupt my quote and take it up further down, and I quote: 
"The people who are coming to rape the children and the women..." -- we are, end of quote, we are not in that framework of defence of the territories, as I referred to on several occasions, but, rather, in the context of maintenance of law and order. So, we are referring to two different things, and it is that point that is very difficult to understand. 
Effectively, I see the difficulty. It is a -- a fleeting passage, but which singularly explains in the light of the two definitions that I gave since yesterday. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Expert Witness, since you are on that paragraph, may I ask you whether the quotation I'm going to read out strengthens the opinion that you made -- or, would make you change your opinion? 
@MR. CANTIER:
So, it is the same document, Mr. President, third paragraph in the French, and the minutes are 
9.3 seconds -- 9 minutes and 6 seconds, I'm sorry, and here is the quote: 
"So, you see that we cannot wait. Whereas we would like everything to go on transparently; that everything should happen with discipline. Without discipline one can understand that we cannot win the war. 
"You understand. So, we would like that everybody be united. Where the population notices such bad practices, the first thing they should do is to defend themselves; those committees are not there to see the Inyenzis -- to chase away the Inyenzis, but they have to exist to discover these people who get into houses to commit these acts." 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
So, here is my question: Does this passage go to strengthen the opinion you've just expressed or it prompts you to bring out another analysis? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
That passage falls in line with my reflection that led to the answer I gave you previously. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is not surprising, since that passage included the second quote he read out to us a couple of minutes ago. 
All right, the next question? 
@MR. CANTIER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I -- I expanded on that on the basis of that document, not artificially. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
Now, Mr. Expert Witness, we are moving to the end of your direct examination, and I'd like to ask you a question which is of a more general and historical character. Here it is: Now, the responsibility of 
Mr. Renzaho as presented by the -- by the Prosecution is induced by a certain interpretation of history? If your answer is in the positive, can you tell us why? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
My answer is positive, and I'll tell you why. Because the Prosecution is following a particular strategy, which is respectable, and I think intellectually seductive for the western and Cartesian mindset. 
The Prosecution is a lot more seductive than the improvisation that we're trying to bring in in this Rwandan situation. That Cartesian view of a clandestine organiser that could do everything -- such as, the Wannsee conference that prepared the genocide of the Jews; that prepared everything -- all the machinery and so on, that is very comfortable for a western mind. So we rely on facts of reason that are ours. 
Unfortunately, we are elsewhere, in Africa, and in Rwanda, specifically. Because there are several Africans that don't have the same methods of reasoning -- we are in Rwanda -- and in the official history of the genocide, given that the Prosecution poses that the genocide was organised by a structure at the summit of the Rwandan state that planned everything, it is obvious then to take the organisation chart and look at the persons who are at the top. And before doing any kind of investigation, we have the culprits already made. Because the -- the -- the position is that the genocide was planned by the highest state authorities, and in that connection, as Molière would say, that is why your daughter is deaf and dumb. 
Everything is logical when you work from the -- postulate that the -- the official structure explains it, in my opinion, and it explains why Préfet Renzaho is here before us. It is obvious that another interpretation of history would lead to different indictments, but this is a standpoint of the history and I will not venture into the legal one. 
@JUDGE ARREY:
I have a question, Professor: What do you mean by saying that the Africans don't have the same methods of reasoning? Can you expand on that for us? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
I did not say so. Maybe I explained myself wrongly. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain further. In the heat of the -- my explanation, I may have jumped over the concepts. Actually, what I mean is that the African situation are not -- or, the European situation, just as the American situation are not ancient ones. 
We are in Rwanda, in a particular period of history and you, the Tribunal, have had multiple explanations. You've seen that the situation in Rwanda is totally different from that of Senegal. 
For instance, the ethnic relations are not the same. We have a very exceptional situation; a unique case. And to impose on a unique system, a European approach where everything is clear, and where everything is obvious and comfortable, does not tie into the reality. Am I clear there? 
In other words, the context explains a lot of things. And the transposition of analysis may lead to an intellectual resource, but in my opinion, it would not lead to a deep understanding of the phenomenon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you just referred to the "Wannsee" conference, didn't you? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Oui, oui. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, with other words W-A-N-N-S-E-E, that was your reference, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
That is right. Well, at the end of my cross-examination, I'm getting tired as the Honourable Judge's comment brought out, and you too, sir. 
What I meant simply is that in the case of Rwanda, we have not been able to explain and make clear what was done as in the case of the Jewish genocide. 
$BY MR. CANTIER:
@MR. CANTIER: 
That is why I wanted to ask you a question on the references that you are using, Mr. Expert Witness. 
My last question, Mr. Expert Witness, which is on Mr. Renzaho, in your opinion was it possible for him, in the context you've just described, to control the city of Kigali? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
With what means, Counsel? Since yesterday afternoon, I've been trying to explain that he had no means with his 30 communal police and with old rifles. No, he did not have the means. He was completely unarmed, and what I find extraordinary in this whole thing is that Préfet Renzaho did not run away from his responsibilities. 
How many men in his place would have left? They would have said, "Okay, I'll behave like the government. I'll going to Murambi; I'll take the first plane out to Nairobi, and I'll leave this hellhole." 
He would not be here today. This man assumed his duty, but with what means? Almost none. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you. That was my last question, Mr. Expert Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
You want to tender the expert report now as the next Defence exhibit? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, that is what I was going to propose to the Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a partial English translation of the end of the report. You will have no objection that it becomes the second part of the exhibit, even if it's a non-official translation? 
@MR. CANTIER:
No objection, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Can I ask you a question, Mr. President? I was not given a copy of the English version of my report. I just wanted to check. I could do that later, but even in previous trials, I've not had my report in English, which is fundamental because there are more English speakers than French speakers, and I would not like my thoughts to be distorted in the translation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This document will probably be subject to an official translation later, and I'm sure that you will be able to get it at some point in time. 
Mrs. Ben Salimo, the next exhibit number is then, for the Defence? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Number D. 109, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Wasn't the CV 109? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
I am sorry. It is D. 110, A and B -- if there's a French and English version. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 110A and D. 110B admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Lugan, you've given an interpretation of the events in Rwanda. My first question to you is: Do you accept that an historian's interpretation of events is governed, at least, in part, by their own world view? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
It is obvious, Counsel, that history is not like chemistry or physics. In chemistry, we know that this or this addition will give this. Here, we are dealing with people whose facts and gestures are interpreted by a human being. So, it is obvious that some element of subjectivity or subjectiveness will exist. And the entire work of the historian is precisely not to avoid, because it is unavoidable, to limit as much as possible that which, in his own background, could lead him to a wrong interpretation. The essential concern being -- and I think I'm working within that methodology, to constantly review one's approach in the light of sources that may appear. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In terms of your own world view, Mr. Lugan, do you agree that in the course of your testimony in the Ndindabahizi trial, you described yourself as a right-wing anarchist? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I think that suits me very well, with some aspect of a mousquetaire, if you like. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Can you help the Trial Chamber and me understand how does a right-wing anarchist - or, does it -- differ and, if so, how does it differ from a fascist? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, you could have asked me, too, if I prefer Bourgogne to Bordeaux, and tell me how the testimony of a lover of Bordeaux helped the Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we avoid the general issues of the witness's political point of view, and move towards the case. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You told the Trial Chamber yesterday, Mr. Lugan, that you -- the last time you were in Rwanda was in 1983, correct? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, in Rwanda -- before, yes -- inside Rwanda, yes. Because as I said, without giving further clarification, I came to the periphery of Rwanda, notably where a number of refugees were found because I worked on that topic, but I didn't go inside Rwanda. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, any Rwandans who you have spoken to, who would form the basis of your knowledge, are those who had left Rwanda; correct? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
You are not lucky with me, Counsel, because, as you see, I was known in the French academic circles of being a defender of RPF views. And up until 1997-1998, and given all my errors of analysis, I'm approached with RPF witnesses, rather than witnesses from the other side. And it was bit by bit that my thinking changed; notably here at the ICTR, following my various appearances. And then I noticed that there was a gap. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Lugan, but my question was a simple one, and didn't require a lengthy answer, and I'll repeat my question which was: The Rwandans you have spoken to, to form the basis of your knowledge -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel speak into the microphone?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
While we are waiting for Mr. Moses to speak into the microphone, there is a little problem in one sentence, just a few sentences back. 
Do we have the record correct now that you arrived in Rwanda in 1973, you stayed there for 11 years and that you left in '83? Is that the evidence? 
You see, we have now Mr. Moses saying that the last time you were in Rwanda was in 1983. And what you explained to the Trial Chamber was that you arrived in Rwanda in 1973. Can you just explain that, please, very briefly? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, Mr. President, I didn't say that. I got to Rwanda on 7 September 1972, and I assumed duty on 20th September 1972 at the university. And I left Rwanda -- I don't have the precise date, but in August 1983 -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you arrived on the 7th of September 1972, and you assumed duty on...? Now, please repeat slowly the date? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
16 September 1972 -- the 16th. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you left? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
In the month of August 1983. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
My question again, Mr. Lugan, if you could listen, is that the Rwandans you had spoken to who formed the basis of your knowledge are those who have left Rwanda. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, Counsel, but the Rwandans belonged to two categories. You have the Hutus, and this you probably know -- obviously know, a number of Tutsi officials, who are notably in France. I will not cite their names, of course, but who left Rwanda a number of years ago and with whom I've discussed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. You refer to -- as one of your sources on page 10 of your report -- a Vincent Ntezimana, N-T-E-Z-I-M-A-N-A, as someone you've relied upon. Do you know where Mr. Ntezimana is now? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, I think he's in the hands of the Belgian courts. 
@MR. MOSES: 
He's been convicted of genocide, hasn't he, Mr. Lugan, in Belgium? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
However, Counsel, I did not -- I focussed on issues that were of interest to my analysis, because if you follow your reasoning, an analysis cannot be based on examination and cross-examination of people who are here in Arusha. History requires the approach of the infinity -- of sources and elements. But, I expected that question because a counsel in a previous trial asked me that question. Of course, your file is empty and you have to -- you have to fill it, even artificially. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, how many of the people, who you have relied upon in making your report and your opinions, have themselves been charged of genocide or accused of genocide, Mr. Lugan? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
None of them, none of them -- those that I interviewed in France, and they were all Tutsis - or, the majority of them, and I do not think that your Tribunal has undertaken investigations in that direction. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, in your report you quoted -- in support of your proposition that there was little the Accused could do -- a document by the Accused himself; testimony about the tragedy that bathed the Kigali population in blood from 6th April 1994; correct? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Please, could you kindly point out the page to me? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you not remember relying on something the Accused wrote? A simple question; if you don't remember I'll try to locate it for you. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Please find it, please find it, it will be of service to me. 
@MR. MOSES:
In the English, Your Honours, it's on page 16. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
It will be, perhaps, the second-to-last page in your report, Mr. Lugan. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel, are you -- are you talking about the last-but-one page of my report? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will find this reference in your report on page 63, the third paragraph of the French version in brackets. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Mr. President, a prior question: Should I understand that counsel for the Prosecution worked only on part of my report? In that case, the issue is closed. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All that is happening now, is whether you agree that on page 63 there is a reference to Mr. Renzaho's document, dated 1997, just on the middle of the page. Do we agree that it is there? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
No, Mr. President, I do not agree, because I understand -- except I am making a mistake, or have omitted -- and this is important for a logical view -- I may be wrong. 
I understand that the Prosecution has only a part of my report. 
$(Pages 27 to 38 by Jean Baigent)
1230H 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please listen. Your report has been disclosed to everyone in this courtroom well in advance of the deadline according to Rule 94 bis. You wrote it in French. Everyone has it. But, as a working tool, the Prosecutor translated the last part into English in order to assist him in his own preparations. But this is immaterial. What matters now is your original. You will, on page 63, find that reference. Now, will you please confirm that it's there? 
And the mike, please. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Am I to consider that counsel for the Prosecution has read the totality of my report? Because if you have not read my whole report, I'm wasting my time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can be convinced that everyone in this courtroom has read the totality of your report. But now we are asking questions about parts of it, just like Defence counsel did the last three hours. 
Now, shall we agree that the reference is there? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Page 63 of my report. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. We all note the reference. 
What's your next question, Mr. Moses? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you satisfied, Mr. Lugan, as a matter of principle and of academic rigor, to accept the word of the Accused on whose behalf you are testifying? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I fail to understand your question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
In terms of your sources and the reliability of them, are you happy to rely upon the word of the Accused as the basis of your opinion? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I now understand your question better, thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. Let us be clear: I used this excerpt from the document by Préfet Renzaho, which I quote. I am exposing myself; I am not hiding anything. It comes from Renzaho, and I quote him. Why? Well, because I could have done as others could have done, and did not do, of course, and put information X or Y. And I'm quoting Renzaho for which information? Is this of fundamental importance? I did find this reference in Renzaho's writings saying that there were only two magistrates left in Kigali. So I quote, and then I provide the source. So this is perfectly correct work from the historical standpoint. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So, from the -- your interpretation of the historical standpoint, it wouldn't matter that someone themselves is accused of genocide? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
If Mr. Renzaho, who is here, is telling us that right now it is noon and not 3 in the morning, should I not believe him just because he's being charged with genocide? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you refer, in the course of your report, to interviews you've had with French officers. Correct? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, indeed. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, you quote extensively from a French officer, Maurin, M-A-U-R-I-N, and Robardey, who you have also quoted. Were either of those gentlemen in Rwanda for the duration of the period of the genocide? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
First I wish to put a question to you. What do you mean by "comprehensive"? Because if what you mean by that -- if you're talking about extensiveness, I could have referred to the reports of the officers, which is not the case. What do you mean by that? You are a -- can you tell me I mentioned part of their reports but not the reports in their totality? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, no. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Professor Lugan, we realise that sometimes, if a question is unclear, the witness may ask for clarification. But it is not the task of a witness to ask the Prosecutor or the Defence questions; it is for the witness to answer the questions. Now, don't you consider the question reasonably clear so that you are able to answer it? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
No, the question is not clear, because it is true that I made use of the statements of these two officers, but these statements were not extensively quoted. In French there are words that have a specific meaning. So, Mr. President, yes, I made use of the reports of these officers which were reports on the situation. One was in Rwanda, and it is Colonel Maurin, who was the French military attaché, who was present in Rwanda for a number of years and who, in addition, was the deputy of the general chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces. So he was someone who knew everything about the Rwandan armed forces. And this is why I'm saying that this is not extensive, because clearly I have not referred to most of the sources that were given to me by Colonel Maurin, because some of them pertain to other works. So I'm not nit-picking, I'm trying to be specific, contrarily to your indictment, which is not. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now you have answered the question. What is the next question? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
When did Mr. Maurin -- was Mr. Maurin in Rwanda on the 6th of April 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Of course, since he was there in his capacity as person in charge, as I said. But I'm mentioning it in my report, but you're aware about that, Mr. -- Counsel for the Prosecution, since you read my report. I gave the dates on which Colonel Maurin was in Kigali. If my memory serves me right, he left Kigali on the last French plane on the 11th of April, I believe. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And Mr. Robardey, was he there on the 6th of April? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Colonel Robardey left Rwanda a few months beforehand when France withdrew part of its forces to only leave in Rwanda the technical assistance, as compared to those who were there on the 1st of October of 1990. 
@MR. MOSES: 
You do not have any footnotes indicating where you get a good deal of your material from in your report, but I'm in particular interested in the numbers for the gendarmerie. Who provided you with the numbers that you say were in the gendarmerie in Kigali during the period of the genocide? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Could you be so kind as to give me the page of my report dealing with this matter? 
Page 56 of my report. We are there. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes, and you'll note, in terms of the numbers during the genocide on -- which you referred to on page 57, there's no -- no footnote. So where did you obtain those numbers from, Mr. Lugan? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Well, the numbers come from the reports on the manning of the gendarmerie, which were communicated to me by General Robardey for the previous period. And the figures -- or, the numbers that were the official numbers of the Rwandan armed forces, which I did not mention, but since I quote them in other reports and in other books -- do you wish for us to engage into a polemic to know whether there are more -- there are 100 or more gendarmes, or less? 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, Mr. Lugan, I'm not concerned at all about the numbers in the gendarmes prior to April 1994, but you are quoting, on page 57 of your report, things about the gendarmerie capability. And you don't provide any source for that information, do you? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
On page 58 I say the following thing, and I quote: "In total the gendarmerie in Kigali, all services included, had a maximum number of 1,200 to 1,500 people." So those are the results I arrived at when I added the different positions. In this type of report, I was not going to provide you with the numbers for each brigade. This is what I do if I am requested to conduct a military study. I gave -- I don't think it would have led us anywhere to provide specific details on the numbers of soldiers in each brigade. Is it useful, yes or no -- can we agree on the fact that there were between 1,200 and 1,500 soldiers in the gendarmerie? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when you used that number, where did you get it from? That's the point. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, indeed, from the tables on the manning strength of the Rwandan armed forces which I had at my disposal, since I have been commissioned in the trials of General Bizimungu as well as Mr. Sagahutu. So I can imagine that I have all the documents at my disposal. I have the postings of the officers. For the Renzaho report I was not going to go into extensive quotations regarding the gendarmerie. The expert is supposed to carry out a specific task, which is to provide a summary of the situation. I'm not writing a detailed report for the gendarmerie. And this is why I have an approximate figure of around 1,200 to around 1,500, because figures vary according to estimates. The UNAMIR figures are different for the Rwandan armed forces, and in order to be more flexible, I spoke about 1,200 to 1,500 to give an order of the number of people. And I might be mistaken, there might be a variation of 100 soldiers or so, plus or minus. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Now, let us remember speed and brevity. 
Here comes the next question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
In the trial of Colonel Bagosora and others, you had provided a questionnaire for Colonel Bagosora to prepare. Did you do the same in respect of the Accused in this trial? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
No, Counsel for the Prosecution, and I wish to make the same observation as I made earlier on. I'm quite frustrated to have had to write a report without having had cognisance beforehand of the examination and cross-examination. The only document from Préfet Renzaho is this document from which I took a quotation referring to the two magistrates, because it appeared to me to be quite telling and to describe the state in which the judicial system in Rwanda was. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let us repeat that the spelling of Robardey is R-O-B-A-R-D-E-Y. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
That is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, in terms of your sources, Mr. Lugan, do they include some of those persons at the UN detention facility here in Arusha? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I must mention a book by Ferdinand Nahimana which dates back to 1998. I don't know whether I mentioned it in this report or another. Off the cuff, no, unless I'm mistaken. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Have you spoken in person to some of the Accused at the UN detention facility to gather information? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
No, Counsel for the Prosecution. I simply requested from the President the authorisation to meet with Colonel Bagosora after the trial, and I met Mr. Nahimana in the corridors. He was one of my colleagues and one of my students, then he was my dean. And we shook hands. And I didn't even know Colonel Renzaho. Earlier on I asked a policeman who was here, who was that gentleman there? I didn't even know he was Mr. Renzaho. So, no, I don't know him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We were so good at speed half an hour ago. Let's continue with this peaceful way of answering. Shall we do that? Here comes the question. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
What documentary material did the Defence for Renzaho provide to you to assist you in preparing your report? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Well, Mr. -- Counsel for the Prosecution, we are now dealing with extensive matters, and I must say that my memory is not as extensive. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'll rephrase it to try and assist you. Were you provided with copies of all exhibits tendered in this trial? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Since I don't have a comprehensive view of the situation, I cannot answer you either in the affirmative or in the negative. The representatives of the registry should give me the list of exhibits, and then I can put a mark on -- in front of those I received. But I believe this would -- that the patience of the Trial Chamber would be wearing thin. I told you that I did not get the cross-examination transcripts, as well as the testimonies, and this is regrettable, because apparently there were very interesting testimonies last week. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you receive many exhibits? Yes or no. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I received adequate documentation, yes. I received documentation. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Well, for example, how many radio interviews of the Accused did you receive? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
It was one of the most painful aspects to deal with, because there were so many. I have here a few pages. I had large quantities of them, which enabled me, by the way, to make progress in my work. I have them here; I can show them to you if you so wish. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you provided copies of, presumably, the open trial session of all Prosecution and Defence witnesses? Do you know, or not? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I was given a number of documents, but since I'm not involved in the cases, I cannot know whether I received all the documents or not. In my humble capacity as a university professor, I'm not in a position to answer your question. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And in the course of your research, have you read the interviews with the prime minister, Mr. Kambanda? All of them? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
So, a comprehensive view? No, I don't think so. Perhaps -- I don't know. As far as this case is concerned, I don't know. How can I answer your question? In order for me to be able to answer -- in the vast information available to me in CD-ROM form or as hard copy, if I were to answer yes or no, I would not be speaking the truth, as I stated when I took the oath. The truth of the matter is that I don't know. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. And I don't want to spend long on this issue, Mr. Lugan, but you will agree with me that in your report in the Ndindabahizi trial, you concluded in respect of the genocide that: 
"During the hours after the death of President Habyarimana, the massacres started in Rwanda according to a plan which was well prepared, aimed at physically eliminating Hutu senior officials of the opposition who did not support the Hutu Power. The genocide of the Tutsis took place at the same time." 
That was your conclusion in 2003, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I truly wonder whether you have really read my report. Because what do I say on page 2 of my report as a caveat and underscored? I referred to the Ndindabahizi case. I am sorry to have to repeat what I have already said on so many occasions, and I quote: 
"It is imperative" -- "It is imperative from the methodological and ethical point of view for an historian to revise his analysis, his interpretations, and conclusions if new elements are made available to him. Thus, since my expert report before the ICTR in 2003 in the Ndindabahizi case..." and so on and so forth "new sources have led me to reconsider some of my previous positions, and this sometimes in a radical manner." 
So we should not place ourselves on the same field as your learned friend. We lost three-quarters of an hour to come to the same conclusion. I have said that because of new sources, my opinion has changed. So let us refer to my present conclusions. 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, I don't want to spend 45 minutes on it, Mr. Lugan. And, yes, I had read your retraction. I just wanted to confirm that, up until 2003, you had published both expert reports and books which came to the conclusion, and your published opinion, that the genocide was planned, well prepared. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, you are making one first mistake that I'm going to correct. It is not a number of expert reports, but one expert report. Because in my second expert report concerning Colonel Bagosora, I had already reviewed my position. What happened -- in fact, the question is how come you had such a radical turnover? That is your question, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
No, it's not -- no, it's not my question, Mr. Lugan. All I was wanting you to confirm is that that was the situation up until 2003. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
The situation for whom? Where? Which situation? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is not dramatic. All the Prosecutor wants on record -- and it actually more or less follows from your preface to your report -- is that you have changed or developed your view, we can use those words, since 2002 to 3, and previously you were of the view that the genocide was planned. Isn't that simply the situation? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Quite clearly, but I say so in such simple words that I'm wondering why questions are put to me on the matter, since I stated so. And I even have references that are obsolete. 
I would have been interested, on the other hand, to have started with a discussion with you, Counsel for the Prosecution, on the reasons that brought about such a change. That would be interesting. Because then we would be involved in the scientific discussion, and you're not dealing with that aspect at all. You're refusing it, just as your colleagues. You're not dealing with me with the fundamental scientific aspect of things. Let us deal with it. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Can we take it, therefore, Mr. Lugan, that your position might change again in another four years on the basis of new information received, and you may return to your original position that the genocide was planned? That's possible? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, as I stated here before, my position evolved since my report was submitted because we have more and more evidence which tends to confirm that the genocide was not planned. So my thought process is evolving, ever evolving. So if tomorrow -- let us be clear, Counsel for the Prosecution. If, in the future, we have a scientific debate and you are able to demonstrate that the genocide was planned, that you're able to demonstrate that the definition of the enemy is part of it, that you demonstrate that there were such things as death squadrons, you show that the Jean Pierre case is not a fabrication, and so on and so forth, if you're able to demonstrate all this, and if you can demonstrate that the so-called Hutu extremists killed President Habyarimana, then, Counsel for the Prosecution, you will have before you a very respectful scientist who will have to bow to what you have been able to demonstrate. But that is not the case. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I'm about to move on to a new matter. I'm halfway through my -- if not more than halfway through my cross-examination. So if that gives you some indication. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. Thank you. There is one minute left until the lunch break. 
Has Witness TOA arrived? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, as far as I know, right now, no. On the basis of the information provided to us by the section, he should arrive in the evening. And I do not know at precisely what time, but we will require sufficient time to meet with the witness. We shall keep you informed and convey the information to you as soon as it's available. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just wanted to make clear that there is no other witness after the end of your cross-examination of the expert this afternoon. 
So then we know how this day will develop, and we will resume at 3 o'clock. 
$(Court recessed from 1300H to 1502H) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon. 
Mr. Moses? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Lugan, in the course of your evidence-in-chief, you referred in passing to Professor Reyntjens as -- in positive terms. And I believe you've referred to Professor Reyntjens also in your report, you've quoted from some of his work. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And without going in any more detail, whilst you may not agree with every conclusion that he has made, he's someone that you have a professional respect for. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Even friendship for him. We were together at the national university of Rwanda, and I have respect for him, so -- which does not mean I accept all his conclusions -- quite the contrary. We are in fact very much in disagreement on fundamental points. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Now, in the course of your testimony in the -- the Bagosora trial, you had said in -- in the course of your testimony that you had been following the trials here in Arusha, and it involved hours and hours of reading. Is that a fair summary of something you said? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
As I recall, yes -- from my memory I would say yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And did that reading of evidence include reading the evidence of Professor Reyntjens in the Rutaganda trial? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
No, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know who Mr. Rutaganda was, what position he held? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I did not look into the matter of Mr. Rutaganda. I worked on testimonies that dealt with the main things that interested me, the military for -- inter alia -- in particular. But I would not be capable at all of speaking in detail of Mr. Rutaganda. I just didn't look into it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Has your research involved consideration of the role of the Interahamwe in the conducting and carrying out of the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
It is only very tardily that I looked into the matter of the Interahamwe, and I must say and only secondarily, to the extent that what I know about the Interahamwe essentially is -- comes from the interviews from Jean Hatzfeld undertook -- we discussed that this morning, I don't need to repeat his name. And also what interested me in respect of the matter of the Interahamwe was the problem there is to know in how the organisation was created and how the organisation could take upon itself the role that it played. And the important aspect that concerned me was the very controversial aspect as to possibilities of infiltration among the Interahamwe. But I must say I did not undertake any investigation directly, or research directly into the Interahamwe. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Are you in agreement with the proposition that the militia were involved in the killings of the Tutsi in Rwanda, and in particular in Kigali? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
As to the -- the overall principle, yes. But killers came from everywhere -- militias, army deserters, et cetera. But, in detail, no, because I didn't work on it. 
@MR. MOSES: 
As you have expressed an interest to -- that the process is a learning process, and your knowledge has developed and continues to develop, to perhaps assist you in that, I'd ask that the -- there's a transcript from the Rutaganda trial of Professor Reyntjens be placed before you. And I'll read a quote from that. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, there's the English followed by the French. On the English, unfortunately under the old transcripts they're not -- the pages don't seem to be numbered, though there are lines. I'm looking on the third page of the English, and commencing with a question two lines from the bottom. There was a question put by Judge Pillay to Professor Reyntjens. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
And in the French, Mr. Lugan -- it is numbered in the French, it's on page 146. About two thirds of the way down there is a question from Judge Pillay. And there was a discussion with Mr. -- Professor Reyntjens about the Interahamwe. And Judge Pillay had asked Professor Reyntjens, "What about your assessment of direction by the leadership? Did that reach this wider group?" What I'm interested in, in particular, Professor Reyntjens -- sorry, Mr. Lugan, is a little bit further after -- two or three sentences down there in the reply. This is what Professor Reyntjens says: 
"One of the people who was clearly involved in -- I suppose I should say in killings -- was in contact with people like Colonel Bagosora and Colonel Renzaho, who was then préfet of Kigali. There is absolutely no doubt that Renzaho was in touch with the Interahamwe. He had been using the Interahamwe before, for instance, just to give you one example, to try and destabilise the MDR congress, end of July 1 -- end of July; I mentioned earlier this morning. So, in other words, who was running the show becomes increasingly blurred. It may well be that it was Renzaho. It was maybe Bagosora. This is sheer hypothesis; I don't know. But it may well be Bagosora giving an order to Renzaho, who would then relay that to the Interahamwe, you see. So, the command structure became, I would say, more blurred." 
Were -- now, Professor, were you aware of -- that that was an opinion held by your colleague, Professor Reyntjens, regarding the role of this Accused, or not? Is this the first time you have been made aware of it? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
This is a very interesting question, Mr. Prosecutor -- very interesting, because the trial was held in 1997. So we're right at the beginning. It is -- that is the correct date, 13th of October 1997. So we are at the beginning of the Tribunal's labours. We're in a very particular historical phase. It's a phase of construction -- edification, I would say, of the Prosecution, of the official history of the genocide. And Professor Reyntjens shows considerable caution. I think it is difficult to draw an argument from this document to put a haphazard theory, as pointed out by Professor Reyntjens, that cannot be taken for certainty. Were I to make a critical reading of this, in the French sense, it would seem that it is a hypothesis. He says it is well known but does not support that. So we are here dealing with an opinion that does not, I think, allow for concrete development. 
On the other hand, you won't -- it will not have escaped you, Mr. Prosecutor, that Filip Reyntjens also has profoundly evolved in many spheres. The Filip Reyntjens of '97 -- '95 -- 1995 (sic) is not the Filip Reyntjens of today. And when we read his books, his writing, it is evident that he is evolving. It should be interesting to ask him what he has to say about it today after his studies and the development in the meantime. I, as an historian, would not found an argument on the basis of what is theoretical. I cannot say more than that, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for your answer, Mr. Lugan, but just very briefly if you could answer my -- do I take it from your answer that you haven't discussed the role of this Accused with Mr. Reyntjens, in particular, his role in relationship with the Interahamwe? Yes or no. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
No, what interested me in Rutaganda was the motion raised by his lawyers in respect of the extension of the ICTR's jurisdiction. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Now -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You meant that the Filip Reyntjens of '97 is not the Filip Reyntjens of today; wasn't that what you said? I just want to get the year correctly. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Oui, oui. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And just help me with that clarification; no additions. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, Mr. President, 1997. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And even though we had the author earlier today, can you give us Jean's last name once more, with spelling, please. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
You mean Reyntjens, Mr. President --Hatzfeld, sorry, sorry. Jean Hatzfeld: H-A-T-Z -- Hatzfeld -- F-E-L-D. H-A-T-Z-F-E-L-D. Hatzfeld. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Lugan, have you read what the former prime minister, Mr. Kambanda, had to say about civil defence, and in particular that civil defence was, in effect, another word for killings. Were you aware that he'd said that? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I am aware. I am also aware of he -- that that person retracted, and I know very well under the conditions which he said some things in the judicial process of which we know before this Tribunal. But what would interest me -- what interests me is that he casts doubt on what he had written under -- and stated under particular conditions. 
@MR. MOSES: 
So you weren't aware in the Military I trial when he testified that he was not retracting what he said, but he was concerned about the -- as you say, the circumstances of his sentencing? He didn't retract; he indicated that he was not retracting what he'd said earlier. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Was that a question? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Were you -- have you read his testimony in the Military I trial? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, because I took part in that trial, so I don't agree with your interpretation. He changed his mind about what he'd said, but he wasn't given the chance to explain himself. So he was not exhaustive. He had to be elliptical. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Would you agree with me, Mr. Lugan, that one of the problems that arose at roadblocks where -- and even throughout Kigali during the period of the genocide -- was that civilians thought they could be judge, jury, and executioner in respect of those they considered to be accomplices of the enemy? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I'm very sorry, but I did not fully grasp your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'll rephrase it. I may have used a particular expression which may not have translated very well. 
Would you agree with me that one of the -- one of the problems during the period of the genocide was that civilians were taking the law into their own hands and killing innocent Tutsi civilians without there being any trial for those who -- who were killed? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I fully agree with you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
@MR. MOSES: 
At the end of your report, on the last page, page 64 in the French, and page 17 of the English, you refer to the Accused Renzaho's statement on Radio Rwanda on the 24th of April. And the -- the translation I have, Mr. Lugan, is that you say: "In which he appealed for resistance and asked that deserters be -- deserters be disarmed and punished". Is that what you have written? Is that a fair translation of what you have in your report? It's on the third -- oh. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes. I don't have the document before me, at least the original, but if my memory serves me right, and unless I am mistaken or forgotten, I was translating Préfet Renzaho's thoughts as they appeared to me from the Radio Rwanda transcript, the transcript of the Radio Rwanda broadcast. And here I am launching into a debate with Alison Des Forges. I'm debating the point with Alison Des Forges. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. And do you recall, in that speech that was recorded -- or, that there is -- that you have referred to, that the Accused was addressing a meeting of the youth of the parties that formed the present government? Do you remember that was the context? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
I don't remember that specifically, but thank you for reminding me, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And do you remember that in fact it is recorded that the Accused encouraged the youth to arrest all the deserting soldiers, to disarm them, and kill them? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes, I speak of that. Punish, disarm. Are you asking me to explain, or merely say yes or no? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I'll -- at the moment just yes or no. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Yes. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. So where you have recorded "punish", that was your encapsulation of the word "kill", where the Accused used the word "kill them". 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Deserters, in any army in the world, in any country in the world, when you're in a state of war and you have deserters, not only soldiers who've deserted and therefore failed in their duty, but those deserters loot, are in fact allies of the enemy, martial law is applicable, and martial law is death. In the context of traditional judicial proceedings, we know of such examples throughout the world. The problem -- Mr. Prosecutor, the problem is that in the instance, there were no military courts because there was no more organisation; there was nothing. So what -- what can you do with deserters who -- who loot, who rape women, who pillage? What, do you want to sing them a serenade? 
@MR. MOSES: 
I think you answered -- my next question was that you referred to what martial law happened in democracies, and you'll agree with me that in democracies military courts will try those who are accused of desertion; is that correct? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Do you want an example, Mr. Prosecutor? I can -- 
@MR. MOSES: 
No. Do you agree with me, in principle, that -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We don't hear you; can you repeat your question, please? 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
You'll agree that in democracies that you have referred to in your report, they don't hand over the decision as to who is a deserter and who deserves to die to a bunch of young people. 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
Mr. Prosecutor, let us not enter this debate that would be interminable. I will give you an example, because when a country that -- where there are -- there was a martial law structure that existed in 1917. In the French army there was desertion or mutiny. Hundreds of mutineers were shot, with at least an appearance of justice. They weren't, of course, handed over, they were killed. But they were killed. 
In Rwanda we face a problem where you can't speak of legality at all. There are abominable massacres, genocide, people are tortured. And among those who committed those abominable acts, you have armed people who were the deserters. You couldn't imprison them, there were no more prisons. There are measures that are well beyond us, we are comfortably seated here. But let us remember the context of war. And I'll stop there; it's pointless going any further.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
The present exchange is a bit unfocussed. Let us try to increase our efficiency. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Mr. Lugan, these very same youth of the political parties who the Accused is telling on the radio that they can be judge and executioner for -- without trial, are the same people, aren't they, who are being judge and executioner in respect of the Tutsi civilians? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
We are at the very heart of the genocide reality. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And bearing in mind what happened at the roadblocks in Kigali from the 7th of April 1994, do you still find it was a strange interpretation from Dr. Des Forges to call that a call to violence? 
@WITNESS LUGAN: 
To combat violence, there are not many other means other than violence in a society where violence is at the service of law. In a case -- a nightmarish situation like Rwanda, the law had disappeared. But I come back to my present earlier notion. I am not denying the massacres, the genocide, the killing. What I deny is the planning. It is obvious that I am not denying what happened at the roadblocks, because I have read Jean Hatzfeld. I have read all his books. No, don't take me down that road where I cannot go. I don't agree with you. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I have no further questions of this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Any re-examination? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
I thank you, Mr. President; there is no re-examination. 
If you allow me, Mr. President, I made an omission a moment ago when you asked me about the exhibits. So in addition to the report, I would like to tender the map, the map that Professor Lugan gave us this morning. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Sorry, a copy, but not my map, I need it for my research. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Professor, if you promise that we will not have to pay copyright, I think we will do it. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
It's my working document. 
@MR. CANTIER:
Yes, we will see to that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is something the Defence and the expert witness can discuss. Usually it's possible to make photocopies with colours under certain technical conditions or to draw an alternative drawing. And if that is being done, then a request can be made at a later stage. But we note that the witness doesn't want to lose his original until that has been done. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Professor, you left Rwanda in 1983? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
That is correct. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So the sources that you used to get information for your publications were all based outside Rwanda? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Not quite, because those sources are entirely involved in Rwanda. For instance, when I work on a document of the French gendarmerie, which are documents which are reports that were drawn up at the request of the Rwandan authorities, these are documents that were prepared in Rwanda before 1994. The sources on which one can work are also Rwandan sources. 
I am not into journalism. I am not following current events to describe things that are happening, like a journalist. The historian, by definition, cannot be in the historic event. If I have to give you a description of the Battle of Waterloo, will you reproach me for not participating in the battle? 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. So we will go to the next question now. From your own evidence, it is clear that you did a lot of research before you published your books and the report that you wrote. Am I right in that assumption? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, Your Honour. I have published a lot. In my CV I have not given the entire list of my publications but I have published a lot in scientific journals. I did not cite all of them, because that would have expended judicial time. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So how do you explain that after writing books that are published and making reports, you come back two or three years later to retract them after you had done a lot of research before publishing? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Well, that is precisely the question I was expecting from the beginning of this examination, and at last we are getting into the scientific domain. Why have I changed my opinion? I changed my opinion -- and thank you, Your Honour, for giving me the opportunity at last to enter into that debate. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
$(Microphones overlapping)...I want you to give me a reason why you changed, not a debate. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Because new sources came to my attention. If I don't visit new sources, then I can't write a new document. Briefly, it is because new elements appeared in the issue. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
So my next question is, what is the guarantee that what you have told us today won't have new elements that will change the opinion of what you have given us in court today; this report that you have presented? What is the guarantee? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
None, none at all. If tomorrow, Madam Des Forges or the Prosecution actually demonstrate that I was wrong, then I will be the first to say I was wrong. I am a scientist; I am not dogmatic. History is written here before the ICTR. 
@JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, did I understand you correctly that in 1990 some Tutsi soldiers deserted Uganda -- from the Ugandan army? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Honourable Judge, I use the word "deserted", but that term can be discussed. I am not going to get into a debate to waste the Court -- the Chamber's time, but there is a fundamental discussion. Did they desert or not? Because if they really deserted, then you cannot say these are deserters. But if it was a sham desertion -- I mean, we are in the context of an international context, so I perfectly understand your question. So I can't answer; special investigations have to be conducted. According to some major opinions -- I don't have an opinion; when I am not sure about something, I don't say it. So I cite opinions. For convenience I use "deserter" but the use of that term can be debated. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Are you in a position to provide us with the sources where you obtained this evidence, information, from? Some publications or books where this particular issue is being discussed in more detail? Just an indication. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Your Honour, that is right. There is a reference behind which I take cover. And I shield behind Prunier and Ruzibiza. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Is that your only source? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
We have sources that are difficult to interpret: French military sources, French military intelligence sources. I don't want to go down that road. I know them very well. To put it clearly -- to put it clearly, French sources speak of an aggression from Uganda. And I don't know from what level of reliability those sources should be treated with. That is why I mentioned it. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Do you have any idea of the legal position of those people who were armed, who carried weapons and crossed the Rwandan border in 1990? I am interested, in particular, about their citizenship. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Those who were members of constituted units of the Ugandan army were, by definition, Ugandan citizens or held Ugandan passports. But I have not studied the internal workings of the Ugandan army, but it would be strange indeed if general staff officers of the Ugandan army of Tutsi origin did not have a legal status or at least double nationality. I have not seen General Kagame's passport or those of the officers that were with him, but you have senior officers of the Ugandan army, you have officers and rank and file. By definition, if they are members of an army it means that, legally speaking, they are members of that country. I cannot go beyond that. But it's interesting because it's a source of debate. It's something that could be explored further, and I think Prunier is working on that. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
You mentioned that the military conflict in Rwanda was at the same time an international military conflict and an internal or non-international military conflict. Do you think -- or do you mean that this conflict was of that nature throughout the whole period of military activity -- struggle, that is, from October 1990 to July 1994 or there were some stages? Do you understand? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Precisely. My answer is going to be very clear and concise: Yes. I'll give you two examples, one at the beginning and one at the end. The offensive of 1 October 1990 undoubtedly from Uganda or with Ugandan equipment -- the assassination of President Habyarimana with equipment from the Ugandan army stock, and we have come full cycle. 
@JUDGE EGOROV:
So, should I take it that both Geneva Conventions -- not both -- Geneva Conventions and both additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions may be applied to this particular military conflict at the same time? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Your Honour, I am incapable of answering you on that.
@JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have your report in front of you, haven't you? Can you look at page 51 of the French version, please, the original version? 
On the middle of the page, the fourth paragraph, there is a reference to the interim government, and what is stated there is: "In fact, the interim government was unable to restore law and order, despite two speeches broadcast on 10th April, one by Augustin Bizimana, minister of defence, and the second by Prime Minister Kambanda; however, they were clear, calling for an end to violence, massacres and the need for the unity of all Rwandans for compliance with the Arusha Accords and punishment of criminals." So, is it your view that these two persons, on the 10th of April, representing the government, tried to avoid violence? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
If we base ourselves exclusively on the facts, I cannot place myself in the minds of these senior personalities. We observed that, effectively, all their statements are -- tend to make peace. And all the statements also appeal to the Arusha Accords -- as if these personalities wanted by all means to persuade the other side and international powers and to convince them of their good faith. I know very well -- I know the debate on interpretation and double language, but the facts are there, and the texts are clear; the rest is an interpretation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
As we all know, Prime Minister Kambanda pleaded guilty to genocide. Would that play a role in your interpretation of his speech on the 10th? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Mr. President, don't take what I am going to say badly. I am deeply mistrustful of the procedure of pleading guilty because it is so strange to my own legal philosophy, where it is called kicking out of touch in football -- in rugby. I am sorry to say this, but pressure was brought to bear on the accused. So, we see it to avoid (unintelligible) certainties of the procedure, and then it is everybody for himself, so I don't see how that that improves the situation, of course. I respect every person's legal choice. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have indicated that there can be no doubt that there was a genocide between April and July '94. But, in your view, were any government representatives involved in that process or was the genocide simply a result of private groups going amok? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Mr. President, all what I can say is that in the present state of my knowledge, nothing permits me to say that the genocide was planned. But it does not say -- it does mean that it didn't take place. I cannot go beyond that. That is another topic. I have not carried out specific research on that topic. But I discover a number of aspects right now, depending on the requests that are made to me by Defence teams. For instance, I went into the MDR affair for the Bicamumpaka defence and that has made me progress and in a number of years I will make a summary. But, for now, as far as I am concerned, I have the scientific conviction that the genocide was not planned. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I am not so interested in the planning. That was not behind the question I just asked. I am thinking of the role of the various actors between the 7th of April and July 1994. 
Now, your present research, does that enable you to draw any conclusion as to whether governmental authorities were involved in the genocide? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
I have not researched into that specific issue, neither have I researched into the Butare region. So, if you will, I have a solid approach on the period between 1990 and about end of April with regard to the fighting; but I depend entirely on sources and that is the area that is known to me. And I humbly admit that I can't know everything. So I am open to any new interpretation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just to allow clear communication, I interpret your answer to mean that you cannot form a clear opinion as to whether persons representing governmental authorities participated in the genocide. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Now I understand your question better, Mr. President. Let us be clear on this, and I am going to say this clearly. To me, the genocide was not planned. It happened, and it was obvious that it had to happen. 
I have not worked from the period of the beginning of genocide, you know, covering all the provinces of Rwanda. I mentioned the Butare affair because it is being discussed a lot at this time, but I rely on the work of my colleague Guichaoua who has worked on it. I have worked more on the military aspect and the political parties, but I didn't work on that issue. So my answer to you would be unsatisfactory. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is your answer: Yes, no, or I have to rely on other research sources, I haven't formed a proper opinion myself? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
To say I don't have any opinion may be going too far. For instance, there is a study on Butare with the Guichaoua report. And Guichaoua uses an interesting term. He speaks of the lack of preparation in Butare. It means that Guichaoua, who conducted almost all his research in -- on Butare préfecture, was in no position to say whether there was premeditation in Butare or not. So I cannot go beyond that. Maybe I will be commissioned to do a study on Butare, then I'll work on it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. Now, the word "governmental" can be ambiguous. Let me now move a bit forward and ask you: Were authorities involved, not necessarily authorities representing the government proper, with other words, the government as cabinet, but government in the sense of at préfectoral level? Were such entities involved in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
The only detailed example is Guichaoua's research on Butare. I am coming back to it. If you read Guichaoua, it is clear that some elements of the hierarchy still to be defined intervened. It is Guichaoua who is saying it, but I trust him. I have not researched on that issue and, by definition, I trust other colleagues, even when I have not verified what they say. 
But, Mr. President, don't ask me to go beyond this. I was commissioned to talk on the Renzaho affair in Kigali, and I don't know what may have happened in Cyangugu in any detail -- or, in Butare. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but you are an expert on Rwanda. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
But the expert on Rwandan affairs humbly confesses that if he knows everything, then he will be fake. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Would it play a role in your considerations that there are quite a few judgements finding representatives at the bourgmestre level or préfectoral level guilty of genocide? So far you haven't referred to that. Does that play a role in your reflection process? 
You see, that's my query. Isn't this of relevance when you are to answer the question whether authorities may have played a role? So far you have just said that you haven't done research on it. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Yes, I can tell you that I worked on the Kigali affair for which I was commissioned, and as far as that affair is concerned, I answer in the affirmative. Préfet Renzaho is not a suspect in that kind of charge. I have not studied the other secteurs or other regions of the country. I have never conducted research on those issues. And, of course, the enlightenment that I am supposed to give as a specialist on Rwanda is based on the work of other colleagues that have carried out pinpoint research on the issues, as I have done on the military issue. 
That is it, Mr. President. I don't have universal knowledge, but I know the judgements that have been delivered by the Tribunal. I know that there have been substantive decisions that have convicted this or that person, but I have not delved into the judgements handed down in a manner that I can discuss them with you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And my questions were of a general nature, not any particular préfecture. 
Now, that was the end of your examination. We would like to thank you for having come to Arusha again to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home. Thank you very much indeed. 
Yes? 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Thank you, Mr. President. Can I make a request to you, please, if that is possible? I would like to have a conversation for a few minutes with Préfet Renzaho, if possible here because I may not have time to visit him in prison? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be arranged by the witness protection unit. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Would the registry kindly accompany Mr. Lugan? Thank you. 
@WITNESS LUGAN:
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Prosecution counsel. 
$(Witness excused) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You mentioned that Witness TOA would probably arrive in the evening and said that you would have need for some time in order to meet with him before the testimony. That's what we heard earlier today. 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, he is supposed to arrive late this evening. I have not received confirmation of his arrival. I think it would be wise to programme him for Thursday morning. That is not a witness who would take too much of our time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Would it be possible to start tomorrow afternoon, and should he not arrive this evening, then you could simply send out a mail informing us that it is impossible to start in the afternoon, and as a subsidiary solution, we will then start Thursday morning? But could it be our goal to start in the afternoon on Wednesday? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we will keep you informed, because we have had a lot of ups and downs with delays in planes and all that, but we will keep you informed. We will face all kinds of situations. But, for now, I can't tell you more, but we note the desire of the Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any view on this, Prosecution? 
@MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, informal discussions -- and they were just that and no one can be held to them -- was that the evidence in chief would take approximately one hour. I can indicate that the cross-examination would take half an hour on the questions I have prepared. It -- I am not wanting to bind my learned friends to being one hour, I must say that because it may -- I know how these things can develop. Clearly, it would be my preference for the matter to be dealt with, if it can be, tomorrow afternoon. 
The only other issue, which I am not asking necessarily to be dealt with now, Your Honours, but at some point, we need to look at some sort of scheduling. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course. It would be the Chamber's preference to start tomorrow afternoon at 2:30, provided that the witness arrives tonight. If the witness does not provide -- arrive tonight, then we will receive a notification from Defence telling us that he hasn't arrived, and then we will have to postpone him to Thursday morning. Will that be all right with you, Maître Cantier? 
@MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we will know tonight. So if he does, we will commence tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 p.m. And if he doesn't arrive tonight, I will advise the Chamber thereof. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for agreeing with that procedure. We understand that that doesn't cause any problems. And if we do not hear anything, we will then meet here in this courtroom, 2:30 tomorrow afternoon. And once we have heard the witness in this examination by both parties, we will have a brief status conference to discuss the scheduling of the written closing arguments and the oral hearing. 
The Court is then adjourned until tomorrow afternoon.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning. The Court is in session. 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness TOA in these proceedings. You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.
$(Declaration made by Witness TOA in Kinyarwanda) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there a personal information sheet concerning this witness, Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. I just wanted to explain the difficulties that we are facing. This morning we were not able to open our door, the lock had a problem. So part of the team had to call in the 
security service to break down the lock and bring out the personal information sheet. 
So, I don't know what happened between last night and this morning. 
Maitre Cantier has asked me to express his apologies, but it is related to the problem we had with the lock. So the personal information sheet will probably come in during the examination-in-chief of the witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right. So we are expecting it then. 
We have received some information about this witness in connection with the motion. But for the time being, I think we can just start the examination-in-chief and await the document, just as you suggested, Maitre Nekuie. 
You have the floor. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. Fortunately, we have the document here. I don't know, maybe the 
registry officer will help circulate the document? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, it has arrived. Thank you to the Defence for having been able to provide it so promptly in spite of this unforeseen development with the door. 
Mr. Witness, you have a document in front of you. Is it your signature at the bottom of the second page and the first page? 
@WITNESS TOA:
Mr. President, it is actually my signature. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So this means the information contained in this document is correct. Isn't that so? 
@WITNESS TOA:
Yes, the information is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal.
$(Exhibit No. D. 111 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nekuie? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I would like to have five to ten minutes of closed session with this witness to start with my examination-in-chief, and thereafter we can move into open session. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No problems with that. That means we will have to close these proceedings for ten minutes and then we will open again. We will then move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 4] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
$(Pages 1 to 2 by Melissa Hook)
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness TOA, we are now in open session and your examination-in-chief continues. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness TOA, when and under what circumstances did you learn of the assassination of 
President Habyarimana? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I learnt of it in the morning of 7 April 1994. I got the information on Radio Rwanda and it was announced that President Habyarimana had been killed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, did that information have any kind of consequence on the attitude of the inhabitants of your secteur in April of 1994? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
From 7 April there were riots in the neighbourhood in which I lived. Unusual roadblocks were erected and unusual firing was heard. So there was a major change. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Now, concerning yourself, Witness, did you remain indifferent to that information or did you also modify your daily behaviour? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
After I heard the news I was afraid, and my neighbours too. My neighbours and I got together and commented on the news. And life seemed to have come to a standstill and professional activities too came to a halt. And, as I said earlier, it was as if life was standing still. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you have any opportunity to leave your home after you had the comments with your neighbours; did you or did you not? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I was able to get out of my house. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
On what date did you leave your house, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I left my house on 10 April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And when you left your home on 10 April 1994, where did you intend to go? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When I left my home, the RPF had just launched an attack, that is, in the Gisozi area. Many people were shouting saying the RPF had attacked Gisozi. Many people fled. And I, personally, and my group, we decided to seek refuge at the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, what was your itinerary when you left to go to the Sainte Famille church from your home? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
From my home to Sainte Famille I took the paved road passing through Kinamba. And I moved up through Muhima through the area called Yamaha. Then I followed the paved road to the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I will spell out that name, Kinamba, K-I-N-A-M-B-A, Kinamba. And I think Yamaha is a well-known name but I'll spell it out: Y-A-M-A-H-A. And Muhima is number 303 on our list. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, on your way did you cross any roadblocks? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I crossed three roadblocks from my home to the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, how did you manage to cross those roadblocks without being stopped? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When I fled I was part of a large group of people coming from Gisozi. And when the persons who were manning the roadblocks started checking the passers-by, we slipped through the roadblocks. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When you say you slipped by at the site of the roadblock, can you be more precise? You moved just next to the roadblock or you moved around the roadblock, from the area around the roadblock? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
We used little paths, paths not far from the roadblocks. Given that there were many people manning the roadblocks. It was possible to slip the crowd of people unnoticed and to use the paths, footpaths that were not far from the roadblocks. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At what distance from the Sainte Famille parish was the last roadblock that you crossed to get to that church on that day? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
The last roadblock I crossed was found at some 150 metres from the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And, Witness, when you got to the Sainte Famille church, how many of you were there, approximately, if you can recall? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When I got there on 10 April 1994 there were about 500 persons within the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Was there any person or any persons within the church to receive you when you got there, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When we got to the Sainte Famille church, we found other refugees who had got there before us. And they were received by Father Munyeshyaka and he was assisted by other young persons who were in charge of the reception service. And it is the same group, of Munyeshyaka and his assistants, who received us. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At what precise point within the Sainte Famille church were you settled, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I, personally, was on the left side, if you stand on the altar and you're looking down on the congregation. So I was on the left side close to the wall. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Should we then understand, Witness, you were inside the church or outside? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Within the church building, I mean. Your Honours, I've just mentioned that I was near the altar and you know that the altar is inside the church, so I was to the left of the altar inside the church building. And when you are looking down on the congregation, I am on the left of the altar. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for that clarification, Witness. You have mentioned a number of refugees who were at Sainte Famille on 10 April 1994. Can you tell us, Witness, from the moment you were settled there how you organised yourself to meet your needs: Your feeding needs, your health needs, your hygiene needs? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you do that, Witness, what was your time of arrival on the 10th at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS TOA:
When we got to the Sainte Famille it was afternoon already. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the answer to Defence counsel's question, please. 
@WITNESS TOA:
Well, given that there was an overlap in the two questions I would like to ask you, Mr. President, to authorise counsel to take over his questions. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Willingly, Witness. I was asking you how you organised yourself as from 10 April 1994 to take care of your feeding, health and body needs. I am talking of all the refugees because there were quite a few of you there. 
@WITNESS TOA: 
As far as food was concerned, the food came from the stores of Father Munyeshyaka. It was 
Father Munyeshyaka himself who saw to the problem of food. With regard to health, it was the 
Red Cross who took care of us. There was even a Red Cross ambulance that took away those who were seriously ill. 
Now with regard to the issue of hygiene, Father Munyeshyaka asked us to dig holes in the garden of the parish. That is where we had our latrines, emergency latrines. These emergency latrines were found in the garden of Sainte Famille. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. From that date on which you settled at the Sainte Famille church and to the end of April 1994, did you have occasion, Witness, to receive visits from the local préfectoral authorities? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
From the date of my arrival at the Sainte Famille church, I personally never saw the authorities visit the area. But I heard from the other refugees that the sous-préfet had come with members of the 
Red Cross bringing us food items. It was the other refugees who were with me who provided that information. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness. And just so the Chamber can clearly follow your story, can you give us the date on which you left Sainte Famille parish as from 10 April when you got there? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
As I've said before, I got to Sainte Famille church on 10 April 1994 and I left that church on 4 July 1994 when the RPF took over control of the city of Kigali. That is when RPF soldiers made us leave the Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well. Witness, up until the end of the month of April 1994, did you have any kind of attacks from militias at the Sainte Famille church? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
There was just one attack, and it happened on 22 April. That was the first attack that was launched on the Sainte Famille church and it was on 22 April. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
At what time of the day did the attack happen? And can you briefly describe the circumstances of the attack? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
On that day between 10 and 11 a.m. we were receiving refugees from CELA. Given that there were very many of us at the Sainte Famille church, we had to change our positions. And so I left my former position and I went to the door, to the main entrance, that is when the attack was launched on the Sainte Famille church. 
I and other refugees moved inside the church. The Interahamwe identified some persons amongst us and they told them, "So you're hiding. And you thought we'd not find you?" 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
So, how many people or how many persons were thus identified and what did you do with those persons, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I was not able to count the number of persons who were kidnapped by the Interahamwe, but I think there were between 10 and 15 persons. After having identified them, the Interahamwe had them brought out and taken away. So, after they crossed the gate of the church I cannot tell you what direction the Interahamwe took. I just saw them forcing them into a vehicle, but I cannot tell you what direction they took. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, were you able to know on that occasion if, amongst the Interahamwe, there were some of them who acted as leaders, leaders of the group? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
In the group of the Interahamwe that came to the church, they were all sporting the Interahamwe uniform. None of them had an official uniform, so they all had on the Interahamwe uniform. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did it appear to you on that day that they were obeying orders from some authority, Witness? 
@MR. MOSES:
That question, I'm objecting to it, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and that objection is sustained. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I will move on to another question, of course. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, let us move away from that incident on which you have properly enlightened us, in the Defence. In the month of May did any incident happen, any major incident during your stay that you can still recall today, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
In early May there was a major event; a shell, a shell was fired from the Gisozi area. We called these shells katiouchas. One was fired on Sainte Famille church. That is the major event that happened in early May 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Still in that month of May, did you face any attacks from militiamen, Witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before that, Mr. Witness, what was that word you referred to? "We call these shells" -- and then you said something. Please spell that word. 
@WITNESS TOA:
Those shells that were regularly fired on the Sainte Famille church were called katiouchas, katiouchas. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the spelling? Can anyone help in the Courtroom? Could it be K-A-T-I-O-U-C-H-A? According to the eminent French court reporter. Thank you. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
That is correct, Mr. President, at least the Defence thinks so. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, I don't know if the Prosecution wanted to raise an objection to my last question. The question was as follows: Did you in the course of May face attacks from the militias? Do you recall, Witness, of any such attacks or not? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
In the month of May the Interahamwe -- I have mentioned before that the attack that took place was launched on 22 April 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Does that mean, Witness, that after the 22 April 1994 attack you had no further attacks from the militias during your stay at the Eglis Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
There were no further attacks from the Interahamwe. After that initial attack, a group of gendarmes that were supposed to take care of our security came in, and thereafter we were no longer attacked by the Interahamwe. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
To be more precise, Witness, does it mean that up until 4 July 1994, when you left, there were no further attacks at all? 
@MR. NEKUIE:
It is not a leading question. 
@MR. MOSES:
With respect, it is, Your Honour. And I'm objecting to it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You know, when you are insisting over and over again after having a negative answer, it is becoming a bit suggestive. So this is an example where the common law people would say that the question is asked and answered. 
$BY MR. NEKUIE:
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, were you shelled in the course of the month of June during your stay? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
In the month of June there was shelling on a number of occasions, in that month of June. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Can you tell us where this shelling was coming from, and the dates, if you can remember? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
In the night of the 16th to the 17th we were awakened by firing. And in the course of that night there was a lot of firing, and people knocked on our door. Then there was noise coming from outside. And the next morning we learnt from the clergy that were there that the Inkotanyi had attacked and had taken away the refugees that were at the Saint Paul centre. And so we learnt that there was an 
RPF attack on that night. The next day, on the 17th, we were discussing the incident, the Inkotanyi attack. We were disturbed. And we saw Interahamwe coming, at about 8 a.m. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What were the Inkotanyi coming to do that morning at about 8 a.m., as you say, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
That morning at about 8 a.m., we saw the Interahamwe coming. I was sitting close to the door that opens out on the garden of the church. We saw the Interahamwe coming. They closed the gate and they came in firing. They headed towards the church garden and they were heading towards the church itself. I, and the persons who were with me, sought refuge within the church and I moved close to my family. At the time I had a child. So I stayed with my family and I told myself that it was better to die with my family, because we thought we were going to die. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And for how long did you remain in that state with your family, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I would say that I stayed that way for about 20 to 30 minutes. Well, that is an approximation, but I was disturbed, so I cannot be sure of the timing. The Interahamwe started firing. But I can say that it lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you able to know why the Interahamwe were attacking you and why they stopped, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Why the Interahamwe attacked Sainte Famille is not clear to me. But what was being said on that day was that the Inkotanyi had attacked Saint Paul and we could see where. We were at Sainte Famille, so we expected Interahamwe to attack us because they were constantly saying that Inkotanyi were hiding in the church. So they attacked because the Inkotanyi had evacuated the refugees at Saint Paul. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How long did that attack last then, and how did it end? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
The attack lasted about 25 to 30 minutes. I raised my head and I realised that there were soldiers telling us that there was no more problem. So I suppose that it was the soldiers who put an end to the attack. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were there any victims in that attack, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
There were victims at the time of that attack. There were deaths, injuries, so there were victims. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What was done with the victims, especially the people who died? Were there people to take care of the injured, or not? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
As usual, it was the Red Cross who took care of those people. The Red Cross removed the corpses and tended to the wounded as was customary. That's what happened on that day. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And how long did the soldiers referred to, Witness, stay on the spot? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Those soldiers did not stay long inside the church. I was inside the church because I was very afraid. I did not exit. I don't know how long they stayed outside the church. I was still afraid. That's why I stayed inside. I was trembling. So, I cannot tell you how long they stayed within the perimeter because I stayed inside the building. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you hear it said, or did you have occasion to see the préfet of Kigali there on that day? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I did not see him on that day. However, some people told us that they had seen him on the 6th, and he was with UNAMIR troops and the Red Cross. So those people told me they had seen me on the 6th, but I did not see him. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
The 6th of which month, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
In fact I'm referring to the 16th because the Interahamwe attacked us on the 17th. The préfet came on the 16th of June. That's what we learned. I did not see him personally on that day, the 16th. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And that day when the Interahamwe attacked you, Witness, where was Father Munyeshyaka? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When the Interahamwe attacked, it was about 8 o'clock. I did not see Father Munyeshyaka. I don't know where he was. When we saw the assailants arrive we entered the church, so I cannot tell you where Father Munyeshyaka was at that time. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you see him -- Witness, did you see him on that day, the 17th, afterwards at anytime on the 17th? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Yes, I saw him in the afternoon. He was trying to reassure people. He was very sad because of what had happened. That is when I saw Father Munyeshyaka. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Were you able to learn whether -- on that day after the attack whether Préfet Renzaho visited 
Father Munyeshyaka? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
We never learned of that and we never learned that Préfet Renzaho and Father Munyeshyaka met. I did not see them together and I did not hear it spoken of. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Witness, you have told us that you left Sainte Famille parish on the 5th -- 4th of July? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
That is quite correct. I left the church on the 4th of July 1994. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Until that date, Witness, up to that date the 4th of July 1994, did you, while you were staying at 
Sainte Famille, note any cases -- learn of any cases of rape within the perimeter of Sainte Famille parish? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Personally, I did not witness any rape nor did I hear it spoken of, and moreover we were one on top of the other inside the church. We didn't have enough room to turn over when we were lying down. There were people everywhere within the church and it did not smell good because it was very dirty. And I don't think rapes could have been committed in view of this situation in which we were. 
People from the Red Cross would come to help us, and if there had been rape, the victims would have appealed to the Red Cross. In May, after the shelling, UN journalists came and the victims would have spoken of it at the time. So, personally, from what I saw there were no cases of rape and I did not hear it spoken of. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you for that answer, Witness. Witness when you left Sainte Famille parish on the 
4th of July 1994, where did you go? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When the Inkotanyi took control of Kigali town, they asked all men ***************************** to help them, so I left. They gave me ************ and I began to work with the RPF military. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
What were your activities with the RPF troops, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I was asked *********************************************************** that would take people from roadblocks -- people who had been arrested by the RPF at the roadblocks, and we took them to places where they were killed. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Could you be a bit clearer, Witness? You carried people to places where they were killed. Did you know why those people were killed and who they were? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When they took control of Kigali, there were many Interahamwe left in town who had not run away. Others were members of the MRND. In the majority, it was those people that we found at the roadblocks manned by the Inkotanyi and it is those people ********************************. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Did you undertake those activities in Kigali town, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Yes. I first began my activities in Kigali town and we continued on the way to Gisenyi. That is where I exercised my activities ***********************. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
How long did you exercise those activities with the RPF troops, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I worked with them for a year. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And why did you stop working with them? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I stopped working with them because I had to look after my family. We were not paid. Peace was restored. So I had no reason to stay with them. I was not a soldier. They'd asked us to help them and that is why I did it. That is the why and wherefore of my working with them. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
And when you left them, Witness, what was your next occupation, and until when did you exercise it? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I became a driver, which activity I exercised until I went into exile. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
When did you go into exile, and why? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When I understood that the truth was being hidden; that they were not telling the truth about what had happened in Rwanda. I decided to testify and that's when they began to chase me. I learned that four civilian drivers who worked with Inkotanyi had been killed. And I understood that I would be killed because I held proof, some proof, and therefore I decided to leave the country in 2004. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Can you tell us, briefly, what sorts of proof you say you had, Witness? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
The first proof is that those civilian drivers who died and were killed in unexplained circumstances and those drivers knew many secrets they might reveal at any time. And the second proof is that someone was killed very near to my home when I was coming back from work one evening, someone was killed. 
@MR. MOSES:
I am sorry, Your Honour. I have been happy for them to lead this material, which isn't directly relevant to the matters Your Honours had to decide, because there had been some reference in the statement to the part as to his activities after 1994 in the final paragraph. 
We're now getting into matters of which there's been no notice provided to the Prosecution. And, therefore, I am objecting to it on that basis. As I say, I was happy for the matters we'd received notice to be led, even though they're not directly relevant. But we're now getting into additional matters of which there has been no notice. Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence? 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. We did not want to end this session in a polemic, and we will hold out our hand to the Prosecution. 
I will end that line of questioning there and I will very shortly have finished with my examination-in-chief.

I never had any personal relations with Mr. Renzaho. I didn't even know him personally. I knew he was a figure of authority, but I never had any dealings or relations with him. 
@MR. NEKUIE: 
Have you any personal interest in coming here to testify on his behalf in here? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I have no personal interest. I'm even risking death because before leaving the country where I live -- 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has mentioned the country again. 
@WITNESS TOA:
I met RPF soldiers who had come with President Kagame to that country and they asked me if I had gone there to seek refuge. I came here to speak the truth because I am a man and I believe in God. I have no other personal interest. I might have to bear many consequences because I came here to testify.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Witness, why didn't you go through the roadblocks directly on the way from your home to Sainte Famille on the 10th of April? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
The reason is a simple one: It was concern for my safety. You know that at the roadblocks some people were killed. And it is very simple. That is the reason why I did not go through the roadblock directly for my own personal safety.
$(Pages 5 to 14 by Melissa Hook)
1000H 
$BY MR. MOSES:
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you for that. 
So, do I understand that it was clear to you, as early as the 10th of April, that you were at risk -- you and your family, were at risk going through a roadblock because of your ethnicity? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I and my family did not dare to cross roadblocks because they were manned by people who were hostile of anyone who is of another ethnicity. And as you know, there were people killed at -- on those roadblocks because of their ethnicity. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And is that also the reason why you stayed at Sainte Famille from the 10th of April till early July, because you considered it was still too dangerous to leave Sainte Famille because of the dangers for you and your family? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Yes, I stayed with my family at Sainte Famille out of safety considerations. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Would you agree that at Sainte Famille there were several thousand people staying in the 
Sainte Famille compound, not just inside the church, but in other parts of the Sainte Famille compound? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Where I was inside the church, I could only see the people in the church garden. And the only estimate I can make is as to the people who were inside the church, and in the church garden. So I cannot give estimates for you of the people who were elsewhere within the Sainte Famille perimeter. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, thank you for that. And do I understand your testimony correctly that you personally never saw the Accused during the entire period of your stay at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
The entire time I stayed at Sainte Famille, I personally never saw the Accused. But I did hear it said, nonetheless, that the Accused had come to Sainte Famille on the 16th of June, but that is hearsay. 
I did not see him personally. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And similarly, you never personally saw the sous-préfet, correct? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
That is correct. Personally, I did not see the sous-préfet; it was a team that brought us food that told us that they saw the sous-préfet in the company of the Red Cross that brought us food items. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Did you know a person by the name of Odette Nyirabagenzi? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I do not know that person who goes by the name of Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Do you know a person by the name of Angeline Mukandituye? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
No, I do not know Angeline Mukandituye. 
@MR. MOSES: 
The incident -- sorry. Were there gendarmes present at Sainte Famille when you arrived on the 
10th of April? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
When I arrived at Sainte Famille, I personally did not see gendarmes there. But I learnt that there were gendarmes in Saint Paul, but from the area where I crossed to get into Saint Paul, I did not see gendarmes. But I was told that there were gendarmes in Saint Paul. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And on the incident, you told us some 10 to 15 people were taken from Sainte Famille, was that including men and women? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
That was an estimate -- actually, I gave the figure of 15, and among those persons there were men and women. 
@MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. Do you recall seeing any roadblock just beside Sainte Famille during the month of 
May 1994? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I learnt that there were roadblocks besides Sainte Famille, but personally I did not see them, because I did not go out of Sainte Famille church. But, the information I received reported that there were roadblocks erected not far from Sainte Famille. 
@MR. MOSES: 
And as you have said quite fairly in your evidence, bearing in mind that you remained within the 
church -- the building itself for most of the period you were there, it's not possible for you to say -- to give direct evidence about all that went on outside the church. That's fair, isn't it? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
The information that came into Sainte Famille was circulated; information moved around. The refugees within the Sainte Famille church shared information. If you got into Sainte Famille church from the paved road, there were people who were there and there were people who were outside, and who gave us information on activities that were happening outside Sainte Famille church. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right, but bearing in mind you were inside the church, you relied upon other persons to tell you, rather than what you saw yourself. That's -- that's fair, isn't it? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
Given that I was inside the church, and that I was sitting next to the door of the church, everything that was happening outside the gate of Sainte Famille church was narrated to me by persons who were outside. 
@MR. MOSES: 
All right. Yes, but it's a simple question, Witness, it only needs a simple answer. You couldn't see personally everything that was going on outside Sainte Famille church, because you were inside the church for most of the time; it's just common sense. That's correct, isn't it? 
@WITNESS TOA: 
I have told you that I could not know what was happening outside the church, even though I was inside, because other refugees told me what was happening outside the church. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is what you could see, Mr. Witness? What could you observe yourself?
@WITNESS TOA:
Personally, I couldn't see what was happening outside the church. Nonetheless, if I could climb up to the mezzanine of the church, I could see what was happening outside, but I'd never gone up there. And that mezzanine was commonly referred to by the refugees as "America".

No, Mr. President, we don't have. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you indicated a number of 500 refugees when you arrived at Sainte Famille? 
@WITNESS TOA:
I stated that when I got into the Sainte Famille church, there were about 500 of us, and we found about 100 persons. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, how many persons were there in the church where you were, approximately, inside that building? Let's say, in June or on the 22nd of April, just to take two dates, approximately? 
@WITNESS TOA:
On the 22nd of June, there were about 1,000 persons. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A mistake from the booth, Your Honour, the witness said that in the month of April, there were 
about 1,000 persons; and in the month of June, there were about 4,000 persons within the church. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. And how many times did you hear of the arrival of the sous-préfet at Sainte Famille? 
With other words, according to what you were told, how many times was he there? 
@WITNESS TOA:
I cannot tell you the number of times that the préfet came to the Sainte Famille church. As I have said, I was told that the sous-préfet had come to the Sainte Famille church in the company of the 
Red Cross team. Then, thereafter I did not get any other information to the effect that the sous-préfet had come to the area. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And we were now talking about the sub-prefect, weren't we, Mr. Witness? That was both my question and your answer, wasn't it? 
@WITNESS TOA:
That is correct, I spoke of the sous-préfet. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
That was the end of your testimony. We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home. Should you wish to meet with the Accused, the witness protection unit will arrange for that visit. Thank you very much. 
@WITNESS TOA:
Thank you, Mr. President. Effectively, I would like to greet him and I would like to ask another question: I'm very concerned about my security, and I would like to ask you to take that into consideration. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Rest assured that the witness protection unit will give its utmost consideration to that issue.
$(Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses. 
@MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour, from the last witness, I believe there's a Pros -- there's a Defence exhibit, and also there was the use of the transcripts from the Rutaganda trial, which I used in the cross-examination of Mr. Lugan. 
And there was also the map that he had prepared and, I believe, both those -- before we conclude the proceedings, Your Honour, I'd be asking that -- certainly I'd be asking for the transcripts to go in, and I believe my learned friends will also want the map. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's first ensure that the transcripts get in; that was a Prosecution exhibit. 
Mr. Matemanga, number? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 118. 
$(Exhibit No. P. 118 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Defence, did you discuss with the expert witness, and do you now have a copy of his sketch so that we can tender it, or did he insist to keep the original to himself? 
@MR. CANTIER:
It has been done, Mr. President. So, we managed to -- to make a colour photocopy, which is to line scale; that is what we worked on and we'd like to tender that as an exhibit. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have it in the courtroom now? 
@MR. CANTIER:
We'll get it right away, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But there will be no objections there, so we can tender it right away. 
The next exhibit number, Mr. Matemanga, will be? 
@MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 112. 
$(Exhibit No. D. 112 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Is there anything else of a practical nature that you want to raise, Defence, before your case is closed? 
@MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, that was our last witness. So what we would like is that the Chamber should enlighten us on the way forward -- that is, the deadlines for the submission of briefs and then the final session. So if you would like to do that now or later, we are at the disposal of the Chamber. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This trial will continue in a moment in the form of a status conference. This means that there is nothing else to be said in connection with this trial. This was the end of Mr. Renzaho's trial, which started on the 8th of January this year. The Prosecution's case closed on 6 March, after the appearance of 26 witnesses in the course of 21 trial days. The Defence case opened on the 14th of May and closed today. Twenty-seven witnesses were heard in 28 trial days. We have, therefore, heard a considerable number of witnesses in this single-accused trial. In fact, we have heard 53 witnesses in the course of 49 trial days and some of them were half days. So, we have achieved a lot within a reasonable time. This is due to a large extent to the efficiency of the Prosecution and the Defence teams. The OTP, led by senior trial attorney Moses always cooperated to ensure the smooth running of the trial; and Maître Cantier and Maître Nekuie have also contributed greatly to our efficiency whilst still vigorously defending the interests of their client. I want to thank, on behalf of the Bench, the two teams for their professionalism, efficiency and courtoisie in the courtroom. The registry represented daily by Mr. Matemanga and Mrs. Ben Salimo have, thanks to their huge experience in the courtroom, ensured a steady flow of documents, and all that needs to be done in the trial took place without any problems whatsoever; and Mr. Diallo has supervised it all in an exemplary way. Our dear interpreters have made sure that there were no interpretation problems or communication problems. They have even acted as witness protection officers from time to time in order to avoid that the witnesses disclose their identity. The quality of the interpretation was superb; the speed amazing. Our team of English and French court reporters has performed their task with distinction as usual. With an incredible speed, they have captured everything. Even when the rest of us do not quite understand all that is being said, the screen is always there when we wonder. The realtime system has been a huge success, and the transcripts were always ready in the afternoon allowing us to prepare for the next day. The court video booth has also worked very well during this trial; thank you very much indeed. Thank you also to the security officers who have been with us throughout the trial. Thank you to all of you. And, we will now continue, while we are sitting here with a status conference. 
$(Court adjourned at 1025H)
