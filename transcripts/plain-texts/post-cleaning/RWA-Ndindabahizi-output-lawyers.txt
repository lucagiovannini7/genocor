@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.
Prosecution, you have the floor for opening statements.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.
Your Honours, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi stands before you today, charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, for the murder and extermination of Tutsi civilians, in and around his home commune of Gitesi in the prefecture of Kibuye in Rwanda.
Needless to say, Your Honours, these crimes are some of the most heinous of crimes known to mankind.  The Defence will have Your Honours believe that the widespread, systematic and sustained attacks on Tutsi civilians throughout Rwanda in l994 resulting in the said genocide, was a spontaneous outburst of communal hatred triggered by the downing of the president's plane as it approached Kigali airport on 6th of April 1994.
The Prosecutor will however, represent to Your Honours, that the attacks on Tutsi which occurred in Rwanda during the said period was conscious, meticulously planned, and orchestrated at the highest level -- at the highest official level.  The Prosecutor will further represent to Your Honour, that the killing of Tutsi was a result of the strategy, the essence and objective of which was a systematic elimination and extermination of all Tutsi in Rwanda, in effect, leaving none to tell the story.
Your Honours, simple logic would suggest that given the magnitude of the killings, it was virtually impossible for such mass killings to have been committed within 100 days without the direct involvement of the state.  In that regard, Your Honours, it is the Prosecution's case that the opposition of the extremist Hutu in power at the time to the power-sharing agreement reached in the Arusha Accords, led to the formulation of an extremist "Hutu-power" ideology within Rwanda.
Two Prosecution witnesses, Your Honours, GKH and Ms. Alison Des Forges, will testify that although the interim government established following the president's death was composed of five of the six political parties in Rwanda, in reality the said government essentially comprised of politicians who were selected from the extremist factions of the respective political parties, many of whom were opposed to the power-sharing agreement.
Your Honours, indeed, the majority of the politicians who formed the said government were
non- extremists.  However, there were some politicians amongst them who had no known history of extremism, but rather, were mere opportunists brought into the said government without any real political power, but rather, as a façade to establish a broad-based government.
Your Honours, the Defence will have you believe that those politicians who had a known history of extremism were indeed more likely to have a motive to commit these heinous crimes than the politicians who belonged to the known moderate parties such as the PSD.  They would argue that such politicians, the moderates, simply have no case to answer.  In that regard, the Prosecutor will represent to Your Honour, that factors such as past or present political affiliations had little or 
nothing -- absolutely no bearing on the sad events which form the basis of this trial.
Witness GKH will describe to Your Honour how, from 7th April 1994, three categories of politicians existed in Rwanda: those who were seen as obstacles to the genocidal government and were eliminated; the second category, those who fled the country in the knowledge of what was about to happen and did not want to be seen to be part of it; and the third category, those who remained and chose to participate in the said genocidal government.
At 10:30 p.m.  on the evening of 8th April 1994, Dr. Thédore Sindikubwabo, who was then the president of the National Assembly, in a radio broadcast to the nation, declared himself president of Rwanda, citing article 42 of the constitution of 10th June 1991.  He announced a list of members of the "provisional government".
Now, regardless of their political affiliation, 20 ministers on the morning of 9th April l994, pursuant to paragraph 56 of the constitution of 10th June 1991, pledged to do as follows, Your Honour, and I quote from paragraph 56 of that constitution.  They pledged to:  "Loyally carry out their duties and be faithful to the Republic of Rwanda, the Head of State, and most importantly, to promote the interest of Rwandan people".
Your Honours, for those men and women who chose to serve in that said provisional government, and those who took the oath of office on the 9th of April, there was now a common denominator that held them together.  It was not political affiliation, but rather, the need to fight the common enemy and those perceived as its accomplices.
Your Honours, the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, an accountant by profession, chose to serve in that transitional government as Minister of Finance.  He remained in that position, Your Honours, until November 1994.  Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, I would represent to Your Honours, was dedicated to cause and country, and that, we say, was a clear motive for participating in such a horrendous crime and criminal enterprise.
Your Honours, it is not therefore surprising that having taken the said oath as indicated by paragraph 56 of the constitution, to be loyal to both cause and country, we find that the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi participated in one form or the other in the killing of Tutsi in and around his native commune and prefecture of origin, Kibuye.
Your Honours, the Accused was a member of the Social Democratic Party, the PSD.  Indeed, he was the chairperson of the said party in his native Kibuye prefecture.  In that regard, Your Honours -- sorry, in that regard, the Accused will have Your Honours believe that the PSD was indeed famous for its moderate stand prior to April 1994.
The Prosecutor will, however, represent to Your Honours that whilst this may have been the case prior to 6th April 1994, the entire moderate leadership of the said party, including those PSD members who by virtue of the power-sharing agreement had participated in the Habyarimana government, had all been eliminated by 12th April l994.  They included Félicien Gatabazi, the PSD leader and cabinet minister in the Habyarimana government, who was assassinated in April 1994.  Mr. Frederic Nzamurambaho, who was the president of the PSD and also a minister in the Habyarimana government, was also assassinated on the 7th of April 1994.
Now, Your Honours, those who had not fled the country, those who hadn't been killed in the first days of the genocide had, in fact, left the country, leaving only members of the PSD, like the Accused, who sympathised and identified with the extremist Hutu ideology to take part in the provisional government.
Now, one of those who fled the country was a man called Marc Rugenera.  He was a senior member of the PSD party and a finance minister in the Habyarimana government.  Rugenera had been earmarked for elimination as well, but had only escaped death due to the fact that he did not reside in the ministerial district like other ministers.  You would be interested to know, Your Honours, that the Accused that stands before you today replaced him in the genocidal government as Minister of Finance.
To survive in government, the Prosecutor would represent to Your Honour that those who chose to remain in the said provisional government quite simply had to remain loyal and committed to the chosen path and had to be seen to be so.  Indeed, those who remained there were at great pains to distance themselves from any association with the perceived enemy.
On 19th April 1994, Your Honours, the interim President Sindikubwabo identified his government as "a government of saviours," a government that would come directly to the people "to tell you what it expects of you".
During the third week of April 1994, ministers and other high-ranking officials did go into the countryside, insisting on the need to support the genocide, promising rewards to supporters and threatening sanctions against dissenters.  Your Honours, the Accused was no exception.
Prosecution Witness GKH was an elected parliamentarian.  His only offence, Your Honour, was that he was married to a Tutsi woman.  That witness will testify in the course of today how the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, accused him of being inactive and demanded the witness to waive his right to assume his elected seat in parliament in favour of another party member who was supposedly more active.
In a speech during a visit to Butare on the 29th April l994, the then interim president, Théodore Sindikubwabo, emphasized that government ministers from Butare had returned home in order to supervise the killing of Tutsi.  On the 18th of May 1994, Mr. Sindikubwabo visited Kibuye préfecture and publicly congratulated the Hutu population for having done its work.
Similarly, the then interim Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda, visited Kibuye on 3rd May 1994.  Various ministers of the interim government who originated from Kibuye prefecture were present at this meeting.  This included the Accused, Your Honour.  Witness GKH and Ms. Alison Des Forges will testify that despite the large-scale massacre that occurred in Kibuye prefecture between 14th and 30th April l994, absolutely none of the senior government ministers present at the said meeting, including the Accused, condemned or even referred to the massacres.
In that regard we would submit to Your Honours that by focusing hatred on Tutsi, the organisers of killings hoped to forge solidarity amongst Hutus.  But beyond that, Your Honours, they aimed at creating collective responsibility for genocide.  People were encouraged to kill together so that no one would bear individual or total responsibility for the executions.
The Prosecutor will represent to the Trial Chamber, that the involvement of the present population in the massacres that followed was facilitated by their misplaced belief, Your Honours, and confidence in their leadership, and also by an understanding that the encouragement of the authorities guaranteed them immunity to kill Tutsi and loot their property.  From 12th April to the beginning of May 1994, the killers carried out the most devastating massacres of genocide throughout Rwanda.
According to the 1991 census, 12.4 per cent of the Kibuye prefecture population was killed in the genocide.  That means, Your Honour, approximately 80 per cent of the Tutsi population.  The majority of those killed in Kibuye were killed in the first two weeks of the genocide, that is, between the 6th and 21st April, 1994, and then again in mid-May 1994.  It is the Prosecution's case, Your Honours, that the Accused, as a member of the interim government, frequently visited Kibuye in order to instigate and order the killing of Tutsi civilians in his préfecture of origin.
By virtue of his prominence in the local community, the Accused as president of the PSD party in Kibuye, as a serving minister, was clearly a person of considerable influence.  As such, civilians, gendarmes, members of the Interahamwe militia, were more likely than not to follow his orders.
Now, several Prosecution witnesses that you will hear in the course of this trial, Your Honours, will testify that roadblocks which had been established to promote security and check rising crime in Rwanda were very quickly transformed and used to identify Tutsi for killing.
Now, by restricting movement at these roadblocks, it made it less likely for people to escape.  In some cases, local businessmen and local officials, people like the Accused, sponsored these roadblocks and supported those who manned those roadblocks with food, drinks and weaponry. 
Your Honours, the Prosecutor will represent to you that as a member of the provisional government, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's mere presence at the roadblock, or indeed several roadblocks in and around Gitesi commune, or indeed his presence, or alleged presence during attacks in Gitwa Hill Karongi Hill, and in the area of Bisesero, would most certainly have an encouraging effect on the attackers.  But more importantly, Your Honours, it would have conveyed to those attackers the impression that the killings of Tutsi in Kibuye was endorsed by the interim government.
The Prosecutor would further represent to Your Honours that the actions of the Accused throughout the months of April, May, June 1994, as outlined in the indictment, namely, the distribution of weapons, his participation in the systematic killing by leading convoys, transporting attackers to massacre sites, being seen at several roadblocks at various locations, is demonstration of his specific intent to destroy in whole or in part of Tutsi as a group.  Indeed, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's statements and directives provide direct evidence of his genocidal intent.
In terms of context within which the activities were conducted, the Prosecutor will represent to Your Honours that there are striking similarities between the killing of Tutsi civilians at various roadblocks in Gitesi commune, Kibuye, the attacks on Gitwa Hill, also in Gitesi commune, the attacks in the area of Bisesero, and those launched against Tutsis in other areas and other parts of Kibuye préfecture and, indeed, in the country of Rwanda as a whole during the same period.
Now, in that regard, Your Honour, it is the Prosecution's case that the mass killings and other crimes alleged in this present indictment or code, was part of a wider genocidal plan and policy to exterminate Tutsis throughout Rwanda between April and June 1994.  To that end, I urge Your Honours not to assess the factual allegations that you would hear in this case in isolation, but, rather, to consider those allegations in the overall context of events -- the events that occurred in Rwanda between April and June 1994, and more specifically in Kibuye préfecture within the same period.  Because it is only such an approach, Your Honours, that will provide you with a better understanding of the context within which the Accused committed the crimes alleged in the present indictment.
Finally, Your Honour, as outlined in Appendix A of the pre-trial brief, the Prosecutor will rely on the evidence of 17 protected factual witnesses, an expert witness, and an investigator, during the course of this trial.
Your Honours, based on the premise that the Prosecutor will be able to present four witnesses every week, I expect that the Prosecution will complete the presentation of her case within four weeks from today.  Unless I can be of further assistance to Your Honours, the Prosecutor is ready to call her first witness.  He is Mr. Upendra Baghel, an investigator from her office, and he will be led by my colleague, Mr. Wallace Kapaya.
Your Honours, I thank you for your attention.

Yes, Mr. Baghel, what do you intend to -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Hold on a little moment, Mr. Kapaya.
Please proceed.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
$BY MR. KAPAYA: 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Baghel, just very briefly, what's the relevance of these maps to the work you did in this case?
@A.
The first map, which is the Rwanda map, it shows that Rwanda is surrounded by Tanzania, Burundi, Congo and Rwanda (sic), and it consists of eleven préfectures which have been shown in the map.  
The second map, which is of Kibuye because Kibuye is one of the préfectures of Rwanda, there is a map of Kibuye préfecture which shows that this préfecture is surrounded by Gisenyi, Gitarama, Gikongoro, Cyangugu préfectures.  And this Kibuye préfecture consists of nine communes, and Gitesi is one of the communes.  
Third map, which is basically a road map, which shows that Kigali to Gitarama is around 42 kilometres, and Gitarama to Gisenyi is around 138 kilometres, Gisenyi to Kibuye is 104 kilometres, and Kibuye to Gitarama is 76 kilometres.  I travelled on these roads and I measured the time which I took, which have been indicated in the map.
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Now part 2 of the - of your work consists of, of sketches consisting of hills.  Can you briefly describe the source of the information which is contained in this one, in this map?
@A.
For the part 2, it shows the map of Gitwa hill and adjourning hills.  Here, the primary source has been an earlier-prepared Bisesero map, the source of most of the hills, and which is in the evidence unit, and I was one of the members who prepared the map.  This primary source after that I took to the field, and again, I contacted the concerned authorities and verified.  So now, this map consists of the Gitwa hill and Gitesi commune and adjourning hills.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what is the relevance of these sketches in this case?
@A.
During the course of the investigation of this file, I noticed that many witnesses are from Gitwa hill, which is in Gitesi commune, and some other hills nearby.  So this map shows where Gitwa hill is located, which is hill number 25 on the Gitwa hill map, which is reference L0019869.  And this hill is located on the road which goes from Kibuye to Karongi hill, which is hill number 20 is Karongi hill, and it goes Gisovu.  And the adjourning hills are -- they are in Bisesero, which I numbered from one to 19.  And there is one more road which comes from Kibuye to these hills directly, because these hills have been referred by the witnesses during the investigation, so these hills are depicted where they are located on the map.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Baghel, it relates to the names of the hills.  We see in hill numbers 5, 6 -- in hill 5, they are all referred to as Gitwa hills.  How would one make the distinction between the three hills?
@A.
Yeah, hill number five and six, they are also called Gitwa hill, but they are in Gishyita commune; and hill number 24 - sorry, 25 is the Gitwa hill in Gishyita commune.  These three hills are quite far away from 25, to hill number 5 and 6, and the direct distance between these hills can be measured because this map is as for the scale.  It has been taken extract from map which was prepared in 199 -- in 1998 by the National Geography of Belgium in collaboration with Rwanda.  So, these two hills are totally different.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, can you relate these hills to the photographs that you have prepared in this bundle?
@A.
In this bundle, I took the photographs of Gitwa hill, which is in Gishyita commune, and this is hill number 25.  And these photographs are in part 4, photo number 3 to 6.  Photo number 3, which is on the page L0019886, is the photo of Gitwa hill taken from the roadside, and part of the road is seen.  
And photo number 4 is taken from the top of Gitwa hill, and as seen from the photograph, top of Gitwa hill having a small grass, small plants and loose stones.
Photo 5 is taken from Gitwa hill towards left direction, that is, pointing towards hill number 26.  So the front which we see the hill is hill number 26, called Gasagaza (phonetic) hill, and as this stretch of road is seen, this stretch of road goes to Kiziba.  Now in Kiziba there is a refugee camp maintained by the UNHCR.  
Photo number 6 is also taken from the top of the hill on the right side, so on the right side this road is seen.  This road is coming from Kibuye town and going through Gitwa hill to Karongi hill, then to Gisovu.  And on the right side there is Kibuye town and the lay council, and the valley is seen.  
So these four photographs are concerned to hill 25, which is Gitwa hill in Gishyita commune.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Now, let's move to the sketches which are in part 3 --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, when you took these photographs, did you take them in order to give the Court an impression of the topography, the landscape, the hills, or was it your purpose to identify particular locations in these hills which may be of relevance in this particular case?
@THE WITNESS:
These, photographs I took, keeping in view about the topography, terrain, and landscape to how Gitwa hill looked like, because when I visited this Gitwa hill, I was not with the - like, with any witness, so I don't know exact location which maybe relevant.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, talking of photographs, how do you relate the other photographs which are in the bundle?
@A.
The other photographs on the bundle, like photo 1, photo 2, they are about the Gitaka centres, and this Gitaka centre had been referred by few witnesses during the investigations.  That's why I took the photograph of the centre. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
M-hmm.
@A.
Then photo number 7 to -- 7 to 16, these photographs are of the adjourning hills around Gitwa hill, and basically they are of Bisesero area.  I reviewed some previous trial transcript and selected a few photographs which show the terrain, topography, and landscape and the kind of hills in the area.  After that, I took them from evidence, evidence unit.  They copied and gave me.  Those photograph, I matched them with the copy in evidence unit, and after that I put them in this bundle.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Is there anything to indicate as to when those photographs were taken?
@A.
These photographs, like photo number 7 to photo number 11, were taken up to 1995; and photo number 12 and 13 were taken in September 1995; and photo number 14 to 16 were taken in February 1998, and these are the Prosecution exhibits in the case of Kayishema.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Now, finally, you have sketches.  What methodology did you use in preparing these sketches?
@A.
The sketches which are in part 3, these are sketches I prepared during the investigation of this file, and I filed them in evidence unit.  While preparing these sketches, I accompanied with the witness, who showed me the place where a roadblock was there in 1994.  And after getting some more information from witness about the location, the jurisdictional location like in which secteur, which commune, I prepared this sketch.  Now, again, I took them from the evidence unit and re-verified, and after that I put them in this binder. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
You have in part 5 a list of secteurs.  Can you tell us the relevance of this document in your bundle?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you move on to that.  
Now, Mr. Witness, did you say that you indicated places where there were roadblocks based on conversations with witnesses?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are these witnesses in the present case or in other cases?
@THE WITNESS: 
These witnesses are in the present case, and during the investigation I did so.  But during the re-verification, I verified the place again.  And with regard to sketch 6, I got additional information, which I put in additional  information, like on sketch 6 which is on L0019879, the place which is marked as B.  B was the bar of Augustine Karara who was the cellule responsable of Gasharu cellule in 1994.  This information I put in the form of additional information on the next page.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We do not know, do we, Mr. Kapaya, which witnesses this investigator's -- this investigator got his information from?
@MR. KAPAYA:
The witness has the pseudonyms of the witnesses from whom he got the information from.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  But that's not in this document, is it?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, it's not there.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  Are we talking about many witnesses or only one witness, Mr. -
@THE WITNESS
No, for these sketches -
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please push the button, will you?
@THE WITNESS: 
For the sketches, we are talking about many witnesses because each sketch is referring to one witness.  Sketch 2 is one witness; sketch 3 is one witness; sketch 4, third witness; then sketch 6 is the sources, secteur counseiller of the secteur; then one more sketch.  So there are four witnesses I'm referring who gave me this information about specific locations.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you think it would be helpful for the Court to know which witnesses, in pseudonym form, these were, Mr. Kapaya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, yeah, it would.
$BY MR. KAPAYA: 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you, Mr. Baghel, mention the pseudonyms of the witnesses who supplied you with the information in regard to the sketches?
@A.
With reference to sketch 2, which is L0019877, the witness who showed me this place, his pseudonym is CGC, Charlie-Golf-Charlie.  In sketch 3, for this, the pseudonym of the witness is CGK, Charlie-Golf-Kilo.  For sketch 4, the pseudonym is CGM, that is, Charlie-Golf-Mike.  For the sketch 6 is the secteur conseiller, who I suppose is still secteur conseiller of the secteur.  And for the sketch which is L0019881, the pseudonym of the witness is CGY, Charlie-Golf-Yankee.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I have you repeat the last one, will you?  Where - are you now on 80?  I think the problem here is that you have K numbers and L numbers.  Now, you were referring to the last two, L81, were you?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yeah.  I am referring L number because K numbers are the old numbers.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@THE WITNESS: 
And the L numbers are the new numbers, which are red in colour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@THE WITNESS: 
L0019881, the pseudonym of the witness is CGY, Charlie Golf Yankee.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Now, I was asking you the relevance of the list of six that you put in the file of your report.
@A.
The part 5, which consists of local authority in Gishyita commune, and this is the list of the secteurs, secteur conseillers and cellules in Gishyita commune in 1994.  This information I collected from the commune office, which is the district office now, on the advice of the trial team to collect it.  And moreover, during the investigation also, I found the many witnesses were referring the names of Gitesi commune, different cellule and secteur.  So the names which have been put here, they may be relevant in the case, and moreover now because Rwanda has been reorganised and the places are called as districts and authorities are called mayor.  So this all '94, it may be useful.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this document does, as you've just indicated, not only relate to the secteurs, but it also gives information about persons holding office during that period?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  In 1994, the person who were holding the office of secteur, secteur conseillers and the bourgmestres.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And that's based on witnesses you met?
@THE WITNESS: 
This is based - this list was given to me by the mayor of Kibuye municipality, which he has signed on the page 3 of this documents on 31st July 2003.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So also the document -- also the information relating to the holders of office comes from the commune office?  
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And it provided, provided when?  In July 31, 2003?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  Thank you.

@MR. KAPAYA:
And finally, Mr. Baghel, you have a copy of the constitution of June '91 as an appendix to your report; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, this is the final document that is appendix in my binder.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That's all I have from this witness, Your Honour.

@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Mr. President, I only have a few questions for this witness.
$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Investigator, you visited Kibuye préfecture.  Did you pay specific attention to the cellule in which the Accused was born?
@A.
Yes.  During the course of my investigations, I visited the place which is in Gitaka centre, and I was told that the Accused's parental house is located at the place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you give us the name of the Accused's native cellule?
@A.
The name of the native cellule where the house of his parents, his parents is located is Gasharu cellule in Gitesi secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you.  Mr. Witness, I would like us to look at L0019861, please.  Do you have the document?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  This is the report that you made after your travel through Kibuye préfecture; is that correct?
@A.
This is the report which I made after travelling on the roads, not necessarily in Kibuye prefecture, because I started from Kigali to Gitarama, then Gitarama to Gisenyi, and Gisenyi to Kibuye then to Murambi; that is, Gitarama back.
@MR. BESNIER:
With regard to the road from Gitarama to Kibuye, can you describe to us the status of that road and what was it made of?
@A.
This is -- I travelled - like, I have been travelling on many times on this road.  For this - for the purpose of this document I travelled -- I went on this road during the days which I mentioned, from 11 August to 18 August 2003, and on that day the road is made of asphalt and it is fully tarmac road from Kibuye to Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have any information on the condition of that road in 1994?
@A.
I don't have any information about the condition of the road in 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you not ask the authorities what the status of the condition of the road was in 1994, because that is what is of interest to us now?
@A.
I did not ask the authority specifically that what is the condition of -- what was the condition of the road in 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can we now look at L0019870, please, the little D of 2, small (ii).  At the end of that paragraph, the last sentence reads that, "It can be granted that the Bisesero area covers parts of Gitesi, Gishyita and Gisovu," and we are referring here to communes, Gishyita commune, Giseti commune and Gisovu commune.  Have you found where I am?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Do you confirm that Bisesero area covers these three communes?
@A.
Because I have been to this area on many occasions, so there is no fixed boundaries for the Bisesero area.  The area which -- around these hills is known as Bisesero.  So that's why areas of these three communes, not whole communes, some parts of the commune where these hills are there, is called the Bisesero area.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was your methodology in arriving at that conclusion?  Was it by listening to the witnesses or did you consult maps?
@A.
This is by listening to various informants, basically witnesses and some local, general informers.  Like when we start from Kibuye town, if you say, "Which is Bisesero area?"  Then they will point out to the hill, "This side is Bisesero."  So this is not on the basis on maps, this is the basis - on the basis of local information gathered in the area.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you very sure, according to your research, that the Bisesero area is part of Gitesi commune, even if it's only a small part thereof?
@A.
Yes, because Gitesi commune is quite large.  Like hill 25, 26, if you go through the hill map, it is in the Gitesi commune.  And if you go to the north of hill 25, 26, they will refer these hills towards Bisesero.  So this - there is no clear-cut distinction.  Bisesero, which I mentioned here, Bisesero is the name of a cellule, is name of a secteur, name of a hill also.  So Bisesero area is having very big boundaries.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I don't know whether the Tribunal has in -- the pre-trial brief filed on the 1st of August, 2003, by the Prosecutor.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have it.  What do you want us to look at?
@MR. BESNIER:
I wanted to request the Chamber to go to page 1154 -- 59, 1159 of this document, please.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In the French or English version?
@MR. BESNIER:
Both.  There is no Defence (sic).  I am working with the English version because I believe the French version is not ready as yet.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said the pre-trial brief, did you?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I did.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Which page did you mention?
@MR. BESNIER:
1159.  This is annex B, the "Prosecutor's Request to Admit" is the title on that page, numbered in the right-hand -- top right-hand corner as 1159. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have found it.  Yes, that's fine.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I would like us to deal with number three, which is at the very bottom of that page.  This question is as follows:  "In Bisesero stand the communes of Gishyita and Gisovu in Kibuye préfecture, Rwanda."  That's right, Mr. President.  The Defence did admit that proposal by the Prosecutor, as you can, yourself, see; but today the investigator from the Prosecution is telling us that the Bisesero area spreads through Gishyita, Gisovu and Giseti communes.  We believe that we have already resolved this matter in the framework of the Prosecutor's motion, and we should not come today to be told that the Bisesero area also covers Giseti commune.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, this raises two questions, doesn't it:  One, what you have actually admitted, and the other issue, what is the factual situation?  And your admittance stays; that's what you have admitted.  And you are now saying that it can't be correct, the additional information given by the witness today; is that the position?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  This is information I wish to show the Chamber.  We will bear this in mind later on when we will present our witnesses, and maybe we will be enabled to amend, if need be, what is being said, given what has been said by the witness on the stand, the investigator.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for sharing that with us.  It's noted, thank you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have other questions for the prosecutor's investigator.  These are questions which may help us to gain time during the cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses or during the examination of Defence witnesses.  
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
This is the localisation of certain cellules.  If you cannot answer, you will inform the change (sic), but I think it will help us in gaining some time at a later stage.  
My first question, Mr. Witness, were you able to identify a cellule referred to as Nyagahinga?  I will spell it, N-Y-A-G-A-H-I-N-G-E, Nyagahinga -- the last letter is A, as in Alpha --in Bubazi secteur, 
B-U-B-A-Z-I, in Giseti commune?
@A.
In which document are you referring, excuse me? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is not, I think, related to any particular document.  The question is only, have you located that place, I think.
@THE WITNESS:
No.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
It's specifically because I did not see this cellule in any of the maps presented, that's why I am putting this question to you, Mr. Investigator.
@A.
I don't know because I have not asked about the specific cellules.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, if we can be of assistance to the Chamber, this is provided on page 902, on item 8, the fifth name is shown there as a cellule.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are in which document now, Mr. Kapaya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
I am sorry, I am in the Exhibit P2, Prosecution Exhibit P2 at five, page L0019902, and item, 
sub-item 5.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So that's number five under paragraph 8?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Another question to the Prosecutor (sic) is, did he visit this location?  Did you visit this cellule?
@A.
No, I did not visit.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you visit the Kibirizi market, K-I-B-I-R-I-Z-I, Kibirizi market?  This is Mabanza commune.
@A.
Yeah, once I visited.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you tell us roughly what is the distance between Gasharu cellule and Kibirizi market?
@A.
In fact, I did not measure the distance but only I can estimate it with rough figures.  Yes, this may be around 8 to 10 kilo - 8 kilometres, around.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Is there a tarmacked road to go there, or is it a dirt road?
@A.
Kibirizi market to the divergence to the Gasharu cellule is tarmac now, but from a main road divergence to the Gasharu cellule is non-tarmac road.  So, there is a mix:  3 kilometres may be 
non-tarmac, five may be tarmac road. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you want to know the condition in '94, I assume, if the witness knows?
@THE WITNESS: 
I did not ask specifically the condition in 1994.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You don't know.  That's covered by the general question, yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I was indeed going to put that question to the witness.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Another question for you, Mr. Witness:  You referred to the Gitaka centre and you took photographs of that centre, did you not?  Is the Gasharu cellule from where the Accused hails, is it far from the Gitaka centre?
@A.
In fact, Gitaka centre is in Gasharu cellule.  So Gasharu cellule is the administrative entity, which is territory.  So how it can be far?  It's part of - like, in Gasharu cellule, Gitaka centre is there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, how does one get to Gasharu from Gitaka centre?
@A.
If you reach Gitaka centre -- or before that, border of Gasharu cellule will start.  Gitaka centre is, Gitaka centre is a place which is -- which lies in Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can one get to that place from Gishaka - Gitaka centre by vehicle?
@A.
Gitaka centre is a place where some market is there, a few shops are there.  It is an open area.  And Gasharu cellule is the entity of cellule.  Cellule is like a few square kilometres, so the centre lies in that, so I don't know how Gitaka centre to Gasharu cellule.  If you say some other cellule which is not in this somewhere, then okay, then maybe like Kibuye town or Manya (phonetic) or something.
@MR. BESNIER:
So if you will, how can one go to Gitaka centre to the Accused's house or his parents' home?
@A.
I went to the parents' house because I went to Gitaka centre first.  I asked who is the secteur conseiller, and the secteur conseiller was there and I approached him.  I requested him; he took me to the house of his parents, and he told this house also in Gasharu cellule.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now the question is, how do you get from this Gitaka centre to this that house, whether you can explain that to us.  That's the question.
@THE WITNESS: 
From Gitaka centre to his house - like, I parked the car in Gitaka centre and I went by walking, on foot, and it's around half kilometre of estimate from the Gitaka centre to his house.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it a road which goes up or does it go down?
@A.
A road which goes up from Gitaka centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
In other words, the Accused's family home, which you claim is the Accused's home, is at the top of the hill; is that correct?
@A.
It's -- the family house or family home which was shown to me is at high elevation than the Gitaka centre, but I cannot say it's the top of the hill because Rwanda is full of the hills.  It's in higher elevation than Gitaka centre.  And if you take up some place, like locate some few metre here and there, you can see Gitaka centre from the place, from the house.  
@MR. BESNIER:
From Gitaka centre up to what you call the Accused's home, is it possible to go that distance, cover that distance using a vehicle?
@A.
I did not use the vehicle, and it depends on the weather at the time.  If it is raining, then it is difficult to use at that time, but I think some powerful car can go up to that place.  It depends on the skill of the driver.  But the road is not so much more travelled, that place, so it is safer to park the car at Gitaka centre and walk.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So was there a road leading up there or would a car have to go off-road?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yeah, from there, like, it's around half kilometre.  So up to half distance there's a - like, the car can go to places - like, the road is wide enough that a vehicle can go, but after half distance I was taken to the dirt track, that is, footpath.  But there may be alternative routes which were not shown me, but I cannot claim those things.  The road which I took I am telling you.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
One minute.  I think you used a path because you went on foot to the Accused's home, but you were allegedly told that there was a road which could have been more easy to use for you to reach the same destination; is that what you're saying?
@A.
Yeah, up to half distance I think vehicle -- the vehicle could have been driven.  After half distance, I was taken on a small footpath on the hill and shown the house, that this is the house.  And the track which was coming where vehicle could have been driven that took right, they were then to right side.  So I did not travel on the right divergence, and I was taken to another track, which was footpath.
@MR. BESNIER:
But how do you know that if you turned to the right you could reach the Accused's family home using a car, since you did not do that yourself?
@A.
I don't know, because it is not like the tarmac road is there and there is lane system or something.  That's why I am not telling whether that right turn, it could have gone.  I don't know exactly.

@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  So to conclude with this matter, all that you saw is that there was a road, a path, which could be used going up on foot and that's what you yourself did, in fact; is that not so?
@A.
Yes, I went by foot -- on foot.  So, I don't -- I can't claim and I don't know about -- that a vehicle could go there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  When you were in Gasharu, did you hear mention made of a place known as Kirombo, 
K-I-R-O-M-B-O, Kirombo (sic)?  Did you hear any mention made of that or did you see any such place?
@A.
Yeah, because the road which goes from the main road to Gitaka centre, I asked where this road leads then I was told this road leads to Kirambo school.  So I suppose there may be a school in Kirambo and that may be the place Kirambo, but I did not visit that Kirambo place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Since you didn't go there, do you know whether the inhabitants of Gasharu cellule have to go to Gitaka centre in order to go to Kirambo school?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The name is Kirambo.  I do beg your pardon.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, the people who -- in Gasharu cellule, if they follow the main -- the road which is the main road in that area, then they might have to go through the Gitaka centre.  But, again, Gitaka is a place in the cellule, so it depends on the person where he is staying in the cellule.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You mentioned one Mr. Karara, can you confirm that you mentioned that person's name?
@A.
Yes, I mentioned the name of Augustine Karara, who was cellule responsable of Gasara cellule in 1994, and I got information that his house and bar was in Gitaka centre and which is marked as "B" in my sketch 6.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the name of the Gitesi commune bourgmestre in 1994, if you know?
@A.
Yes, the name of the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune was also Augustine Karara, but these two are different persons.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
They have the first name and the last name in common?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, they have first and last name both in common, Augustine Karara.
@MR. BESNIER:
This is an ambiguity which I wanted to clarify as of this moment, because this name is going to come about several times during the course of the trial. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Could you clarify again what the designation of these two Karara was?
@THE WITNESS:
In my sketch 6, which is on L001-9879, I have shown the place marked "B" and it was the bar and the house of Augustine Karara, and his designation was cellule responsable of Gasharu cellule in Gitesi secteur, in Gitesi cellule.  And the other Augustine Karara which -- the name which is referred to me just now, he was the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And he is the one mentioned on L001-9901? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, he is the one who was bourgmestre, but cellule responsable is not mentioned because the names have not been given of those authorities.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  I would now like to refer to document L001-9880, L001-9880, and let us now refer to Item No. 3.  Could you please tell us who informed you that there was a roadblock during the events of 1994 in Gitaka?
@A.
During the course of investigation, I found few witnesses referring about the roadblock in Gitaka centre.  But when I visited this Gitaka centre I asked the secteur conseiller whether there was a roadblock during the 1994 events and that time he informed me the roadblock was near the place marked "B" and "H1".  So this was the secteur conseiller who gave me information about the specific location, but during my investigation I came to know two other witnesses also.  When I visited I was not with the witnesses, but -- when I went to Gitaka centre I was not with the witnesses.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you were accompanied by the consellier, Mr. Karara, weren't you?
@A.
Yes, I was with him.
@MR. BESNIER:
And he was the one who told you that, indeed, in 1994 there was a roadblock in that location; is that correct?
@A.
Sorry -- I was not -- you are just now mentioning I was accompanied with the (sic) secteur conseiller Karara, no, the current secteur conseiller and the Karara which is mentioned, he was the cellule responsable, not the secteur conseiller.  So I was accompanied by the secteur conseiller.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No Karara?
@THE WITNESS:
No Karara.

@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  I would now like to refer to document L001-9881, that's L001-9881.  Did you go to the top of Karongi hill?
@A.
During the course of investigation of this file I did not go, but in some cases -- in some other case I have been to the top.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see any specific building at the top of this hill?
@A.
There are antennas -- communication antennas are there and big towers are there on the top of the hill.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  If we take a look at your sketch, when -- if you are standing on Karongi hill, across from the person, there would be a non-asphalted narrow path leading to Rubengera and Mabanza; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is the information I got from the witness.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it possible to see Mabanza from Karongi hill?
@A.
It's on the high elevation, Karongi hill, and Mabanza is low elevation.  It should be possible to see Mabanza or to look at the direction in which Mabanza is there (sic).  It depends on the location of the person and the place where the person is standing.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are there any road signs on this road?
@A.
There is no road sign on the roads.

@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  On sketch No. 4 you have also identified the Nyabahanga river, which is spelt: 
N-Y-A-B-A-H-A-N-G-A, Nyabahanga.  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would like to know whether you know the distance separating Foyer, also known as Fayer, and the Nyabahanga river?
@A.
On this road, I measured the distances by driving a vehicle, like, from Fayer or Foyer to Kibuye is 
10.7 kilometres.  Nyabahanga river -- from Nyabahanga river to Kibuye is 3.5 kilometres.  So the distance between these two places should be around 7.2 kilometres by road, which is existing now.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is this an area that is populated?  Is it densely populated?  Did you see any houses in-between Fayer and the Nyabahanga river?
@A.
Yes, there are houses on the roadsides which are, I cannot say densely populated, not like town or something, but a few houses are there.
@MR. BESNIER:
On sketch No. 4 you have mentioned the bridge that goes over the Nyabahanga river.  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know in what secteur of Gitesi commune this bridge is located?

Very well, thank you.  My last question -- or, last few questions will deal with Gitwa hill.  You have identified that there were two hills or actually several hills that had the same name.  Is that correct; they were all called Gitwa?
@A.
Yes, I have identified them, three hills which are called Gitwa in this map.
@MR. BESNIER:
To your knowledge, how many hills are called Gitwa in Kibuye préfecture?
@A.
I do not know how many hills because these names have been given locally by the local people.  The area which I visited on these roads -- around the roads, I asked and they gave these names of Gitwa hill, so I cannot say how many hills are in Kibuye préfecture.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are there also hills or places that might be called Gitwe, with an "E" at the end: G-I-T-W-E?
@A.
Yes, like -- which I have shown one more hill, which is hill No. 2.  It's called Gitwe hill.  And I don't know about others which are not in this map.
@MR. BESNIER:
If we refer to document L001-9886, we can see a photograph of Gitwa hill; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, this is a photograph of Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, hill No. 25.
@MR. BESNIER:
And it is the Gitwa hill which is located in Gitesi commune; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Is this hill very high?
@A.
This hill is quite high and it can be seen in the photograph also.  There is a valley on the one side, like if you see photograph No. 46.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but when I look at that photograph 3, it does not seem that it's a very high hill, actually, it seems like a slight rise in this lay of the land.  Could you please explain this to us?
@A.
Because when you travel on the road, the road is passing through the hills, going from one hill to other hill.  So on the side of these roads you see photograph No. 3, on the left side there is a valley, so height has to be relative phenomenon.  So this hill is quite high compared to other -- other very near hills, but Karongi is the highest hill in this area.  So this hill is quite high.  It seems as -- quite flat because photograph No. 4 is taken from the top, but we have to see the locations of -- like photograph Nos. 5 and 6, you'll see that, yes, valleys are there and hill is quite high compared to other hills.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Did you visit the other Gitwa hill, the one that's located in Bisesero?
@A.
Yes, I visited those hills also.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you did not take any photographs of them, did you?
@A.
No, because for this -- like for the purpose of this case I did not take the photograph of those hills because through the photograph Nos. 7 to 16, the hills have been projected, how the hills look like in this area.  And all the hills are like -- they look almost similar but there are a lot of hills and there is a road in-between and hills are covered with vegetation, trees, like a little bit of forest in the valleys.  So which is -- these have been presented in photo 7 to photo 16.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would now like to focus on Gitwa hill in Bisesero.  In photograph 7 to 12, could you identify the Gitwa hill located in Bisesero?
@A.
No, I cannot identify it.
@MR. BESNIER:
I believe that you were the one who interviewed some of the Prosecution witnesses; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you ask them to distinguish, when they were speaking of Gitwa hill, whether they were referring to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune or of Gitwa hill in Bisesero?
@A.
Yeah, I asked some of them and they referred to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, which is in the statements.  And, in fact, I visited like sketch number -- sketch number --  sketch on L001-9881.  This sketch has been prepared when I went with the witness and that time he referred to the Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune which is hill 25 here.  And I passed through that road, crossed the hill, then I went to the place which is shown as a roadblock in this.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  This -- and this would allow us to be able to proceed smoothly with the rest of the trial.  I have no further questions, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, just one simple question, Your Honour.  
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Baghel, could you tell whether the Accused's -- the family home of the Accused person was accessible by road -- by car from Gitaka centre in 1994?
@A.
About 1994, I don't know.  I visited only in 2001.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, very much. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I understood you to the effect that these photographs were taken without any consultation with particular witnesses.  It was to give us an idea of the topography and the landscape.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, photographs 1 to 6, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, this also relates to photographs 1 and 2 concerning the Gitaka centre.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No contact with particular witnesses in contact -- in connection with that one?
@THE WITNESS:
No, when I took the photographs.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, now you limit your answer to photographs 1 to 6.  But when we look at photograph 7 onwards, again, what was your method there, was there any link to any witness in this case?
@THE WITNESS:
Photograph -- because during the course of investigation, some witnesses referred from Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, they fled to the adjourning hills.  That's why to project what kind of terrain of the hills in that area, topography, what kind of vegetation is there where those witnesses fled.  That's why I took those photographs.  I searched from the database and found those photographs which were '95, so it was hardly one year after the main events.  That's why I took those photographs put here (sic).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So these are all photographs from 1995 and not linked to any particular story or event recounted by the witnesses in the present case?
@THE WITNESS:
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  Thank you very much.  
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for coming --
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- forward with your testimony. 
@THE WITNESS: 
Thank you. 
$Witness excused) 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, while we are waiting for the next witness I would like to draw to your attention that during the status conference that was held last week we had agreed with the Prosecutor as to the order in which the witnesses would appear.  However, we were informed just a few hours ago that this order was going to be modified and that the witness that was scheduled to testify today was not the one that had been specified during the status conference.  We do not wish to cause an incident with respect to this, but we just wish to draw your attention to the fact that this state of affairs raises some difficulties for the Defence.  At the present time, at this very moment, we do not know what this witness will say in his testimony, but in view of his statement, it is possible that as a result of the testimony of this witness we might ask for some additional time before we begin our
cross-examination.  We might, for example, request that we begin our cross-examination tomorrow morning if this is required.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You are quite right.  It follows from the notification we were provided with today that the order of witnesses has been changed.  This being said, I note that there is no request for additional time as of now, and we will see how this develops.  
Could we then bring in the next witness, Prosecution? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, I expect that the WVSS section is dealing with that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, this is a protected witness.  If you will now kindly draw the curtains.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the Prosecution proposes to call Witness GKH -- gulf, kilo, hotel.  That witness is listed as No. 3 on your list.  
Your Honour, I acknowledge my learned friend's comment in relation to the order that we had indicated.  There are certain circumstances that govern these trials that are absolutely beyond my control as Your Honour may be aware of.  This particular witness that I had requested to travel was unable to travel, and other issues came up over the weekend that necessitated us taking this particular witness instead of the prior indicated witness.  But I assure both Your Honours and my learned friend for the Defence that we do this in good faith.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in other words, witness 1 on the original list, C-Charlie, G-Gulf, H-Harold, did not come?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, no, Your Honour, witness 1 is actually here.  CGH is here.  But we -- based on reconfirmation exercise over the weekend, we felt a lot more comfortable with GKH to come now and CGH to come right after him.  So we kind of reversed the order but -- 
So, if I can be of some assistance whilst we wait for the witness to come in.  I have informed my learned friend for the Defence that we would take Gulf-Hotel - sorry, Gulf-Kilo-Hotel now.  We hope to finish with him today.  We will then take Charlie-Gulf-Hotel second, hopefully, tomorrow at this time; we will then take Charlie-Gulf-Kilo, third.  And that would be it for this week, at least as far as I know.  As I stand before you I have no other witnesses in Arusha.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is no GMZ? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@GMZ did not arrive, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  All right, these are the three witnesses available at present.  
Can you please bring the witness, Registry? 
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I'm not sure I fully understood the order in which the witnesses were going to appear.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat it, please, Prosecution?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We would hear witness No. 3 on our list now.  He is GKH, Gulf-Kilo-Hotel.  We will then hear witness No. 1 on our list this time tomorrow, God willing.  That witness's pseudonym is Charlie-Gulf-Hotel.  We will then hear witness No. 4 on our list, and her pseudonym is Charlie-Gulf-Kilo.  And that about wraps up -- that would exhaust the witnesses we have on the ground as we speak.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you very much. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to testify in French during your testimony? 
@THE WITNESS:
I speak French.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness GKH in these proceedings, and you are a protected witness.  So when you are asked questions by, first, Prosecution -- can you hear me, Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what I was about to say that you are a protected witness and you have to be careful when you answer the questions posed first by the Prosecution and then by the Defence in order not to reveal your identity.  So, if any question, when answered, would lead to disclosure, then please make a pause and we will make the necessary arrangements to proceed without risking anything.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to tell the truth and the registry will now administer the solemn declaration.  Registry, please. 
@MR. MUSSA:
Mr. Witness, please stand up and raise your right hand, then say after me. 
$Declaration made by Witness GKH in French)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, listen carefully to the questions, Mr. Witness, and try to answer them as briefly and concisely as possible.  
The Prosecution will now start, please.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
Your Honour, may I start by asking the Registry to kindly hand to the witness a personal information form, as is customary in this Trial Chamber, to dispense with the need to have to go through his personal identification details with him.  It's signed.  He just signed it in the witness room and I just want him to confirm it for the record that he does agree with its contents.  I'll then enter it into evidence.  
Mr. Registry, can you assist me, please?  Very kind.  
Whilst that is being done, Your Honour, due to the nature of this witness's testimony, I am afraid that I am going to have to make one of those applications that doesn't endear me terribly with the press and the public.  And in that regard, I am making an application under Rule 79(A)(ii).  And the application unfortunately is that the press and the public be excluded from part -- and I emphasise, part -- of these proceedings for reasons of the safety, security and the non-disclosure of the identity of this witness, pursuant to Rule 75(B)(ii).  
In terms of the scope of the order, and I hasten to add that the first three segments of this witness's testimony has to be in closed session and I would only request to re-open the session towards the end of his testimony when we talk about more general events in the locations that he is going to be testifying about.  
Your Honour would see, having closely scrutinised his particulars and, indeed, his -- the nature of his testimony as indicated in page 4 of the English version of his statement -
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The first statement? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I believe he only has one, Your Honour.  I think so.  I will just check.  Yes, I think he only has one statement.  Yes, he only has one statement dated the 10th of May 2001.
Your Honours, I draw Your Honours' attention to page 4 at least of the English version.  And if you look at the paragraph that starts "In early think June 1994", Your Honours would see from the discussion there that it is very unlikely that there were many people in this witness's position at that particular time.  It is certainly an issue that troubles my witness very much, and it is an issue that he has raised and I cannot but agree with his representations that if I adduce that sort of evidence in public then he certainly would be identified.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, this is something you are going to start off with?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's the thrust of my testimony -- of his testimony, Your Honour, and I intend to go straight into it, you know.  Yes, if you turn to page -- the first page, page 3, what is page 3 of the English statement as well, I do intend to go to -- into matters that concern his political affiliations.  Again, they are closely linked with his location and his residence and that of the Accused.  So, again, there are not many people who are in that position and -- 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, there is no advantage or disadvantage for this being in closed session.  It's unfortunate for the press and for general information in general but, in any case, if it's great -- it's better for justice if we proceed in open session, but it's up to the Prosecutor and for the Trial Chamber to make a decision based on information provided by the Prosecution.  Therefore, Mr. President, I shall abide by your decision.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will see how this develops.  
Thank you very much for that remark, Defence.  Having looked at this document, we will follow the proceedings, but in view of the observation by the Prosecution that they will -- rather, early focus on the particular occupation of this witness, the most practical way, and also in conformity with the spirit of the relevant Rules, would seem to indicate that we have to close this session.  
Now, what is the actual time span, Mr. Phillips?  Approximately how much do you intend to be in closed until you open or are there anything you could take in open first before you move into these other areas?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The matters I want to deal with in open session, Your Honour, are very general matters as to the state of events in Kibuye.  If I start with that Your Honours will end up being totally confused.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, no, we will not be confused.  So maybe we could do it that way, unless anyone else is getting -- is it difficult for you -- for your strategy to do it that way?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, it's difficult and it's perhaps also totally inconsequential to my case whether or not I deal with those general matters.  And, as I say, they are matters -- they are matters I might, in the course of his testimony, just decide to leave out entirely.  So, to start with it would be really prejudicial.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, you may not even have to go into it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then -- and so the entire testimony of this witness in-chief will be for closed?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  It wouldn't to be terribly long, Your Honour. He is testifying in -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Approximately?  About an hour would be --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- French and --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- I think about an hour would be --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
About an hour.  So the public is informed of that, but then that would have repercussion on the cross-examination.  So there may well be closed session for the rest of the day.  At any rate, the Registry will announce whether we can go into open session later on.  That is the situation.  If the public will then kindly leave the gallery and we will proceed.  
Mr. Witness, you have listened to this discussion and I am sure you have seen that in order to protect your safety we will now close these proceedings.  That implies that everything that's going to happen here now will only be heard by the parties and the staff.  There is no one in the public gallery, and the transcripts of the proceedings will be kept under seal afterwards.  So now you can speak freely. 
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, during your stay in Kibuye between April and June 1994, did there come a time when you attended a meeting at the Kibuye préfectural office, and, if so, when?
@A.
Yes, it was on the 3rd of May 1994. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you know who convened this meeting?
@A.
I don't know, but the prime minister was there, and other ministers were there as well.  There were members of various political parties who were there, there were bourgmestres there as well.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you know the identities of any of the government ministers that attended this meeting, sir?
@A.
Well, apparently they were all there, but mainly those from Kibuye, because the prime minister had come to visit Kibuye prefecture, and so those who were natives of Kibuye had to be there. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And are you able to recall which particular ministers hailed from Kibuye who attended that meeting?
@A.
There was Agnes Ntamabariro, who was the minister of justice, I believe, N-T-A-M-A-B-A-R-I-R-O, first name Agnes, A-G-N-E-S; there was Eliezer Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A, Niyitegeka, first name Eliezer; and there was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  And I think those were the ministers who were from Kibuye. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know why the three ministers who hailed from Kibuye had to have been present at the meeting?
@A.
Well, they had to be there, because the prime minister, who was the one who had appointed them, had come to their prefecture, therefore there was no reason for them not to be there and to be where he was, especially as the visit dealt with Kibuye prefecture.  So they had to attend the meeting.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know what the purpose of the meeting was, sir?
@A.
Well, the main purpose -- at least this is what the prime minister said -- it dealt with pacification with respect to the killings, the massacres.  And so the main word was pacification.  And he spoke about the RPF, that RPF units had attacked the country, that we needed to fight, that we would defeat them, but he was saying that we had to stop the killings. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At the time of this meeting, the 3rd of May 1994, were you personally aware, Mr. Witness, of any, any, massacres in Kibuye prefecture?
@A.
Yes, there had been massacres everywhere, killings everywhere.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you mention some locations that you had become aware of where massacres had indeed occurred as at 3rd May 1994, Mr. Witness, in Kibuye?
@A.
At that date, no.
I'm not sure I understood your question. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I guessed as much.  Can you tell the Court of any locations in Kibuye prefecture that you had become aware of as at 3rd May where massacres had occurred, just off the top of your head?
@A.
Well, not on that specific date, but between April and May there had been massacres in Kibuye at the Home St. Jean, at the parish, at Gatwaro stadium, at Nyange and Mugonero, and they had already started in Bisesero.  But fighting still continued, so everywhere there were massacres and killings.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Whilst you were at the meeting on 3rd of May involving the prime minister and these other ministers who hailed from Kibuye, did you hear anyone condemn those massacres that you have just described as having been aware of?  Anyone?
@A.
Yes, a person named Leonard Hitimana.  He was a doctor.  He was a member of the MDR party, but from the moderate MDR wing.  He condemned the massacres.  He said that small children remained in the stadium and at the Home St. Jean and had been taken to hospital, and that it was necessary to watch over them, to bring them food, to take care of them, because they were still there.  And the person named Eliezer Niyitegeka said that was none of his business and was not his problem, even though he was a physician, these matters were none of his business.  And this is why, after the meeting, Dr. Hitimana had to flee, because he was being persecuted.  He had to flee the country.  He went to Congo and did not come back until some time much later.  And so there were persons who had bad intentions and did not want people to be saved.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The man you describe as Niyitegeka, who reacted to Hitimana's comments, was who?  What position did he hold in government?
@A.
He was the minister of information, I believe.  The minister of information.  He was a member of the MDR power wing. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did the prime minister himself react to the comments made by this Dr. Hitimana?
@A.
I don't remember.  I don't remember his reaction. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, you also mentioned, Mr. Witness, that some bourgmestres attended the meeting on 3rd May.  Do you recall if any of the bourgmestres made any speeches at that meeting?
@A.
There was a person -- I can't recall this person's name -- a person from Gisheta commune.  I can't remember the name just now, but it will come back to me.  Yes, it was Sikuwabo, and he said that there were RPF soldiers in Bisesero and he was asking for assistance, asking that soldiers be sent to fight them.  And the prime minister said, "You must be watchful and see whether they were RPF soldiers, Inkotanyi, or if they were Batutsi who had fled to that location.  If they were Batutsi, you should leave them, but if they were RPF soldiers, tell us, and we will provide assistance so that you can fight them". 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
To your knowledge, Mr. Witness, were there any RPF soldiers in Kibuye as at the 3rd of May 1994?
@A.
Well, who else was there?  Let me think.  I know that the Turquoise troops came, but I don't remember exactly when.  I know they came to Kibuye.  I don't know if it was then or later.  I don't really recall.  Turquoise was also in Kibuye, because I think it was towards the end of May when Turquoise went to Bisesero to try and save the survivors who had remained there after the massacres. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My question, rather, referred to RPF soldiers.  Do you know, in your personal knowledge, whether there were any RPF soldiers active in Kibuye in May 1994?
@A.
Well, unless they had infiltrated, but they had not yet arrived.  They were still in the Gitarama area.  They were still fighting in Gitarama.  They had not yet crossed the Nyabarongo.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So in your opinion, what -- who did you understand this bourgmestre Sikuwabo to be referring to when he referred to RPF or Inkotanyi?  Who was he referring to?
@A.
I wouldn't be able to know.  I mean, they weren't wearing a uniform, they could not easily have been identified, so I don't know who he could have been referring to.  I don't know. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Mr. Witness. 
Mr. Witness, if I asked you to identify Emmanuel Ndindabahizi this evening, would you be able to do so?

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Mr. Witness, can you tell me, has anyone other than officers from the Office of the Prosecutor contacted you in relation to this trial, anyone at all apart from members of the Office of the Prosecutor?  Has anyone contacted you in relation to this trial and, if so, who and when? 
@A.
Thank you.  It was during the month of August, I believe it was on the 10th or the 11th, I received a telephone call from someone who was claiming to know me and they wanted to meet me in a bar.  I was busy, and I told this person that I could go there later.  This person called me back, and so I went to see this person.  I didn't know this person, but there is someone who knew me and knew the person. 
And when I reached the bar I had a drink, and I was expecting for someone to come and see me and say, "I have been looking for you."  After approximately ten minutes this person said, "Well, where is so and so?"  The person who knew me said, "Well, he's there."  So this person came and greeted me.  It was around 5 p.m. or 7 p.m., but we could see with the lamp. 
So we moved to one side of the road, and he told me that he was contacting me at the request of Ndindabahizi's counsel and that he wanted me to make a statement for Ndindabahizi's defence, and he told me that he had been sent by counsel.  He gave me his name.  His first name was Jean Pierre; I don't remember his surname.  I know someone who had lived with this person.  And he told me, "To confirm this, I can say that during the month of August you will be travelling to Arusha to testify." 
He showed me a document on which was written the names of all the persons who were going to come and testify here in Ndindabahizi's trial and their pseudonym.  I believe that is the word that you used, was that.  He said, "This is your name and this is your pseudonym."  And he read the names.  I recognised some of the names; these were some of the people I knew.  And I told him, "I cannot speak double-talk.  If you know that I am going to Arusha, then I go to Arusha.  I will not change my testimony and I cannot give you a statement."  And I know that subsequently he went to see other people who will perhaps come, and they contacted me and said, "Were you contacted by someone?"  And they said, "Yes, I was contacted."  And they said, "We met with this person as well." 
I thought this person was an employee of the ICTR, and when I mentioned this to someone they said, "No, it wasn't us because you know us."  And when I reached Kigali before I came here, I spoke to ICTR employees in Kigali because if we are to be protected, then everything should be done in the strictest confidence.  I mean, I've left my house, and now everyone knew I was coming to Arusha.  And this is why I said this, in case there were any problems, so people would know how things actually took place.  This is what I have to say. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let the records reflect, Your Honour, that the 10th of August is three days after I made unredacted disclosure of my entire witness list to the Defence team in Paris, France. 
I have no further questions for this witness.
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Before I lead the cross-examination with this witness, there was one point that I would like to clarify, and I would like to ask the Prosecutor to which part of the indictment he is referring to.  When hearing this witness, what are the relevant parts of the indictment that pertain to this witness, because I have closely read the indictment and I do not see that Mr. Ndindabahizi is accused of having participated in a meeting on the 3rd of May, 1994, in Kibuye, and I do not see that he is accused of having had a meeting with the witness in June 1994.  So from a legal perspective, I believe it is important to clarify which specific parts of the indictment are relevant to this testimony and to the testimony made by this witness. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's a very simple matter, Your Honour.  They are factual allegations in any indictment and there's also something called specific intent to commit genocide.  Genocide and intent, that's what it goes to, Your Honour.  It doesn't have to be clearly stated in the indictment. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, I believe that we will have to go a bit further, but maybe we will do this in our closing argument. 
Mr. President, there's two points I would like to make.  First of all, this witness was supposed to testify at a later time, and I have understood that we would only have three witnesses this week.  Therefore, if we request that we -- that today's session be shortened, I believe that we will not lose -- that we will not get behind.  And would it be possible for the Trial Chamber to order that cross-examination begin tomorrow afternoon, especially as it is now currently six -- ten minutes past six. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is, of course, like both parties, willing -- no, eager to move things forward and use court time in an efficient way, but this being said, we note, as mentioned by the Defence, that there has been a change in the witness sequencing.  We also note the explanation of the Prosecution previously why that happened during the weekend. 
In view of the fact that there is a limited number of witnesses, at least for the time being, in the couple of days to come, we would see no problems in granting the Defence request and start tomorrow at two o'clock.  Yes.
Could we plan now a little bit forward, Prosecution?  You have mentioned the witnesses.  We have the investigators, we have the present one -- and I don't think there is any harm in the witness listening to this.
Mr. Witness, we are now just discussing a few procedural issues.  If you could kindly bear with us a couple of minutes.  And as you understood, we will come back to you tomorrow at two o'clock, but before we close for the day, only a few practical arrangements.
Now, the next -- please, Mr. Phillips, first let me ask the Defence the estimated time for the cross-examination of this witness, it being understood that it is certainly only an estimate. 
@MR. BESNIER:
One hour to an hour and a half.  I believe that it would take approximately an hour and a half to cross-examine this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the next witness, Mr. Phillips?  Did you indicate --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Number one on our list, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  Approximately two hours, one hour, three hours? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I actually don't have an indication of how well or how badly I did in relation to time today because of that break in between, but I think I spent, what, two hours? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You started --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no idea how long it was.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, we will shortly be able to -- you started 16:10 and finished 18:10 and then we lost 20 minutes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So I did better than I anticipated, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Not bad at all.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Oh, good, okay.  So if we say two hours maximum for that witness and hopefully shorter than that, Your Honour, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  So the next witness, approximately two hours?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At the very -- at maximum.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
At the maximum, yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's two hours.  Now, that implies that we will start with this one and we will start with cross-examination of that witness tomorrow.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then it was -- that's Tuesday.  Then the third one.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The third one is number four on your list, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And that is a very short witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Estimated time?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
One hour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
One hour.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
One hour maximum.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Say max one hour from the other side, and that's that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's that.  I have no indication who has been brought today, if anyone.  I would find out when I leave here, so ...
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so please get in touch with the witness protection.  And the problem is that GMZ didn't arrive, was that so?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, we're having problems with him, Your Honour, and he's -- he has indicated that he would not be available until November.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which is -- which poses a problem practically.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But it's important, then, if you -- when you get in touch with Mr. Chappell to make sure that everyone is doing his and her very best, because the number is too limited.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  You will come back to us on that one, then.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Mr. Witness, this brings us to the end of today's session.  You will continue tomorrow.  You must not discuss your testimony with anyone until tomorrow. 
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The court is adjourned until tomorrow.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.
Prosecution, you have the floor for opening statements.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.
Your Honours, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi stands before you today, charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, for the murder and extermination of Tutsi civilians, in and around his home commune of Gitesi in the prefecture of Kibuye in Rwanda.
Needless to say, Your Honours, these crimes are some of the most heinous of crimes known to mankind.  The Defence will have Your Honours believe that the widespread, systematic and sustained attacks on Tutsi civilians throughout Rwanda in l994 resulting in the said genocide, was a spontaneous outburst of communal hatred triggered by the downing of the president's plane as it approached Kigali airport on 6th of April 1994.
The Prosecutor will however, represent to Your Honours, that the attacks on Tutsi which occurred in Rwanda during the said period was conscious, meticulously planned, and orchestrated at the highest level -- at the highest official level.  The Prosecutor will further represent to Your Honour, that the killing of Tutsi was a result of the strategy, the essence and objective of which was a systematic elimination and extermination of all Tutsi in Rwanda, in effect, leaving none to tell the story.
Your Honours, simple logic would suggest that given the magnitude of the killings, it was virtually impossible for such mass killings to have been committed within 100 days without the direct involvement of the state.  In that regard, Your Honours, it is the Prosecution's case that the opposition of the extremist Hutu in power at the time to the power-sharing agreement reached in the Arusha Accords, led to the formulation of an extremist "Hutu-power" ideology within Rwanda.
Two Prosecution witnesses, Your Honours, GKH and Ms. Alison Des Forges, will testify that although the interim government established following the president's death was composed of five of the six political parties in Rwanda, in reality the said government essentially comprised of politicians who were selected from the extremist factions of the respective political parties, many of whom were opposed to the power-sharing agreement.
Your Honours, indeed, the majority of the politicians who formed the said government were
non- extremists.  However, there were some politicians amongst them who had no known history of extremism, but rather, were mere opportunists brought into the said government without any real political power, but rather, as a façade to establish a broad-based government.
Your Honours, the Defence will have you believe that those politicians who had a known history of extremism were indeed more likely to have a motive to commit these heinous crimes than the politicians who belonged to the known moderate parties such as the PSD.  They would argue that such politicians, the moderates, simply have no case to answer.  In that regard, the Prosecutor will represent to Your Honour, that factors such as past or present political affiliations had little or 
nothing -- absolutely no bearing on the sad events which form the basis of this trial.
Witness GKH will describe to Your Honour how, from 7th April 1994, three categories of politicians existed in Rwanda: those who were seen as obstacles to the genocidal government and were eliminated; the second category, those who fled the country in the knowledge of what was about to happen and did not want to be seen to be part of it; and the third category, those who remained and chose to participate in the said genocidal government.
At 10:30 p.m.  on the evening of 8th April 1994, Dr. Thédore Sindikubwabo, who was then the president of the National Assembly, in a radio broadcast to the nation, declared himself president of Rwanda, citing article 42 of the constitution of 10th June 1991.  He announced a list of members of the "provisional government".
Now, regardless of their political affiliation, 20 ministers on the morning of 9th April l994, pursuant to paragraph 56 of the constitution of 10th June 1991, pledged to do as follows, Your Honour, and I quote from paragraph 56 of that constitution.  They pledged to:  "Loyally carry out their duties and be faithful to the Republic of Rwanda, the Head of State, and most importantly, to promote the interest of Rwandan people".
Your Honours, for those men and women who chose to serve in that said provisional government, and those who took the oath of office on the 9th of April, there was now a common denominator that held them together.  It was not political affiliation, but rather, the need to fight the common enemy and those perceived as its accomplices.
Your Honours, the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, an accountant by profession, chose to serve in that transitional government as Minister of Finance.  He remained in that position, Your Honours, until November 1994.  Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, I would represent to Your Honours, was dedicated to cause and country, and that, we say, was a clear motive for participating in such a horrendous crime and criminal enterprise.
Your Honours, it is not therefore surprising that having taken the said oath as indicated by paragraph 56 of the constitution, to be loyal to both cause and country, we find that the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi participated in one form or the other in the killing of Tutsi in and around his native commune and prefecture of origin, Kibuye.
Your Honours, the Accused was a member of the Social Democratic Party, the PSD.  Indeed, he was the chairperson of the said party in his native Kibuye prefecture.  In that regard, Your Honours -- sorry, in that regard, the Accused will have Your Honours believe that the PSD was indeed famous for its moderate stand prior to April 1994.
The Prosecutor will, however, represent to Your Honours that whilst this may have been the case prior to 6th April 1994, the entire moderate leadership of the said party, including those PSD members who by virtue of the power-sharing agreement had participated in the Habyarimana government, had all been eliminated by 12th April l994.  They included Félicien Gatabazi, the PSD leader and cabinet minister in the Habyarimana government, who was assassinated in April 1994.  Mr. Frederic Nzamurambaho, who was the president of the PSD and also a minister in the Habyarimana government, was also assassinated on the 7th of April 1994.
Now, Your Honours, those who had not fled the country, those who hadn't been killed in the first days of the genocide had, in fact, left the country, leaving only members of the PSD, like the Accused, who sympathised and identified with the extremist Hutu ideology to take part in the provisional government.
Now, one of those who fled the country was a man called Marc Rugenera.  He was a senior member of the PSD party and a finance minister in the Habyarimana government.  Rugenera had been earmarked for elimination as well, but had only escaped death due to the fact that he did not reside in the ministerial district like other ministers.  You would be interested to know, Your Honours, that the Accused that stands before you today replaced him in the genocidal government as Minister of Finance.
To survive in government, the Prosecutor would represent to Your Honour that those who chose to remain in the said provisional government quite simply had to remain loyal and committed to the chosen path and had to be seen to be so.  Indeed, those who remained there were at great pains to distance themselves from any association with the perceived enemy.
On 19th April 1994, Your Honours, the interim President Sindikubwabo identified his government as "a government of saviours," a government that would come directly to the people "to tell you what it expects of you".
During the third week of April 1994, ministers and other high-ranking officials did go into the countryside, insisting on the need to support the genocide, promising rewards to supporters and threatening sanctions against dissenters.  Your Honours, the Accused was no exception.
Prosecution Witness GKH was an elected parliamentarian.  His only offence, Your Honour, was that he was married to a Tutsi woman.  That witness will testify in the course of today how the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, accused him of being inactive and demanded the witness to waive his right to assume his elected seat in parliament in favour of another party member who was supposedly more active.
In a speech during a visit to Butare on the 29th April l994, the then interim president, Théodore Sindikubwabo, emphasized that government ministers from Butare had returned home in order to supervise the killing of Tutsi.  On the 18th of May 1994, Mr. Sindikubwabo visited Kibuye préfecture and publicly congratulated the Hutu population for having done its work.
Similarly, the then interim Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda, visited Kibuye on 3rd May 1994.  Various ministers of the interim government who originated from Kibuye prefecture were present at this meeting.  This included the Accused, Your Honour.  Witness GKH and Ms. Alison Des Forges will testify that despite the large-scale massacre that occurred in Kibuye prefecture between 14th and 30th April l994, absolutely none of the senior government ministers present at the said meeting, including the Accused, condemned or even referred to the massacres.
In that regard we would submit to Your Honours that by focusing hatred on Tutsi, the organisers of killings hoped to forge solidarity amongst Hutus.  But beyond that, Your Honours, they aimed at creating collective responsibility for genocide.  People were encouraged to kill together so that no one would bear individual or total responsibility for the executions.
The Prosecutor will represent to the Trial Chamber, that the involvement of the present population in the massacres that followed was facilitated by their misplaced belief, Your Honours, and confidence in their leadership, and also by an understanding that the encouragement of the authorities guaranteed them immunity to kill Tutsi and loot their property.  From 12th April to the beginning of May 1994, the killers carried out the most devastating massacres of genocide throughout Rwanda.
According to the 1991 census, 12.4 per cent of the Kibuye prefecture population was killed in the genocide.  That means, Your Honour, approximately 80 per cent of the Tutsi population.  The majority of those killed in Kibuye were killed in the first two weeks of the genocide, that is, between the 6th and 21st April, 1994, and then again in mid-May 1994.  It is the Prosecution's case, Your Honours, that the Accused, as a member of the interim government, frequently visited Kibuye in order to instigate and order the killing of Tutsi civilians in his préfecture of origin.
By virtue of his prominence in the local community, the Accused as president of the PSD party in Kibuye, as a serving minister, was clearly a person of considerable influence.  As such, civilians, gendarmes, members of the Interahamwe militia, were more likely than not to follow his orders.
Now, several Prosecution witnesses that you will hear in the course of this trial, Your Honours, will testify that roadblocks which had been established to promote security and check rising crime in Rwanda were very quickly transformed and used to identify Tutsi for killing.
Now, by restricting movement at these roadblocks, it made it less likely for people to escape.  In some cases, local businessmen and local officials, people like the Accused, sponsored these roadblocks and supported those who manned those roadblocks with food, drinks and weaponry. 
Your Honours, the Prosecutor will represent to you that as a member of the provisional government, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's mere presence at the roadblock, or indeed several roadblocks in and around Gitesi commune, or indeed his presence, or alleged presence during attacks in Gitwa Hill Karongi Hill, and in the area of Bisesero, would most certainly have an encouraging effect on the attackers.  But more importantly, Your Honours, it would have conveyed to those attackers the impression that the killings of Tutsi in Kibuye was endorsed by the interim government.
The Prosecutor would further represent to Your Honours that the actions of the Accused throughout the months of April, May, June 1994, as outlined in the indictment, namely, the distribution of weapons, his participation in the systematic killing by leading convoys, transporting attackers to massacre sites, being seen at several roadblocks at various locations, is demonstration of his specific intent to destroy in whole or in part of Tutsi as a group.  Indeed, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's statements and directives provide direct evidence of his genocidal intent.
In terms of context within which the activities were conducted, the Prosecutor will represent to Your Honours that there are striking similarities between the killing of Tutsi civilians at various roadblocks in Gitesi commune, Kibuye, the attacks on Gitwa Hill, also in Gitesi commune, the attacks in the area of Bisesero, and those launched against Tutsis in other areas and other parts of Kibuye préfecture and, indeed, in the country of Rwanda as a whole during the same period.
Now, in that regard, Your Honour, it is the Prosecution's case that the mass killings and other crimes alleged in this present indictment or code, was part of a wider genocidal plan and policy to exterminate Tutsis throughout Rwanda between April and June 1994.  To that end, I urge Your Honours not to assess the factual allegations that you would hear in this case in isolation, but, rather, to consider those allegations in the overall context of events -- the events that occurred in Rwanda between April and June 1994, and more specifically in Kibuye préfecture within the same period.  Because it is only such an approach, Your Honours, that will provide you with a better understanding of the context within which the Accused committed the crimes alleged in the present indictment.
Finally, Your Honour, as outlined in Appendix A of the pre-trial brief, the Prosecutor will rely on the evidence of 17 protected factual witnesses, an expert witness, and an investigator, during the course of this trial.
Your Honours, based on the premise that the Prosecutor will be able to present four witnesses every week, I expect that the Prosecution will complete the presentation of her case within four weeks from today.  Unless I can be of further assistance to Your Honours, the Prosecutor is ready to call her first witness.  He is Mr. Upendra Baghel, an investigator from her office, and he will be led by my colleague, Mr. Wallace Kapaya.
Your Honours, I thank you for your attention.
@MR. PRESIDENT:

Mr. Baghel, it is noted that there are five parts in this document.  The first part relates to maps.  Can you tell this Chamber the source of the maps which are there?
@A.
First part contains the maps-it is having three maps; map of Rwanda, map of Kibuye and the road map.  The map of Rwanda, which is the first map, I collected from the evidence unit.  And the second map, which is map of Kibuye, was collected from the UNDP office Kigali, and it is in the database of Kigali investigations.  The third road map is Kigali to Gitarama, and Gisenyi, Kibuye and Gitarama, which I prepared after visiting these places and travelling on the road, then plotting to the road which I took.

@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Mr. Baghel, what do you intend to -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Hold on a little moment, Mr. Kapaya.
Please proceed.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
$BY MR. KAPAYA: 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Baghel, just very briefly, what's the relevance of these maps to the work you did in this case?
@A.
The first map, which is the Rwanda map, it shows that Rwanda is surrounded by Tanzania, Burundi, Congo and Rwanda (sic), and it consists of eleven préfectures which have been shown in the map.  
The second map, which is of Kibuye because Kibuye is one of the préfectures of Rwanda, there is a map of Kibuye préfecture which shows that this préfecture is surrounded by Gisenyi, Gitarama, Gikongoro, Cyangugu préfectures.  And this Kibuye préfecture consists of nine communes, and Gitesi is one of the communes.  
Third map, which is basically a road map, which shows that Kigali to Gitarama is around 42 kilometres, and Gitarama to Gisenyi is around 138 kilometres, Gisenyi to Kibuye is 104 kilometres, and Kibuye to Gitarama is 76 kilometres.  I travelled on these roads and I measured the time which I took, which have been indicated in the map.
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Now part 2 of the - of your work consists of, of sketches consisting of hills.  Can you briefly describe the source of the information which is contained in this one, in this map?
@A.
For the part 2, it shows the map of Gitwa hill and adjourning hills.  Here, the primary source has been an earlier-prepared Bisesero map, the source of most of the hills, and which is in the evidence unit, and I was one of the members who prepared the map.  This primary source after that I took to the field, and again, I contacted the concerned authorities and verified.  So now, this map consists of the Gitwa hill and Gitesi commune and adjourning hills.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what is the relevance of these sketches in this case?
@A.
During the course of the investigation of this file, I noticed that many witnesses are from Gitwa hill, which is in Gitesi commune, and some other hills nearby.  So this map shows where Gitwa hill is located, which is hill number 25 on the Gitwa hill map, which is reference L0019869.  And this hill is located on the road which goes from Kibuye to Karongi hill, which is hill number 20 is Karongi hill, and it goes Gisovu.  And the adjourning hills are -- they are in Bisesero, which I numbered from one to 19.  And there is one more road which comes from Kibuye to these hills directly, because these hills have been referred by the witnesses during the investigation, so these hills are depicted where they are located on the map.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Baghel, it relates to the names of the hills.  We see in hill numbers 5, 6 -- in hill 5, they are all referred to as Gitwa hills.  How would one make the distinction between the three hills?
@A.
Yeah, hill number five and six, they are also called Gitwa hill, but they are in Gishyita commune; and hill number 24 - sorry, 25 is the Gitwa hill in Gishyita commune.  These three hills are quite far away from 25, to hill number 5 and 6, and the direct distance between these hills can be measured because this map is as for the scale.  It has been taken extract from map which was prepared in 199 -- in 1998 by the National Geography of Belgium in collaboration with Rwanda.  So, these two hills are totally different.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, can you relate these hills to the photographs that you have prepared in this bundle?
@A.
In this bundle, I took the photographs of Gitwa hill, which is in Gishyita commune, and this is hill number 25.  And these photographs are in part 4, photo number 3 to 6.  Photo number 3, which is on the page L0019886, is the photo of Gitwa hill taken from the roadside, and part of the road is seen.  
And photo number 4 is taken from the top of Gitwa hill, and as seen from the photograph, top of Gitwa hill having a small grass, small plants and loose stones.
Photo 5 is taken from Gitwa hill towards left direction, that is, pointing towards hill number 26.  So the front which we see the hill is hill number 26, called Gasagaza (phonetic) hill, and as this stretch of road is seen, this stretch of road goes to Kiziba.  Now in Kiziba there is a refugee camp maintained by the UNHCR.  
Photo number 6 is also taken from the top of the hill on the right side, so on the right side this road is seen.  This road is coming from Kibuye town and going through Gitwa hill to Karongi hill, then to Gisovu.  And on the right side there is Kibuye town and the lay council, and the valley is seen.  
So these four photographs are concerned to hill 25, which is Gitwa hill in Gishyita commune.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Now, let's move to the sketches which are in part 3 --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, when you took these photographs, did you take them in order to give the Court an impression of the topography, the landscape, the hills, or was it your purpose to identify particular locations in these hills which may be of relevance in this particular case?
@THE WITNESS:
These, photographs I took, keeping in view about the topography, terrain, and landscape to how Gitwa hill looked like, because when I visited this Gitwa hill, I was not with the - like, with any witness, so I don't know exact location which maybe relevant.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, talking of photographs, how do you relate the other photographs which are in the bundle?
@A.
The other photographs on the bundle, like photo 1, photo 2, they are about the Gitaka centres, and this Gitaka centre had been referred by few witnesses during the investigations.  That's why I took the photograph of the centre. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
M-hmm.
@A.
Then photo number 7 to -- 7 to 16, these photographs are of the adjourning hills around Gitwa hill, and basically they are of Bisesero area.  I reviewed some previous trial transcript and selected a few photographs which show the terrain, topography, and landscape and the kind of hills in the area.  After that, I took them from evidence, evidence unit.  They copied and gave me.  Those photograph, I matched them with the copy in evidence unit, and after that I put them in this bundle.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Is there anything to indicate as to when those photographs were taken?
@A.
These photographs, like photo number 7 to photo number 11, were taken up to 1995; and photo number 12 and 13 were taken in September 1995; and photo number 14 to 16 were taken in February 1998, and these are the Prosecution exhibits in the case of Kayishema.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Now, finally, you have sketches.  What methodology did you use in preparing these sketches?
@A.
The sketches which are in part 3, these are sketches I prepared during the investigation of this file, and I filed them in evidence unit.  While preparing these sketches, I accompanied with the witness, who showed me the place where a roadblock was there in 1994.  And after getting some more information from witness about the location, the jurisdictional location like in which secteur, which commune, I prepared this sketch.  Now, again, I took them from the evidence unit and re-verified, and after that I put them in this binder. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
You have in part 5 a list of secteurs.  Can you tell us the relevance of this document in your bundle?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you move on to that.  
Now, Mr. Witness, did you say that you indicated places where there were roadblocks based on conversations with witnesses?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are these witnesses in the present case or in other cases?
@THE WITNESS: 
These witnesses are in the present case, and during the investigation I did so.  But during the re-verification, I verified the place again.  And with regard to sketch 6, I got additional information, which I put in additional  information, like on sketch 6 which is on L0019879, the place which is marked as B.  B was the bar of Augustine Karara who was the cellule responsable of Gasharu cellule in 1994.  This information I put in the form of additional information on the next page.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We do not know, do we, Mr. Kapaya, which witnesses this investigator's -- this investigator got his information from?
@MR. KAPAYA:
The witness has the pseudonyms of the witnesses from whom he got the information from.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  But that's not in this document, is it?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, it's not there.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  Are we talking about many witnesses or only one witness, Mr. -
@THE WITNESS
No, for these sketches -
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please push the button, will you?
@THE WITNESS: 
For the sketches, we are talking about many witnesses because each sketch is referring to one witness.  Sketch 2 is one witness; sketch 3 is one witness; sketch 4, third witness; then sketch 6 is the sources, secteur counseiller of the secteur; then one more sketch.  So there are four witnesses I'm referring who gave me this information about specific locations.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you think it would be helpful for the Court to know which witnesses, in pseudonym form, these were, Mr. Kapaya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, yeah, it would.
$BY MR. KAPAYA: 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you, Mr. Baghel, mention the pseudonyms of the witnesses who supplied you with the information in regard to the sketches?
@A.
With reference to sketch 2, which is L0019877, the witness who showed me this place, his pseudonym is CGC, Charlie-Golf-Charlie.  In sketch 3, for this, the pseudonym of the witness is CGK, Charlie-Golf-Kilo.  For sketch 4, the pseudonym is CGM, that is, Charlie-Golf-Mike.  For the sketch 6 is the secteur conseiller, who I suppose is still secteur conseiller of the secteur.  And for the sketch which is L0019881, the pseudonym of the witness is CGY, Charlie-Golf-Yankee.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I have you repeat the last one, will you?  Where - are you now on 80?  I think the problem here is that you have K numbers and L numbers.  Now, you were referring to the last two, L81, were you?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yeah.  I am referring L number because K numbers are the old numbers.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@THE WITNESS: 
And the L numbers are the new numbers, which are red in colour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@THE WITNESS: 
L0019881, the pseudonym of the witness is CGY, Charlie Golf Yankee.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Now, I was asking you the relevance of the list of six that you put in the file of your report.
@A.
The part 5, which consists of local authority in Gishyita commune, and this is the list of the secteurs, secteur conseillers and cellules in Gishyita commune in 1994.  This information I collected from the commune office, which is the district office now, on the advice of the trial team to collect it.  And moreover, during the investigation also, I found the many witnesses were referring the names of Gitesi commune, different cellule and secteur.  So the names which have been put here, they may be relevant in the case, and moreover now because Rwanda has been reorganised and the places are called as districts and authorities are called mayor.  So this all '94, it may be useful.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this document does, as you've just indicated, not only relate to the secteurs, but it also gives information about persons holding office during that period?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  In 1994, the person who were holding the office of secteur, secteur conseillers and the bourgmestres.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And that's based on witnesses you met?
@THE WITNESS: 
This is based - this list was given to me by the mayor of Kibuye municipality, which he has signed on the page 3 of this documents on 31st July 2003.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So also the document -- also the information relating to the holders of office comes from the commune office?  
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And it provided, provided when?  In July 31, 2003?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  Thank you.
$BY MR. KAPAYA: 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And finally, Mr. Baghel, you have a copy of the constitution of June '91 as an appendix to your report; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, this is the final document that is appendix in my binder.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That's all I have from this witness, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Mr. President, I only have a few questions for this witness.
$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Investigator, you visited Kibuye préfecture.  Did you pay specific attention to the cellule in which the Accused was born?
@A.
Yes.  During the course of my investigations, I visited the place which is in Gitaka centre, and I was told that the Accused's parental house is located at the place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you give us the name of the Accused's native cellule?
@A.
The name of the native cellule where the house of his parents, his parents is located is Gasharu cellule in Gitesi secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you.  Mr. Witness, I would like us to look at L0019861, please.  Do you have the document?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  This is the report that you made after your travel through Kibuye préfecture; is that correct?
@A.
This is the report which I made after travelling on the roads, not necessarily in Kibuye prefecture, because I started from Kigali to Gitarama, then Gitarama to Gisenyi, and Gisenyi to Kibuye then to Murambi; that is, Gitarama back.
@MR. BESNIER:
With regard to the road from Gitarama to Kibuye, can you describe to us the status of that road and what was it made of?
@A.
This is -- I travelled - like, I have been travelling on many times on this road.  For this - for the purpose of this document I travelled -- I went on this road during the days which I mentioned, from 11 August to 18 August 2003, and on that day the road is made of asphalt and it is fully tarmac road from Kibuye to Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have any information on the condition of that road in 1994?
@A.
I don't have any information about the condition of the road in 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you not ask the authorities what the status of the condition of the road was in 1994, because that is what is of interest to us now?
@A.
I did not ask the authority specifically that what is the condition of -- what was the condition of the road in 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can we now look at L0019870, please, the little D of 2, small (ii).  At the end of that paragraph, the last sentence reads that, "It can be granted that the Bisesero area covers parts of Gitesi, Gishyita and Gisovu," and we are referring here to communes, Gishyita commune, Giseti commune and Gisovu commune.  Have you found where I am?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Do you confirm that Bisesero area covers these three communes?
@A.
Because I have been to this area on many occasions, so there is no fixed boundaries for the Bisesero area.  The area which -- around these hills is known as Bisesero.  So that's why areas of these three communes, not whole communes, some parts of the commune where these hills are there, is called the Bisesero area.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was your methodology in arriving at that conclusion?  Was it by listening to the witnesses or did you consult maps?
@A.
This is by listening to various informants, basically witnesses and some local, general informers.  Like when we start from Kibuye town, if you say, "Which is Bisesero area?"  Then they will point out to the hill, "This side is Bisesero."  So this is not on the basis on maps, this is the basis - on the basis of local information gathered in the area.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you very sure, according to your research, that the Bisesero area is part of Gitesi commune, even if it's only a small part thereof?
@A.
Yes, because Gitesi commune is quite large.  Like hill 25, 26, if you go through the hill map, it is in the Gitesi commune.  And if you go to the north of hill 25, 26, they will refer these hills towards Bisesero.  So this - there is no clear-cut distinction.  Bisesero, which I mentioned here, Bisesero is the name of a cellule, is name of a secteur, name of a hill also.  So Bisesero area is having very big boundaries.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I don't know whether the Tribunal has in -- the pre-trial brief filed on the 1st of August, 2003, by the Prosecutor.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have it.  What do you want us to look at?
@MR. BESNIER:
I wanted to request the Chamber to go to page 1154 -- 59, 1159 of this document, please.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In the French or English version?
@MR. BESNIER:
Both.  There is no Defence (sic).  I am working with the English version because I believe the French version is not ready as yet.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said the pre-trial brief, did you?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I did.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Which page did you mention?
@MR. BESNIER:
1159.  This is annex B, the "Prosecutor's Request to Admit" is the title on that page, numbered in the right-hand -- top right-hand corner as 1159. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have found it.  Yes, that's fine.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I would like us to deal with number three, which is at the very bottom of that page.  This question is as follows:  "In Bisesero stand the communes of Gishyita and Gisovu in Kibuye préfecture, Rwanda."  That's right, Mr. President.  The Defence did admit that proposal by the Prosecutor, as you can, yourself, see; but today the investigator from the Prosecution is telling us that the Bisesero area spreads through Gishyita, Gisovu and Giseti communes.  We believe that we have already resolved this matter in the framework of the Prosecutor's motion, and we should not come today to be told that the Bisesero area also covers Giseti commune.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, this raises two questions, doesn't it:  One, what you have actually admitted, and the other issue, what is the factual situation?  And your admittance stays; that's what you have admitted.  And you are now saying that it can't be correct, the additional information given by the witness today; is that the position?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  This is information I wish to show the Chamber.  We will bear this in mind later on when we will present our witnesses, and maybe we will be enabled to amend, if need be, what is being said, given what has been said by the witness on the stand, the investigator.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for sharing that with us.  It's noted, thank you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have other questions for the prosecutor's investigator.  These are questions which may help us to gain time during the cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses or during the examination of Defence witnesses.  
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
This is the localisation of certain cellules.  If you cannot answer, you will inform the change (sic), but I think it will help us in gaining some time at a later stage.  
My first question, Mr. Witness, were you able to identify a cellule referred to as Nyagahinga?  I will spell it, N-Y-A-G-A-H-I-N-G-E, Nyagahinga -- the last letter is A, as in Alpha --in Bubazi secteur, 
B-U-B-A-Z-I, in Giseti commune?
@A.
In which document are you referring, excuse me? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is not, I think, related to any particular document.  The question is only, have you located that place, I think.
@THE WITNESS:
No.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
It's specifically because I did not see this cellule in any of the maps presented, that's why I am putting this question to you, Mr. Investigator.
@A.
I don't know because I have not asked about the specific cellules.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, if we can be of assistance to the Chamber, this is provided on page 902, on item 8, the fifth name is shown there as a cellule.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are in which document now, Mr. Kapaya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
I am sorry, I am in the Exhibit P2, Prosecution Exhibit P2 at five, page L0019902, and item, 
sub-item 5.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So that's number five under paragraph 8?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Another question to the Prosecutor (sic) is, did he visit this location?  Did you visit this cellule?
@A.
No, I did not visit.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you visit the Kibirizi market, K-I-B-I-R-I-Z-I, Kibirizi market?  This is Mabanza commune.
@A.
Yeah, once I visited.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you tell us roughly what is the distance between Gasharu cellule and Kibirizi market?
@A.
In fact, I did not measure the distance but only I can estimate it with rough figures.  Yes, this may be around 8 to 10 kilo - 8 kilometres, around.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Is there a tarmacked road to go there, or is it a dirt road?
@A.
Kibirizi market to the divergence to the Gasharu cellule is tarmac now, but from a main road divergence to the Gasharu cellule is non-tarmac road.  So, there is a mix:  3 kilometres may be 
non-tarmac, five may be tarmac road. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you want to know the condition in '94, I assume, if the witness knows?
@THE WITNESS: 
I did not ask specifically the condition in 1994.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You don't know.  That's covered by the general question, yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I was indeed going to put that question to the witness.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Another question for you, Mr. Witness:  You referred to the Gitaka centre and you took photographs of that centre, did you not?  Is the Gasharu cellule from where the Accused hails, is it far from the Gitaka centre?
@A.
In fact, Gitaka centre is in Gasharu cellule.  So Gasharu cellule is the administrative entity, which is territory.  So how it can be far?  It's part of - like, in Gasharu cellule, Gitaka centre is there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, how does one get to Gasharu from Gitaka centre?
@A.
If you reach Gitaka centre -- or before that, border of Gasharu cellule will start.  Gitaka centre is, Gitaka centre is a place which is -- which lies in Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can one get to that place from Gishaka - Gitaka centre by vehicle?
@A.
Gitaka centre is a place where some market is there, a few shops are there.  It is an open area.  And Gasharu cellule is the entity of cellule.  Cellule is like a few square kilometres, so the centre lies in that, so I don't know how Gitaka centre to Gasharu cellule.  If you say some other cellule which is not in this somewhere, then okay, then maybe like Kibuye town or Manya (phonetic) or something.
@MR. BESNIER:
So if you will, how can one go to Gitaka centre to the Accused's house or his parents' home?
@A.
I went to the parents' house because I went to Gitaka centre first.  I asked who is the secteur conseiller, and the secteur conseiller was there and I approached him.  I requested him; he took me to the house of his parents, and he told this house also in Gasharu cellule.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now the question is, how do you get from this Gitaka centre to this that house, whether you can explain that to us.  That's the question.
@THE WITNESS: 
From Gitaka centre to his house - like, I parked the car in Gitaka centre and I went by walking, on foot, and it's around half kilometre of estimate from the Gitaka centre to his house.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it a road which goes up or does it go down?
@A.
A road which goes up from Gitaka centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
In other words, the Accused's family home, which you claim is the Accused's home, is at the top of the hill; is that correct?
@A.
It's -- the family house or family home which was shown to me is at high elevation than the Gitaka centre, but I cannot say it's the top of the hill because Rwanda is full of the hills.  It's in higher elevation than Gitaka centre.  And if you take up some place, like locate some few metre here and there, you can see Gitaka centre from the place, from the house.  
@MR. BESNIER:
From Gitaka centre up to what you call the Accused's home, is it possible to go that distance, cover that distance using a vehicle?
@A.
I did not use the vehicle, and it depends on the weather at the time.  If it is raining, then it is difficult to use at that time, but I think some powerful car can go up to that place.  It depends on the skill of the driver.  But the road is not so much more travelled, that place, so it is safer to park the car at Gitaka centre and walk.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So was there a road leading up there or would a car have to go off-road?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yeah, from there, like, it's around half kilometre.  So up to half distance there's a - like, the car can go to places - like, the road is wide enough that a vehicle can go, but after half distance I was taken to the dirt track, that is, footpath.  But there may be alternative routes which were not shown me, but I cannot claim those things.  The road which I took I am telling you.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
One minute.  I think you used a path because you went on foot to the Accused's home, but you were allegedly told that there was a road which could have been more easy to use for you to reach the same destination; is that what you're saying?
@A.
Yeah, up to half distance I think vehicle -- the vehicle could have been driven.  After half distance, I was taken on a small footpath on the hill and shown the house, that this is the house.  And the track which was coming where vehicle could have been driven that took right, they were then to right side.  So I did not travel on the right divergence, and I was taken to another track, which was footpath.
@MR. BESNIER:
But how do you know that if you turned to the right you could reach the Accused's family home using a car, since you did not do that yourself?
@A.
I don't know, because it is not like the tarmac road is there and there is lane system or something.  That's why I am not telling whether that right turn, it could have gone.  I don't know exactly.

@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  So to conclude with this matter, all that you saw is that there was a road, a path, which could be used going up on foot and that's what you yourself did, in fact; is that not so?
@A.
Yes, I went by foot -- on foot.  So, I don't -- I can't claim and I don't know about -- that a vehicle could go there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  When you were in Gasharu, did you hear mention made of a place known as Kirombo, 
K-I-R-O-M-B-O, Kirombo (sic)?  Did you hear any mention made of that or did you see any such place?
@A.
Yeah, because the road which goes from the main road to Gitaka centre, I asked where this road leads then I was told this road leads to Kirambo school.  So I suppose there may be a school in Kirambo and that may be the place Kirambo, but I did not visit that Kirambo place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Since you didn't go there, do you know whether the inhabitants of Gasharu cellule have to go to Gitaka centre in order to go to Kirambo school?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The name is Kirambo.  I do beg your pardon.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, the people who -- in Gasharu cellule, if they follow the main -- the road which is the main road in that area, then they might have to go through the Gitaka centre.  But, again, Gitaka is a place in the cellule, so it depends on the person where he is staying in the cellule.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You mentioned one Mr. Karara, can you confirm that you mentioned that person's name?
@A.
Yes, I mentioned the name of Augustine Karara, who was cellule responsable of Gasara cellule in 1994, and I got information that his house and bar was in Gitaka centre and which is marked as "B" in my sketch 6.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the name of the Gitesi commune bourgmestre in 1994, if you know?
@A.
Yes, the name of the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune was also Augustine Karara, but these two are different persons.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
They have the first name and the last name in common?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, they have first and last name both in common, Augustine Karara.
@MR. BESNIER:
This is an ambiguity which I wanted to clarify as of this moment, because this name is going to come about several times during the course of the trial. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Could you clarify again what the designation of these two Karara was?
@THE WITNESS:
In my sketch 6, which is on L001-9879, I have shown the place marked "B" and it was the bar and the house of Augustine Karara, and his designation was cellule responsable of Gasharu cellule in Gitesi secteur, in Gitesi cellule.  And the other Augustine Karara which -- the name which is referred to me just now, he was the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And he is the one mentioned on L001-9901? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, he is the one who was bourgmestre, but cellule responsable is not mentioned because the names have not been given of those authorities.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  I would now like to refer to document L001-9880, L001-9880, and let us now refer to Item No. 3.  Could you please tell us who informed you that there was a roadblock during the events of 1994 in Gitaka?
@A.
During the course of investigation, I found few witnesses referring about the roadblock in Gitaka centre.  But when I visited this Gitaka centre I asked the secteur conseiller whether there was a roadblock during the 1994 events and that time he informed me the roadblock was near the place marked "B" and "H1".  So this was the secteur conseiller who gave me information about the specific location, but during my investigation I came to know two other witnesses also.  When I visited I was not with the witnesses, but -- when I went to Gitaka centre I was not with the witnesses.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you were accompanied by the consellier, Mr. Karara, weren't you?
@A.
Yes, I was with him.
@MR. BESNIER:
And he was the one who told you that, indeed, in 1994 there was a roadblock in that location; is that correct?
@A.
Sorry -- I was not -- you are just now mentioning I was accompanied with the (sic) secteur conseiller Karara, no, the current secteur conseiller and the Karara which is mentioned, he was the cellule responsable, not the secteur conseiller.  So I was accompanied by the secteur conseiller.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No Karara?
@THE WITNESS:
No Karara. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
I am sorry, I had not understand (sic) that data which is why I asked you to clarify it.  Could you tell us what the name of the conseiller de secteur is, if you recall his name?
@A.
I have the name of the secteur conseiller who told me his name is Uwimana, Ephraim.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  I would now like to refer to document L001-9881, that's L001-9881.  Did you go to the top of Karongi hill?
@A.
During the course of investigation of this file I did not go, but in some cases -- in some other case I have been to the top.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see any specific building at the top of this hill?
@A.
There are antennas -- communication antennas are there and big towers are there on the top of the hill.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  If we take a look at your sketch, when -- if you are standing on Karongi hill, across from the person, there would be a non-asphalted narrow path leading to Rubengera and Mabanza; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is the information I got from the witness.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it possible to see Mabanza from Karongi hill?
@A.
It's on the high elevation, Karongi hill, and Mabanza is low elevation.  It should be possible to see Mabanza or to look at the direction in which Mabanza is there (sic).  It depends on the location of the person and the place where the person is standing.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are there any road signs on this road?
@A.
There is no road sign on the roads.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  I would like now to look at document L001-9878, that's L001-9878.  Have you found the page?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
You mentioned a roadblock at Fayer, which is often -- sometimes referred to as Foyer as well.  I am referring to sketch No. 3, Foyer also referred to as Fayer.
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  On sketch No. 4 you have also identified the Nyabahanga river, which is spelt: 
N-Y-A-B-A-H-A-N-G-A, Nyabahanga.  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would like to know whether you know the distance separating Foyer, also known as Fayer, and the Nyabahanga river?
@A.
On this road, I measured the distances by driving a vehicle, like, from Fayer or Foyer to Kibuye is 
10.7 kilometres.  Nyabahanga river -- from Nyabahanga river to Kibuye is 3.5 kilometres.  So the distance between these two places should be around 7.2 kilometres by road, which is existing now.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is this an area that is populated?  Is it densely populated?  Did you see any houses in-between Fayer and the Nyabahanga river?
@A.
Yes, there are houses on the roadsides which are, I cannot say densely populated, not like town or something, but a few houses are there.
@MR. BESNIER:
On sketch No. 4 you have mentioned the bridge that goes over the Nyabahanga river.  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know in what secteur of Gitesi commune this bridge is located?
@A.
To me, information was given as it is mentioned in this sketch in  Gitarama secteur of Gitesi commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
In Gitesi commune and in what secteur?
@A.
Gitarama secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you.  My last question -- or, last few questions will deal with Gitwa hill.  You have identified that there were two hills or actually several hills that had the same name.  Is that correct; they were all called Gitwa?
@A.
Yes, I have identified them, three hills which are called Gitwa in this map.
@MR. BESNIER:
To your knowledge, how many hills are called Gitwa in Kibuye préfecture?
@A.
I do not know how many hills because these names have been given locally by the local people.  The area which I visited on these roads -- around the roads, I asked and they gave these names of Gitwa hill, so I cannot say how many hills are in Kibuye préfecture.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are there also hills or places that might be called Gitwe, with an "E" at the end: G-I-T-W-E?
@A.
Yes, like -- which I have shown one more hill, which is hill No. 2.  It's called Gitwe hill.  And I don't know about others which are not in this map.
@MR. BESNIER:
If we refer to document L001-9886, we can see a photograph of Gitwa hill; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, this is a photograph of Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, hill No. 25.
@MR. BESNIER:
And it is the Gitwa hill which is located in Gitesi commune; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Is this hill very high?
@A.
This hill is quite high and it can be seen in the photograph also.  There is a valley on the one side, like if you see photograph No. 46.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but when I look at that photograph 3, it does not seem that it's a very high hill, actually, it seems like a slight rise in this lay of the land.  Could you please explain this to us?
@A.
Because when you travel on the road, the road is passing through the hills, going from one hill to other hill.  So on the side of these roads you see photograph No. 3, on the left side there is a valley, so height has to be relative phenomenon.  So this hill is quite high compared to other -- other very near hills, but Karongi is the highest hill in this area.  So this hill is quite high.  It seems as -- quite flat because photograph No. 4 is taken from the top, but we have to see the locations of -- like photograph Nos. 5 and 6, you'll see that, yes, valleys are there and hill is quite high compared to other hills.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Did you visit the other Gitwa hill, the one that's located in Bisesero?
@A.
Yes, I visited those hills also.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you did not take any photographs of them, did you?
@A.
No, because for this -- like for the purpose of this case I did not take the photograph of those hills because through the photograph Nos. 7 to 16, the hills have been projected, how the hills look like in this area.  And all the hills are like -- they look almost similar but there are a lot of hills and there is a road in-between and hills are covered with vegetation, trees, like a little bit of forest in the valleys.  So which is -- these have been presented in photo 7 to photo 16.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would now like to focus on Gitwa hill in Bisesero.  In photograph 7 to 12, could you identify the Gitwa hill located in Bisesero?
@A.
No, I cannot identify it.
@MR. BESNIER:
I believe that you were the one who interviewed some of the Prosecution witnesses; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you ask them to distinguish, when they were speaking of Gitwa hill, whether they were referring to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune or of Gitwa hill in Bisesero?
@A.
Yeah, I asked some of them and they referred to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, which is in the statements.  And, in fact, I visited like sketch number -- sketch number --  sketch on L001-9881.  This sketch has been prepared when I went with the witness and that time he referred to the Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune which is hill 25 here.  And I passed through that road, crossed the hill, then I went to the place which is shown as a roadblock in this.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  This -- and this would allow us to be able to proceed smoothly with the rest of the trial.  I have no further questions, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, just one simple question, Your Honour.  
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Baghel, could you tell whether the Accused's -- the family home of the Accused person was accessible by road -- by car from Gitaka centre in 1994?
@A.
About 1994, I don't know.  I visited only in 2001.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, very much. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I understood you to the effect that these photographs were taken without any consultation with particular witnesses.  It was to give us an idea of the topography and the landscape.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, photographs 1 to 6, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, this also relates to photographs 1 and 2 concerning the Gitaka centre.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No contact with particular witnesses in contact -- in connection with that one?
@THE WITNESS:
No, when I took the photographs.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, now you limit your answer to photographs 1 to 6.  But when we look at photograph 7 onwards, again, what was your method there, was there any link to any witness in this case?
@THE WITNESS:
Photograph -- because during the course of investigation, some witnesses referred from Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, they fled to the adjourning hills.  That's why to project what kind of terrain of the hills in that area, topography, what kind of vegetation is there where those witnesses fled.  That's why I took those photographs.  I searched from the database and found those photographs which were '95, so it was hardly one year after the main events.  That's why I took those photographs put here (sic).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So these are all photographs from 1995 and not linked to any particular story or event recounted by the witnesses in the present case?
@THE WITNESS:
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  Thank you very much.  
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for coming --
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- forward with your testimony. 
@THE WITNESS: 
Thank you. 
$Witness excused) 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, while we are waiting for the next witness I would like to draw to your attention that during the status conference that was held last week we had agreed with the Prosecutor as to the order in which the witnesses would appear.  However, we were informed just a few hours ago that this order was going to be modified and that the witness that was scheduled to testify today was not the one that had been specified during the status conference.  We do not wish to cause an incident with respect to this, but we just wish to draw your attention to the fact that this state of affairs raises some difficulties for the Defence.  At the present time, at this very moment, we do not know what this witness will say in his testimony, but in view of his statement, it is possible that as a result of the testimony of this witness we might ask for some additional time before we begin our
cross-examination.  We might, for example, request that we begin our cross-examination tomorrow morning if this is required.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You are quite right.  It follows from the notification we were provided with today that the order of witnesses has been changed.  This being said, I note that there is no request for additional time as of now, and we will see how this develops.  
Could we then bring in the next witness, Prosecution? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, I expect that the WVSS section is dealing with that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, this is a protected witness.  If you will now kindly draw the curtains.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the Prosecution proposes to call Witness GKH -- gulf, kilo, hotel.  That witness is listed as No. 3 on your list.  
Your Honour, I acknowledge my learned friend's comment in relation to the order that we had indicated.  There are certain circumstances that govern these trials that are absolutely beyond my control as Your Honour may be aware of.  This particular witness that I had requested to travel was unable to travel, and other issues came up over the weekend that necessitated us taking this particular witness instead of the prior indicated witness.  But I assure both Your Honours and my learned friend for the Defence that we do this in good faith.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in other words, witness 1 on the original list, C-Charlie, G-Gulf, H-Harold, did not come?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, no, Your Honour, witness 1 is actually here.  CGH is here.  But we -- based on reconfirmation exercise over the weekend, we felt a lot more comfortable with GKH to come now and CGH to come right after him.  So we kind of reversed the order but -- 
So, if I can be of some assistance whilst we wait for the witness to come in.  I have informed my learned friend for the Defence that we would take Gulf-Hotel - sorry, Gulf-Kilo-Hotel now.  We hope to finish with him today.  We will then take Charlie-Gulf-Hotel second, hopefully, tomorrow at this time; we will then take Charlie-Gulf-Kilo, third.  And that would be it for this week, at least as far as I know.  As I stand before you I have no other witnesses in Arusha.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is no GMZ? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@GMZ did not arrive, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  All right, these are the three witnesses available at present.  
Can you please bring the witness, Registry? 
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I'm not sure I fully understood the order in which the witnesses were going to appear.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat it, please, Prosecution?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We would hear witness No. 3 on our list now.  He is GKH, Gulf-Kilo-Hotel.  We will then hear witness No. 1 on our list this time tomorrow, God willing.  That witness's pseudonym is Charlie-Gulf-Hotel.  We will then hear witness No. 4 on our list, and her pseudonym is Charlie-Gulf-Kilo.  And that about wraps up -- that would exhaust the witnesses we have on the ground as we speak.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you very much. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to testify in French during your testimony? 
@THE WITNESS:
I speak French.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness GKH in these proceedings, and you are a protected witness.  So when you are asked questions by, first, Prosecution -- can you hear me, Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what I was about to say that you are a protected witness and you have to be careful when you answer the questions posed first by the Prosecution and then by the Defence in order not to reveal your identity.  So, if any question, when answered, would lead to disclosure, then please make a pause and we will make the necessary arrangements to proceed without risking anything.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to tell the truth and the registry will now administer the solemn declaration.  Registry, please. 
@MR. MUSSA:
Mr. Witness, please stand up and raise your right hand, then say after me. 
$Declaration made by Witness GKH in French)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, listen carefully to the questions, Mr. Witness, and try to answer them as briefly and concisely as possible.  
The Prosecution will now start, please.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
Your Honour, may I start by asking the Registry to kindly hand to the witness a personal information form, as is customary in this Trial Chamber, to dispense with the need to have to go through his personal identification details with him.  It's signed.  He just signed it in the witness room and I just want him to confirm it for the record that he does agree with its contents.  I'll then enter it into evidence.  
Mr. Registry, can you assist me, please?  Very kind.  
Whilst that is being done, Your Honour, due to the nature of this witness's testimony, I am afraid that I am going to have to make one of those applications that doesn't endear me terribly with the press and the public.  And in that regard, I am making an application under Rule 79(A)(ii).  And the application unfortunately is that the press and the public be excluded from part -- and I emphasise, part -- of these proceedings for reasons of the safety, security and the non-disclosure of the identity of this witness, pursuant to Rule 75(B)(ii).  
In terms of the scope of the order, and I hasten to add that the first three segments of this witness's testimony has to be in closed session and I would only request to re-open the session towards the end of his testimony when we talk about more general events in the locations that he is going to be testifying about.  
Your Honour would see, having closely scrutinised his particulars and, indeed, his -- the nature of his testimony as indicated in page 4 of the English version of his statement -
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The first statement? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I believe he only has one, Your Honour.  I think so.  I will just check.  Yes, I think he only has one statement.  Yes, he only has one statement dated the 10th of May 2001.
Your Honours, I draw Your Honours' attention to page 4 at least of the English version.  And if you look at the paragraph that starts "In early think June 1994", Your Honours would see from the discussion there that it is very unlikely that there were many people in this witness's position at that particular time.  It is certainly an issue that troubles my witness very much, and it is an issue that he has raised and I cannot but agree with his representations that if I adduce that sort of evidence in public then he certainly would be identified.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, this is something you are going to start off with?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's the thrust of my testimony -- of his testimony, Your Honour, and I intend to go straight into it, you know.  Yes, if you turn to page -- the first page, page 3, what is page 3 of the English statement as well, I do intend to go to -- into matters that concern his political affiliations.  Again, they are closely linked with his location and his residence and that of the Accused.  So, again, there are not many people who are in that position and -- 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, there is no advantage or disadvantage for this being in closed session.  It's unfortunate for the press and for general information in general but, in any case, if it's great -- it's better for justice if we proceed in open session, but it's up to the Prosecutor and for the Trial Chamber to make a decision based on information provided by the Prosecution.  Therefore, Mr. President, I shall abide by your decision.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will see how this develops.  
Thank you very much for that remark, Defence.  Having looked at this document, we will follow the proceedings, but in view of the observation by the Prosecution that they will -- rather, early focus on the particular occupation of this witness, the most practical way, and also in conformity with the spirit of the relevant Rules, would seem to indicate that we have to close this session.  
Now, what is the actual time span, Mr. Phillips?  Approximately how much do you intend to be in closed until you open or are there anything you could take in open first before you move into these other areas?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The matters I want to deal with in open session, Your Honour, are very general matters as to the state of events in Kibuye.  If I start with that Your Honours will end up being totally confused.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, no, we will not be confused.  So maybe we could do it that way, unless anyone else is getting -- is it difficult for you -- for your strategy to do it that way?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, it's difficult and it's perhaps also totally inconsequential to my case whether or not I deal with those general matters.  And, as I say, they are matters -- they are matters I might, in the course of his testimony, just decide to leave out entirely.  So, to start with it would be really prejudicial.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, you may not even have to go into it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then -- and so the entire testimony of this witness in-chief will be for closed?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  It wouldn't to be terribly long, Your Honour. He is testifying in -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Approximately?  About an hour would be --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- French and --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- I think about an hour would be --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
About an hour.  So the public is informed of that, but then that would have repercussion on the cross-examination.  So there may well be closed session for the rest of the day.  At any rate, the Registry will announce whether we can go into open session later on.  That is the situation.  If the public will then kindly leave the gallery and we will proceed.  
Mr. Witness, you have listened to this discussion and I am sure you have seen that in order to protect your safety we will now close these proceedings.  That implies that everything that's going to happen here now will only be heard by the parties and the staff.  There is no one in the public gallery, and the transcripts of the proceedings will be kept under seal afterwards.  So now you can speak freely. 
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we will now start with the open session, Mr. Witness, and from now on you have to be careful, but we understand that the questions to be put to you by the Prosecution are of a general nature.  But beware that you don't reveal your identity in any way. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, during your stay in Kibuye between April and June 1994, did there come a time when you attended a meeting at the Kibuye préfectural office, and, if so, when?
@A.
Yes, it was on the 3rd of May 1994. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you know who convened this meeting?
@A.
I don't know, but the prime minister was there, and other ministers were there as well.  There were members of various political parties who were there, there were bourgmestres there as well.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you know the identities of any of the government ministers that attended this meeting, sir?
@A.
Well, apparently they were all there, but mainly those from Kibuye, because the prime minister had come to visit Kibuye prefecture, and so those who were natives of Kibuye had to be there. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And are you able to recall which particular ministers hailed from Kibuye who attended that meeting?
@A.
There was Agnes Ntamabariro, who was the minister of justice, I believe, N-T-A-M-A-B-A-R-I-R-O, first name Agnes, A-G-N-E-S; there was Eliezer Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A, Niyitegeka, first name Eliezer; and there was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  And I think those were the ministers who were from Kibuye. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know why the three ministers who hailed from Kibuye had to have been present at the meeting?
@A.
Well, they had to be there, because the prime minister, who was the one who had appointed them, had come to their prefecture, therefore there was no reason for them not to be there and to be where he was, especially as the visit dealt with Kibuye prefecture.  So they had to attend the meeting.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know what the purpose of the meeting was, sir?
@A.
Well, the main purpose -- at least this is what the prime minister said -- it dealt with pacification with respect to the killings, the massacres.  And so the main word was pacification.  And he spoke about the RPF, that RPF units had attacked the country, that we needed to fight, that we would defeat them, but he was saying that we had to stop the killings. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At the time of this meeting, the 3rd of May 1994, were you personally aware, Mr. Witness, of any, any, massacres in Kibuye prefecture?
@A.
Yes, there had been massacres everywhere, killings everywhere.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you mention some locations that you had become aware of where massacres had indeed occurred as at 3rd May 1994, Mr. Witness, in Kibuye?
@A.
At that date, no.
I'm not sure I understood your question. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I guessed as much.  Can you tell the Court of any locations in Kibuye prefecture that you had become aware of as at 3rd May where massacres had occurred, just off the top of your head?
@A.
Well, not on that specific date, but between April and May there had been massacres in Kibuye at the Home St. Jean, at the parish, at Gatwaro stadium, at Nyange and Mugonero, and they had already started in Bisesero.  But fighting still continued, so everywhere there were massacres and killings.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Whilst you were at the meeting on 3rd of May involving the prime minister and these other ministers who hailed from Kibuye, did you hear anyone condemn those massacres that you have just described as having been aware of?  Anyone?
@A.
Yes, a person named Leonard Hitimana.  He was a doctor.  He was a member of the MDR party, but from the moderate MDR wing.  He condemned the massacres.  He said that small children remained in the stadium and at the Home St. Jean and had been taken to hospital, and that it was necessary to watch over them, to bring them food, to take care of them, because they were still there.  And the person named Eliezer Niyitegeka said that was none of his business and was not his problem, even though he was a physician, these matters were none of his business.  And this is why, after the meeting, Dr. Hitimana had to flee, because he was being persecuted.  He had to flee the country.  He went to Congo and did not come back until some time much later.  And so there were persons who had bad intentions and did not want people to be saved.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The man you describe as Niyitegeka, who reacted to Hitimana's comments, was who?  What position did he hold in government?
@A.
He was the minister of information, I believe.  The minister of information.  He was a member of the MDR power wing. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did the prime minister himself react to the comments made by this Dr. Hitimana?
@A.
I don't remember.  I don't remember his reaction. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, you also mentioned, Mr. Witness, that some bourgmestres attended the meeting on 3rd May.  Do you recall if any of the bourgmestres made any speeches at that meeting?
@A.
There was a person -- I can't recall this person's name -- a person from Gisheta commune.  I can't remember the name just now, but it will come back to me.  Yes, it was Sikuwabo, and he said that there were RPF soldiers in Bisesero and he was asking for assistance, asking that soldiers be sent to fight them.  And the prime minister said, "You must be watchful and see whether they were RPF soldiers, Inkotanyi, or if they were Batutsi who had fled to that location.  If they were Batutsi, you should leave them, but if they were RPF soldiers, tell us, and we will provide assistance so that you can fight them". 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
To your knowledge, Mr. Witness, were there any RPF soldiers in Kibuye as at the 3rd of May 1994?
@A.
Well, who else was there?  Let me think.  I know that the Turquoise troops came, but I don't remember exactly when.  I know they came to Kibuye.  I don't know if it was then or later.  I don't really recall.  Turquoise was also in Kibuye, because I think it was towards the end of May when Turquoise went to Bisesero to try and save the survivors who had remained there after the massacres. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My question, rather, referred to RPF soldiers.  Do you know, in your personal knowledge, whether there were any RPF soldiers active in Kibuye in May 1994?
@A.
Well, unless they had infiltrated, but they had not yet arrived.  They were still in the Gitarama area.  They were still fighting in Gitarama.  They had not yet crossed the Nyabarongo.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So in your opinion, what -- who did you understand this bourgmestre Sikuwabo to be referring to when he referred to RPF or Inkotanyi?  Who was he referring to?
@A.
I wouldn't be able to know.  I mean, they weren't wearing a uniform, they could not easily have been identified, so I don't know who he could have been referring to.  I don't know. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Mr. Witness. 
Mr. Witness, if I asked you to identify Emmanuel Ndindabahizi this evening, would you be able to do so?
@A.
Yes.  He also would recognise me.  I can see him over there.

Your Honour, may I seek your leave to have this witness perform a dock identification, or an identification, at least if he can, of the Accused. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, look around this courtroom, and tell me if you can see the man you knew as Emmanuel Ndindabahizi here.  If you do --
@A.
Yes, I can see him. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you --
@A.
I recognise him. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you describe where he is seated in the courtroom, if you recognise him? 
@A.
He is seated behind counsel.  He's wearing a tie.  He's balding; he has a few white hairs. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you recognise the colour of what he's wearing, if you are good with colours? 
@A.
He's wearing a black jacket. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Enough for me.  Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, may the records reflect, in my opinion, it's been a positive identification of the Accused seated to the left of the witness box behind counsel, learned counsel for the Defence.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's noted. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Mr. Witness, can you tell me, has anyone other than officers from the Office of the Prosecutor contacted you in relation to this trial, anyone at all apart from members of the Office of the Prosecutor?  Has anyone contacted you in relation to this trial and, if so, who and when? 
@A.
Thank you.  It was during the month of August, I believe it was on the 10th or the 11th, I received a telephone call from someone who was claiming to know me and they wanted to meet me in a bar.  I was busy, and I told this person that I could go there later.  This person called me back, and so I went to see this person.  I didn't know this person, but there is someone who knew me and knew the person. 
And when I reached the bar I had a drink, and I was expecting for someone to come and see me and say, "I have been looking for you."  After approximately ten minutes this person said, "Well, where is so and so?"  The person who knew me said, "Well, he's there."  So this person came and greeted me.  It was around 5 p.m. or 7 p.m., but we could see with the lamp. 
So we moved to one side of the road, and he told me that he was contacting me at the request of Ndindabahizi's counsel and that he wanted me to make a statement for Ndindabahizi's defence, and he told me that he had been sent by counsel.  He gave me his name.  His first name was Jean Pierre; I don't remember his surname.  I know someone who had lived with this person.  And he told me, "To confirm this, I can say that during the month of August you will be travelling to Arusha to testify." 
He showed me a document on which was written the names of all the persons who were going to come and testify here in Ndindabahizi's trial and their pseudonym.  I believe that is the word that you used, was that.  He said, "This is your name and this is your pseudonym."  And he read the names.  I recognised some of the names; these were some of the people I knew.  And I told him, "I cannot speak double-talk.  If you know that I am going to Arusha, then I go to Arusha.  I will not change my testimony and I cannot give you a statement."  And I know that subsequently he went to see other people who will perhaps come, and they contacted me and said, "Were you contacted by someone?"  And they said, "Yes, I was contacted."  And they said, "We met with this person as well." 
I thought this person was an employee of the ICTR, and when I mentioned this to someone they said, "No, it wasn't us because you know us."  And when I reached Kigali before I came here, I spoke to ICTR employees in Kigali because if we are to be protected, then everything should be done in the strictest confidence.  I mean, I've left my house, and now everyone knew I was coming to Arusha.  And this is why I said this, in case there were any problems, so people would know how things actually took place.  This is what I have to say. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let the records reflect, Your Honour, that the 10th of August is three days after I made unredacted disclosure of my entire witness list to the Defence team in Paris, France. 
I have no further questions for this witness.
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Before I lead the cross-examination with this witness, there was one point that I would like to clarify, and I would like to ask the Prosecutor to which part of the indictment he is referring to.  When hearing this witness, what are the relevant parts of the indictment that pertain to this witness, because I have closely read the indictment and I do not see that Mr. Ndindabahizi is accused of having participated in a meeting on the 3rd of May, 1994, in Kibuye, and I do not see that he is accused of having had a meeting with the witness in June 1994.  So from a legal perspective, I believe it is important to clarify which specific parts of the indictment are relevant to this testimony and to the testimony made by this witness. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's a very simple matter, Your Honour.  They are factual allegations in any indictment and there's also something called specific intent to commit genocide.  Genocide and intent, that's what it goes to, Your Honour.  It doesn't have to be clearly stated in the indictment. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, I believe that we will have to go a bit further, but maybe we will do this in our closing argument. 
Mr. President, there's two points I would like to make.  First of all, this witness was supposed to testify at a later time, and I have understood that we would only have three witnesses this week.  Therefore, if we request that we -- that today's session be shortened, I believe that we will not lose -- that we will not get behind.  And would it be possible for the Trial Chamber to order that cross-examination begin tomorrow afternoon, especially as it is now currently six -- ten minutes past six. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is, of course, like both parties, willing -- no, eager to move things forward and use court time in an efficient way, but this being said, we note, as mentioned by the Defence, that there has been a change in the witness sequencing.  We also note the explanation of the Prosecution previously why that happened during the weekend. 
In view of the fact that there is a limited number of witnesses, at least for the time being, in the couple of days to come, we would see no problems in granting the Defence request and start tomorrow at two o'clock.  Yes.
Could we plan now a little bit forward, Prosecution?  You have mentioned the witnesses.  We have the investigators, we have the present one -- and I don't think there is any harm in the witness listening to this.
Mr. Witness, we are now just discussing a few procedural issues.  If you could kindly bear with us a couple of minutes.  And as you understood, we will come back to you tomorrow at two o'clock, but before we close for the day, only a few practical arrangements.
Now, the next -- please, Mr. Phillips, first let me ask the Defence the estimated time for the cross-examination of this witness, it being understood that it is certainly only an estimate. 
@MR. BESNIER:
One hour to an hour and a half.  I believe that it would take approximately an hour and a half to cross-examine this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the next witness, Mr. Phillips?  Did you indicate --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Number one on our list, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  Approximately two hours, one hour, three hours? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I actually don't have an indication of how well or how badly I did in relation to time today because of that break in between, but I think I spent, what, two hours? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You started --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no idea how long it was.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, we will shortly be able to -- you started 16:10 and finished 18:10 and then we lost 20 minutes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So I did better than I anticipated, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Not bad at all.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Oh, good, okay.  So if we say two hours maximum for that witness and hopefully shorter than that, Your Honour, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  So the next witness, approximately two hours?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At the very -- at maximum.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
At the maximum, yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's two hours.  Now, that implies that we will start with this one and we will start with cross-examination of that witness tomorrow.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then it was -- that's Tuesday.  Then the third one.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The third one is number four on your list, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And that is a very short witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Estimated time?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
One hour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
One hour.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
One hour maximum.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Say max one hour from the other side, and that's that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's that.  I have no indication who has been brought today, if anyone.  I would find out when I leave here, so ...
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so please get in touch with the witness protection.  And the problem is that GMZ didn't arrive, was that so?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, we're having problems with him, Your Honour, and he's -- he has indicated that he would not be available until November.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which is -- which poses a problem practically.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But it's important, then, if you -- when you get in touch with Mr. Chappell to make sure that everyone is doing his and her very best, because the number is too limited.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  You will come back to us on that one, then.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Mr. Witness, this brings us to the end of today's session.  You will continue tomorrow.  You must not discuss your testimony with anyone until tomorrow.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon.
@MR. BESNIER:
I am Ndindabahizi's counsel.  I am going to ask you a few questions, not too many, on your testimony. I would like you to ask -- answer your questions as briefly and as precisely as possible.  
Let's begin with the multiparty era in Rwanda. That was the beginning of your testimony yesterday.  You stated that from a given point in time, political parties were authorised and they were able to operate on the territory Rwanda; is that correct, and what time exactly was that?
@A.
Do you remember the Boule conference in France which enabled multipartyism to start?  So I believe in Rwanda from 1991, that is when it started.  I am not sure exactly, but I think it was in 1991 that multipartyism started.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  And can you tell which parties emerged from this Rwandan political class which this thus liberated?
@A.
Thank you.  Apart from the MRND which was already in place, there was the MDR, the PSD.  There was the PL, PDC, PDI.  There was also the DPR.  In fact, there were several parties.  There were many parties.  PSD also was included.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, are we in a public, open session or are we in closed session?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are, are we not, Registry, in an open session?  The question arises now when you want to go into the closed session.  Registry --
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I have some questions of a general nature to put to the witness, but I am also concerned about the safety and the need to preserve the identity of our witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just for the planning, do you have some questions which could be posed in a public session to start with before moving into a closed session?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I have some questions of a general nature, but I would at least want to mention the name of the party to which the witness belonged.  I wonder whether this would be of any problem if I were to ask him the party to which he belonged.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Phillips.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the question my learned friend proposes to ask may not, on its own, be a problem but, when considered in the context of this gentleman's testimony, will reveal the identity, and I think the appropriate thing is to go into camera.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
It depends a little bit on the -- on the question to be posed.  Can we hear the question first?  And we agree -- I mean, both parties are now actively searching not to divulge the identity of the witness, so that is something we are very eager to avoid, Mr. Witness.  We are looking -- we are very careful now. Now, let me first hear the question.  And Mr. Witness, you do not have to answer this question.  We just want to hear the question, and we will then assess whether we can continue with that question or whether we go into closed.  And at some stage, we will obviously have to go into closed.  The only issue now is the timing.  
Yes, please, the question, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, you said yesterday that the PSD was a moderate party.  Can it also be referred to as an opposition party, in opposition to the president and the MRND party?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That can be answered.
@THE WITNESS: 
I believe it's true, that -
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said that it's true that it was in opposition to the MRND.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You also said that the PSD was a party whose aim was to promote social progress.  Can you please explain to us what you intend to mean by the term social welfare, social promotion?
@A.
I rather said that the PSD was a moderate party whose objective was social welfare, that's what I said.  I didn't say social progress, I said social well being.  
Now, in that context, with that term I mean that the PSD -- first of all, the MRND as it was, and had limited itself to some parts of the country where there were tendencies in various parts, depending on  who the party official was or who the president was.  The PSD in its party said that any Rwandan citizen, any Rwandan national, should enjoy social development and should be able to enjoy democratic rights.  So the PSD had as an objective the fact that any Rwandan enjoy his or her social welfare without any restriction from any side whatsoever, because the MRND was biased.  That's what I can say.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did all the members of this party adhere to that generous ideology?
@A.
Yes.  The members all shared the same objective, because before they joined the party there was an ideology which was already prepared, and each member needed to read beforehand the text that governs the party.  He had to adhere to those ideologies, and then he would join.  If he does not agree, he wouldn't join.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  And as you have said, this party was opposed to any kind of discrimination?
@A.
Yes.  What I said is that that happened before the 6th of April 1994, because subsequent to that date every changed.
@MR. BESNIER:
On the 6th of April specifically, was -- did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, as a member of the PSD party, share the ideologies you've just expressed and explained?
@A.
Yes, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was a member of the party, the PSD.  He was living in Kigali.  He was living in Kibuye, and he would regularly attend meetings, but most often he was rather more in Kigali than in Kibuye.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could we ask for more of a pause between the question and answer between counsel and the witness? 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
In 1994, was there any other parties in opposition to the MRND, apart from the PSD? 
@A.
There was the PSD, there was PL, there was the DPR.  All these parties were opposed.  And then the MDR in the beginning before -- it was also opposed before there was some forums which were created within parties against the MRND.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a point of order here.  When both counsel and the witness are talking the same language, it is very tempting to enter into a dialogue immediately, in other words, not allowing for translation; but both interlocutors must remember to pause for about four seconds so that we will get the rest of the sentence before you start.  So if you will both observe this.  
And Defence counsel, this seems to have gone very well so far, but you will know when you are entering areas where we have to close.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will be on the lookout.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Was the PSD party well-spread out throughout the territory of Rwanda, or was it better represented in certain préfectures?
@A.
The PSD was represented everywhere.  Obviously since it was founded in such and such a préfecture, there would be more members there in that préfecture rather than elsewhere, but the PSD was well represented throughout the country, yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you remind us in which préfecture the PSD was founded?
@A.
The first members of the PSD were living in Kigali, and there was Nzamurambaho, Frederic, who was a native of Gikongoro; Félicien Gatabazi was living in Kigali but was a native of Butare; Ngango, Félicien, was first vice-president, was living in Kigali but was a native of Kibungo.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The names have been mentioned and quickly, now.  So, the first name was?  Just take it a little bit more slowly, even if we went through it yesterday.  You said that Frederic came from?
@THE WITNESS: 
Of Gikongoro, he was a native of Gikongoro.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the second person you mentioned was?  
@THE WITNESS: 
I mentioned Félicien Gatabazi from Butare.  Ngango was from Kibungo also, yes, Kibungo.  And then Gafaranga (phonetic) -- may I continue?  From Gitarama.  That was -- those were some of the members of the founding -- founding members of the PSD at national level, but they came from different préfectures.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but you didn't quite answer my question.  I am sorry, Mr. Witness, I wanted to know in which préfecture the party was the best represented just before the month of April 1994.
@A.
Yes, thank you.  Everywhere in the préfectures PSD existed.  There had been elections for members of parliament throughout who were supposed to represent the PSD in the national assembly, but one can say that Butare, which even today hoists the PSD flag, was more represented than other préfectures.
@MR. BESNIER:
And in Kibuye, what was the situation?  Would you say that there was a party which was very well represented or a party which had few members in relation to the average numbers in Rwanda?
@A.
The PSD was well represented.
@MR. BESNIER:
You spoke about the elections to the national assembly.  Can you tell us whether all parties which were born of the multiparty era, all those you have mentioned a moment ago, were indeed represented at the national assembly of Rwanda before April 1994?
@A.
Yes, following multipartyism, all the parties were represented, but the balance wasn't equally.  This depended on the numbers of the members.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you please remind us when this legislature that you referred to was in effect?  When were the elections that took place for appointing members of parliament to the national assembly in Rwanda?
@A.
The elections took place in 1993, but the specific date I do not recall.
@MR. BESNIER:
The year will be sufficient.  And when was that office to expire?
@A.
The transition was to last - I'm sorry, I do not know.
@MR. BESNIER:
If you do not know, that is okay, Mr. Witness.  It's not too much of a problem.  
Very well, we have spoken a lot about the PSD.  Let's now move on to the other parties.  Would you say that some of the other parties born of the multiparty system were extremist parties?
@A.
I was in the PSD.  I was dealing mostly with my own party, and I wasn't really interested in going to see whether the other parties were extremist or not.  I do beg your pardon.
@MR. BESNIER:
No.  But Mr. Witness, as a citizen who is participating in the political life of the country and as a politician, you should have some observations, some point of view on the political nature of the other political parties, wouldn't you say?
@A.
In the beginning, the political parties, the opposition parties, the parties in opposition to the MRND, were unanimous.  To start with, there was the MDR, which split into two.  There was the power wing and the moderate wing.  After that there was the PL, and that same thing happened to that party.  
Now, PSD also was later seen to divide or split up.  As for the other parties, PSR and the other smaller parties, that wasn't so clear.  But there were also some parties which didn't exist in our prefecture, so I wouldn't know what their behaviour or conduct was.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let's go about this step by step.  I believe I understood from your testimony yesterday that the PSD before April 1994 didn't split into power wings; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, you're quite right.  Yes, but apparently -- that was the apparent situation. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, going back to the other political parties, do you know what happened to the most influential, as it was, of these opposition parties immediately after the 6th of April 1994?
@A.
Which parties are speaking about?
@MR. BESNIER:
I am speaking about political parties, opposition political parties, for instance, the PSD.
@A.
That I know about.
@MR. BESNIER:
What happened to them?
@A.
It happened that there was a matter of identifying who had killed the president.  Others fled; some people remained behind.
@MR. BESNIER:
As for the people who were killed, they didn't only belong to the moderate parties, did they?  They also belonged to the government in place.  For instance, the prime minister of Rwanda, she was also assassinated, wasn't she?
@A.
Yes, she also belonged to a moderate party.  She was in the MDR.  MDR was not - was moderate. It wasn't - it didn't have a power wing.
@MR. BESNIER:
There were other people belonging to the Habyarimana government who were killed on the morning of the 6th or 7th of April 1994?
@A.
Yes, mention was made of that, but they were not all killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Some of the victims were Hutu, were they not?  Would you say that an atmosphere of terror existed on that day and days that followed in Rwanda?
@A.
It is not only on that day, it was the case for a long duration of time.  It was not only in Kigali, it went on also in the préfectures.  It wasn't only limited to Kigali.  Terror reigned for at least two or three months.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know when the interim government was formed after the death of President Habyarimana, what day?
@A.
I know that it was in April, but he knows it better because he was part of it.
@MR. BESNIER:
I am asking you the question.
@A.
All I know is that it was in April.  I wasn't in the government.  I had fled, so I did not know what was happening.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  So I believe that you may not know this, but can you confirm it -- you may not know the circumstances under which the interim government was formed.
@A.
I wasn't there, but I know that it was Kambanda who formed the government, but I could not tell you why it was formed, what were the circumstances.  But in my view, I believe it's clear because what the government did subsequently was clearly seen.
@MR. BESNIER:
The question, rather, is strictly on the technical formation of the government, and I want to know whether you have any information.
@A.
I do not have any concerning the formation or the calling together of these ministers to form the government.  I don't know.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know what parties were represented within that interim government?
@A.
I know that there was the MRND, there was the PSD, there was the PL.  I think that's it.  I don't know whether there were any others, but the major parties that I know were those.  There could have been others that I was not aware of.  But the RPF was not there, the DP was not there, the PDC was not included, so there were parties which were not included in the government.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your opinion as a political observer, as a citizen, why was it necessary to bring together several parties in order to form the interim government, whereas it was unimaginable that a government of national unity be formed surrounding only those involved in the MRND?
@A.
Could you please repeat your question?
@MR. BESNIER:
We are in April 1994; the president has just been assassinated.  The first reflex which will come to one's mind is to constitute a strong government around the only political party which was strong at the time, at least, the party which represented the interests of the Rwandan people, the MRND.  Why was that not done, and why did those who formed the government ask other parties to associate themselves with that government?
@A.
Thank you.  The MRND -- which was still strong at that point in time because there were opposition parties which were counter-balancing, the major leaders had already been assassinated -- the MRND went back to its older form, and then, as I have said, there were factions in the parties.  There power wings in the MDR, in the MRND.  Those who left those parties joined the MRND again, and this happened in several of the parties and --
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you think that the interim government was only made up of ministers of the power tendency or with power leanings?
@A.
Well, the fact that there were Tutsis who were welcomed and a person who was in the government and who was able to lead, I don't know how -- that government could not be if it was excluding certain individuals whereas these people were for the formation of the government.
@MR. BESNIER:
You do really believe that this government was able to have all of the powers it should have been able to draw from the constitution, more specifically with respect to security?
@A.
When the government was formed initially it was in Kigali, then it went to Gisenyi, then it was -- the government was in flight.  But to say that they were actually able to wield all of the power that the constitution entitled it to, the time in which it governed was such a short period of time, nevertheless it was able to accomplish what it sought to do, sought out to do.  For example, on the 6th of April the president died.  A few days later the government was formed, and the killings did not cease.  The MRND had soldiers, militia from the MRND, and they should have wielded their power over the people.  If the people had already started to kill their brothers, the soldiers that were everywhere in the country -- I mean, one word from the head of government or from the prime minister could have stopped the situation, and if they did not do so, then it is the government's fault.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you believe that the high-ranking officers in the army had any influence on the government, Rwandan government, between April and July 1994?
@A.
That's what I was saying, that's what I meant.  The government had already been established, and there was a minister of defence whose job was to supervise the soldiers if they went above the government.  If I had been in the government, I would have stepped down and I would have left the soldiers to work alone.  If I was not allowed to have any power on them, I would have resigned.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but that's not the question, Witness.  I am not asking what you would have done, but I am asking about the events that have already taken place.  I am asking you, would it be possible that the soldiers -- that the officers took decisions without referring to the government or to the minister of defence, whether that would be a classic case of rebellion?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I object to this line of questioning.  You are either asking the witness to speculate on what he has no direct knowledge about, or you are asking for his opinion.  You can't have your cake and eat it.  You asked for his opinion; he gave you his opinion.  You are now asking him to speculate. He wasn't part of the government.  I object to that line of questioning.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, this is cross-examination.  When -- he spoke at length yesterday of the interim government, and I believe that he had information on that subject.  In any case, I would like to add that this was my last question on this matter.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is allowed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I think -- I believe that the witness already answered that question.  He said that if that there were the case, that that would be a rebellion.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, at least we got the answer now.  It didn't come through in the first version.  Are you moving on to a different area now?
@MR. BESNIER:
I was going to move on to something else, Mr. President, but if you would like to put a question to the witness, then of course I shall pause and allow you to put your question to the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I have just been following the line of questioning, and at a certain point I think we have to close the session, and I wonder whether this will be a convenient moment in view of the issues you are about to get into now.
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President.  I will be moving on to another line of questioning, but I believe that we can still remain in open session.
@MR. PRESIDENT:  
All right, watch it very carefully.  
Mr. Witness, we are in an open session, as you know, so be careful with your answers.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness, let us now speak of the 6th and 7th of April 1997 (sic) and what you stated yesterday.  You said that men and women involved in politics, especially those who were members of opposition parties, and specifically those who were members of the PSD, could be divided in a schematic form in three groups.  There is the category of those who were killed during the first few days and the days that followed; secondly, there are those who fled, those who went into hiding; and finally, there are those who participated in the government.  Have I summarised this properly?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  In your opinion, those who were killed on that day, they really didn't have much choice, did they?
@A.
Could you rephrase - could you clarify your question?
@MR. BESNIER:
The persons who were killed, they had no choice, did they?  It's because they were - they did not have the opportunity to flee, isn't that the reason why they died?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Please, ambiguous, totally ambiguous.  Can my learned friend rephrase that question, specify which day and which people he is referring to.  It's a very ambiguous question.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That objection is sustained.  The question is too general, and it is difficult to answer it in a precise way when it is so generally formulated.  Please reformulate it.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
The persons who fled, those who are part of the second category, in your opinion did they do this as a political gesture to show - were they taking a political stand to show that they were against what was happening in Rwanda, or did they proceed in this manner because they were trying to save their lives?
@A.
They were trying to seek refuge.  They could either go to the RPF or they could flee to another country, to Zaire, to the Congo; or they could join the Rwandan army, because those that went over to the Rwandan army did not die.  If they joined the RPF, it is because they were sure that they would not be killed there.  They would not be killed by soldiers or the Interahamwe, because it was alleged that there was a list saying who was -- specifying who was supposed to be killed.  There was a list and people knew.  You would go Ngango's house because there was a list, and then in the meantime you would be going to the houses of the other persons whose names appeared on the list.  It wasn't just by chance that these killings took place, especially as far as important politicians are concerned.  
I specified -- I gave you the example of the PSD, and I mentioned the names of Hutus.  I did not mention the names of the Tutsi because they were classified by ethnic group.   I am speaking here of these persons' beliefs or their ideology, the fact that they were against the MRND.  And if you had a Hutu person who was a member of the PSD and who is against the MRND, in another words, I mean, why would they die?  Why would they be killed?
@MR. BESNIER:
In other words, and then to summarise -- sum up what you've just said, those who fled did so because they were in danger and they could be killed?
@A.
Yes, because their names were on the list.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Let us now move on to the third category of persons, those who participated in the interim government.  Do you really believe that they had a choice to participate in this government?
@A.
Once again, Counsel, I will tell you that I was not a member of the government.  I was not a part of that government.  I know it was established.  I do not know how these persons became a member of the government, and I cannot answer your question.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  So you were not present at the meeting of the 8th of April 1994 at the ministry of defence when the government was formed, is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Therefore, you know nothing about what happened during the meeting when the government was formed.  You don't know if people were threatened; you do not know if any pressure was brought about against them.
@A.
I did not go to the government -- to this meeting because I was not invited to attend this meeting.
@MR. BESNIER:
Perfect.  Very well, let us now move to a meeting that was held in Kibuye at the beginning of May 1994.  Do you remember speaking of this meeting yesterday?
@A.
Yes, I do. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you think it would be possible to speak of this meeting in general terms and that your identity will not be revealed?
@A.
I think it would be okay.
@MR. BESNIER:
I am referring to the transcript from yesterday, and this is what you said, Witness.  You said the main purpose of the meeting was pacification, and pacification was to stop the killings, stop the massacres.  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that was the purpose of the meeting.  That is what the prime minister stated.
@MR. BESNIER:
And then a little bit - sometime after this you added that during the meeting, you realised that there were persons, and I'm quoting, "who had good intentions and others who did not want people to be saved."  Is that correct?  Is that what you said?
@A.
Yes, it is.
@MR. BESNIER:
In what category would you place Mr. Ndindabahizi when he attended that meeting?
@A.
Well, I would have been able to put him in one group or another if he had spoken, but as -- you will recall that I did not mention what he said.  I could not say where exact - I could not say in what position he was as I did not hear him speak and state his position.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you give us the names of the ministers or who attended this meeting, because I believe that I did not take proper notes.
@A.
There was Agnes. I will spell the last name, N-T-A-M-A-B-Y-A-L-I-R-O, Ntamabyaliro.  Agnes,
A-G-N-E-S for the first name, Agnes.  There was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, N-D-I-N-D-I-B-A-H-A-Z-I (sic), Ndindabahizi.  There was Éliezer Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A, Niyitegeka.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is that it?
@A.
Those are the names I mentioned.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you very much, Witness.  Let us now speak of the conversation that you alleged that you had with Ndindabahizi in during 1994.  I am not going to say where the conversation took place.  I think that we might deal with that subsequently.  Before the conversation took place, didn't the bourgmestre of your commune already warn you?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this was something that took place in closed session yesterday, and I think that we will easily get into matters where the questions and answers will be so intertwined that it may become a little bit risky.  And in view of the decision we took about that particular meeting yesterday, I think this is the time to close the session.  It's logical.  It's just the same regime we operated under last time we discussed this issue.  
So we have tried to keep this session open as far as possible, because we always prefer to keep transparency and openness, but when it comes to protecting the identity of the witness, we have also to be careful, and now we have reached a point where I am afraid we have to make the ruling that the public is kindly asked to leave the public gallery, and we will continue then in a closed session. 
Could we indicate approximately, Defence counsel, how much time you envisage for the rest of your cross-examination so that the public would know when to come back again, approximately?
MR. BESNIER:
It's difficult, Mr. President.  I have taken 45 minutes so far, and I believe that I will only need a further 30 minutes to complete my cross-examination.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's noted, and there will be possibly a re-examination.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you gave a statement to investigators from the ICTR in October 2000?  Do you recall doing that?
@A.
Yes, I remember that.  I remember that I made a statement.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that on the 30th of April 1997 you testified as Witness M for mother in the trial against Clement, Dr Clement Kayishema at this Tribunal?
@A.
Yes, I remember that also.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that on the 6th of April, on or about the 6th or 7th of April, you and other members of your family became aware of the death of the Rwandan president?
@A.
It was the 6th, not the 4th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct.  And would I also be correct in saying that following the news of the president's death, you and other members of your family left your home to seek refuge elsewhere in Kibuye préfecture?
@A.
Yes, that's correct; we went to seek refuge elsewhere.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did there come a time, Mr. Witness, during the month of April 1994, when you and other members of your family sought refuge at the location known as the Kibuye stadium or the Gatwaro stadium in Kibuye?
@A.
Yes, that's where we were.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall what date you arrived at the Gatwaro stadium in Kibuye with your family?
@A.
It should have been the 13th of April 1994.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And did you and other members of your family remain at Gatwaro stadium throughout the month of April or did there come a time when you left that location?
@A.
My two children and my wife went to ************ home on that day, but for the rest of the refugees, including myself, we remained at the stadium.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And did there come a time, Mr. Witness, when the stadium was attacked and, if so, can you help me with the date, please?
@A.
The stadium was attacked on the 18th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And can you tell the Court how you survived the attack at the stadium on the 18th, as you put it?
@A.
Mr. President, Your Honours, the circumstances under which I survived were the following:  It was at about 1 p.m.  the attackers came, they started throwing grenades into the stadium, they shot at the stadium.  I tried to hide in a latrine in the lower part of the stadium.  I remained there until about 6 p.m.  It was at that time that I was able to leave to go to the forest.  And when I reached in front of the stadium, I met a policeman whom I knew.  I had met him at ********** house.  I went towards him.  I thought that******* had sent him to come and fetch me, and I asked him to take me back to *****home.  He agreed to do so, and that's how I survived the killings.  Thank you. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness is speaking rather fast.  We would be grateful if you were to ask him to slow down.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could speak a little bit more slowly, Mr. Witness, that would assist the interpreters.
@THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, how long did the attack last at the stadium in Kibuye?
@A.
The attack ended at about 5:40, and in the 20 minutes that followed, I left the stadium.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you testified earlier the attack started about one o'clock in the afternoon, did you not?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Now, Your Honour, I am really in your hands as to how to proceed with this witness.  There is very little that I can build up -- upon without having -- I don't want to emphasise the situation, so that I don't draw further attention to it, but there is a problem in that regard. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Having listened to the way this witness responds to the questions, it seems to me that it's a risky course of action to remain in open session.  
So, unfortunately to the public, I think we have to close because of the protection of the witness, because we wanted to stay in open, but it's developing in a way which could be harmful.  So let's now move again into closed session.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, in April 1994, were you living with your parents of Gitesi commune?
@A.
Yes, I was living with my parents.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Following the death of the President of the Republic on the 6th of April, could you briefly tell us what the security situation was in your secteur?
@A.
There were political parties and rallies were held regularly, and the killings started on the 12th.  The conseiller held a meeting to stop Hutu from killing Tutsis, and they refused; they threw stones at him; and we fled on the 13th.  My mother was killed, and I fled.  I left the secteur.  I went into Kayenzi secteur, and I remained in the house of one resident of that secteur.  Three weeks later I left the secteur to go and hide in the bush.  I spent two weeks there, and I saw vehicles, a car and a Daihatsu on the road.  When these two vehicles came to the roadblock, they stopped --
@MR. KAPAYA:
Witness, let us have your testimony in pieces, right?  Now, you say that after the 12th, after your mother was killed, you fled and hid in a house of a named person.  Would you tell us the name of the person in whose house you went to hide, please?
@A.
I do not think I can mention the name of that person because that person is known to many people.
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Could you just tell us whether he was a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@A.
He was Hutu.
@MR. KAPAYA:
From that person's residence, where did you go?
@A.
I continued to wander around and I came to a place known as Fayer, spelt:  F-A-Y-E-R
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us where Fayer is?
@A.
In Kayenzi secteur.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And could you tell us approximately the time you reached Fayer in Kayenzi secteur?
@A.
It is in the same secteur; the distance is not that great.
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Could you tell us when you reached this place Fayer?
@A.
It was in May.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And could you help us, please?  What part of May?  Was it the beginning of May, the middle of May or towards the end of May?
@A.
It was in the beginning of May.  I was quite close to that place,  But I was still in that same location at the end of May -- in the month of May.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, could you tell us what you observed while you were at Fayer?
@A.
I saw a vehicle and a Daihatsu which were coming; the vehicle was black and the Daihatsu was green.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you tell us what time it was that you observed these two vehicles?
@A.
I was about 1 p.m., but I didn't have a watch, I am only giving you an estimate.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, thank you, Madam Witness.  Could you not tell us what you observed when these two vehicles came to where you were?
@A.
Three people came out these vehicles.  There was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and on the Daihatsu there were machetes, and there are were also people in the Daihatsu.
@MR. KAPAYA:
From which direction did the vehicles come from?
@A.
The vehicles were coming from Kigali.
@MR. KAPAYA:
You have described several people who came out of those vehicles.  Could you tell us which people came from which vehicle?
@A.
There were three people into the car and they were armed, and in the Daihatsu there were also three people, Interahamwe, who were armed with firearms.
@MR. KAPAYA:
You testified, Madam Witness, that one of the people who came from those vehicles was
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  From which vehicle did he come?  Did he disembark from?
@A.
He was in the car.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you observe him driving that vehicle or he was one of the passengers in that vehicle?
@A.
He had a driver.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you tell us of those three people in that vehicle whether any of them were armed?
@A.
Yes, they were armed.
@MR. KAPAYA:
All of them or some of them?
@A.
All the occupants of the vehicle were armed except Ndindabahizi.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, when the vehicles reached the place where they stopped, how far away were you from them?
@A.
I didn't measure the distance, but I think the distance was about 5 metres, because I was in a place which was above the road and they were on the road; the vehicles had stopped on the road.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was there anything significant at that particular place where the cars had stopped?  Was there any activities that were going on?
@A.
There was a roadblock; people were stopped, and they were asked to show their identity cards.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Madam Witness, after the two vehicles had stopped, did you observe anything?  Did you hear anything?
@A.
Emmanuel Ndindabahizi spoke to the people who were at the roadblock, asking them whether they had finished killing the Tutsis, and they answered: "We spared the women who -- Tutsi women who were married to Hutu men and their children."  And he ordered them to get into vehicle -- vehicles, to go and kill them.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I didn't understand the last part of your question (sic).  You say he ordered them to do what?
@A.
He ordered them to get into the Daihatsu and take the machetes that were on the Daihatsu and to kill the Tutsi women who were married to Hutus and children whose fathers were Hutu and mothers were Tutsi.  So they got into the vehicle; they took the machetes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you observe how many machetes -- how many weapons or what type of weapons were off-loaded from that vehicle -- from the Daihatsu?
@A.
There were only machetes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you tell us how many machetes you saw?
@A.
There were many machetes.  I don't know how many there were.
@MR. KAPAYA:
After that speech and the off-loading of the weapons, what else did you observe?
@A.
They continued on their way, and I remained in that place for some time, then I went towards the Nyabahanga River.  After that I went to look for some food.  I met people who were going to harvest sorghum.  One person threatened to cut me with a spear, and I gave him money.  I went back to Nyabahanga and I heard noises of a plane.  And when I got to Nyabahanga, I asked what was happening with these planes -- the aircraft, and I was told that it was the French who were coming, and that was when the war ended.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, the people who were manning the roadblock at Fayer, do you know any of them?
@A.
No.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you shed some more light, Madam Witness.  How far is it from Fayer to Nyabahanga Bridge?
@A.
It's a distance of about 1kilometre.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Is it correct to say that FAYE and Nyabahanga are between Mabanza and Gitesi town; is that a correct statement?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, you have told us that in May l994, you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at Fayer Bridge distributing arms.  Had you known Mr. Ndindabahizi before May l994?
@A.
Yes, I knew him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us where you knew him and how?
@A.
He would come to his home and to a centre which was quite close to his parents' home.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, I think you can mention that centre without any problems.
@A.
It was Gitaka centre in Gitesi commune -- Gitesi secteur.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So, when was it that you saw him come to this place?
@A.
In 1990, 1992, 1993.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Let's go to 1990.  How often did you see him in 1990 at Gitaka centre?
@A.
Every year I would see him only once.
@MR. KAPAYA:
In 1990, under what circumstance did you see him at Gitaka centre?
@A.
There was nothing special.  He had come to visit his parents and he went to that centre.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you know where his parents lived?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us how far it was from Gitaka centre to their house?
@A.
About 1 kilometre.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know the names of his parents?
@A.
Yes.  His father is known as Hanyumbwa, and his mother is Nyirabarukwa.
@MR. KAPAYA:
To your knowledge, are his parents still alive?
@A.
No, they died before the war.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, in 1990 when you saw him at Gitaka centre, how did he come there?
@A.
When I saw him, he was on foot.  He was standing at the centre in the company of other people.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you say whether he was doing anything that you noticed or you saw him do, or say anything that you heard him say?
@A.
He was speaking with those people, but I do not know what they were talking about.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what were you doing at that time at that particular centre?
@A.
I came to the market.
@MR. KAPAYA:
When again did you say you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi in his secteur?
@A.
In 1991, 1992.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay, let's go to 1991.  Where did you see him at the Gitaka centre?
@A.
We met on the way on the road.  He was being accompanied.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you help us?  What was he doing?
@A.
I don't know.
@MR. KAPAYA:
For how long did you observe him?
@A.
Are you referring to the first time or the second time?  About 20 minutes only.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The first time or the second time?
@THE WITNESS:
This is the first time, because he was standing.  On the second occasion it was for about ten minutes, because he was walking and I was also walking.
@MR. PRESIDENT.
And the location of this second occasion was at this location?
@THE WITNESS:
We met on the road.  I was coming from the centre, and they were coming from there.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
And on what other occasion did you see -- in which other year did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi after that second occasion?
@A.
In 1992.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Where were you?  Can you tell us where you saw him this time?
@A.
I saw him at Gitaka.  I was passing through and I was coming from prayers.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us for how long you observed him this time in 1992?
@A.
About 30 minutes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, on all the occasions you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at Gitaka centre, were all these on one particular day or it was on different days of the week?
@MR. PRESIDENT.
What does that question mean?
@MR. KAPAYA:
What time I mean, Your Honour, is whether she saw him on Mondays or Tuesdays or Sundays.
@MR. PRESIDENT.
Did you see him on the same week days these three years or on different week days?
@THE WITNESS:
On different days.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, could you tell us what Mr. Ndindabahizi was doing in 1990, 1991 to 1992, if you know?
@A.
No, I don't know.
@MR. PRESIDENT.
Did you know his profession?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I don't know.
@MR. PRESIDENT.
Did you know where he lived?
@THE WITNESS:
They used to say that he lived in Kigali, but I have never been in Kigali.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Madam Witness, have you been to Fayer after May '94.
@A.
Are you referring to the period after May?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that is correct.  After May l994, have you had occasion to visit the Fayer trading centre?
@A.
After the war?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, please.
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us when you went there and why?
@A.
I went there on many occasions because it was on my way, but on other occasions I went there in the company of other people.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was there a time when you went to Fayer with officers of this Tribunal, the ICTR?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us when, please?
@A.
In 2001, but I don't recall the month.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell the Tribunal the purpose of your visit that year to that place?
@A.
It was to show them where the roadblock was erected and where the vehicles were parked.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you recall the person you went with to show him those places?
@A.
No.
@MR. KAPAYA:
When you reached the place, did you disembark from the car or how did you show him?
@A.
The vehicle slowed down and I showed them the position of the vehicle.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, when you went there in the year 2001, can you tell us what topographical differences you observed between then and 1994, conditions of the road, whether -- the vegetation and that kind of thing?
@A.
Yes, there were changes.  The trees that were there had been cut off, buildings had been erected and there was a tarred road that didn't exist before then.
@MR. KAPAYA:
This is all I have from this witness, Your Honour.  Thank you, Madam Witness.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the person you think is Mr. Ndindabahizi dressed in when you saw him in May, Madam Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
He was wearing black clothes, a pair of trousers and a shirt.
@MR. PRESIDENT.
How could you describe this person?
@THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to Ndindabahizi?
@MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes.
@THE WITNESS:
He was a very big person, with a big head and long ears with a flat nose.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Is he present in the Court today?  Do you see him in the Court today?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, he is in the courtroom.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Could you tell us where he is sitting?
@THE WITNESS:
Since I hadn't seen him -- I have not seen him for a very long time, and let me recall that I was very young at the time, but I think it is the person wearing a white shirt and a tie.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Let the record reflect, Your Honour, that the witness has identified Mr. Ndindabahizi.
@MR. PRESIDENT.
I am afraid we cannot let the record reflect that, Mr. Kapaya.  Are you pursuing this?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then you have to do the homework.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, can you tell us where the person you say is Mr. Ndindabahizi is seated?  Could you stand up and show us; with leave of the Chamber.
Just to facilitate your identification, could you please stand up and look around and tell us where he is seated?
@A.
I see him.  He is there seated behind the white people.  He is wearing a white shirt and a tie.  But I must add that I haven't seen him for a long time.  He is also wearing a black jacket.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, let the record now reflect that the witness has identified Mr. Ndindabahizi -- she has identified the Accused person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the colour of his trousers, Madam Witness?  What is the colour of his tie, for instance?
@THE WITNESS:
He is wearing a black tie.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Currently, in Arusha, you are living in a protected house, in a safe house?
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Alone or with other persons?
@A.
There are other persons in that house.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
People with whom you could have formal or informal discussions?
@A.
Yes, I do have conversations with them. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And in particularly (sic), are you able to discuss the reasons for your trip to Arusha, matters relating to this case, the Ndindabahizi case with them?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you share your experiences regarding the various -- your various testimonies?
@A.
Which persons are you talking about, Counsel?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You did say a while ago that you were not alone in that house, and I wanted to be specific.  You said there were people you could discuss with.  Are they your compatriots?
@A.
These are officers of this Tribunal.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
It appears you also said that these include witnesses in this case?
@A.
No, I am talking about officers of the court.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Let me just finish.  But you live in the same house as they?
@MR. KAPAYA: 
Your Honour, this is something that may disclose the location of the witnesses in this Tribunal.  They are supposed to be staying in places which are referred to as safe locations.  So I -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are quite right in raising the issue that we want to protect the witnesses, and also that, of course, we do not want to mention where the safe houses are, you are quite right in that.  But it seems to be quite difficult to imagine that the question, whether there are other witnesses living in a safe house, that that can disclose anything which is sensitive.  Would you agree with me?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Well, at least --
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I can only repeat the question of the President.  The location is immaterial, but are there other witnesses living in the same house where the witness is living or in the neighbourhood where Madam Witness is currently living in Arusha, that is my question.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And if that's your objection, Mr. Kapaya, it is overruled.  
Answer the question.
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, there are other witnesses in the same house.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam, are you able to tell me how it is that your first testimony on this case is taking place seven years after -- it's seven years later?  You told the investigators that it is so important, why did you have to wait for so long before coming to testify?
@A.
Questions were put to me on events that I knew about, and I gave my testimony.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, I understand.  But did you not take the risk seven years after the facts?  Because if I look at your date of birth, you were about 16 or 17 years at the time of the events, and you revealed them when you were 24 years old.  I'm not doubting that your memory is no (sic) good, but why did you have to wait for so long?  Madam, don't be afraid of showing your face.  
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can the curtains be drawn?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Fully, so that we can see the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, the question is the following:  You -- are you listening?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President, I am listening.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, the question is the following:  This -- you were in touch with the investigators of the Tribunal in 2001.  How is it that your information was given to them in 2001, more -- about seven years after the events?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, maybe that question should be clarified because it is our office that goes looking for witnesses.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya --
@MR. KAPAYA:
I am sorry, Your Honour.

-- that was improper.
@MR. KAPAYA:

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence counsel, we are now waiting for the questions -- for the witness.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam, let me repeat my question, and I'll wish this time around that it is the witness who answers.  Why is it that, given the fact that you have such an excellent memory, that you had to wait for seven years?  And let me -- and you waited for the Prosecutors to come and look for you.  One would have expected, one would have expected that this information would have been brought to the notice of the police.  How come that you waited for seven years to make a statement on such serious events as you are making today?
@A.
I did not do so because nobody interviewed me on them.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam, are you a member of a victims association?
@A.
I am not a member of any victims association.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And, Madam Witness, one last question:  Have you ever entered the premises or had you ever entered the premises of this Tribunal before this afternoon?
@A.
No.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You have never entered a courtroom?
@A.
I have been to a courtroom on another occasion, which is not today. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
But a courtroom of this Tribunal or another judicial system?
@A.
It's a courtroom of the same Arusha Tribunal.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Then you have -- you had earlier entered the premises of this Tribunal?
@A.
I had already seen this courtroom, but it is today that I have entered to give my testimony.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The Courts will evaluate that answer.  Let's move on.  
There are two problems in this case, and we would like to know the conditions under which you know or did not know the first time you met in 1990, 1991, 1992, Mr. Ndindabahizi to your knowledge.  If I compare your testimony of today and the one you made to the investigators, are you able to clarify where Mr. Ndindabahizi lived when you were born and grew up?
@A.
I did not know where Mr. Ndindabahizi lived, but I knew his parents' house.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.  In your statement to the investigators, you said that Ndindabahizi lived in Kigali from January until '94, and do you know approximately what date where Ndindabahizi lived without you knowing him, and can you be more specific today?
@A.
I knew that Ndindabahizi lived in Kigali, but these are things that other people told me.  People told me he lived in Kigali, but I did not know exactly where in Kigali.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I am sorry, that is not my question.  My question was not to know his address in Kigali, which you do not know.  My question is to know since when, to your knowledge, was he living in Kigali?
@A.
When I got to know Mr. Ndindabahizi, he lived in Kigali.  I was told that he lived in Kigali, but I did not see the locality in which he lived in Kigali.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.  Let's then go to a number of statements.  You said that, "I know Ndindabahizi because we both hail from Gitesi.  I got to know that he lived in Kigali up to the beginning of the genocide."  As far as the circumstances that the Prosecutor referred to, you, before 1994, saw Ndindabahizi only three times?
@A.
That is correct. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Once in 1990, once in 1991 and once in 1992?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You said that on one occasion you saw him because he was visiting his parents?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
In the family house?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I believe the Court will be very indulgent with me because this is my baptism of fire.  I might make some errors regarding the form.  I am very sorry about that.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
When you met him, was he somebody you met together with other persons or you met him one on one?  Was he introduced to you or was -- did somebody tell you that this is Mr. Ndindabahizi or the son of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Ndindabahizi was pointed out to me.  I was told that he is the son of so and so, so that he's the son of Hanyigwa, and he lives in Kigali. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So such that you never spoke to him, you did not have any personal conversation with him, just that once or twice somebody pointed him out to you as Mr. Ndindabahizi, the son of so and so?
@A.
Yes, that is how it happened.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
But you yourself, you never approached him to ask him whether, "You are indeed Mr. Ndindabahizi, I am glad to meet you"?  Did you do any such thing?
@A.
No, I could not.  I couldn't put such a question to him because I wasn't in the same age group as himself.  I don't know how he would have reacted to such a question.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So do you know what his profession was?  Do you know what he was doing in Kigali?
@A.
No.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You didn't know -- not his parents, but did you know his wife, his children?  Do you know whether he had -- he was married, do you know whether he had children and, if so, how many?
@A.
No, I did not know his family.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And you say by that that you know someone?
@A.
I know him individually.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Another small point on which I would like to ask you some questions, Madam Witness:  In your written statement and also in your testimony today, you said that until the 12th of April, there was only one disquieting speech on the 7th of April 19 -- no, the 12th of April 1994, I beg your pardon.  That's some days after the killing of the president, but that Mugemagango, at the end of his speech, was stoned, but until then there had not been any looting nor any killings.  Can you confirm that?
@A.
Yes, that was my testimony.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
But you didn't attend that meeting yourself, did you?
@A.
No.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So this Mr. Mugemagango was appealing for calm.  So who told you about what happened at that meeting and this call for peace or calm?
@A.
It's people who attended the meeting who reported that to me.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You say also that when you left - that at the end of the meeting, looting and killings began.  How did you get to know about that?
@A.
No, I was a witness of those activities.  I would see people destroying houses and burning them.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You situate the beginning of the killings after the 12th of April, is that correct, and --
@A.
Yes, for -- as far as our secteur was concerned. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.  And I refer to the killings.  You say people started killing Tutsis.
@A.
No.  It was rather on that date that the killings of the Tutsis in our secteur began.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Okay, very well.  So at the beginning -- the beginning of these killings was on the 12th of April, and what is referred to as the killings is that Tutsis were being killed?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.  Yes, all the Tutsis who were found were killed.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Without any discrimination of age, children, men, women, all Tutsis were killed; is that what you are saying? 
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, you testified that at that time, knowing the danger that you were running, you were risking, you left together with your mother.  I am sorry, I am referring to your statement.  You went to hide with your mother in two houses, and you didn't say whether they were distinct one from the other.  And then furthermore, a little while later you got to know that your mother was killed in that house.  Why did you not hide together with your mother?
@A.
It was in order to avoid our -- us being killed at the same time.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
In your written statement, when you say that the houses were not far from one another, in your opinion, how far away were they from each other, those two houses?
@A.
About 40 metres.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
During that attack and the killing of your mother, you didn't hear anything?  You didn't hear anything, and you were only informed about it later?  You didn't hear any cries, you didn't hear any noises accompanying that attack on your mother; did you?
@A.
I didn't hear any noise.  Earlier -- I came to that house in the evening after my mother was killed, and her body was shown to me.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.  Then you fled into Kibuye secteur, you went and sought refuge at (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) house.  You didn't give his family name, but you were able to do so for his wife.  I believe it is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal). 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I'll request that that certain name be deleted from the record --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
-- because the witness has said this is a name that is familiar in the area and -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we agree that this name will be struck from the transcripts and deleted from the video system.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I do apologise.  I can therefore not ask you any more specifics.  Can I mention the first name, (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  Is it a family name?  I'm sorry.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence counsel, you will remember that the witness asked specifically not to mention that name, and we have respected that, so now we strike it from the record for the second time.  
Now, we do not want that name mentioned, but you will easily be able to reformulate the question and achieve what you want.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
$Not translated).
@MR. KAPAYA:
Alternatively, Your Honour, he can use the writing method.  He can write on a piece of paper, show it to the witness, and then ask the question.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
No, no, I will not ask any more questions on that.  
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
But on the first name, one of these two people, it would seem it's the woman -- I can use the writing method, but the second person mentioned, the second person mentioned, it seems that that was your baptismal witness; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is true.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you explain to me for my own personal information what is a baptismal witness, because I know that in the Catholic religion, you know that there are godparents and in marriages there are witnesses, but for baptismal, I do not know what you are referring to.  What is it exactly that you mean by that?
@A.
No, this is my godmother.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I gave you the opportunity to make that correction.  I am sure you are happy about that.  
You state a little later that you hid for some weeks in their house, and then other Interahamwe, led by Sinishunga, came to the house looking for Tutsis.  So who is this Sinishunga?  The name is not known to us.  Who is this person?
@A.
This was a citizen of that area who was leading the attacks.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
If I were to put your testimony together with your written statement before the investigators, I place the scene, which makes Ndindabahizi appear in conditions which we will need to have explanations for, I place that in the middle of the month of May.  Would I be correct in doing so?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mid-May? 
@A.
In other words, the end of the month of May.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
That's not quite correct, because if I look at what you say, this is what you stated.  You stated -- I am trying to find the place -- that you hid for two -- for three weeks in the house of the persons whose names I should not mention, and then you say you spent three weeks, "And during that period I was being told that the Tutsi population had been exterminated," and you then spent two weeks hiding in bushes.  And if we were to take that -- those periods of time, this takes us to the middle of May.  Wasn't it the middle of May?
@A.
It's towards the end of May.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.  After leaving the house of your godmother, you were chased by Sinishunga and his acolytes.  You fled and you went to hide in bushes.  That was a rather tragic situation, and everybody is aware of that.  How were you able to survive, because this was practically one month?  How were you able to survive for a whole month in the bushes?
@A.
When I left the place known as Fayer, I went to settle along Nyabahanga river.  I left that place to look for food.  When I came back, I met a group of people who were going to cultivate sorghum.  One of these people came to me and attacked me with a knife on the head, but that person only wounded me.  He did not kill me.  I gave him a note of 5,000 shillings which I had with me.  
I went towards Nyabahanga River, and that's where I saw aircraft flying overhead.  And I asked people why the planes were there, because I thought they were looking for Tutsis.  I went back to the person who had provided me shelter.  They opened the door.  I told them, "I see there are planes circling in the sky.  Why are they there?"  And those people told me that they were French planes which had come to put an end to the war, and they asked me remain in the house because, they said, the war was coming to an end.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Well, is that the incident that you place at the end of May?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, do you hear us?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I am listening.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, first of all, when you are asked questions, please listen carefully.  The question posed by counsel some time ago was simply, "How did you survive hiding in the bushes?"  He didn't want you to repeat all your evidence.  But leaving that aside, now the question is this episode about giving a person a note and seeing the planes.  When was that?  Was it before or after the alleged episode with Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@THE WITNESS: 
It was after seeing Ndindabahizi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when was it?  When did you make those observations about the planes and the person hurting you?  
@THE WITNESS: 
I mentioned this in my written statement.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we know, but we are asking you now orally.  Do you remember now?
@THE WITNESS: 
I don't remember, but it was towards the end of the war.  It was in June.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
By your leave, Mr. President, I want to come back to this incident, and I want to go again back to the date for the last time because it's got a lot of inconsistencies. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So Madam Witness, I want to go back to the instance during which you claim you saw 
Mr. Ndindabahizi and the circumstances you spoke of a moment ago.  So I want to come back to this one last time to remind you that in one instance you said that it was in the middle of May, and today you are saying that it was at the end of May.  Now, can you remember exactly when it was that you saw this incident?
@MR. KAPAYA:
I object to that recitation.  The witness has said it was towards the end of May, and at no time had she said that it was in the middle of May.  Counsel is misleading the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, in fact, my note is that at the beginning she gave a different indication of time, but I don't want to recall that now.  
So Madam Witness, the point now is, there is some unclarity or lack of clarity as to exactly when this episode with Mr. Ndindabahizi took place.  Now, you have told us it was in May.  When in May, beginning, middle or end?  Can you help us with that, please.
@THE WITNESS: 
It was at the end of May.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Therefore, that means that you spent a month in the bushes in Fayer, and I am repeating the question which you didn't answer:  How did you survive?  What did you drink, what did you eat during this whole month?  Because if we were to look at your answer, this is a question which arises.
@A.
I went to dig in the fields. I went to dig up sweet potatoes, and I was eating wild fruits, and I was drinking the water from the Nyabahanga River.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And during this whole time you were hiding in the same bush close to the roadblock at Fayer?
@A.
I was on the shores of Nyabahanga River.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, we'll come back to that incident.  Where were you sleeping during that whole month?
@A.
But I was sleeping in the bushes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So this is an area which is densely populated, as we were told by the investigator.  Were you not afraid of being found out?
@A.
What area are you talking about?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
We are dealing with the area near the roadblock near Fayer, and you said you lived there for a month.
@A.
I beg your pardon?  When I was drinking the water from the Nyabahanga River, I was living on the banks of that river and not close to the place which was referred to as Fayer.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Is it an area which is highly populated or densely populated?
@A.
Which place are you referring to, which area?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Well, the secteur, the cellule about which we are speaking, Madam Witness.
@A.
Are you referring to the area near the place called Fayer or are talking about the banks of the river, Nyabahanga River?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Wherever you were when you were hiding.
@A.
But I am asking you whether you are referring to the area known as Fayer or are you referring to Nyabahanga?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Well, we will come to Nyabahanga a little bit later.  Maybe it's a good idea to have known what was happening in the various areas, but we have to follow it all chronologically.  I think we are speaking about the incident which you have referred to on the banks of Nyabahanga River.  I am speaking about the time where, for about a month, you were hiding in bushes close to the roadblock at Fayer.
@A.
No, but I didn't spend a whole month in that place.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
How much time, then, did you spend there?
@A.
Two weeks.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So we will have problems of chronology, chronology, which don't only contradict one another, but they are also inconsistent.  You say you spent three weeks at your godmother's house.  Unfortunately, I have to look at this chronology myself.  After the -- on the 13th of April, you went to your godmother and you spent three weeks there.  That takes us to the 4th of May.  And you say, "I spent three weeks in my godmother's house."  That takes you to the end of April.  And then three weeks you went to the place which was close to the Fayer roadblock. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And I am saying, Mr. President, that there is inconsistency, and I want to determine where it arises from.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour -
MR. MARÇAIS:
The witness has just said that she had spent two weeks there and not one month.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a need to simplify the proceedings now.  Defence counsel, you are using too many words and you are mixing the questions with argumentation, and that is not simplifying your communication with this witness.  So it's important, for ease of communication, just to concentrate on the brief questions and receive, hopefully, the brief answers.  And then you will later address the Bench on alleged inconsistencies.  So if you would assist us in this way, then, as I say, it will become more efficient.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I shall repeat my question.  I had thought I heard the witness said that she only remained for two weeks there.  I am reading and I can hear, "I spent three weeks at my godmother's house and then two weeks in the bushes near the Fayer roadblock."  This seems to take us to the middle of May, but the witness has just mentioned the end of May, and I want to have for clarification because this seems to me to be inconsistency.
@MR. KAPAYA: 
May I make a comment, Your Honour?  The witness is talking of a period of "about".  She is not saying exactly three weeks, she is not saying exactly two weeks.  She is saying about two weeks, about three weeks.  I think counsel should take this into account when posing his question to the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But in fact we have now, we have now been circling around this issue, beginning of May, middle of May and end of May, for quite some time.  I think we know the witness's answer.  The answer is the end of May.  She has been asked many times now.  The question, then, is whether that is inconsistent with a calculation based on the calendar, and that is something you will come back to later.  You have made your point.  You have made your point that there is an inconsistency, in your view.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
It's the last answer given by the witness in which she said, when I asked her how she survived for a whole month, she said, "No, not a month, a fortnight."  And I said at that time that if we were to do the arithmetic and look at the statement, this brings us to the middle of May.  That was a mere observation I was making.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's braking in open doors.  That we have understood.  So what is the next question?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, Mr. President.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
When we read about your presence near the roadblock near Fayer, you state that you were about 5 metres away from the roadblock.  A question arises here, Madam Witness:  You are in great danger, great danger of death.  Would it have been reasonable for you to be 5 metres away, even only just to hear everything, without considering the risk -- without considering the danger that you were risking?
$Pages 43 to 53 by Petrus Chijarira)
1800H
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear the question, madam?  The question is, if you were afraid, why only be five metres away? 
@THE WITNESS:
These people were on the road, and I was above the road.  There was a kind of mound, and I was overlooking the road.  These people could not see me, and they didn't know I was there. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You said two vehicles arrive at the roadblock manned by the Hutus and that there you recognised, from behind the bushes, Ndindabahizi that you had seen on about two occasions earlier.  You -- he was not introduced to you.  And you said, "I saw Ndindabahizi speaking to the Tutsi." 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
But counsel corrects that to say that, "He spoke to the people who were manning the roadblock."
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And the persons manning the roadblock could not see you, but they could hear you moving since you were close by. 
@A.
They could not see me.  There were some eucalyptus trees, and I was uphill from them and they could not see me. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The person that you claim is called Ndindabahizi allegedly said, "Have you finished with the Tutsis?"  Is that correct?
@A.
He posed the following question:  "Have you finished killing the Tutsi?" 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Apart from this scene, have you ever witnessed any other massacre scenes? 
@A.
No.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You never went to Bisesero?
@A.
No. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You give two different answers but quite similar.  That was -- with regard to the answer that was given to Ndindabahizi, "They did not kill everybody.  They did not kill women and children"; is that correct?  Let me use your expression again.  "They did not kill women and children of Hutu mothers."  Is that correct? 
@A.
I said, and I repeat, he posed the following question:  "Have you finished killing the Tutsis?"  And they said, "Yes, we only -- we did not kill women who -- Tutsis who had married Hutus." 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So they did not kill Tutsi women if they had a Hutu husband; that is correct?  But you said a while ago that on the 12th of April, to your knowledge, they had killed all the Tutsis.
@A.
No, I did not say that they killed all the Tutsis.  I said they were in the process of killing the Tutsi. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Well, it appears -- I've been asked not to mix the questions and the arguments, but if you -- the issue was on a general question on men, women, and children.  But on the 13th April, you did not indicate that they did not kill some category of people.
When you said that they did not kill persons this day, who is it referring to? 
@A.
I don't follow your question, Counsel. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Let me quote, madam.  Ndindabahizi put the question, "Have you finished with the Tutsi?  And they answered him."  I don't know who the "they" are.  Who are these "they"?  Who are these "they" referring to? 
@A.
The persons who answered his question were the Hutus who were at the roadblock. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So "they" referred to the Hutus who were at the roadblock.  And the other "they," who does it refer to?
@A.
The Kayenzi secteur, Tutsi women who had Hutu husbands who were not killed, and as well as children who had Hutu mothers but Tutsi husbands -- Tutsi fathers, I'm sorry.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Let's continue with your testimony.  Ndindabahizi came in a vehicle, in a small pick-up with about five persons -- Mr. Ndindabahizi was not driving his car himself -- in a green pick-up; is that correct?  Witness, did you say 400 persons? 
@A.
No.  Ndindabahizi came with four or five persons.  His car was driven by a driver, and it was a small pick-up with four or five persons.  
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So that makes it four -- that makes it five or six persons; is that correct? 
@A.
I did say that there were three persons in the -- in Ndindabahizi's car, two persons plus Ndindabahizi.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, can counsel wait for the interpretation.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The break -- please remember the pause between the answer and the question so we can have time for translation, for interpretation, please. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
In a pick-up, a while ago you said that there were other persons, two, three persons in Ndindabahizi's private vehicle who came to the roadblock; is that correct? 
@A.
No, that's not what I said.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I thought I understood you to say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that there was a roadblock manned by Hutus, and that the two vehicles we are referring to come to the roadblock under the conditions that you recounted. 
Did the roadblock already exist with the Hutus manning it when the vehicles, that you referred to as Ndindabahizi's vehicle and the pick-up -- 
@A.
The roadblock was there.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And manned by about how many persons? 
@A.
There were many.  About 15, but I didn't count them. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were they -- or, who were these people?  Did you know them?  Were they holding their famous machete?  How were they? 
@A.
Well, I did not know them.  I didn't live in that locality.  They were wielding machetes and clubs, and that is clubs that we call ntampongano.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you saw the person that you call Ndindabahizi arrive together with another vehicle on a roadblock kept by 15 persons, about 15 persons wielding machetes? 
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You said that in a green pick-up -- when you saw the green pick-up approaching --
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the witness needs to tend to her baby. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Madam Witness, I think it is good if you could leave the courtroom for a moment and look after your baby, but I don't think we should close the session for today, we just take a little break.  So shall we say about ten minutes? 
What is your view on the situation, Mr. Kapaya?  What is the need?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Ten minutes would do, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, yes.  Let's do that, then. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I shall defer to the wisdom of the Court.  I have no question (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So we adjourn for ten minutes.
$Court recessed from 1812H to 1830H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.  And if we could finish this witness by seven, I think that would be preferable. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, I'll do that.  I'll ask three quick questions. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
It seems that there's a small confusion, Madam Witness.  A moment ago I was speaking to you about where you were hiding in a mound or close to the roadblock near Fayer, and you say you were drinking water from the river.  I think you may have confused this with the time when you had fled to the place close to Nyabahanga river. 
@A.
Yes, I did make that mistake.  At the time when I was in that place, I didn't have anything to drink or eat.  Sometimes I could have had bananas given to me by people who, like me, were fleeing.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I'm now coming to the last episode -- no, let me go back to the episode following the Ndindabahizi. 
At the roadblock you were saying Ndindabahizi was speaking to the Hutus, you are referring, undoubtedly, to the Hutus who were manning the roadblock, unless I am mistaken?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And it was to those Hutus that he was saying, "Take up the machetes and kill them all"? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.  Now, on the episode dealing with the Nyabahanga river, you said in your written statement that you met a Hutu carrying a spear who struck you and wounded you, and today you talked about a Hutu who threatened you, so which is the truth?  Which is which? 
@A.
I said that he struck me with his spear on the head and that I gave him 5,000 Rwandan francs.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were they Rwandan francs?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You had kept this 5,000 francs throughout this very difficult time? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you recall the colour of that note? 
@A.
It was a note of 5,000 Rwandan francs such as was used before the war. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
$No translation).
@A.
I don't remember.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Thank you. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, I'm done. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
One question, Your Honour. 
RE-EXAMINATION
@MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness --
@MR. KAPAYA:
I don't see the witness. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You were asked by counsel whether, apart from the Accused person and his parents, do you know any other relatives, blood relatives of the Accused person?
@A.
I would see them as they went by, but I didn't know their names. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
That's fine, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, the persons manning the roadblock, I understood that you told us that before 
Mr. Ndindabahizi arrived, they were armed with machetes; is that correct?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why would, then, Mr. Ndindabahizi give them machetes and give them the order, based on this provision of machetes, to go and kill Tutsi if they already had weapons? 
@THE WITNESS:
But he had brought them the machetes.  And some of these people did not have machetes, they only had clubs which are known as ntampongano. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So not all persons at the roadblocks had machetes, is that your testimony, before Mr. Ndindabahizi arrived? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's correct.  That's right. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
I have a question I think, rather, to the Prosecution, but the witness should be waiting in case we may need her.
Now, this Fayer roadblock, in our bundle of documents which you produced as Prosecution Exhibit 2 there is a document which seems to be relevant to this episode, and this sketch seemed to have a link with that particular witness.  Isn't that so, Mr. Kapaya? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, that's right, Your Honour.  Actually, that particular roadblock is referred to on page L0019875 of Exhibit P2, and sketch 3, sketch 3 on page L0019873. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Seven-eight?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, 78 --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.
@MR. KAPAYA:
-- and 75.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, so sketch 3, and that coincides with the question to the investigators who mentioned the pseudonym of this witness in connection with sketch 3.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, the investigator (sic) went to show him where it was.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so this -- where on the page L0019875 do we find this particular roadblock?  Can you assist us with that? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
It's on R2, Your Honour.  Sorry, R2, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
R3? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, R2.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
R2.
@MR. KAPAYA:
R2 is the Fayer roadblock.  R3 is the Nyabahanga river, Nyabahanga roadblock.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this follow from the map itself? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  It follows there on the right-hand side, "R2 roadblock, ref. sketch 3."  That's the link, is it?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, yes.  Okay, then, we have located that.  And if you now compare this map L0019875 with the big map, with the bigger map, for instance, the map on the preceding page, would we find this on the same map in a more large scale? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, if we look closely, Your Honour, we can see it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, all right.  If it's difficult to find right away, I still think it would be useful to make sure that we know exactly where the roadblock is.  So if the parties could simply agree upon and, at a convenient moment, come back to the Bench and show us exactly on the big map where we are when we look at the small-scale map, that would be helpful.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, we'll revert to Your Honour in due course.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much, indeed.
Madam Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  We thank you very much for coming to the Tribunal and giving your evidence.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you kindly not to discuss your testimony with anyone.
When it comes to the particular episode you mentioned, that you had been approached, that will be looked into in the appropriate forum. 
So we wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you very much. 
@THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the last available witness, Prosecution, and I understand even that if we're short of witnesses, that is because one of the witnesses did not travel to Arusha from Kigali, in spite of the fact that you had asked that witness to come.  Is that so, Mr. Phillips?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the reason why there is not the witness this time is because this was an unforeseen circumstance. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  That's what they say.  That's what they tell me.  I have no way of verifying that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It may well be as a direct result of the comments we've heard from witnesses this week, and that's a matter that I would address in due course.  I have no way of verifying the circumstances that have led to this witness.  As far as I'm aware, when we had a status conference, Your Honour was told that all was well.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you did tell us, didn't you --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Not me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- in your e-mail of 1st of September that, "As you are already aware, this witness did not travel to Arusha last Friday"?  And that was before the testimony started, wasn't it? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I became aware of it on Friday.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So in other words, I don't think there is a link between testimony given this week and the non-appearance of this witness because --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, the events that surround the testimony given this week happened before they came here, that's my point. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You're talking not about what happened in court.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You're talking about pre-trial issues.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Well, we'll look into that.  And this implies that when do we meet again, at 2:00 next Monday?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On Monday, yes. 
Your Honour, there's a procedural matter that I need to address the Court on.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Before doing so, are we in a position now to indicate the order of the, say, five witnesses that have arrived in Arusha, or will you do that in 24 hours' time?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It would be as indicated, from number five down; in other words, five, six, seven, eight, nine, in that order. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have finished number one, two, three, and 18.  So you are saying that it will be number five, six, seven onwards? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In that sequence?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now you have something you would like to raise.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  It's a matter that troubles me very much. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour would -- is aware -- Your Honours are aware of the provisions of Rule 85, Rule 85(B) in particular. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We might excuse the witness?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, she's been excused.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can we have the registry escort the witness out, please?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- you will now be escorted out of the courtroom because we are now addressing another matter which is not related to your testimony. 
Please, you have to draw the curtains, of course. 
$Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You referred to Rule 85, Mr. Phillips.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
85(B) in particular.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm interested in the provisions of that rule.  And whilst I am mindful of the fact that Judges may at any stage -- Your Honours may at any stage put questions to witnesses whilst they're testifying in this courtroom, it has to be said on the record that such questions cannot be seen to compromise either the case of the Prosecution or, indeed, that of the Defence.  Certainly that is not the idea behind Rule 85(B).
We're all officers of the court, and indeed, be us on the Bench or at the bar, my training suggests that we're all officers of the court.  And as officers of the court, we have a duty to our clients, be you the Prosecution or the Defence, and in exercising that duty, we do it, at least my training tells me that we do it, with the utmost courtesy to the Bench and, perhaps, often expect that that courtesy be extended to us, be us the Prosecution or the Defence.
Now, a situation arose this evening, Your Honour, which I find extremely regrettable, where my learned friend and colleague, a very senior member of the Tanzanian bar, was stopped and restrained and almost bullied from asking or objecting to a question which he felt was extremely pertinent and legitimate which -- the result of which may have ended up compromising the evidence of a Prosecution evidence.
Now, the position is this:  He makes an observation following a question from Your Honour, and he does it in good faith.  He does it as a result of his duty, as an officer of this court, to protect that witness.  He did so, being extremely courteous to the Bench.  I would leave this courtroom this evening with the regrettable feeling that that courtesy may not have been extended to him as a result of the way Your Honour intervened and restrained him from asking that question, and I regret that.  And I must say, as lead counsel representing the Prosecution, I regret that.
I would also add that if I had a younger and more junior counsel assisting me today, the end result of which would have been such a lawyer may have been frightened out of his or her wits, unable to continue with the job that I have assigned him to do this evening, and that in itself would have compromised my case.
I leave this courtroom this evening with a feeling that, unfortunately, somewhere along the line that courtesy, which I expect as Prosecution counsel, has not been extended to the Prosecution.
I'm grateful for your attention.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for drawing our attention to this issue, Mr. Phillips.  I am now happy to make my contribution so that you will not leave the courtroom with that feeling; neither should Mr. Kapaya do so. 
What happened here was quite normally only the issue that there was, during a question by the Defence, an objection by the Prosecution.  That is perfectly legitimate, and, as you just said, that is what any officer of the court is expected to do.  What happened, however, was that that particular objection was formed in a way which could indicate the answer to that witness.  Now, this happens on many occasions, and we all know that that is something that should be avoided.
There was certainly no -- any intention to hurt anyone or to not express courtesy.  And Mr. Kapaya and I, we have worked together in this courtroom for a long time and in many cases, and you know I have the utmost respect for Mr. Kapaya, and that respect is unchanged.  And you will then note that after that particular episode where I had to stop him, because the objection was suggestive, that the cooperation in a very courteous manner continued, in my view, from both sides.
So I do not think we should blow up this episode, and it's my absolute belief that we will continue, as we have done previously, to cooperate to the fullest extent.  Thank you very much.
Now, the Court is now adjourned to Monday at two o'clock.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, if you could look in my direction, this way.  I'm going to ask you some questions in relation to your written statement that you gave to investigators from the ICTR.  Do you understand that?
@A.
Yes, I understand.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you recall how many times you met with investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor of this Tribunal?
@A.
Yes, I do recall.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell me how many times you met with such persons, please?
@A.
Twice.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Do you recall approximately when you met with those investigators, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I think that it was in the year 2001, but I do not remember the exact dates.

Yes.

Thank you.  Mr. Witness, do you know a man by the name Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, I do.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell the Court how you know this man?
@A.
I knew him a long time ago, while he was still in school and I was a child.  I was in primary school at the time.  He was studying at the university, and we would meet sometimes during the holidays, as well as on other occasions.  Subsequently, sometime after he finished his studies, I would see him at the Kibuye Trafipro -- I do not know whether he was working there or whether he was just passing by but I would see him in the building of the Trafipro, and I do not know whether he was carrying out any activities there.  And then I would see him on the road.  He was one of the great intellectuals of our region.  We were saying that we were lucky to have someone in university because it was rare to have someone in university.  So he was someone who was well known in our region and that's how I came to know him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, can you help us with the period, by that I mean the year that you saw him whilst he was at university?  Can I start with that, first?  Can you help us with that year, if you recall, please?
@A.
I'll give you an estimate because I do not remember the year very well.  I believe it was between 1969 and 1971.  I don't know whether he had finished his studies at the time or not. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the period that you describe having seen him at Trafipro, can you also help me with that time frame, please?
@A.
I do not remember.  It was at a time when one referred to as Trafipro in our country, in the 1980s or at least before 1980, when we had what we referred to as Trafipro in our country.  I saw him but I do not remember the exact period of time.  I didn't have any particular reason for me to remember the period of time during which I saw him.  
So, we had what were referred to as Trafipro cooperatives and it was during that period of time, when these Trafipro cooperatives existed, that I used to see him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that the period when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at Trafipro was after the period when you saw him during his university days?  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is true, it was afterwards.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you know if Mr. Ndindabahizi belonged to any political party?
@A.
Yes, he belonged to a political party.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know which political party Mr. Ndindabahizi belonged to?
@A.
Yes, I do.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell the Court, please?
@A.
It was the PSD party.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you a member of the PSD party?
@A.
No.  I did not belong to any political party.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was it then that you became aware that the Accused belonged to the PSD party?
@A.
Some parties were represented in Kibuye, and in our commune of Gitesi and within our secteur and on Sundays the parties would have recruitment drive rallies.  When they came it was said that he was living in Kigali; he came to see -- he came to see how the recruitment was being done amongst the people.  I would see him at the stadium as we came back from mass and this would be on Sundays. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Roughly, how many times would you say you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi before April 1994, for instance?
@A.
I think I saw him twice.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you, by your answer, mean that you saw him twice in your entire life from 1969 to 1994, or do you mean you saw him twice in relation to the political rallies?
@A.
It was during the multiparty era between 1992 and 1993.  It was during that period of time that I saw him twice; otherwise, I would see him earlier when he was walking around in Kibuye or if I came across him on the road as he was passing by.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So can you -- or are you able to give an approximate number of times that you might have seen 
Mr. Ndindabahizi since 1969 - '71, thereabout, until 1994, just roughly?  Can you help us with that?
@A.
I would see him often, but I think I wouldn't have seen him for more than 10 or 11 occasions.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Turning to April 1994, Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you heard of the news of the death of the president at some stage after the 7th of April, 1994?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that following some disturbances in your area of origin you fled to other locations within Kibuye préfecture during the month of April 1994?
@A.
Yes.  Yes, I fled elsewhere, that is true.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, during the month of April 1994, Mr. Witness, did you see a man known as Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at all and, if so, when did you see him and where?
@A.
I saw him in April in the hills close to Gitwa hill, to which we had fled.  We had left our houses in order to go and flee, to seek refuge at the top of Gitwa hill, which was overlooking our houses.  I saw him at that time and he was quite close to the place where I lived.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall a particular date or period when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
It was between the 20th and the 26th of April, but the first time that I saw him was between the 20th and the 23rd or the 24th of April. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you say that you saw him whilst you were on a hill called Gitwa.  Can you confirm to the Court whether or not Gitwa is in Gitesi commune, Gitwa hill?
@A.
That hill is in Gitesi commune.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you able, Mr. Witness, to describe to the Court the circumstances that led to you seeing 
Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time?
@A.
I can do so.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Please do. 
@A.
It was between the 20th and the 24th.  I do not remember the exact date, but two days later we were dispersed from that hill, but before that Ndindabahizi came and suddenly I saw a Daihatsu vehicle which was green.  It was a type of vehicle which could use country roads, and it was this kind of vehicle that was used.  On it were soldiers and people dressed in civilian clothing, and there was another white vehicle and the two vehicles stopped below a road -- below a woods on the road.  
The people who were in Gitwa could not see the vehicles because of the trees which were blocking their view, and there was also a mound, a kind of small hill, which made it impossible for them to see those vehicles.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you recall when you actually arrived in the area of Gitwa hill?  Do you recall when you arrived there?
@A.
I got there around the 14th.  It was around that date that we were chased out of our houses; our houses were burnt down and the population -- the inhabitants went to seek refuge on that hill around the 14th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You have just described seeing some vehicles arriving at Gitwa hill on or about the 20th -- between the 20th and 23rd of April.  Now, can you tell me how many vehicles did you see on this day?
@A.
On that day I saw the vehicles; in other words, Ndindabahizi's vehicle and the Daihatsu vehicle and another one which came after it.  In other words, there were three vehicles.  There was a Hilux vehicle which was blue. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And apart from the Hilux vehicle which you describe as being blue, can you also help me with the colour of the other two vehicles, please; colours?
@A.
The sedan was white and the Daihatsu was green. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In which of the three vehicles did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi, if at all?
@A.
I saw him inside the small, white vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And was Mr. Ndindabahizi alone in the small, white vehicle?
@A.
At that time I was able to -- I was unable to know whether he was alone in his vehicle, but it was the vehicle he normally used.  But at the time when we saw him, he wasn't in the vehicle.  But when they left, he left together with a gendarme; in other words, we saw him getting into a vehicle -- the vehicle, and the gendarme also got into the vehicle together with him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What about the vehicle you describe as the green Daihatsu, what sort of vehicle was that, if you know?
@A.
It was a large vehicle of the Daihatsu make and its colour was green.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you able to describe to the Court what the vehicle looked like, the green Daihatsu vehicle?  Apart from being large, was there anything else about it that you recall, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I don't know if in their country they don't have that kind of vehicle but it was a Daihatsu-make vehicle and it had a back part which was used for transporting merchandise.  It could also transport people.  There were iron bars in the back which are supposed to hold in the cargo, if the car was to hold any cargo.  But this is the type of vehicle that I saw.  I don't know how to explain to you otherwise the kind of vehicle that it was.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You've testified that there were other people present with Mr. Ndindabahizi when you saw him.  Do you know if they had travelled in any of these three vehicles and, if so, which one?
@A.
I didn't quite understand your question.  Could you please repeat it for me? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When you saw the Daihatsu vehicle which you've just described, do you know what that vehicle conveyed to that location, if anything?
@A.
But those vehicles were parked in that place and afterwards the vehicles -- the gendarmes who were on those vehicles, as well as members of the population, came down from those vehicles.  Suddenly, we saw them coming out -- bringing out a kind of box and throwing it onto the road.  We were in the woods and we could see what was happening.  We saw them sharing out knives -- or, rather, new machetes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  Let's go back to the gendarmes that you've talked about.  Now, were you able to tell if the gendarmes had travelled to that location in any of those vehicles or had they gone there on foot?
@A.
They had come on board the Daihatsu vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And where on that vehicle were the gendarmes located, if you recall?
@A.
They were in the back, in the part I had referred to which is used for transporting merchandise; but in front, in the cabin, there was another gendarme and someone else, I presume, together with the driver.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Roughly, how many gendarmes did you see arriving at Gitwa hill on this day?
@A.
You are referring to the day on which those vehicles came to that place? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  Yes, Mr. Witness. 
@A.
Listen, I will estimate that to be between 18 and 20.  We really did not count them, but I will suppose that they were between 18 and 20 because the vehicle was full.  This obviously is an estimate because nobody really counted them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the civilians that you have referred to, did they travel in any of the vehicles?  Can you help us with that?
@A.
We thought some were hanging on the metallic bars at the back of the vehicle.  They were behaving like mad people.  They were travelling, hanging on the bars of the vehicle.  We could see a large crowd of people dispersed in the area, some of whom had come on foot.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The people you have described as gendarmes, how were you able to recognise them as such?
@A.
They were wearing gendarmes' uniform.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were they armed and, if so, what were they armed with?
@A.
The gendarmes were carrying guns. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The civilians, were they -- how were they dressed?
@A.
They were wearing civilian clothes, just as all of us, since they were not soldiers.  They were not soldiers.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were they armed?
@A.
They were carrying clubs, machetes, which were distributed to them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How were you able to identify the man you've described as Emmanuel Ndindabahizi amongst this crowd of people on this day, Mr. Witness?
@A.
He was standing by his vehicle and talking to the people around.  Besides, he was a leader.  When a leader is standing with members of the population and soldiers, you cannot not notice him.  He was talking to those people in his capacity as a leader. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, let's talk about where you were located at this time.  Could you tell us how far you were from 
Mr. Ndindabahizi and his entourage, as you say?
@A.
It was very close to the forest.  We were hiding.  We were trying to see what those people standing there were doing.  We came from the Gitwa hill.  When we saw the vehicles, we got close to see what the vehicles were doing there.  Because when the vehicles were coming up the hill, when the Interahamwe were coming up to the top of the hill, we would go down from the top of the hill to see what the vehicles and the Interahamwes were doing.  We were in the bush on the hill, but I was with other people who unfortunately are dead now, and we were at the distance of about 25 to 30 metres from where these people were standing.  Well, obviously, I did not measure the distance; I am only giving you a estimate of that distance.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And were you -- in terms of your position, were you the same level with these vehicles or were you below the vehicles or above the vehicles in terms of your position?
@A.
I was uphill from the vehicles, hiding in the forest.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, would I be correct in saying that you were looking down at the vehicles and not up?
@A.
That is correct.  I was uphill from the street -- from the road, and I was looking at the vehicles from up.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Roughly, how many people were with you as you observed these three vehicles, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I was with two young men.  Obviously, there were other people further on, but I was with two people when I saw them.  But these people died subsequently, unfortunately.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you have testified that you witnessed or observed some items being removed from one of the vehicles.  Can we go back to that part of your testimony, please?  Do you understand that?  What was it that you saw being offloaded from the vehicles, and which vehicle did you see this being offloaded from?
@A.
There was something that looked like a box, a wooden box, which was offloaded from the Daihatsu vehicle.  And this box was put on the road and it contained machetes, and the people around the Interahamwes shared these machetes among themselves.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many boxes were you able to observe being offloaded?
@A.
There was one box, but it appeared that there were other boxes in the vehicle.  One could observe that there were other boxes in the vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Having been offloaded from the vehicle then -- and can you help me again, which particular vehicle did you observe this box being offloaded from; do you recall?
@A.
It was from the Daihatsu that I mentioned to you earlier on, the green Daihatsu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall the persons who were responsible for offloading this box?  Did you see who offloaded the box from the Daihatsu vehicle?
@A.
It was the Interahamwe who were with him.  They were the ones who offloaded the box.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was this box you saw being offloaded already opened at the time?
@A.
Regarding the opening of the box, I did not observe that carefully.  I only know that the box was offloaded, put on the ground, and I realised that they took out the machetes that I referred to, but I did not look at it properly to see if it was open at the time they were putting it on the ground. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Earlier on in your testimony, Mr. Witness, you described the machetes as being new.  You used the word "new".  How were you able to arrive at this conclusion?
@A.
You know, when a machete is new, you see it's shining.  The people handling them and who were describing them, we could hear them.  When a machete is old, it has been used, it has a black colour.  But when it is white -- when it is new, it is whitish.  You can therefore distinguish a new machete from an old, used one. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Having witnessed the box being offloaded, was there anything else that you saw at the time?
@A.
I saw that they immediately distributed the machetes contained therein. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Where was Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time when the machetes were being distributed?  Were you able to tell?
@A.
He was still in the neighbourhood, close to the vehicles.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your opinion, was he able to see what was going on as described by yourself?
@A.
Yes, he could see.  He was the one supervising the exercise as leader or the person in charge.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And how were you able to come to that conclusion, Mr. Witness, that he was supervising as the leader?  Was there anything in particular that made -- indicated that to you?
@A.
What led me to that conclusion is that I knew him at the time.  He was somebody working for the government.  He was a very important personality, and those other people present, they were ordinary members of the population and gendarmes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did Mr. Ndindabahizi speak at all during the time you saw him there, speak to anyone?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Who did you see him speak to?  
@A.
He spoke to those people and told them the following: "Go.  There are Tutsis who have become difficult."  And since the 14th, the Interahamwe would normally come to Gitwa carrying machetes and clubs.  And since they did not have firearms, we tried to fight them back.  He told them that, "There are Tutsis on the hill and they've proved to be difficult.  You, therefore, have to kill them, and when you kill them, you will be compensated."
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You referred to "those people".  Would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that these were the people that had arrived -- you had seen arrive with Mr. Ndindabahizi when you say "those people"?
@A.
It is to those people that he distributed the machetes to.  There were many.  They came uphill and they invaded the area, and they were the people who attacked us.  But he is the one who issued the order.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Those of you who sought refuge on Gitwa hill on this day, did you belong to any particular ethnic group and, if so, which of the ethnic groups did you belong to?
@A.
There were only Tutsis there and the Tutsis were the target of the attack.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Earlier on in your testimony, you described seeing a third vehicle which you described as a blue vehicle.  Do you recall saying that, Mr. Witness?
@A.
This vehicle that looked like a Toyota or Hilux which came subsequently, it is therefore the third vehicle that I was referring to and which came later on.  But the two vehicles I referred to came earlier.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And were you able to recognise those on board this vehicle -- or, sorry, I take that back. The third vehicle that you described, Mr. Witness, do you know if there was anyone on board this vehicle?
@A.
There's a man called Nambajimana who was the conseiller in our secteur who was aboard that vehicle.  I also saw aboard that vehicle -- because that vehicle arrived but continued further uphill, I saw our conseiller.  I also saw another man called Ruzindana who comes from Rwamatamu, as well as a former journalist called Niyitegeka.  These people came after the first two vehicles.  I don't know if they were travelling together as a convoy.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
For the record, the first name I believe is spelt N-A-M-B-A-J-I-M-A-N-A, Nambajimana, the first name he mentioned.  I think that was then followed by Ruzindana, which is spelt R-U-Z-I-N-D-A-N-A, I believe.  And the third name he mentioned was Niyitegeka, which for the record is spelt N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A, Niyitegeka.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, what time of day was it when you observed Mr. Ndindabahizi's presence at Gitwa hill?  What time of day was it?
@A.
It was approximately 10:30 or 11:00 a.m.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you've described being some 20, 25 metres or 30 metres -- I can't recall -- away from 
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Now, can you tell me, were there any obstacles between you and Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time?  Were there any obstacles, big trees, branches?
@A.
Yes, obviously, there was a thick forest.  It was a thick forest.  There were dense branches and we were hiding among them, like birds.  So this was -- there was bush around. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, how were you able to identify these things and these people if these branches and bush were all around you?
@A.
You see, if you want to see through an opening, you find an opening or you hide behind a tree and then you look, but since the other person you are looking at does not know you're hiding there, you try to see without being seen by the person in question.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did the branches and the bush obstruct your view of Mr. Ndindabahizi and the people around him, 
Mr. Witness?
@A.
No, I could find an opening where there was no bush.  Those people were not expecting anyone to be in the bush around, such that I could take a position from where I could observe what was happening. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you've described how you and other Tutsis sought refuge on Gitwa hill.  My question to you is: were you not scared or afraid when you saw these vehicles arrive?
@A.
Yes, we were afraid, but we plucked up our courage.  But what we were afraid of were guns and we wanted to see if they had guns aboard those vehicles or if they were just ordinary civilians.  That is why we came down, to come and see if they had soldiers among them to help them in their attack, and we realised that they had -- they were carrying machetes.  
Well, obviously, we were afraid but, you know, we had women and children among us.  We were obviously afraid but what did you want us to do? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Having seen the arms being distributed, can you tell the Court what you saw happen next?
@A.
These vehicles subsequently continued on their journey and the attackers attacked those on Gitwa hill.  They climbed up the hill to launch their attack.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When you say "these vehicles", do you refer to all three vehicles or only some of them?
@A.
No, all the vehicles continued.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did Mr. Ndindabahizi remain or did he leave Gitwa hill?
@A.
No, he also left aboard his vehicle; I mean the white vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What about the gendarmes that you describe arriving at that location earlier, did they remain or did they leave? 
@A.
They left again in the same vehicle.  Only the civilian population remained behind.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And were these the same civilians that the arms had been distributed to earlier, as you had testified earlier?
@A.
Yes, those same members of the population.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You described an attack having occurred on Gitwa hill on this day.  Were you able to resist the attack, Mr. Witness?  The refugees, were they able to resist this attack?
@A.
Since they had no guns, we took stones and fought them off.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you successful?
@A.
Yes, we fought them off and they went back.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The vehicles that left Gitwa hill on that occasion, were you able to tell in what direction they headed, having left Gitwa hill?
@A.
They went back on the road that goes to Gisovu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did there come a time, whilst you sought refuge on Gitwa hill, that you witnessed other attacks?  Sorry, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on, Mr. Witness, how many civilians were there you observed? 
@THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about the members of the population?  I did not clearly understand your question, 
Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You explained that there were three cars:  two coming first; one afterwards.  You observed civilians and gendarmes.  I'm now asking you how many civilians you observed on that occasion. 
@THE WITNESS:
There were very many.  There were many attacks launched by many members of the population.  There were very many.  They invaded a whole area.  I therefore cannot give a specific number.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to indicate how many civilians you observed in connection with those two, three cars, approximately?
@THE WITNESS:
Regarding the members of the population who came with those vehicles, I would say there were about 50 who came with the vehicles, but all around there were other members of the population who arrived and who were moving in all directions.  So, I cannot recall the exact number, because I just cannot recall the number.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And they arrived in which vehicle or vehicles? 
@THE WITNESS:
They came aboard the Daihatsu vehicle.  At least, there were some members of the population who were at the back of this vehicle, this small vehicle, but on the road there were other members of the population, and when we saw these vehicles stop, all around there were members of the population who were getting ready to attack us.  And normally, around eight o'clock, there are members of the population all along the road, so the vehicles arrived and found these other members of the population who were already there.  There were very many.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you observe how Mr. Ndindabahizi, if it was him, how he was dressed?
@THE WITNESS:
I saw that he was wearing a jacket which looked white.  I really did not look closely to see what he was wearing.  I limited myself to look at the -- at his face, but not what he was wearing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, during the time that you remained on Gitwa hill, did there come a time when you witnessed other attacks at that location and, if so, when were these attacks?
@A.
Yes, there were other attacks on the 26th.  It was on that occasion that many gendarmes came; in fact, I think there were many more gendarmes than civilians.  They were able to fend off the attack initially by the members of the population.  It was on that occasion that the gendarmes came on the 26th of April, attacked us together with the other members of the population.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified that you had left your home early in April to seek refuge elsewhere.  Did you do so with other members of your family, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And did there come a time when you left the area of Gitwa hill for some other location?
@A.
They shot at us and we scattered in the bush.  They chased us and in the evening we came back to the place and we continued hiding in the neighbourhood.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you ever leave the area surrounding Gitwa hill to go elsewhere?
@A.
After the gendarmes shot at us, we dispersed.  We went to hide.  Several people were killed, but we were changing our hiding places continuously following the attacks against us.  We kept moving in the forest and in the general neighbourhood.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many members of your family survived the attack or attacks in and around Gitwa hill?
@A.
None.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, would you be able to recognise the man you describe as Emmanuel Ndindabahizi if you saw him today?
@A.
It is very possible that I will recognise him, but let me make a comment right away.  People went to various localities.  It is possible that their faces will change, that they will lose weight or put on weight.  If the opportunity were given to me, I will see if I would be able to recognise him from among the people present in this courtroom.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, can you describe what that person that you referred to is wearing?  How is he dressed?
@A.
He is wearing a jacket, a white shirt and a tie.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is there anything else about him that you can see that may help identify him, if you know?
@A.
It must be him.  I believe that I have recognised him.  The person I've described appears to me Mr. Ndindabahizi, in any case, based on what I know of him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, if the record can reflect, I think, that Mr. Ndindabahizi fits that description.  If the record can reflect that the witness has identified Mr. Ndindabahizi as being present in this courtroom.
Your Honours, I hope I have kept to time.  I have no further questions for this witness, and I would be very obliged if my learned friends for the Defence would make an effort to keep to the same time frame.  I am grateful, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The identification is noted for the record.
There is a question.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you said you fled the Gitwa hill to the neighbourhood.  Could you please name the neighbourhood; what was the area called?
@THE WITNESS:
Could you please reformulate your question?  I didn't quite understand it.
@JUDGE KHAN:
In your statement you said that you fled the Gitwa hill to the neighbourhood.   What is the name of that area where you fled from the Gitwa hill?
@THE WITNESS:
We were scattered about and we ran into that forest.  I continued to get further into the forest, but I didn't leave the area itself.  We were moving about through the forest, but within the same area.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So does this imply that you remained at what is usually referred to as Gitwa hill, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sometimes we would leave Gitwa to go into the areas near -- within Gitwa, but in the forest and in the bushes because in the bushes one can hide.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Defence, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Good morning (sic), Mr. Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon.
@MR. BESNIER:
You said that you have already testified -- or you have been interviewed twice by the investigators of the Tribunal; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, it is.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you meet those investigators in your home or elsewhere?
@A.
They found me elsewhere.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you go to that other place upon their invitation, or did you just happen to meet them in that place?
@A.
They invited me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you accompanied by other people?
@A.
No, I left alone.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it be correct to say that the investigators of the Tribunal, first of all, went to your home and then they accompanied you to the place at which you were interviewed?
@A.
Yes, yes, we left together.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why could you not be interviewed in your home?
@A.
Since this was something confidential the children or my wife would have been able to hear what I was saying, and that's not correct, is it?
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you already visited this courtroom or a similar courtroom before today?
@A.
From the time of my birth I have never witnessed a trial, even in our local courts.
@MR. BESNIER:
You mean you have never, ever gone into a courtroom here in Arusha at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda before your testimony today; is that what you are saying?
@A.
I have already come here.
@MR. BESNIER:
And the officers of the Tribunal made you come and visit the courtroom, did they?
@A.
No, not here.  There's a vehicle which took us somewhere further away where we are housed.  And that's when I arrived here, but I do not know this specific location.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, can you look around you in this courtroom and tell us whether there is any other male, black person, who is not dressed in courtroom robes and who is not an advocate of this Tribunal?
@A.
I can see women and I think that's the only persons whom I can see who are not wearing a uniform.
@MR. BESNIER:
You would be in agreement with me, Mr. Witness, that the only person that you identified as being Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is also the only black male who is not wearing judges' or lawyers' robes or a uniform; am I not right?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Objection, my learned friend should look in the courtroom properly before he --
@THE WITNESS:
I know him from a long time -- I have known him for a long time.  I saw him and identified him, and he was in the place where the events took place.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
That's not the question I put to you, Mr. Witness.  But let's move to another question.  Mr. Witness, just a small question: you stated that you witnessed -- you were interviewed twice on two different dates before the Tribunal's investigators; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
You do not remember the exact dates on which you were interviewed, but were these dates close to one another or were they far apart?
@A.
The dates were far apart; between the two dates were about one or two months, as far as I recall.
@MR. BESNIER:
The Defence has two statements; one is dated 3rd April 2001 and the other one is the 27th April 2001.  Do these dates correspond to the ones during which you were interviewed?
@A.
Yes, those were indeed the dates.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the second statement which the Defence has, that of the 27th April 2001, you stated, "This is the first time that I am being interviewed by the investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda".  But it would seem that, in reality, it was the second; so why were you saying it was the first time?
@A.
Could you please repeat your question, because I didn't understand it?
@MR. BESNIER:
In the statement dated 27th April 2001 --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel said 1994; he means 2001, and he makes that correction.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
-- and, in fact, that is the second statement.  You say in that statement that, "This is the first time I am being interviewed by the investigators from the Tribunal".  I don't quite understand this contradiction.  Can you please explain it to me?
@A.
There is no contradiction.  I spoke to you of dates on which I was interviewed and I explained to you the subject matter of my statements; so what contradictions are you referring to?  I spoke to you of the dates on which I was interviewed.  I told them to you.  I do not understand why you say there is a contradiction.
@MR. BESNIER:
This is a technical matter.  In the statement that you made one month after your first statement, it is written that, "This is the first time that I am being interviewed by the investigators from the Tribunal".  This is my question: were you interviewed once or twice but, nonetheless, why did you in your statement say --
@A.
I was interviewed twice.  No; you are distorting what I said.  I said that I was interviewed twice, and this is quite clearly written.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you read English or French, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Do you mean can I speak French or English?
@MR. BESNIER:
Should I conclude from your answer that you are not -- that you do not understand either English or French?
@A.
That's impossible.  I am Rwandan and I can express myself in Kinyarwanda, and when I speak I speak in Kinyarwanda.  You, yourself, express yourself in French.  Had I been conversant in the French language, I would have used French.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the question is only, if you were asked to read a sentence or two in French, would you be able to understand it.
@THE WITNESS:
No.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, in your statement you say that the situation in your area started to deteriorate around the 10th of April 1994; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct; it was around that.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you specify how the situation deteriorated in your area?
@A.
I have said this to you.  Do you want me to repeat what I said?  The attackers came and they killed people, and that's what I've told you.  The Accused was not the only one.  I have spoken of the situation from the month of April until the time when we went to hide in Gitwa hill.  I do not know; maybe you know the situation better than I do.  I do not want to repeat what I've already said.  If you didn't understand what I said, maybe you can go to Kibuye and one could explain the situation better to you there.  Maybe you can come with me.  You certainly will be able to see, at least, one bone.  My children, my six children were killed in that place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the questions asked by both counsel are quite normal, legitimate questions.  And now counsel simply wanted to ask you a question about the developments in 1994.  So please listen carefully to the question now.  Here it comes again.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, did you witness murders or killings from the 10th of April 1994?
@A.
Yes, I witnessed killings.  From the 10th until the 26th we were on Gitwa hill and we were targets of attacks by members of the population whom we tried to repel with stones until Ndindabahizi came with machetes which he distributed to the members of the population.
@MR. BESNIER:
My question was, and you have answered that -- when I asked you whether you had seen killings on the 10th of April 1994 -- please concentrate on that date -- did you also see houses being burnt down in your neighbourhood on April 10th, 1994?
@A.
Let me explain to you briefly.  From the 10th we were not spending nights in our house; we were at Gitwa.  People who came to hide at Gitwa were fleeing attacks from members of the population and their houses had also been burnt down.  I was one of the people who were lucky to survive those attacks.  What I'm telling you is true.  If you wish, we can go together and the members of the population who are still alive in Gitwa will be able to tell you how things happened.  Otherwise you, yourself, can make a stop there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, you fled towards Gitwa on the 14th of April 1994, is that correct, the 14th of April?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
My question is dealing with the period of the 10th of April 1994 and, once again, I'm asking you to concentrate on that date, to focus on that date.  Did you see on that date refugees who were leaving their houses?
@A.
Yes, I did.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you also personally witness killings or murders of Tutsis between the 10th and the 14th of April 1994?
@A.
Yes, I saw Tutsis killed.  We were chased away from our homes on the 10th of April and we found refuge on the hill; in other words, on the 14th when this situation became worse we went up the hill and we were targets of attack in our homes, so we were trying to face those attacks.  Some people were killed; others fled.  It was not only --
@MR. BESNIER:
I do beg you, Mr. Witness, let's move about this step by step.  All the questions will come in their time.  I wanted to find out from you whether, when you arrived on Gitwa hill on the 10th of April, there were already other refugees there.
@A.
Yes, there were other refugees.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you give us an estimate of their number?
@A.
More than 10,000.  I did not count the refugees who were there, but if I were to make an estimate, I would say that there were more than 10,000.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is Gitwa hill a very high hill?  Can you give us a rough estimate of its altitude?
@A.
I did not do any studies which would enable me to get altitude.  You are asking me questions on matters I have not studied.  Maybe it's 1,500 metres, but I'm not very well versed in those issues of determining how high hills are in terms of altitude.  I know that it's a high hill, and we sought refuge there in order to try and escape the attacks that were launched against us; otherwise, I do not know how altitudes of hills or mountains are measured.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it be correct to say that refugees had specifically chosen that hill because it overlooked -- it was higher than the other hills in the region and enabled them to see from whence the attacks were coming?
@A.
No; that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you on Gitwa hill on the 14th of April and were you able to see attacks on that hill between the 14th of April and the 20th of April?
@A.
Yes, there were attacks against us.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there an attack every day?
@A.
Yes, we were attacked every day.
@MR. BESNIER:
Between the 14th and the 20th April, who attacked you; was it the civilian population or were they soldiers and gendarmes who attacked you?
@A.
It was the civilian population.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was the population armed?
@A.
With traditional weapons, machetes, small hoes, as well as clubs.
@MR. BESNIER:
Those people who attacked you, were they many?
@A.
Yes, they were many.  All the members of the Hutu ethnic group were part of those attacks.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you say that between the 14th and the 20th of April the people who attacked you were larger in number than the Tutsi who were -- had sought refuge on Gitwa hill?
@A.
Could you please repeat your question?
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you say, Mr. Witness, that the civilian population attacking you between the 14th and the 20th April were larger in number than the refugees who were already on the hill?
@A.
Yes, the number of the attackers was higher; in other words, the members of the secteurs which were in the neighbourhood, and there were even attackers who came from Rutsiro commune in Cyangugu préfecture who came on Ruzindana's vehicles, because we had always resisted these attacks and that's why the members of the local population sought assistance from people to reinforce their own attacks.
@MR. BESNIER:
Since you said the refugees were approximately 10,000 in number, do you understand that every day more than 10,000 civilians came to attack you on Gitwa hill?
@A.
They wanted to exterminate all the Tutsi in Rwanda.  That's how they found reinforcements from other communes.  They would give beer to the members of the population participating in these attacks, and it was Préfet Kayishema who compensated them.  It was in order to send us away from this area so that they could eat our crops and our cattle.  Where did you want them to go?  They were there.  They even had recourse to thousands and thousands of civilians, even 50,000.
@MR. BESNIER:
How were the civilians -- how were the refugees resisting the attacks?
@A.
Did they have guns?  We would take stones -- we would pick up stones and throw them at the attackers.  We didn't have any guns.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the attacks continue during the night?
@A.
No, not regularly.  At night there was no consistent attack.
@MR. BESNIER:
Should I understand that the civilian population attacking you would go back home to sleep and would come back the next morning in order to attack you; would that be correct?
@A.
Those who were near that area would spend the nights in their homes.  Others who came from far would spend the nights, while dancing, drinking and eating our cows, and the next day they would come and attack us in a drunken fury.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the population which was attacking meet at another -- at a specific place?  Did they surround the hill, or did they scatter throughout the area surrounding that particular hill?
@A.
They would surround us.  There were two secteurs.  This hill is between Rubazo and Kabingo secteurs - Kagabiro secteurs, and those who came from below, some came from all four corners and they would attack us.  So we would divide ourselves into groups and we tried to go into the various parts so that we could repel the attacks because the attacks didn't come only from one direction.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it have been possible for you to flee from that hill, or the population which was surrounding the hill would have stopped you from doing so?
@A.
We could not flee because we were surrounded.  There was no way out.  We were surrounded and we were on the hill.  There was no way out and the attackers were surrounding us throughout the night and we would not have been able to find anywhere to flee to because all the parts were well surrounded.  There were roadblocks everywhere both during the day and at night.  Because this was a plan which was drawn up by the higher-up leaders of the country, the members of the government.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were they so numerous in number that you wouldn't have been able to make a path through them in order to find a surer and more safe place to hide?
@A.
Please don't tire me out, Counsel.  Where could we go through?  We were few.  The others were scattered everywhere.  Do you think that the Tutsis lived only in one area?  Unless we were all in the same area.
@MR. BESNIER:
As you have testified before the Tribunal, the population was shouting, they were dancing, they were making a loud noise; were they not?
@A.
Yes, they were singing, they were saying, "Let's kill all the Tutsis wherever they are hiding in the forest".
@MR. BESNIER:
Right.  When you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi between the 20th and the 24th of April -- according to you, that would be at around 10:30 to 11:30 -- did you see him accompanied by other people?  Did the civilian population accompany these vehicles?
@A.
Yes, that is true.
@MR. BESNIER:
And these vehicles were completely full of civilians as well as gendarmes, were they not?
@A.
Yes, they were.
@MR. BESNIER:
And when these vehicles arrived, were the people who were in them welcomed by the civilian population?
@A.
Yes, there was applause and shouting.  When the civilian population which was there saw the vehicles, they were happy because they thought that the soldiers that had come there had come to kill us, and they were there themselves in order to help them exterminate us.
@MR. BESNIER:
And when the box or trunk was offloaded, was the civilian population also happy?
@A.
Yes, they rejoiced because they wanted to exterminate all the Tutsi.  They were very happy.  They were dancing.  They were really extremely happy because they knew that they were going to exterminate us.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Ndindabahizi congratulated or applauded when he showed the people the trunk which had been offloaded?
@A.
Even if you are not Rwandan or Tanzanian, I think at your home there are sports such as football.  These people, the civilian population, were happy like football spectators -- or some spectacle or other.
@MR. BESNIER:
You, yourself, Mr. Witness, you were about 25 to 30 metres from Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's vehicle; is that not so?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you were hiding in a bush, you say?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Actually, you explained that there was, initially, bush and then there was a clear patch in that bush in which you were hiding; is that right?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, can the registry be requested to show the witness the photographs showing Gitwa hill which is in Exhibit No. 1 of the Prosecutor?  It's document L0019886 and L0019887.
Does the witness have this document?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sure counsel meant P1.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel meant P2, the green one with the photographs.
@THE WITNESS:
I don't have that document. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you please show the witness photograph No. 3 and 4, Mr. Registry, photograph No. 3 and No. 4?
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, these photographs were taken by an investigator of the Tribunal.  Do you recognise Gitwa hill on these pictures?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you tell us what you refer to as a forest or woods in either one of these pictures?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Objection, Your Honour.  My learned friend is misleading the witness.  It's very apparent and obvious from L0019883 that those pictures were taken on the 16th of August 2003.  If Your Honours recall, the investigator did say that he had no indication what the vegetation was in 1994.  It's a deliberate misrepresentation, Your Honour.
@MR. BESNIER:
I do not claim that's exactly the same vegetation, but I think the question should be put to the witness, by your leave, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
The vegetation on the field, as you see it on this photograph, is it similar to what existed in 1994 on Gitwa hill, Mr. Witness?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, there are several photographs in this folder.  We will go one by one.  Look first now at photographs Nos. 3 and 4.  The place where you were hiding, did it look like this one -- or these two, or was it different?
@THE WITNESS:
At the time it was covered by bush but, subsequently, the bush was burnt down to chase us out.  Here, I see that there is very little bush.  Regarding the photographs, I don't know if they took the photograph -- I don't know much about photography or the hills.  All I can say is that at that time there was a lot of bush.  Probably -- on the next photograph I see that there is a bit of bush but, later on, all this bush was burnt down.  But -- well, maybe in the photograph, the third photograph, I realise that that looks more like what it looked like then.  There are just some shrubs here.  I don't know if a photograph of that place was taken.  I would have shown them where I was hiding, but they chose to photograph this area.
@MR. BESNIER:
Unfortunately, I do not think that the photograph the witness is referring to is in the exhibits.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, Witness, my question is that you found yourself in an opening in the middle of the forest and you are saying that you were 25 metres away from the vehicle of the Accused.
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
And, as you said, on this Gitwa hill there were several thousand refugees; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, there was a great number.
@MR. BESNIER:
And there was yet a greater number of attackers and people where you found yourself -- where you were?
@A.
Yes, there were many more.
@MR. BESNIER:
How, then, were you able to identify Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and were able to distinctively identify his voice, given the number of people who were present at that place?
@A.
I was able to hear what he was saying because he was asking the people there to keep quiet because he wanted to speak to them, and they obeyed his instructions.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he use a megaphone or any other equipment to amplify his voice?
@A.
No, he did not use a megaphone.  Because when you are respected you do not need to use a megaphone because people listening to you want to hear you and it is in their interests to listen to you and obey your orders.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he climb on the boot of a vehicle to be able to speak to the people around?
@A.
No, he was standing on the road and people surrounding him -- they surrounded him.
@MR. BESNIER:
And are you able to recall the number of machetes distributed on that day, Witness?
@A.
There are questions you put to me which are not -- which are without any grounding.
@MR. BESNIER:
If you see a box and you are a hundred metres way, are you able to count the number of machetes?  Were you at a hundred metres from the site?
@A.
I told you that distance; it was between 25 and 30 metres, but I did not measure the distance. Whatever the distance at which I found myself, I was able to follow what was going to happen to us.  Even at 200 metres, if you are in danger of death, you will be able to hear people who are planning against you.  When somebody is in danger of death he is able to hear him from a great distance.  His ears become very sensitive.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you saying, Witness, that fear gives you this extra capacity to hear from a great distance?
@A.
Yes, obviously, because in such situations, you want to hear what these people are saying so you can escape them or face them.  When we saw them distributing the machetes and talking among themselves, we said to ourselves that they had no guns, and that reassured us to some extent because if they attack us without guns, they are not able to kill us.  So we said since they did not have guns, we are going to be able to resist them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a question.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question to the witness: at Gitwa hill, where you were hiding, there was a forest, and I believe a road below where the vehicles were passing; which road was this?
@THE WITNESS:
It was an untarred road which led to the Gisovu tea factory in the Gisovu commune, going through the FM antenna at Karongi commune, leading all the way to the Gisovu commune.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
So would I be right if I called it Kibuye-Karongi road?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, you would be right.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, in your written statement dated 26 April 2001 you stated in the sixth paragraph of that statement: "Probably there were 50 of the machetes in that box".  Do you confirm that, the number of 50?
@A.
Well, that was an estimate.  I did not count the machetes.  I did not get hold of the box to count the number of machetes contained in it.
@MR. BESNIER:
And only one box was brought down; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, only one.
@MR. BESNIER:
Don't you find it strange that only one box be brought down for a crowd of 10,000 people?
@A.
But these were implements which were brought in reinforcement but, otherwise, people had their own weapons.  These extra ones were brought for the indigent ones who did not have money to buy their own machetes; otherwise, the other people were well prepared with their own machetes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Witness, you stated that you knew Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before then; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you stated that you knew him -- you had known him for a long time.
@A.
Yes, I knew him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know where Mr. Ndindabahizi studied, in which primary school Mr. Ndindabahizi studied?
@A.
It must have been in the Kirambo locality.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know where he did his secondary school?
@A.
No, I do not know.
@MR. BESNIER:
University, in which he studied?
@A.
It was in Butare.  It was said that he was at university, but I believe it must have been the Butare university.  I was not closely following where he was studying.  It was being said that he was at university.  He was my neighbour, but I had no interest in finding out which university.  And then at the end of his university studies -- he was one of few people who attended university in our region.  And he was appointed a leader because he was one of the very few people in our region to have attended university.
@MR. BESNIER:
What were you -- what were you doing when Mr. Ndindabahizi was at university?
@A.
I was a farmer.
@MR. BESNIER:
What reason did you have to visit him at this time?
@A.
But I never visited him.  We never visited each other.  I just knew him the way you know someone -- when children are in school they know each other.  When you visit a cousin or an auntie, paternal aunt, you hear that there is a child in school.  But when a child of the secteur or commune attends a university or university (sic), it was known by everybody because it was something -- it was a rare event at the time.
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you ever spoken to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi or has he ever spoken to you?
@A.
Speak to me?  We were not of the same social standing.  He is somebody who attended university.  And what interests would he have to speak to a farmer?  And, in any event, we did not live in the same secteur.  We were in the same commune.  I knew him as a leader, just the way you know any leader.  When the préfet holds a meeting the members of the population will see and recognise him, but he does not see everybody except those who belong to the same class as he himself.  When you don't belong to the same social class you do not know each other, and only the good leaders who do not plot against their country, who do not betray their fellow countrymen, are known by the citizens.
@MR. BESNIER:
What leader was Ndindabahizi before 1994?  What was he leading?
@A.
Well, in 1994, from what I was told, he was working somewhere before 1994; but I don't know exactly what he was doing, but at some point in time I went to the Trafipro cooperative and I found him there.  Later on, I heard that he was in Kigali.  I was not closely following the situation, but he was working in a department in Kigali.  And later on in 1994 I heard that he was the minister of finance.  I don't know whether he was given that position to be able to pay the Interahamwe.

@MR. BESNIER:
You refer to Trafipro, can you explain to the Court what this Trafipro means?
@A.
It was a cooperative.  I don't know if it was a state-sponsored cooperative or a farmers' cooperative.  They sold clothings -- clothing and other implements.  I used to see him there, and when I saw him there, I thought he worked there, but I really do not know, but he was a very important person in that area.  And I used to see him quite often because I used to go to Trafipro, but I really didn't closely monitor or follow his situation; besides, we never spoke to each other, he and I never spoke to each other.  
It was only because some events occurred and I have been called upon to testify in his trial.
@MR. BESNIER:
You never visited Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, did you?
@A.
No, I just knew him.
@MR. BESNIER:
You confirm that you never spoke to him?
@A.
No, I never spoke to him.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you were unable to recognise him in April of 1994?
@A.
What do you mean that I was unable to recognise him?  Can you repeat your question?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETERS:
Sorry, we missed the beginning of Counsel's question, if he can go over the question.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat your question, please?  Please repeat the question.
@MR. BESNIER:
This is my last but one question, Mr. President.  And I'm asking Witness -- I'm telling Witness he really does not know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and I don't even think he knows him at all.  And I am putting it to him that he was unable to identify him during the events that he is referring to.
@THE WITNESS:
I'm not lying, I saw him.  I'm not lying; I knew him before.  Obviously, we were not visiting each other because he was rich and I was poor, and besides, he lived far away from me. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
My last question, Witness, in your written statement you claimed that someone allegedly told you that Ndindabahizi distributed weapons at Gisovu; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would wish you to tell us who this person is, but don't mention his name.  I'm going to show you a piece of paper with the name of this person, and please tell the Court if this, indeed, is the person who told you that Ndindabahizi distributed weapons at Gisovu; do you understand?
@A.
Yes, I understand.
@THE WITNESS:
Can I have that piece of paper.
@MR. BESNIER:
Please show the names to the Judges, the Prosecution and then to the witness. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, this is the person.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Mr. President, no further questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a name on the piece of paper, do you want that exhibited?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  I'm sorry, Mr. President.  Indeed, I would like to -- I would like it to be noted that the Witness has recognised the name that was presented to him by the Defence, and that this name be entered on the records of the Court.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this becomes Defence Exhibit Number 6, under seal. 
$Exhibit No. D6 admitted, under seal)
@MR. MUSSA:
That will be Defence Exhibit Number 6, My Lord.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good.  And your information there, Defence Counsel, it was based on information in the documents?
The name mentioned on the piece of paper, could you just draw our attention to the particular paragraph where we should look?
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President.  It is a piece of information which appears in the statement of 3rd April, 2001 of Witness CGN at the end of his statement, sixth line from the bottom in the French version.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There it is, thank you.
Thank you.  Any re-examination? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have now come to the end of your testimony.  Thank you, very much for coming to the Tribunal to testify.  We wish you a safe journey home; and please, do not discuss your testimony with anyone. 
@THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have a request, if you allow me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead.
@THE WITNESS:
There are lawyers or assistants  -- assistants to some lawyers from other countries.  And these people come and put questions to these people.  But these are confidential matters, particularly concerning our security.  But some of these people come to us, go to the hills, to the communal office, and in front of the public have someone's written -- I was interviewed in 2001.  And before I came here, I met investigators, and that was done in a confidential manner.  
But these people I am referring to, come publicly.  They write summons at the communal office.  And we are summoned to the communal office as if we are criminals to be interviewed.  And when we are interviewed to request us to come and testify here, we are told that it is confidential.  
I'm not criticising these people, but I am requesting that this does not -- is not repeated, or I request the Chamber to go after these people.  
I have a document here which has the communal stamp.  And these are people that we do not know who bring you this document, present the document to you.  This document was given to me on the 15th of July; that is the date on the document.  These people receive -- people receive these summons from strangers.  And these are people who want to interview us; whereas, they should be interviewing us in a confidential manner, they give this document to the communal secretary or to a third party, even to children.  But it is written on this document, you can see, written, the International Criminal Tribunal of Arusha (sic).  I think this issue needs to be looked at closely.  Our security should be safeguarded.  
Maybe you should contact the Kibuye authorities.  I don't know if you are thinking about ensuring our security after we have been killed.  There are very few people who are ready to come and testify here and I think we ought to be protected.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Tribunal is very anxious to protect the security of the witnesses.  And we have a unit, a section which is particularly trained in these matters.  And they usually proceed very discreetly in order to avoid exactly what you are indicating.  
Now, are you saying that Tribunal staff approached the communal authority in a transparent way so that it became transparent, then visible?  Is that -- are you talking about Tribunal staff?  Have you seen them, yourself?  Who are these persons that you are referring to?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know these people, but these must be officers of the Tribunal, and they want to interview you publicly, before the public, in a room at the communal office, everybody sees you.  There was a Rwandan woman with these people.  And let me add, to appoint somebody who is in Kigali, and for these people to go and look for people he knows; you should not be appointing just anybody to go and contact people, people that he does not know.  It is not proper to proceed in that manner.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, there is a criticism directed specifically at my office, and the investigators that were involved in the re-confirmation exercise of this witness in the field.  We regret the circumstances very much; but it certainly is not associated with what other witnesses have complained about before Your Honours prior to today.  This is a separate matter that this -- that accord in relation to this witness and some other witnesses where they were, indeed, contacted through the local authorities.  
And we have -- we have established an independent investigation of this in our office, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Did you hear the explanation there, Mr. Witness; just answer yes or no whether it was translated to you?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I followed the interpretation.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, with our words I confirm that the Tribunal is very anxious to protect your identity; and that if there were problems here, they will be looked into and an investigation is going on.  And I will also be -- if I can keep this document, Mr. Witness, I will hand this over in connection with that investigation.
@THE WITNESS:
You may keep that document, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is very kind, thank you for assisting us.  
Now, we wish you a safe journey home, and you may now be discharged.  And if the registry could kindly assist you and draw the curtain.  And we will then move on, if we have the next witness available. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@CJY, Your Honour, CJY.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Witness, we will look into the matter.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be asked questions now in an open session.  Be careful when you answer the questions so as not to reveal your identity.  Do you have a piece of paper in front of you now?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see the document.  I have it right here.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you recognise that document?  Have you seen it before?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, this document was shown to me at the time when I signed it at the bottom.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The fact that your signature is at the bottom, does that imply that the information contained therein, in that document, is correct?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, this document was read to me and I realised that the information on it was correct.  I realised that the information on the document is correct.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, were you working in Kibuye town in April 1994?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And did you live outside of Kibuye town in April 1994?
@A.
Yes.  I was living outside of the town of Kibuye, but in the urban commune in which the said town is to be found.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And when you heard of the death of the president on the 7th of April, you were in Kibuye town; right?
@A.
Yes.  That is where I was when I learned of that news.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you briefly tell their Honours what the security situation was a week or so following the death of the president in Kibuye town?
@A.
In the week following the death of the president, from the day after the death of the president the security situation deteriorated progressively.  Little by little, and gradually the situation deteriorated.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What did you observe during this period?  What was happening?
@A.
To begin with, some people changed their behaviour; one could say that they were expecting to be doing something.  Some members of the population were happy; others were sad.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, did you witness any attacks during this period, between members of the population?
@A.
During this period of time, when I was in town, the attacks had not yet begun.  But outside of the town in the surrounding communes, there were attacks and we could see smoke from far off because the houses had already begun to be burned down.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, could you tell us when you witnessed attacks in Kibuye town?
@A.
Personally, when I left Kibuye town people were already in groups, but the attacks had not yet been launched.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And when did you leave Kibuye town, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I finally left on the 11th of April; that is when I left Kibuye town.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you tell the Tribunal where you went after leaving the town?
@A.
I went to my native region.
@MR. KAPAYA:
When you talk of your native region, do you mean the place where you were raised at, where your family was?
@A.
Yes, that is where my family was.  But it is the same urban commune where the town is located.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, when you talk of your family, Mr. Witness, you mean a wife and how many children, if any?
@A.
I'm referring to my wife, our children, there were three.  I'm also referring to my mother; my older brothers, who were married.  But amongst my brother, there was one who was still a bachelor.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  When you got to the area of residence, what was the situation like then?
@A.
Where I lived, one could see clearly that there was security, but there were rumours coming to us from far off places.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you make any security arrangements for your family, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, we tried to take some measures.  We came together in groups in order to ensure our security together.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Witness CJY, did you stay at your residences throughout April, May, June, July, 1994?
@A.
No.  We didn't remain there because at a given point in time the situation -- the security situation deteriorated and we were forced to flee.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell their Honours, what it is that forced you to flee?
@A.
We decided to flee because there were numerous attacks targeting the neighbouring areas, there were other people who were seeking refuge by leaving their homes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us who was attacking whom at this particular period?
@A.
It was people referred to as Interahamwe, people of the Hutu ethnic group who were attacking Tutsis, but it is not all of the Hutus who were -- who had become attackers.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know the reason why the Hutus were attacking the Tutsis, those particular Hutus who were attacking the Tutsis?
@A.
I didn't quite understand the question, could you please repeat it for me.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, you said that -- you testified that some Hutus were attacking Tutsis at that particular period.  My question was whether you knew the reason why those particular Hutus were attacking the Tutsis at that particular period.
@A.
Yes, I know the reason.  Mention had already been made of that; and then there was a radio which was heating up people's head, especially the RTLM.  And there were others who were acting because of their sense of morality or their religious convictions.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, you haven't actually told us the reasons why, but what was said on RTLM about these attacks?
@A.
On RTLM, it was being said that the Inkotanyi had wanted to grab the country, to kill Hutus; and, therefore, Hutus needed to do everything in their power to try to protect themselves and try to ensure their safety and security.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what did you understand by the term, "Inkotanyi"?
@A.
The word Inkotanyi referred to all Tutsis, without any distinction.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, could you tell us, Mr. Witness, whether there came a time when you went to seek refuge at any particular place?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now approaching something slightly different?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we take the 15-minutes break now. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
It is fine with me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  We are coming back in about 15 minutes, Mr. Witness.
@MR. MUSSA:
All rise.  
$Court recessed from 1632H to 1649H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Mr. Kapaya.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, following the detailed security situation of your area of residence, did you go somewhere to see refuge; if so, where?
@A.
I did not remain in my home.  But first of all, what I would like to ask is that you had told me that I needed to be careful when answering questions because the name of the place which I'm going to mention in my answer may help in revealing my identity.  So, if I say it -- because once I would have answered your question, maybe we will not be able to reverse the situation.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you about to refer to a hill in Bisesero or are you about to refer to a more specific place?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is a specific area which may be recognised later as somewhere which is close to my home.  I don't know, this may help reveal my identity. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
But I believe that the Witness went to seek refuge is a place where many people went there.  So it     is -- I think he can rest assured that his identity will not be known.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for drawing our attention to this, Mr. Witness, that was the right thing to do, but you will not be identified, says the Prosecution.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you now kindly tell us, Mr. Witness, where you went to seek refuge?
@A.
I went to seek refuge on Gitwa hill.  But I left that place later on because my wife was expectant -- expecting, and moreover, it was raining a great deal; it was the month of April, I had small children with me.  And I tried to take these people to a friend's house.  As for myself, I remained on Gitwa.  And from time to time, I would go to the home of the person I have just referred to.  So when there was some fog, or at night, I would go to the house of that person who was hiding my family for me.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, let's focus on Gitwa hill.  Is it true that Gitwa -- could you tell us where Gitwa hill is located, in which commune?
@A.
Gitwa hill is -- was in the commune formally known as Gitesi commune in Roboso (phonetic) secteur even now.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you recall the approximate date you went to seek refuge at Gitwa hill?
@A.
I remember the date; I think it was on the 15th of April.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And could you tell us for how long you stayed at Gitwa hill before you moved elsewhere?
@A.
I didn't remain there for a long time because I told you that I had to be on the move constantly because my wife was pregnant, and she delivered in the month of May.  So as I was saying, I was at two places at the same time, so to speak.  And it was -- and these two places are near each other.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  While at Gitwa hill, Mr. Witness, can you tell us what you observed?
@A.
On that hill, there were many refugees who had come from several places in Kibuye préfecture.  There were, in fact, refugees who came from as far as Gitarama.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was it safe to stay at that hill all of the time?
@A.
Yes, there were difficulties, but we didn't have any choice.  These were people who had come together in order to resist, by the grace of God.  But if death came, then we would all die together.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us whether there were any attacks mounted upon Gitwa hill, where you sought refuge in that place?
@A.
Yes, there were attacks on Gitwa hill.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us who mounted those attacks?
@A.
It was those people whom I'd referred to, it was the Hutus who said they wanted to protect the country which was going to be captured by others.  But I said that there were also Hutus who remained in their homes, who deplored the situation and who did not approve of these things that were happening.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Of the Hutus who attacked you; do you know of any people who -- do you know the names of any particular attackers who came there?
@A.
Yes, I know some.  There were particularly the leaders of the attackers who seemed to have been trained.  One could see that these were people who were prepared.  And they came from secteurs which I knew of, or secteurs which were neighbouring ours.  It was not a matter of people who came from very far.  There were some who came from far, but there were also neighbours among them.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know of any people of authority who came along with the attackers to that place?
@A.
Yes, I do.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you name them, those you recall -- those whose names you recall?
@A.
There were authorities, people in authority at various levels.  And maybe I will begin with the responsable right up to people of very high levels.  All of these people came to attack.  But now,      Mr. Prosecutor, from where do you want me to begin.
@MR. KAPAYA:
You may begin from wherever, the identification of the responsable upwards.
@A.
I can mention from the responsables de cellule, but there, once again, there are going to be -- it is going to be necessary to make the remark that I made earlier, because if I mention specific names, my area of origin would be identified.  Maybe you can give me a piece of paper on which I can write these names.  I think that would be a better option.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, I don't think by mentioning a person -- the person's position and his area of authority will ever -- will in any way identify you, unless you say you live there or you've lived there.  All we want from you is just to mention those people and say where they worked, and that kind of thing.  Don't necessarily link them with where you lived.
@A.
If I understand you, it means that if I mention only the names that would be adequate for you,          Mr. Prosecutor?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, that may do, under the circumstances. 
@A.
Let me begin with some names, especially people whom I consider to have been leaders; people who were considered to be valiant, courageous.  There was one John Munyangeyo, Munyangeyo is spelt, M-U-N-Y-A-N-G-E-Y-O.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what was his position in society?
@A.
He didn't have any specific status.  The fact of being considered courageous or valiant doesn't mean that you have a position of authority as such.  This is someone who was considered to be courageous during that period of time, and who killed with no problem.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay.  Who are the other people you can recall?
@A.
There was Kanyamibwa, Martin.  Kanyamibwa is spelt, K-A-N-Y-A-M-I-B-W-A; Kanyamibwa, Martin was his first name.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you tell us what position he held in society? 
@A.
He was the responsable of the cellule
@MR. KAPAYA:
And who else was there?
@A.
Let me mention John Rwamasasu, which is spelt, R-W-A-M-A-S-A-S-U, Rwamasasu, first name John.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And did you tell us what he was?
@A.
He was also a member of the cellule committee.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you tell us some other names you recall, at a different level now?
@A.
There was Nyagasaza.  Nyagasaza is spelt, N-Y-A-G-A-S-A-Z-A, Nyagasaza. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what was this person?
@A.
He is someone who can be considered as a vagabond, somebody who is always found in drinking bars.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, let's move to the communal level.  Did you see anybody come who held positions at the commune level and the secteur level?  Let's move at that level now.
@A.
Yes, there was one Besingemana (phonetic), who was a veterinary officer.  And he used to operate in the Rutsiro region.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, did you see any préfet or ministers come along with attackers at that time?
@A.
During the attack, there was an officer -- I think he was the officer in charge of the Gisovu tea factory, who came during the last large-scale attack.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And before that attack you described as a "large-scale attack", did you see other minister or préfets come at Gitwa hill?
@A.
No.  There were no préfets or minister on the Gitwa hill.  But before the large-scale attack that I referred to, some government officials came to give instructions, but they were not very visible, because people were staying -- in hiding.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know the person by the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I know him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us how you got to know him?
@A.
I knew him well before these events.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us when you knew him and under what circumstances, and in which years before these events?
@A.
When I got to know him the first time, he was still a young man.  I studied at the center close to his region, his native region, a centre called Kirambo, K-I-R-A-M-B-O.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And when was that?
@A.
This was in 1968, '69, around that period.  It was on that occasion that I got to know him.  But since he was in the higher institution, I did not see him quite often.  But in any event, it was during that period that I got to know him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us other periods, before the war, when you used to see or know Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Before the onset of the war, he used to come from time to time to Kibuye.  This was after 1990, so this was after the advent of the multi-party system.  It was then that he used to come to Kibuye and I used to see him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What would you see him doing in Kibuye, Mr. Witness?
@A.
From time to time he would come to Kibuye.  He didn't come quite often, but when he came there was PSD party rallies.  And at that time, he was somebody who was a very well respected and who held a lot of clout at the national level within his PSD party. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
What was the connection between him and the PSD party, if you know?
@A.
He was a member of that party; besides, he was an officer.  But at that time, the PSD was a good party, but subsequently, things changed.  But before things changed, people liked that party; people liked the PSD party.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Were you a member of any political party yourself, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I was not a member of any political party. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Then how did you know that Mr. Ndindabahizi came to attend these PSD political parties?
@MR. KAPAYA:
The political parties use to hold their rallies where I worked.  So whether you are a member or not, or whether -- even if you are not a member of any political party, you could still follow what was being said out of curiosity?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Just to wrap up this part, can you describe to the Honours, what Mr. Ndindabahizi looked like?
@A.
At that time, most of the time he was not on foot, he was aboard a vehicle.  People would be around the vehicle, and he would bring out his hand from the vehicle, in the direction of the people; people would applaud.  And one could see that he was somebody who was well liked by the people.  It was in those circumstances that I was able to observe him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you describe his physical features?  Was he tall, short, brown, black, that kind of thing?
@A.
At that time he would be seated aboard a vehicle.  But when the vehicle stopped, he would normally get out, greet people.  He was of average height, not too fat; somebody of average height and not too fat.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And how would you place his age?
@A.
About -- he was somebody who was about 42, 43 years, but that is just an estimate.  The way I saw him, he must have had -- he must have been 42, 43 years.  He was no longer a young man.  He was an adult, a matured person.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Let's go back to 1994, now.  When was it that you saw this man?
@A.
I saw him in 1994.

$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you give us the approximate date and month when you saw him in '94? 
@A.
In 1994, I believe I saw him on the 23rd April.  I don't think there should be any doubt about that. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what makes you think that you saw him on the 23rd and not the 22nd or any other date? 
@A.
I confirm that date because under such difficult circumstances, I had a radio and I could listen to the news on that radio.  So I am able to easily remember this date. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay.  Mr. Witness, can you tell us how he got to the place where you saw him? 
@A.
He came in a vehicle, that is how he got to the place. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did he come in one vehicle or did he come in a convoy? 
@A.
He came in his own vehicle, but he was accompanied by other vehicles.  It was therefore clear that he was being accompanied. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you describe the vehicle in which he boarded, he came with? 
@A.
It was a white double-cabin vehicle. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And how many people came with him in that vehicle? 
@A.
He was with his driver who was driving him as well as two soldiers who escorted him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And how did you know that the other two people were soldiers? 
@A.
They were wearing military uniform with red berets.  In fact, they were gendarmes and I knew by the uniform they were wearing. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us -- can you describe the second vehicle in which Mr. Ndindabahizi came? 
@A.
It was a blue Daihatsu.

Do you know who owned it?
@A.
No.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you describe the people who were in that vehicle? 
@A.
Among the people in there, there were soldiers wearing military uniform, other members of the population who had covered their heads with bananas leaves.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was there a particular name which the members of the population with bananas leaves were referred to at that particular time? 
@A.
These persons were referred to as Interahamwe.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell Their Honours how many Interahamwes and how many soldiers were there? 
@A.
It is clear that I did not count these people and that I was in hiding.  We had to act with a lot of prudence, but if I have to estimate, I would say that the gendarmes were about six or ten.  Let me say between six and ten gendarmes.  Regarding the members of the population, there were many, but their number would not exceed 20 -- 20 people. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you describe the third vehicle in that convoy? 
@A.
It was an old model Toyota, the colour was between white and yellow.  In fact, the colour is similar to the colour of the table in front of me here.
@JUDGE KHAN:
What did you say -- this was the colour of the car, yellow?
@THE WITNESS:
I observed that the colour was close to yellow or let's say, a defaced yellow. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may the record show that the colour of the desk the witness is describing is beige, sort of. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us the occupants of this third vehicle, who were in that third vehicle? 
@A.
Aboard that vehicle there were some gendarmes which -- what makes me say they are gendarmes is the fact that they were wearing military uniforms with red berets.  So the uniform I have just described is the gendarmes' uniform.  The gendarmes were few. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And were there other occupants in that vehicle apart from the gendarmes? 
@A.
Yes, there were other persons who were sitting there and one could see that they were waiting for something because they stayed there for a long time. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, I am still with the people who were in that third vehicle, you said some of them were gendarmes.  My question is, who were the others, could you recognise them at least by their dressing or something? 
@A.
These were members of the population who were wearing banana leaves and there were some soldiers as well with them. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you estimate their number, how many of these were? 
@A.
They were about six persons apart from those wearing the banana leaves. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now can you tell us the order in which these motor vehicles reached that place, which preceded the other? 
@A.
First of all, there was a white double-cabin vehicle, the second vehicle was a Daihatsu and the third one was this single cabin Toyota pick-up, the model was stout. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now after Ndindabahizi had reached that area, did you observe him say or do anything? 
@A.
Yes, when he got to the place people got up to greet him, and other people joined those who were already there, and it was as if they were waiting for the arrival of the vehicles to join those who were already there.  So they got close to him. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you now describe, Mr. Witness, in your own words what you observed, whether this man said anything or did anything? 
@A.
Those who were there greeted Mr. Ndindabahizi.  He asked them if people were still taking refuge on the Gitwa hill. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
What did people reply and what did he say if anything else? 
@A.
They answered that people were no longer taking refuge at that place because people had already assembled there, they had left their houses. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
What else did Mr. Ndindabahizi say or do, if anything? 
@A.
He told them that the situation was similar and that there were no more people living in the forest to take refuge there, then they should implement the plan that was envisaged immediately. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
During that meeting, did you observe anything happening? 
@A.
There was a distribution of implements which were going to go used in the implementation of the plan. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you give us some background as to the distribution of implements?  How did it come about that -- I mean implements were distributed, and which implements?  Can you be more specific, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
The implements that were distributed were cartons of machetes which were distributed, they were not many.  There were also cartons containing the camouflage uniforms of the leaders, those who were going to lead the attacks. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Were those uniforms and weapons accompanied by any explanation from anybody? 
@A.
Yes, it was explained that, that the weapons that had just been distributed were to be used in implementing the plan that had been drawn up, and that they should not just keep them without using them. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, who gave that explanation? 
@A.
It was Ndindabahizi. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And can you tell us what was the response from the people?  
@A.
The people present were very happy because they had just received some assistance and then the people rejoiced. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you want to tell us that before the arms were brought by Mr. Ndindabahizi, there was nobody who was armed amongst the attackers on that particular day? 
@A.
Yes, there were those who were carrying machetes; others were carrying clubs, and they came to look for weapons that they were going to use. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Can you tell us from which of the three vehicles that those weapons were off-loaded from?
@A.
The weapons were in the Daihatsu, that was the second vehicle. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And do you recall some of the names of the people who received those weapons? 
@A.
Yes, I remember these people, in fact, most of them were in fact the names that I had mentioned earlier. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, can you, for the record, just go through the names very quickly, please? 
@A.
There was one Jean Munyangeyo.  I spoke of one Martin Kanyamibwa, I mentioned  -- yes, Jean Munyangeyo, Martin Kanyamibwa, Jean Rwamasasu, Nyagasaza, who was unemployed, and one Mathias. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  What time of the day was it that you saw this particular incident on that day? 
@A.
When vehicles arrived at about eleven in the morning, but the operation was underway very quickly because there was the matter of the distribution of weapons and then the vehicles left. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
So how long did Mr. Ndindabahizi stay where you saw him distributing the weapons? 
@A.
It took less than 30 minutes. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now from where -- how far were you from the place you were hiding to the place where weapons were being distributed? 
@A.
I did not measure the distance,  but I would say that it was between 25 and 50 metres -- 25 to 50 metres.  I didn't measure the distance, but I think that the distance wouldn't be more than 50 metres.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And when you talk of 25 to 50 metres, how long would that be in relation to the place you are seated? can you point some place within this courtroom or farther beyond where you estimate 25 metres to 50 metres to be? 
@A.
From where I am seated, one who have to go beyond the glass and add maybe another five metres, beyond the glass to the end of this courtroom.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what was the vegetation like between the place where you were hiding and the place where the three vehicles stopped? 
@A.
It wasn't either a valley nor was it a desert, but  there was a slight slope.  There was a kind of a small hill or mound.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when you said that in order to give an indication of the distance, it was between you and even longer than the glass wall, which glass wall, which wall on which side of the courtroom, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
I gave the example of that distance from that side where that camera is suspended up to the other end where there are other glass, in other words, the opposite direction.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So one glass wall to the other glass wall, and according to the courtroom measurements, document we have in front of us here, it has been measured by the Court Management Section and from the glass of the translators' booth to the wall of the video booth, is about 21 metres.  So that is on record.  
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, I am still at the place where you were hiding.  Were you on an elevated position in relation to where Mr. Ndindabahizi was or was it the other way round? 
@A.
It was above the road.  I was above the road.  There was a slope and I was looking downward towards the road. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now let's focus at the place where you said you saw him park those vehicles.  Was there anything special with that place?  Was there any activity going around at that particular place? 
@A.
At the place where the vehicles were parked there was a crossroad.  In that place, a roadblock had been setup. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know when that roadblock had been setup? 
@A.
That roadblock was setup after the 15th around the 16th, because it is at that point in time that they began stopping people who wanted to go and hide.  That happened at night and then they were killed. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
In relation to hills, can you tell us that roadblock was between which hill and which hill, if you can? 
@A.
It was a roadblock number one, which was situated between Gitwa Hill and FM antennae, but from where the roadblock was up to the antennae, there was a longer distance, if you were to compare that distance between the roadblock and Gitwa Hill. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, which direction Mr. Ndindabahizi took after the distribution of the arms? 
@A.
He went northwards. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Is that the direction from which he had come? 
@A.
No, he took the Kibuye road going towards Gitwa, but he didn't go in the same direction from which he had come. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, whether there were any attacks after that date, the area you were hiding? 
@A.
The following day there was an attack.  It was somewhat an attack to assess the strength of the refugees, but that attack did not succeed because they repelled the attack, the refugees repelled the attack. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now during the attack, did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi that day? 
@A.
No, he was not in that attack, rather, the people to whom he had distributed the weapons were involved in that attack. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you name some of them whom you saw, who taken the -- who had received the weapons and took part in the attack on the second day? 
@A.
Yes, these people were indeed involved in the attack. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us their names, please, if you can recall them? 
@A.
Yes, I can mention their names.  Among others, there were those whom I had mentioned, but if you wish, I can repeat their names but they were many.  Given the fact that these people were my neighbours and we shared everything, I was able to recognise them. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you witness any attacks subsequent to that one, the one which took place around the 24th?
@A.
On the 25th, another attack was launched, but that attack failed. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us why it failed, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
The attack was launched on 24th and it failed because some of the attackers were killed.  Therefore, the attackers were afraid because some of them had died the day before; that is why because they were afraid, they were attacking with fear. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you want to tell us that nobody was killed during the second attack? 
@A.
People were killed during that second attack, people who were in their camp, but also amongst the attackers, there were victims. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was there another attack, Mr. Witness, that you witnessed at Gitwa? 
@A.
On the 26th on Gitwa hill, there was a large-scale attack.  People from all the secteurs were beating on their drums and all the old women and children died during that attack; only able-bodied people were able to escape from that attack. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi during that attack? 
@A.
No, the people who had participated in that attack were at a lower level than the leadership, the major leaders were not involved in the attack. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us how you managed to survive the attacks? 
@A.
To speak about the way in which I escaped or survived, is like a dream because it was difficult to escape from more than a 100 attackers, attackers who were armed with weapons, with machetes and other weapons.  It was really difficult to escape from those attacks. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us how you were rescued from those attacks? 
@A.
Everyone tried to escape and save his or her life and those who were in flight could cut up with a machete anyone who was coming to attack him or her. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was there a time when you sought refuge at Nyarushishi refugee camp? 
@A.
Yes, I went to take refuge in that camp.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you help us with the month, please?  Which month did you go to that camp? 
@A.
It was on the 18th of July, but I was coming from Kibuye where I had been rescued by the French soldiers, on the 11th of July. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
In your statement that you gave to ICTR investigators, you said that you were rescued in May 1994.  How do you explain that, Mr. Witness, in the light of your testimony now? 
@A.
I think the investigators did not take down my statement properly because in the month of May the French had not arrived in Kibuye préfecture.
@MR. KAPAYA:

Yes, I went to that place with the investigators of the Tribunal.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us what you told them, what you did with those investigators? 
@A.
I went with those investigators and they examined the location.  They looked at the place where the roadblock had been setup and also the place where I remained, a building which served as a bar, it was a wooden structure and they took photographs of all these places.

Yes, I can see there is a big dot there, and on the place is written "Kibuye", and there is a crossing of the road.  And lower down, I can't read English, but I can read "Karongi FM hill", and then there is the word "scale" one centimetre to 0.5 kilometres.  And then I can see Kibuye map; I see 50,000 or something to that effect.

Yes, and under the word "Legend", there is an explanation what R4 reads.  Can you confirm that that is the place where it is referred to as R4 on that place?
@A.
Yes, I can see.  However, you have your legend in a language which I do not understand, but I think this is a sketch which represent sections of roads, and I think that it is referring to a road, or a section of a road.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr.  Witness, R4 is referred to as the roadblock.  That is the place where you claimed that you saw 
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  My question is: do you confirm that in this map?  It's a pictorial representation.

While at Nyarushishi refugee camp, did you have occasion to discuss the events of '94 in the ordinary course of your stay there at the camp?

There is a slope where I was, but it was not very steep and it was not too far.  I was behind a house which was between the trees.  The house has been destroyed, but we can see the land on which the house was constructed.  It was on the road.  I went there together with the investigators and I pointed the place out to them.  It is on the road and you can see it.

So you hid behind a house and behind the trees?

@A.
Yes, I remember his name.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you not meet this person in Gitwa during the events of '94 that you talked about?
@A.
No, we did not meet.  The camp was quite large, and there were a lot of people in the camp.  It's a camp that extended over one kilometre, and you can't know everybody who was within that -- within the space of one kilometre.

I understand, but you knew this person before the events of 1994?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
You never had discussion with him at Gitwa during the events of 1994 regarding Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
No, we never discussed that issue.  And besides, at the time we could not imagine that those committing the genocide, those perpetrating the genocide would be tried.  We did not know that such measures were going to be taken against them.  So we could not have discussed it.

During the events of 1994, on what date did you arrive -- on what date exactly did you arrive at the -- on the Gitwa hill?

I explained; that is in my statement, I believe -- in my testimony.  It was around the 15th that I left my house and got to the Gitwa hill which is quite close to my house.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why specifically did you decide to take refuge on the Gitwa hill on that day?
@A.
I saw a lot of people there and I thought it was the best place to take refuge, because I also needed to get close to others.
@MR. BESNIER:
How many refugees were there on Gitwa hill when you got there?
@A.
There were a lot of refugees.  It's an extensive hill top and people had brought their livestock and had their stables for their livestock.  There were cattle, goats and other domestic animals, and there was a large crowd.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you give us an estimate of the number of people?  Were they hundreds, several thousands, tens of thousands, can you be a bit more specific?
@A.
There were thousands of people.  I would not say there were hundreds of thousands, but there were tens of thousands.
@MR. BESNIER:
And after you arrived on Gitwa hill, did other persons join you to increase your number?
@A.
Yes, people were trickling in one by one.  There were people we did not know from Gisenyi, Gitarama, Cyangugu, people we did not know and people who also left the Kibuye stadium where a horrific acts had been committed.  Obviously, I was not at the Kibuye stadium, but I do know that horrific acts were committed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you witness the attack at the Gitwa hill before the one you claimed is a visit of Ndindabahizi on that hill in 1994?
@A.
An attack which I would refer to as sporadic attack was mounted from Gisovu, but that sporadic attack was not successful.
@MR. BESNIER:
When did that attack take place, Witness?
@A.
I recall that it was on the 18th of April.

I told you and I repeat, just in case you did not understand.  It was as if there were two distinct families.  My family was living outside the refugee camp in the village, and another part of my family living within the camp.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to clarify or tell us the members of the family who were living in the camp and those living outside the camp?
@A.
Outside the camp, there was my wife and the child she was carrying on her back, and also she was pregnant.  There were two other children, my children and my old mother.
@MR. BESNIER:
And these were close relatives living on the Karongi hill; is that correct?
@A.
There was also my big brother, my younger brother who was a young man, they were all on the Gitwa hill, but my old mother and my children had to be protected from the rain, because it was during the raining, it was raining a lot, and we sought to protect them from the rain and cold.
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm sorry, Witness, I did not understand you.  Maybe it is a problem of interpretation.  I understood that your wife and children were on the Karongi hill.  Let's take it step by step.
@A.
I have explained to you that my wife who was pregnant and had a child and the two other children as well as my old mother, were on the Karongi hill, whereas my brothers -- my brothers were on the Gitwa hill.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  How were your wife, your children and your old mother protected from -- or sheltered from the rain on Gitwa hill?
@A.
My old mother -- I entrusted my old mother to someone who sheltered her as well as the two children.  My wife who was pregnant was entrusted to an inhabitant of the region who is a friend of my mine.
@MR. BESNIER:
Your wife and children were sheltered in a house.  Why then didn't you join them since they were in a security -- situation of security?
@A.
But I could not stay there.  It would be a mistake to stay there.  It was better for me to stay out of where they had taken refuge to be in the camp with my brothers to be able to ensure the security of my family.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is:  Why it would be better for you to do it the ways you chose?  Mr. Witness, can you explain that to us?
@THE WITNESS:
Let me go over my answer and attempt to explain to you.  I did not stay with my wife and children because they were not at the same place; they were in two separate places.  They used to come and fetch people from houses, and those who did not collaborate with the attackers, the killer were worried by the attackers.  That is why part of my family was in the houses and others were in the camp.  There was no other way of -- there was no place that was safe during those -- during that time.

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the name of the person who sheltered your wife and the children?
@A.
I don't intend to give his name, I think we agreed before I stated my testimony; I believe that is going to create a state of insecurity for this person as it was said earlier.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you then accept to write his name on a piece of paper and pass it on to the Court?
@A.
Very well, I agree.  I will write it on paper.
@MR. BESNIER:
By leave of the Court, can the registrar - registry, give a piece of paper and pen to the witness. 
To save a bit of time I will continue with my cross-examination, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, one last time.  I don't understand clearly.  In your written statement, you stated that on the 15th of April 1994 you went to the Gitwa hill, and that there you met a friend who was working on that hill, and who accepted to shelter you; is that correct?  You took shelter or you hid yourselves in that friend's house?
@A.
I don't think that was correctly recorded.  I told you that I had my wife and one of the children that my wife was carrying on her back, with a friend, and that my mother and two other children were sheltered by another person and I was in the camp, and I was shuttling between the camp and these two places.  It was as if I was living in these  -- all these places.  Besides, during that time we were not sleeping, I was shuttling all the time between the camp and where my family members were living.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. Witness.  Let me read out to you a portion of your statement: "On 15th April we decided that it was too dangerous to stay, and some of us fled to Gitwa hill.  Myself, I went with some people to Karongi FM hill, there I met my friend".  Would it be prudent, Witness, to mention the name of that friend?
@A.
Are you referring to the name of the person where I was?  Will request you not to mention that name.  You can limit yourself to the name I have given you.  This person is not there, he is in exile.  It would therefore not be proper to mention his name, you will understand.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let me continue.  "There I met my friend.  We were both -- we were working both for a company that I will not mention, and we were friends.  He accepted to hide me.  I went to Gitwa hill and brought my children also to Karongi FM hill".  Let me skip three lines to move faster.  "I stayed at Karongi FM hill up to about 21st April 1994".
My question is as follows: did you stay on Karongi FM hill between 15th April 1994 and 21 April 1994 without moving?  My understanding from your statement -- which is what I understand from your statement, or did you keep moving between Karongi FM hill and Gitwa?
@A.
Have you finished so that I can answer you?  Well, I would be coming, going.  I would go there and I would go back to where I came from.  I would spend nights at Karongi.  During the night I needed to move, to go to Gitwa and provide food, because I am the one who prepared meals for those people.  So I am the one who prepared meals in the house of a friend whose name you haven't mentioned, and for which I thank you, by the way.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Let's now focus on the 23rd of April 1994, Mr. Witness.  You claimed you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 23rd April 1994 close by Gitwa hill, between noon and 1 p.m.  Do we agree on the dates and the time the date and the time?
@A.
As for the date, I accept it, but as for the time, I did say that it was from 11, but I must say that I cannot be categorical about the time given.  The difficult circumstances under which I was living, I couldn't be exact with time.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are very affirmative regarding the date, and you explained that you were listening to the radio.  Can you give us explanations or clarifications?  Did the radio announce the visit of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi to Kibuye or was there something else that could have struck you?
@A.
No, the radio didn't announce Ndindbahizi's visit.  No, I was in difficulties and I was not listening to the radio all the time.  From time to time we would listen to the RTLM, but not consistently as someone who was living in times of peace.  From time to time I would listen to it and I would switch it off, and also you needed to think about saving the batteries, you see.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  So when you saw Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, Mr. Witness --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, do you see the significance of this question, Counsel is -- doesn't understand how you can use the fact that you were listening to the radio as an explanation of how you are now able, nine years later, to remember that you are absolutely convinced that this happened on the 23rd.  What was it on the radio which could give you an indication or a basis for remembering now, nine years later, that it was on the 23rd?  You have to explain that to us; it's not clear.
@THE WITNESS:
I will answer you as follows: we were listening to the news, or at least the news in brief, and mention was made of places where there were difficulties, but we didn't listen to the music programmes or any other programmes.  Every time that one thought about it, you know, we were in difficult times.  As for the RTLM broadcast, there was the music on RTLM and Bikindi's music as well as other messages, which was inciting the people to kill the other members of the population.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's your answer?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I think this is the answer I had for you. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER: 
@MR. BESNIER:
My question was this: when you saw Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, was there a specific program on the radio, which had drawn your attention?
@A.
I explained to you that I never heard Ndindabahizi's name on the radio.  I told you that the meetings were being held around the roadblocks; that's where the people were, the members of the population were, and that's where we saw the vehicles, and that's how we came to realise the reason for the presence of those vehicles, and we had to anticipate what was going to happen to us.  As for the rest, we were running helter skelter, and then people were killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was it at your friend's house, the friend whose name we haven't mentioned, where you were listening to the radio, or did you have your own radio, which you listened to?
@A.
In that house there was a radio set.  As for my own set, I tried to listen to it when it was necessary, but there would come times when I would turn on my radio when the news had already passed.  I thought about going to the place where my brothers were.
@MR. BESNIER:
You said in your written statement: "I stayed at Karongi FM hill up to about 21st April 1994".  I want to know whether you later on went back to Karongi FM hill to see your friend again.
@A.
As for returning to Karongi hill, that wasn't possible because soldiers had been sent.  It was being said that the Inkontanyi wanted to take over the situation.  In fact several soldiers had been sent to that place.  So those circumstances made me leave the hill.  I didn't see the hill again, otherwise I would have lost my life there, or I could have endangered my life.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  In your written statement you say --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are now reading from the English version, interpreter booth.  If you look at K01851526, if you have that in the statement, then you would see that it is paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Almost everything.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could continue the reading.  Please read on. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, there was a technical problem.  There was a switch, which was not switched the right way, so I will repeat, but I am looking at the French of the written statement, written by the Witness.  It's on page 4 of that statement, last but one paragraph in the French version.  And in the English it's also page 4 of the statement, paragraph 5 and it begins with the words; "Almost every day".
$BY MR. BESNIER:
Q 	Should I repeat the question, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Kindly repeat the question so that I can answer you appropriately.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement before the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor you stated almost every day Gitwa hill was attacked, but these attacks were small, and Tutsi people taking shelter there used to resist the attack".  
I wanted to know to which period of time you were referring when you say; "Almost every day".  Was it between the 15th of April 1994 and the 26th of April 1994?
@A.
This means from the 18th of April, it was on that day that an attack was launched which was repelled.  Secondly - subsequently, I beg your pardon, subsequently from the 23rd, 24th, there was another attack until there was the major attack.  It was during this period of time that almost every day there was an attack -- there was an attack launched.  It wasn't every day that there would be an attack but there were four attacks.  As you can see, in this period of time they were very close to one another.  So from the 15th -- from the 18th up to the 26th, it would be in that time.
@MR. BESNIER:
So could we say that on the 18th of April 1994 to the 27th of April 1994 you were almost every day the subject of an -- attacks on Tutsi civilian population which had taken refuge there?
@A.
I explained that when these attacks were launched they were trying to assess the strength of the refugees.  It's clear that in these attacks people were killed, and there were also victims amongst the assailants.
@MR. BESNIER:
These attacks which took place on Gitwa hill, did they also take place on Karongi hill between the 18th of April and the 27th of April 1994?
@A.
You are talking about the attacks on Karongi, but I don't think I mentioned any attacks which were launched on Karongi hill.  I didn't say that.
@MR. BESNIER:
No, I didn't say that you were attacked -- that you referred to or mentioned those attacks, but I was just seeking information from you.  So there were no attacks on Karongi hill during that period of time, is that correct?
@A.
Are you referring to the Karongi hill with the antenna, or Karongi, which was in the middle of that village?  Which part of the hill are you referring to?
@MR. BESNIER:
Karongi with the antenna on it.
@A.
No, no attack was mounted on Karongi.  To the contrary, I am telling you that soldiers were being sent, but that was an exaggeration.  People were talking about the Inkotanyi, but we were in fact seeing people who had taken refuge, people who had taken refuge at that place, but it was said that it was the Inkotanyi who had taken refugee there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were there many refugees on Karongi hill?
@A.
No, no, there were not that many refugees.  It was said that the refugees who were in Gitwa were going to take over the Karongi station, therefore communication was going to be hindered, but this was a way -- this was an exaggeration so that people can become furious and that they increase their strength, so that they go to kill those people who were there, and that's what happened on the 26th.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In the same paragraph as the one that I had referred to a moment ago, you said:  In the group, some people like me used to go to nearby places to collect more information about possible attacks".  Can you tell me what you meant?  What was the object of those missions for information gathering, as it were?
@A.
I will answer you.  It was an important mission because this enabled us -- we became to know where the attackers were coming from as well as the people, the inhabitants who were not supporting these attacks, and we were thus able to know the places where the attackers were coming from.
@MR. BESNIER:
During these fact-finding missions did you have to go away from Gitwa hill, to go towards the attackers so that you could get better information regarding their numbers, for instance?
@A.
This information could not be collected or gathered by one single individual.  There were people who needed to go and look for the information, and since Gitwa was surrounded by more than three secteurs -- Gitwa is located in Rubanzo, next door there's Gitetsi, Gitarama secteur, and Bishura and Kangabiro as well as the Rubanzo secteur -- so, you will realise that there must have been many people who needed to go and try and find information from all corners, and it was not to me alone that that task was assigned.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let's go back to the day on which you claim you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 23rd April 1994.  Were there any civilians on the road that you saw arrive?
@A.
When he arrived there were some members of the population who were manning the road, but there were others yet who came from farther a field, they were fewer, but in fact they organised themselves. The members of the population organised themselves when they saw the vehicles arriving. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you give us the number of the people that you saw at the roadblock in and around -- at or around the roadblock?
@A.
To give you an estimate I wouldn't say there were more than six people at that road, but later on when they assembled, there would have been maybe 30, 30 or more people.
@MR. BESNIER:
You yourself, Mr. Witness, you say that you were hiding behind a house or at the corner of a house.  Can you please describe that house to us?  Was it in ruins or was it still intact?
@A.
It was a house, which was still standing.  It was intact.  It was a house which was made of wooden planks, and it was by the roadside.  In fact if someone had gone in that direction I would have to run away into the forest, into the middle of the forest.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is that house -- was that house in the middle of the forest or was the -- was it a little bit farther from the road?
@A.
Everywhere there were trees, but there was a distance somewhat between the trees.  And at the level of the trunks there were no thick leaves, so you could look to the other side through the trees, as it were.
@MR. BESNIER:
From the road could that house be seen?
@A.
Yes, that house was visible.  I told you that it was a drinking place, and that can't be very far from the road.  In fact you needed to make it easier for people on the road to come by that house.
@MR. BESNIER:
On that day was the drinking place open.  That bar, was it open?  Were there people drinking there?
@A.
No, activities had come to an end because the owner of the bar was also being sought, because had he been there  -- had he been found there he would have been killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that for you not to be recognised you were holding -- you were standing in front of -- you were not standing in front of the house?  So you had to be hiding behind the house isn't that correct?
@A.
I stated that I didn't need to be behind the house all the time.  I was trying to look from one corner of the house, and through the trees I could see what was being done, what was happening.
@MR. BESNIER:
But if the road could be seen, if the house could be seen from the road that means that you yourself could be seen.  So were you looking furtively or were you always in visual contact with the vehicles that you were talking about; that were on the road below?
@A.
I saw the scene until the time they left that place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you standing, were you crouched, or were you lying down in order for you to be looking at this incident?
@A.
I was standing up at the corner of the house, as I have showed you a moment ago from my desks, so that I could see who was on the other side.  And the same thing applied when I needed to look from the other corner, I had to go and move to that corner of the house.  People who needed to come to the place knew where the house was, and I think they came there as usual.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you hiding there alone behind this house or were you with others?
@A.
There was no one else with me.  The others had remained far behind in the woods, and they were not that many.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement, Mr. Witness, you claim to have seen Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and you also claim that you saw a carton of machetes, which was tied with a string.  Do you remember having made that kind of statement, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, I can confirm that.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, in the French, this statement appears on page 5 of the witness's statement, at paragraph 2, and in the English version the statement appears on page 4 of the witness statement, paragraph 6 of that page.  I do beg your pardon; it is paragraph 7, last but one paragraph on page 4.  The exact sentence is, "I saw a bundle of machetes tied together".  
$BY MR BESNIER:
@MR BESNIER:
Do you confirm having seen what was tying the bundles of machetes together from where you were, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I could not see the string very well, but as I saw it someone took the box, the carton, and it appeared clearly that it was a matter of string that one was trying to untie, but I didn't see the string all that clearly.
@MR BESNIER:
How many machetes were there?  Can you please remind me, Mr. Witness?  How many machetes were there in the carton?
@A.
I cannot confirm the number, but looking at the number of people who had received the machetes and who were brandishing them, I can give you an estimate of some 30 people, but I did not count the machetes one by one for me to be able to give you the exact number.
@MR BESNIER:
How long did Ndindabahizi Emmanuel stay there?
@A.
I told you that the time which elapsed was not more than 30 minutes.  In other words, he didn't stay there for very long.
@MR BESNIER:
Today before the Court, you repeated a number of words you claim were said by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  I am going to repeat those words that you, yourself, said today, and which you attributed to the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, allegedly said "Are there still Tutsis coming to Gitwa hill?  If no one else  -- if no one is leaving the bushes, we must implement our plan immediately.  You should not keep the weapons, you must use them".  
Do you recall having testified in similar terms?
@A.
Yes, I do confirm.
@MR BESNIER:
But in your written statement which was made before the investigators of the Tribunal you said, "I heard Emmanuel Ndindabahizi say to the people present; "Hurry up. You know what you need to do with these weapons".  It's much shorter and very different, Mr. Witness, isn't it?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may I interject.  Counsel has not read the full statement which he has attributed to the Accused on this statement.  He just read half way.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution is right there, Defence.  So if you want to put this to the witness you must read all the quotes in that paragraph.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, you are quite right, Mr. President.  I will complete my question.  I was just referring to  -- I quoted the sentence in inverted commas.
$BY MR. BESNIER: 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, in your written statement, Mr. Ndindabahizi allegedly asked a question as to whether there was still Tutsis fleeing towards Gitwa hill, but you didn't in your written statement refer to any plan.  Do you remember that sentence later on?
@A.
I would like to answer you.  You know, you can understand quite a lot of things when you speak in Kinyarwanda.  I suppose the same applies to French, but in fact, he told them that they needed to use their weapons.  There's no really difference from what I said today.  Maybe there's one or two words which are different, but the meaning remains the same.  I do not see why you would ask me that question.  Please understand that it's the same meaning, the main -- the same significance.
$Pages 52 to 58 by Judith Kapatamoyo)
1905H 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
In fact, the meaning of my question was that you had heard Emmanuel Ndindabahizi speaking at length and said many words.  So, I'm wondering whether you were sure that from where you were hiding you heard all that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi said. 
@A.
The words I referred to here, I heard.  If I were to speak at length about what he had said, I could give you more details.  You understand, yourself, that that would be dwelling on a situation which is quite clear and obvious.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would need another 30 minutes, Mr. President.  May I continue?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it's better to listen to those 30 minutes tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we leave, now this Witness CGY has given two statements and there is also one document in this bundle connected to that witness but prepared by investigators.  
Now, if you look at that second document, that one in between the statement of 2001 and the statement of 1999, there is then this investigator document and that contains photographs, 
Mr. Kapaya.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This is on page 12 of that document; page 12, 13 and 14.  They are not very easy to read and I'm not quite sure that those photographs have actually been included in the green bundle.  I think not. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
They are not included in the green bundle, Your Honour.  And actually, I obtained the original photographs from the Evidence Unit.  They, too, are in black and white.  They are just as unclear as the others, so I couldn't file them to the witness.  Actually, the witness could not even identify them.  I wonder if I should pass them over to you, too.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could just -- having listened to the testimony, I think it could be interesting to read or to look a bit closer at this document on page 13, if you have the more legible copy which you could distribute tomorrow morning, I think that could be helpful.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Page 13, Your Honour?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It's actually K0262356, I think, but it's a handwritten little page 13 at the bottom there, as you will see.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may I get the K-numbers perhaps?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Shall we first find this sketch location where the roadblock was there and the witness saw the target?  Do you have that one?
@MR. KAPAYA:
That one is on P2, Your Honour; P2, the exhibits bundle.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I am in your main bundle, the white one, where all the witness statements are.  And you would find it in between the '99 statement and the 2001 statement.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, I have seen that one.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very good.  Now, the sketch seems to be on something called page 79, if we use that one, and then starts the photographs on page 80.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, these photographs.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Which is on K532, the last K-number.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two versions of these photographs: one, the English version and one maybe in the French.  Anyhow, you will see that there are three pages with photographs in these documents coming from the investigators.  If we could only have a clearer copy of those, please, if you don't have the original.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I have the originals here, Your Honour, with me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  If you could make that available to the Court when you start at 2 o'clock tomorrow morning -- tomorrow afternoon.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I'll endeavour to do that, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And show it to the Defence in connection with the cross-examination.  Thank you very much.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then continue tomorrow with this witness.  The next witness, is that a long witness, Prosecution? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, we have three witnesses left.  CGF and CGE, I propose to take both of them tomorrow, if 
Your Lordship pleases.  There's no reason why I can't have both of them tomorrow.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@CGF and CGE, leaving CGX for Wednesday, and she is a remarkably short witness so we will be finished by 5 o'clock on Wednesday for this week.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so we know that, that we may be hearing the rest of this witness plus two more, tomorrow. 
Mr. Witness, this is the end of today.  We will continue with your testimony tomorrow afternoon again for about 30 minutes by the Defence.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, to summarise some of the statements that we went through yesterday, will it be correct to say that you left Karongi on 20th April 1994, and that you hid yourself in a bush between the 20th and the 26th of April with your wife and your children?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
And on 23rd April you observed a distribution of weapons by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there an attack immediately after the departure of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on that 23rd of April 1994?
@A.
On that day there was no attack.
@MR. BESNIER:
The following day, which was 24th of April, was there an attack against the people who were taking refuge on Gitwa?
@A.
Yes, an attack which was not large scale was launched on that day.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did that attack occasion victims on the part of the refugees?
@A.
Yes, people were killed, but there were not many.
@MR. BESNIER:
How were they killed?
@A.
They were killed with clubs and machetes because at that stage the attackers were not carrying guns.
@MR. BESNIER:
The following day, 25th April 1994, was there another attack?
@A.
Yes, there was another attack, not large scale, such that that attack was not successful from the standpoint of the attackers.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement you stated that this attack made victims among the Tutsis, but also among the attackers; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell the Court how the attackers were killed by the people?
@A.
The people came in a group and when they got close to the refugees on the hill -- when they were getting close, the refugees went to meet them.  There was a combat and since the attackers were few they went back, such that there were attackers who were killed during the fighting and, obviously, there were victims on the part of the people as well, the people attacked.
@MR. BESNIER:
What weapons were used by the Tutsis against the attackers?
@A.
The Tutsis also used traditional weapons which were available to them.  You know, when we were fleeing, those who had machetes carried them along.  In Kinyarwanda (sic), it is normal that when you have a weapon and you feel that you are in danger you protect yourself with that weapon.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can we say that a large number of farmers who were all Tutsis also had machetes?
@A.
Yes, in Rwanda normally, be they Hutu, Tutsi or the Twa, the people had implements, normally machetes which they used to work on their farms.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  The 26th April 1994, there was an attack -- you witnessed an attack which was on a larger scale; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to describe in a few words the intensity of this attack?
@A.
Yes, this was a large-scale attack.  The attackers came from all sides and they came in great numbers.  They were wearing banana leaves and they were carrying clubs and machetes.  The attack was large scale and the attackers came from all sides of the hill, and they were very determined.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there a large number of victims among the Tutsi?
@A.
Yes.  It is not easy.  I don't know what terms to use to describe the number of people killed.  A lot of families were disseminated (sic), families numbering about 30 were completely disseminated.  There were few survivors after that attack.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the attackers have guns or other firearms?
@A.
Most of the attackers had traditional weapons.  A small number of the attackers were carrying grenades and firearms and, among the attackers, there were civilians who had been trained in -- who had had weapon training and training in the use of grenades.
@MR. BESNIER:
If I should refer to one of your previous answers, you stated that on 23rd April there were fewer victims because the attackers did not have guns as yet.  Am I to understand that guns were made available to the attackers between the 23rd and 26th of April?
@A.
I told you that there was no attack on the 23rd, that however on the 24th and 25th there were attacks; but I told you that there was no attack on the 23rd.  Regarding firearms which were distributed on that day, I stated that weapons were distributed previously and secretly, but not on the day of the attack.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you know by whom and when these firearms were distributed?
@A.
I cannot give you the details.  That was done secretly, but what makes me say that is that, among the attackers, some of them were in military uniform.  That is one.  Two, we do know that they were civilians in military uniform and, secondly, when the security situation worsened we heard explosions, such that -- which meant that there was a prior distribution of firearms and that there were instructions to that effect --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, can counsel wait for the interpretation before coming in?
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
-- but that on the 26th April 1994 firearms were used?
@A.
Yes, firearms were used.  There was another attack that I referred to, that of the 18th, and that attack was led by one Musema, a former director of the Gisovu factory.  The attackers tried attacking us, but they did not succeed.  I thought to myself that they were trying to gauge the force -- the strength of the refugees and then, subsequently, there was a large-scale attack which I spoke about.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please remember the pause, s'il vous plaît.  Please remember the pause between the question and the answer.  The interpreters are having a little problem here.
@MR. BESNIER:
I'll do that, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You have just mentioned Mr. Musema, Mr. Witness.  You were a Prosecution witness in the Musema case; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, indeed, I was in that trial.
@MR. BESNIER:
And, indeed, you testified against Musema, 30th of April 1999; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on with the Musema bit, can you repeat, Mr. Witness, the date on which Mr. Musema led the attack, the date?
@THE WITNESS:
The first attack was on the 18th of April; that was when he led an attack.  I recall that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that the only attack led by Mr. Musema, on the 18th of April?
@THE WITNESS:
No.  He came back during the large-scale attack on the 26th of April, which I referred to earlier.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have a question, and only one, to put to the witness in respect of his testimony in the Musema case.  I believe the registry can make available to the Judges the witness's testimony during the Musema case.  You already have the statement.  I'm going to use the English statement, and the Bench and the Office of the Prosecutor are English speaking.  I also requested that copies be made available to the -- copies of the transcripts be made available to the interpreters.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you read English?
@A.
No.
@MR. BESNIER:
Therefore, I'm going to read your testimony, with the agreement of the Office of the Prosecutor and the Bench; page 43 of the transcript of 30th of April 1999 in the Musema case, page 43, line 10.
@MR. BESNIER:
The witness was being examined by one Mr. Phillips.
Mr. President, I'm going to have to read the questions in English.  Please bear with me with my English accent.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
"You were saying that you had left on the 20th -- you had left your previous hiding place on the 20th of April.  Why did you leave that place?"
Answer: "It is because a friend I was living with wanted me, given the fact that those he'd asked to come and help him did not know me and they could kill me."
Question by the Prosecutor: "Maybe I can clarify that for you.  Would I be correct in saying that the friend that you were staying with at Karongi had asked for some reinforcements and before the reinforcement arrived you thought it sensible that you left because the others would not sanction you being there; is that correct?"
You answered: "He told me to leave because he could not stay there alone because those with whom he was working had gone to another place."
Question: "Therefore, you were alone there?"
Answer: "I was there with my family and no one else."
Let us pause at this stage.  Witness, did you understand what I have just read to you?
@A.
Yes, I understood.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would like to continue for a while. 
The next question was: "Did you feel abandoned; is that what you mean to say?" 
Answer: "Abandoned by whom?"
Question by the President: "By your friend."
Answer: "It was a way of helping me because the reinforcement he had asked for, if those people had arrived, he would not have confidence in them.  So it was a way of helping me."
Question by the President: "I see.  Thank you."
Question by Mr. Phillips: "And would I be correct in saying that you left that place and sought refuge in the bush with your family; is that correct?"
Answer: "Yes."
Another question: "Whilst you were in bush did you witness another attack?"
Answer by the witness: "There were no other attacks."
Now, then, Witness, you have just said that there was an attack and there were victims among people on the 24th of April, and you also said that another attack made victims not only among the people but also among the attackers on the 25th April; whereas, in the Musema case you testified that there was no attack before the 26th of April.  Are you able to explain whether or not the attacks of the 24th and 25th April actually existed?
@A.
I can explain that if I am given the opportunity.  I believe I explained extensively these attacks.  To start with, you made reference to the time when the people working with my friend left.  In fact, they were involved in looting, but I don't want to go into that.  If they left, it was because they -- that was in their interests.  When my friend realised that he was alone and that rumours had been circulated to the effect that the refugees were preparing to take over the Karongi antenna, questions were put to him in that respect, and he answered that he was not with anyone, and at that stage they wanted to give him military reinforcement but, given the circumstances, I do not think that soldiers were going to save me.  And I can't say anything about that.
So, as I said, there were smaller scale attacks which took place.  So, when you say there is a contradiction in my testimony, I made reference to an attack which took place on the 18th and other small-scale attacks.  And I don't know if you made reference to the attack of the 18th.
@MR. BESNIER:
The attacks which took place on the 24th and 25th April -- you clearly answered in the Musema case that there was no attack before the 26th April, and I wanted your explanation on this point.  That is all.
@A.
What I can say is that the person who recorded my testimony, if he said I said nothing on this, it's because my testimony was not properly recorded.  I recall yesterday when I said that the French came in May -- you said I said that the French came in May, but that was not what I said.  I said that they came probably after the 26th of the month of May.  But I did not have the opportunity to check these documents.  So I am just giving an example of what could have happened in that case.
There is a line which you pointed out to me where you said that I said that the French saved me in May.  That also reminds me of that passage because, as we all know, the French were not yet in the country in May.  That mistake is contained in that document, so I will give the same explanation regarding the -- the same explanation as I gave in respect of the mistake we met yesterday.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, Defence believes that there is, nonetheless, a contradiction in the testimony that was given in the Musema case and the testimony as given yesterday.
@MR. BESNIER:
And I will have to enter the transcripts as exhibits in each pages 43 to 45, the witness -- transcript of the witness's testimony of 30th April 1999.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's then admitted as D7, I think.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, wouldn't it --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is whether it is sufficient with these three pages or whether we need to see it in context.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That's what I wanted to speak on, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Because there is a question.  The witness was also closely examined on this very issue, on the question of attacks by Mr. K, in the course of the proceedings, so I thought it was better that the entire proceedings -- the entire evidence of this witness in the Musema case could be entered as an exhibit.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have no problems with that because we did that with a previous Defence exhibit, a transcript.  So you have kindly copied the entire bundle.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, very well.  I must say, Mr. President -- in that case, I would like the entire transcripts to be entered as an exhibit.

Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, now, let's come back to Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Would you say that Mr. Ndindabahizi played an important role in the genocide perpetrated in Kibuye?
@A.
I can say that he played an important role because when a leader carries out a distribution of weapons and issues orders, he does not have to use these weapons personally; but if you understand very well the concept of responsibility, then you will understand that he played an important role in the genocide.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you remember that you mentioned the name of Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi to -- in reference to his role in the genocide either before this Court, or before the investigators of this Tribunal, or before the Rwandan authorities before your statement of 10th May 2001?
@A.
To date, in all the cases, be they the people who worked together with him or those who got the weapons -- there are a lot of them; some of them in prison, some have not been tried yet -- to date, I have not had any problem of anyone in my country; for example, if you contacted the court of first instance, you'd understand -- you would find out that I have not been involved in any case.  Before this court somebody was brought -- was accused -- was brought before this court and I was called upon to testify, but I have not testified in any other case in the Rwandan judicial system in relation to the events that -- or the genocidal events that occurred.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let me clarify my question: why did you have to wait for seven years to talk about serious events accusing the former minister, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, whom you referred to as a senior officer of Kibuye?
@A.
In return, I would like to put a question to you, you, as a lawyer.  Before you appeared before this Court you never came here to assist him in his defence, since he was not present to talk about  -- to talk about charges against him would be a vain exercise.
@MR. BESNIER:
In Rwanda, is it not the duty of a good citizen to denounce the activities of an offender?
@A.
How can you contact that judicial system when you have not been requested to do so?  For example, if I were not called upon to testify in this Court, I would not have done so.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you never interviewed by the prosecutor general, Mr. Gahima?
@A.
No, he did not interview me in that respect.  You can contact him and if you find out that I testified in respect of that person, then I'll agree that I am a liar.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A pause please, Mr. President.  I guess it's a repeat of the previous question.
@THE WITNESS:
Regarding Gérard Gahima, he came and put questions relating to some individual, but that had nothing to do with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  You can contact Mr. Gérard Gahima and if I said anything -- and if he said I said anything in respect of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, that would be a lie.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, the question now, Mr. Witness, is the following: have you ever been interviewed by Mr. Gahima?  Leaving aside the subject matter, have you ever been interviewed by him; yes or no?
@THE WITNESS:
Gahima never interviewed me on any issue whatsoever.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President (sic), I thought you said a while ago that Mr. Gahima interviewed you with regard to a certain individual.
@A.
I accept that Mr. Gahima came to Kibuye.  But he never put any questions to me.  He came to the office of the prosecutor.  The office of the prosecutor summoned all of us.  We were many and we had to talk about one individual who had nothing -- who is not linked to this case before this Court.  It's a matter relating to people in Kibuye.  I was interviewed by an assistant prosecutor of the court of first instance in Kibuye.  I was, therefore, not interviewed by Gérard Gahima.  At that time Gérard Gahima was visiting the office of the prosecutor and he had reason to visit the office of the prosecutor, but I was not summoned by Gahima and those who were with me were also not summoned by Gahima.  It was the office of the prosecutor which summoned us.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I have had my answer, Mr. President.
Another question and, in fact, I have six more questions, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, does it not appear strange to you that a minister, like Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, specifically came to Gitesi with soldiers to distribute weapons to people who already had some?  Would he not rather distribute firearms?
@A.
That is not a problem, in my opinion.  Let me explain the situation to you.  He said he came to distribute some machetes, but I spoke about a box of military uniforms which had to be distributed.  Possibly -- it's even possible that guns were there and that they were waiting to be distributed, but they were members of the population with guns; so how did they get the guns?  So to say that he came to distribute just machetes is not surprising.  What we should focus on is that he did something and that led to certain consequences.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, at the beginning of your testimony to your -- to the Prosecutor you said something in respect of knowing Mr. Ndindabahizi before the war, and you said something to the effect that he studied in Kirambo in '68 or '69; or was it, rather, you who studied in '68, '69?  Can you clarify this issue?
@A.
Let me repeat my answer, just in case you did not understand.  I did say that I knew him when he used to come on holidays as a secondary school student.  In '68, '69, I was a student at Kirambo school which is neighbouring to his residence.  But ask him if at the time the Kirambo school was not close to his residence.  If he tells you the contrary, then you can say I am lying.
@MR. BESNIER:
Another clarification which I need: you have made reference to PSD rallies, the social democratic party.  Can you say where and when these meetings took place -- these rallies took place?
@A.
Normally, all the rallies took place in the building which is called the MRND palace.  It's a building that belonged to the préfecture, but now it's a building that is currently referred to as an all-purpose hall.  The rallies normally took place on Sundays because the people were normally available on Sundays.
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you ever attended any of these rallies?
@A.
No, I did not want to be a member of any political party for personal reasons so I never attended any political rally.
@MR. BESNIER:
You also said that Mr. Ndindabahizi was an influential political figure at the national level.  What did you mean by that?
@A.
By that, I meant that at the national level he was an important politician but, in fact, I was talking in relation to our préfecture.  He was an important leader within the PSD, such that at the national level he was like a representative of our region.  Currently, we talk about regions, but in those days we used to talk about préfectures.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.
Now I move on to my very last line of questioning.  I'm going to read a portion of your written statement to the investigators to you in relation to how you met Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  In the English version, it's a document K0181025 -- 0181525; that is, pages -- page 3 of the witness statement, paragraphs 2 and 3, and in the French version K0262326.  Are you following, Witness?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
You say: "I know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi well.  I'm sure I can still recognise him today.  We are natives of the same secteur, Gitesi.  I remember that since 1992 Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, came and held public meetings in his cellule at the ... centre." -- I don't want to mention the name of the centre so as not to reveal your identity.  "I did not attend these meetings, but afterwards people told me what they had been told.  I was always at my work at (By order of the Court these words have been extracted and kept under seal) in Kibuye town and I was not a member of a political party".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Besnier, it was very good that you didn't read the centre, but was not so good that you referred to the office.  So we have to strike the reference to the office in both the video system and in the transcripts.  That element will be put under seal then.  So, the transcripts will read, "I was always at my work place in Kibuye town", and then it goes on.  Please proceed.
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm sorry about that, Mr. President.  It just escaped me.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
"... and I was not a member of a political party.  Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, was an influential member of PSD.  The purpose of these meetings was to promote PSD and many people joined PSD, leaving other parties, including MRND."
Last paragraph --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President; we are lost.
Okay.  "I remember having seen Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, before the war around the end of 1993 on the road towards the guesthouse in Kibuye after a meeting in the conference room of the Kibuye préfecture office.  After the meeting he took a round in Kibuye town to greet and wave to his supporters from a car, and at the time I saw him for the first time."
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
If I believe you, Mr. Witness, you are saying that you saw Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi once come to greet his supporters; is that correct?
@A.
Continue, Counsel.  I understand you and I'm going to give you explanation after your question.
@MR. BESNIER:
On the last bit of the sentence which I read to you, "it was the first time I saw him", I understand from that that that was the first time that you were seeing him when he came to greet and wave at his supporters, and that was around the end of 1993.
@A.
Yes, I understand what you are saying, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Then answer the question.
@A.
I'm going to answer.  When he came to hold the meeting, he went round in a vehicle.  He went round the town greeting people, shaking people's hands.  I told you that he used to get out of his vehicle to shake hands with the people.  But regarding the lower class, he would normally wave to them from his vehicle, but to greet people of higher classes he would get out of his car to shake their hands.  I think I explained that to you already.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, this will be my last question.  I would like to give the witness a piece of paper with two names, and I would like to know if the witness has any family ties with these two people.
Registry, can you show these names to the Court, to the Office of the Prosecutor and then to the witness? 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know the names of the persons whose names you are seeing on the two pieces of paper you have before you, Mr. Witness?

I know one of these people only, and even the person whose name I recognise is not related to me at all; we are not even neighbours, but I do know the person.  I'm going to mark the paper on which the name of the person I know is -- I recognise, with a letter "V", and the other name, I'll mark with a question mark.

Your Honour, yes; just two questions, Your Honours.
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, you testified to me that the attack occurred on the 26th of April and before.  Now, what makes you recall that particular date?
@A.
I remember this date.  It's a date which I'll never, ever forget in my whole life.  I will remember it until I die.  I saw unnameable things which I had never, ever seen in my life; people who were attacking small children, babies, pregnant women, everyone, anybody, old men.  These are unnameable things which I will never, ever forget.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, can you now -- in relation to that particular attack, can you tell us how many days, approximately, was it before you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I'm going to give you a simple example.  I'm using the date of the 26th -- in other words, the last day, the day which I have said I will never, ever forget -- because there were thousands of people who died and these people were innocent people.  So, let me begin with the 26th on which there was a large-scale attack.  On the 25th -- in other words, before the 26th -- there was a surprise attack and on the 24th there was a smaller-scale attack.  On the 23rd that was the day of the distribution of the material.  I will stop there but, if you will, I can repeat the answer I have just given, if that's not a waste of time for you.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That will suffice for the purposes of my question.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I have before you the three photographs which you requested to be provided with.  Now, can I -- I wonder whether I can ask the witness to clarify on some these.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are quite right, Mr. Besnier.  In fact, it was me who raised that at the end of the last session.  So, I think the correct procedure would then be that I ask these questions to the witness as questions from the Bench.  So, we will handle this, Mr. Kapaya, unless you want an exception from the               cross-examination.
@MR. KAPAYA:
As it pleases, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  Do you have any other questions, please?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, my actual --  my last questions are focused on these three photographs.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  
Now, Mr. Witness, we have now been provided with -- thank you very much, Prosecution.  We have now been provided with three photographs which are in our bundle, but these are more easy to read.  
If the registry could show this witness page 10 -- no, page 11; please use page 11, registry.  
Now, do you recognise this place, Mr. Witness?  Have you seen this photograph before?
@THE WITNESS:
These photographs have not been shown to me before today.  But the answer that I can give in terms of what these pictures relate -- and I'm not doubtful at all about what I am going to say.  I'm going to give you as much explanation as I can on these photographs.  
I can see a place, which I believe I recognise quite well.  It is a place at which there is a kind of road, and towards the top I see a stable where cattle were kept.  I can see trees; I think this is the forest and the house where I was.  You can see pillars above the road, and a kind of mount.  I went to this location with investigators, and the only thing I mentioned is that that is where I was hiding, but the house had been destroyed.  We had been waiting for assistance to get the house rebuilt.  And since we didn't get that, we were using these poles or these pillars as firewood.  
That is where I was.  And I think from there I can see the road.  I can see my signature below.  And I see the figure K0181533 on this sheet of paper.  I, therefore, believe that I'm not wrong, and that this is the photograph about which you are asking me questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a pen in front of you?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do, but I do not have any paper.  I would like to be given a piece of paper, please.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, would you be able to mark on this photo where the house was; where, according to you, you were hiding -- you said that the house had disappeared -- could you indicate?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can indicate where the house once stood.  I have marked that location with the letter "V" for Victor.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you, very much.  If that could then be -- 
@THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  If that could just be passed around, and I think we will mark it as Chamber Exhibit 1.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, can it also be put on the projector for all to see?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is possible.  Can you do that please?
If there are no more questions from the Prosecution, just for the record, I note that the parties have not requested that the written statements of this witness, or any other witness for that matter, be placed automatically before the Chamber as an exhibit.  So, for instance, these three documents relating to this witness have not been exhibited.  
But in view of the fact that reference was made to a particular month when the French came in one of the statements, namely, the statement of 2001, that was the point mentioned by you, Mr. Kapaya, and it was also briefly mentioned during cross-examination, I think just to put it on record that I noted that in the witness statements dated the 13th of January 1999, where there is also a reference in the last sentence concerning the witness rescued by French soldiers, and there I note that the witness says, "I continued to hide from the attackers until I was rescued on the 11th of July by French soldiers, who took us to a certain camp".  It is not very important matter, but I just thought that the record should reflect this. 
Mr. Witness, the Gitwa hill you were hiding during this period, in what commune was it?
@THE WITNESS:
Well, with regard to the commune, I was still in our commune of Gitesi in the hills which are near the place where I lived, in the secteur which neighbours the place where I live.  Gitwa was a place where one couldn't really hide.  It was almost a desert like place, and one could find dead bodies there and heads of victims.  
There had been many killings there, and as people were being killed their bodies decomposed, and the attackers continued to loot and to rejoice about their work.  But some attackers were also -- were still on the lookout and would go into the bushes to look for any possible survivors, and sometimes, they did find survivors.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you very much.  This will then bring your testimony to an end, Mr. Witness.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, I would like to pursue the other two photographs for purposes of identity by the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
@MR. KAPAYA:
May I now refer the witness to photograph No. 10, on page 10?
@THE WITNESS:
I can see the photograph. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, no we think that we have to stick to this procedure here, and since this was not raised, we tend to think that the last question has been asked, unless you have a very convincing explanation why you should follow up this, because we did not asked any questions concerning the other two paragraphs.  I just wanted to raise one particular issue concerning the observation place of the witness; that is why I thought that was relevant.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  And as far a Rule 85(B) is concerned, having raised that question, my learned friend is well entitled to follow up on it, if he considers it prejudicial to his case.  That is the whole point that I raised the other day about Rule 85(B), and whilst Your Honours can ask questions, it cannot compromise my case.  And if he, in his professional opinion, deems it to be so, he has a right to explore that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but this cannot -- how can you possibly say that this compromised or was prejudicial to his case, because it --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, Your Honour --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, what happened is simply that I wanted to see something which was in the Prosecution's bundle, namely, this document.  And I just wanted to know whether the witness was able to say where he was positioned when he made his observation.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Having invited the witness to comment on a document of any sort, Your Honour, it then forms part of the Prosecutions case. And, indeed, I can argue either way that it compromises my case.  As long as you have invited comment from a Prosecution witness, it then impacts directly on our case.  That is my respectful submission.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is your respectful submission even if this were only -- even if the question only related to one paragraph, as of one page and not the two other pages.  What is your comment on that?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, there is a distinction between seeking for clarification on a matter that has been raised by either party.  And there certainly is clearly a different matter for the Trial Chamber and, indeed, the Bench to raise an issue entirely on its own; they are two separate matters.  
And the impression I get from the proceedings yesterday and today, was that this matter was not directly confronted by any of the parties.  Instead, it was raised by the Bench; having been raised by the Bench, we then have a right to address the issue.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Try to relax a little bit now.  This is not a very dramatic thing, we are listening.  So, I take note of your submission and we will hear the other side.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, what is your view, then?
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I believe that I had formulated an objection a moment ago, and the Tribunal did not admit my objection.  And I think the Tribunal accepted that these photographs could not be presented by the Prosecution as evidence, and I think we should stop there, and stick to the ruling which had earlier been made by the Chamber.  
Thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a little moment to deliberate
All three Judges are of the opinion that we will enter, then, this document on which I raised a question as Chamber Exhibit 1.  And that was the question which will be raised in addition to this witness. 
So, Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  And we thank you for having come forward to the Tribunal here in Arusha, and wish you a safe journey home.  Please, do not discuss your testimony with anyone. 
$Chamber Exhibit No. 1 admitted)
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you want to speak.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I wish to say something, I will be very brief.  I thank you very much, Mr. President.  But I have some concerns which I want to express to you, Mr. President.  And they are the following:  My concerns in the conclusion of the presentation of my testimony, you have asked me to not share this with anyone.  When a secret is divulged, it no longer remains a secret.  I wish to tell you one thing.  You do your job very well, but you know there can be obstacles which may be of hindrance to us as witnesses, but which may not be evident to you as Judges.  We, who are outside of this Chambers, we have problems.  I'll give you a few concrete examples.  
Defence counsel stated that I had said that there was no attack, and I answered that my statement was not well taken down, because I gave as an example the place in my written statement where I had -- where there was mention made of French being in Rwanda in May, whereas the French was not there then, that is something that was well-known.  Yet in my statement, it was stated that they were there in May, but I will not come back to that.  
What I wish really to say is this:  Delegates from the Tribunal called us to the town, and they met us at -- on the veranda of the office of the mayor of the commune.  Everyone was present at the mayor's office, and they could see what we were doing.  I think this should be corrected, because it is a procedure which may bring about insecurity on our part.  This is done on a determined date.  I can mention the date to you.  I will not mention the names of the individuals involved, but these are persons who have committed a mistake; a mistake which has arisen in the proceedings.  
I wish to also raise another point.  Someone came, and he said that he was part of the Ndindabahizi Defence team.  I have proof of what I am saying.  He was looking for Defence witnesses.  You know that in a trial there are Prosecution witnesses and Defence witnesses, and it depends on what one knows about the Accused.  So this person came, and I don't know whether in the Rules of the Tribunal this is allowed; in other words, it is the Prosecutor who contacts us; does he have the right to go and contact Defence witnesses in the Ndindabahizi case?  What I'm telling you about did happen, and I have the evidence; I was not the only person contacted, there were other friends who were also contacted. 
I have another issue to raise within the framework of our security and safety.  You say that everything should be done in confidentiality, and you ask us to speak the truth and not to be indirect in what we say.  But when we are not indirect in what we say, there is no longer confidentiality; there is no secret.  So if Defence counsel for Ndindabahizi tells me that I didn't mention this or that, if I answer him, he doesn't keep these answers to himself.  This is information which I am providing which goes out and cannot be held back again.  This is what I wanted to say, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I thank you. 
The name of the organisation for which I was working, and the time during which I was working there, and people will understand who the witness is.  I think since he mentioned this, he is putting me in a difficult situation, and yet he is a lawyer himself.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for raising these issues.  When it comes to the first matter, namely, whether it was easy to observe some of you at your place of origin, that is something that the Prosecutor is looking into whether there was a mistake or not.  We heard that previously in the courtroom.  And I understand that the laws in connection with the witness protection unit make sure that things like that do not happen.  
As to the second question, whether the Ndindabahizi Defence team or certain representatives for that team have contacted you, I note what you are saying.  Please address your concerns to the witness protection unit.  Could you just indicate when this episode took place, Mr. Witness, according to your recollection?
@THE WITNESS:
I think I know the date.  I had mentioned it on a piece of paper, but when I was to travel, I was a bit in a hurry and I wasn't able to find the piece of paper again.  I wasn't alone; I think this affects at least three witnesses.  There was a witness who was called, he was far away, and he was transported on a vehicle.  But I was close by, and another witness was also very close and was working close to that place. So these are three people.  
And I think that these three people are going to be mentioning this matter to you.  So we shall give you the date.  I do not know the person who came to contact us.  But the person who contacted me to meet this other person at a given place, I wouldn't say it is an office, I'm not going to mention the place, but let's say that it was a place where there was a bar.  
I know the person who asked me to go to that location.  So I'm requesting that you follow this matter up closely, because if there were ever to be any problem, these people should be held responsible, or they should be made accountable.  And that the person who was looking for us should be known -- should be known.  We need to know who was looking for us.  
I know this person physically, but I do not know his name.  But the one who came to me, the one who was the intermediary, the go-between, who made us meet the other person, I know that person very well and I know that person 100 per cent.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, Mr. Witness, rest assure that this is being followed up.  Whenever such allegations are made, we are following them up.  And I can assure you that in this particular case, I have already been in touch with the witness protection unit to investigate the matter, because similar allegations have been made by other witnesses.  
So rest assure, and if you would kindly provide specific information about this to witness protection unit.  When it now comes to your third point, then it is true that there was a slip of the tongue here in this session, today, but that was obviously inadvertent, counsel excused himself, and the information was placed under seal and delete from the record of the Court video system.  So you can be confident that this information will not be disseminated.  
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  And we wish you a safe journey home.  
And if the registry could kindly accompany the witness out of the courtroom, after having drawn the curtains, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
I thank you.

testified as follows:
$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Actually, Your Honour, I hadn't considered the nature of this witness's testimony.  In that regard, I would invite Your Honours to look at pages 96 -- I take that back.  Look at -- yes, if you look at pages 96 through 101, it becomes terribly apparently that this nature and, indeed, the nature of his testimony has a great bearing on his area of residence presently.  I'm more worried about his present location than I am about his location in 1994.  
The witness still resides in that location.  And that location forms the essence -- the essence -- the very essence of his testimony.  And whilst I make the application for this particular witness, it is going to be the same for the one that comes after him as well.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you just -- we have page 96 in front of us, now.  Could you just indicate the paragraph where it is particularly transparent?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, if I refer you to page 96 itself, to paragraph seven where it says addresses as the starting point.  Aside from the place of birth, Your Honours, look at the current residence and glance across to the residence in April of 1994.  It then becomes apparent that the witness hasn't moved and that cellule also has some bearing with the Accused person.  
So you see, he talks about events in that location, it is the location where he still resides.  He has to mention people who also still reside in that location.  And it then becomes very obvious who he is.  And then I also invite Your Honours to look at paragraph five, which details his ethnic group, increases the likelihood of repercussions following his testimony, Your Honour.  
A follow-up question which I know is perhaps on Your Honour's lips is, how much of this testimony am I seeking to exclude.  The honest answer is all, because I fear -- I fear to delve into matters that may eventually, unconsciously, either by virtue of his replies or my state of excited ness reveal his identity.  
So I regret that I'm going to have to ask for the entirety of his testimony to be excluded.  And I do that under the provision of Rule 79(A), little two, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comments, Defence?
@MR. BESNIER:
No objections, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I have glanced through the testimony, now, and in light of what you have just said --
@THE WITNESS:
$No translation)
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is asking the interpreter to speak up because he has problems with his hearing.  The witness is asking for the volume on his headsets to be increased because he has problems with hearing, he is a bit hard of hearing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, but what we were about to say here was that having looked at the statement, and in view of the submissions by the OTP, it is clear that the safest is to decide to hear this witness in a closed session, because the combination of the elements may, very well, reveal his identity.  
So I'm sorry to ask the audience, kindly, to leave the public gallery during this witness' testimony.  This is exceptional; usually we hear it in open session, but we have to be sure that nothing happens to our witnesses.  
Thank you very much, indeed.

Thank you.  Prosecutor, please. 
Yes, Mr. Witness, do you have anything to communicate? 
@THE WITNESS:
What I wanted to say is that I want to testify in closed session so as to ensure my security. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have noted that request and now the Prosecutor may wish to give the reasons for such a request. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Following on from the witness's comments, I seek to make an application pursuant to Rule 79(B) -- sorry, Rule 79(A)(ii) of the Rules of Procedure for an in camera session in relation to the testimony of Witness CGE.  The basis of that request is to protect this witness's identity, consequently his security, to ensure his security following his testimony in this courtroom.  
I did point out yesterday in relation to my motion concerning the previous witness, CGF, that I would be making a similar request in relation to this witness and indeed the one that comes after this witness. 
The essence of the application is that the witness still resides in the particular cellule where the events that he will be testifying about took place.  He resided there in 1994, I believe, and I believe he still does so now. 
In particular, can I refer Your Honours to page 103 of your bundle of witness statements and, in particular, to paragraph 7 of that page?  Therein you would see the current location where he resides and, indeed, the location where he resided in 1994 remains the same, and that has some bearing on the nature of his testimony because the events did take place in that locality and nowhere else.  In relation to how much of his testimony I am seeking to exclude, I'm afraid I would be seeking to exclude the entirety of his testimony, for the reasons that I have pointed out already. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the fact that someone is born in a particular place, residing there in '94 and also now is, of course, not in itself sufficient but I understand you, having listened to what you said also yesterday, that there is something in this little environment connected to the particular episode -
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- that he will be very easy to identify.
@MR. BESNIER:
I have no objection, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
(Interpreters' booth microphone on) ... so the decision is then made under the relevant Rule to close the proceedings and go on in an in camera session, and I regret to ask the audience in the public gallery, if any, to leave that gallery. 
Mr. Witness -- do the court reporters -- can you hear me?  I can't hear myself.  I think someone is having their mike on in the booth so that we can't hear even the English version

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You were studying there, and at the time what was the -- what was Mr. Ndindabahizi doing there? 
@A.
At that time, Ndindabahizi would come there often.  Furthermore, ************************************* 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you also know if Mr. Ndindabahizi himself had studied at that location? 
@A.
He would go by that centre, but he studied elsewhere. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How long ago was it that you used to see Mr. Ndindabahizi at that location?  Do you know the year?  Do you recall the year? 
@A.
I did my second year of primary school there, but that was a long time ago.  I cannot recall the year. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, between the time that you went to school at that location and the events of 1994, how many times had you seen Mr. Ndindabahizi before the events of 1994? 
@A.
The last time we saw one another was on that occasion; however, during the war I was able to recall what he looked like because when you've already seen someone, you can't forget him so fast. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you saying that the last time you saw him before the war was when you were a student at that institution, or did you see him after that? 
@A.
It was when I was studying at that centre, that institution.  But other times I would see him, for instance, at Trafipro, but I hadn't seen him from that time.  It was only later during the war that I saw him again.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What do you mean by Trafipro?  Do you know what Trafipro -- can you help us with what Trafipro stands for, please? 
@A.
This was a cooperative, and that is where the members of the population would obtain their supplies.  This would be in the form of coffee or other products.  That's where the members of the population obtained their supplies.  And I think that he was an official of that cooperative, the Trafipro, I believe. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you recall the year or years when you saw him at this place you describe as Trafipro? 
@A.
I do not remember the years because subsequently it was heard that he was a minister, but I do not remember much about that period.  Furthermore, apart from the fact I knew he was a minister, I cannot tell you specifically what his functions were. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was this before 1994 that you saw him at Trafipro? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was well before that year.  As for the year 1994 itself, he was a minister, but I do not know what portfolio he held. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So how many times do you think you saw him at Trafipro then, Mr. Witness?  Is it possible to indicate that? 
@THE WITNESS:
When someone is working, you cannot say how many times you have seen him.  I said that I went to seek provisions from there and I saw him, but I cannot remember how many times I did that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You saw him more than once; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
Each time I went to get my provisions at Trafipro, I would see him, but I wouldn't go there every day.  I would go there when I had the financial means to enable me to provide myself with provisions.  I have said that I didn't go there every day.  I went there only to get myself certain provisions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And approximately how old were you when you were at secondary school, Mr. Witness, approximately, your own age? 
@THE WITNESS:
When I saw him at the Trafipro, it would be on occasions when I was transporting my parents' coffee for that coffee to be sold.  At that point in time when I would see him there, I was still a young man. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
My question to you was, approximately what was your age when you attended secondary school. 
@THE WITNESS:
I did not go to secondary school.  I only went as far as the fourth year of primary school, and then afterwards I became a farmer, and I am still a farmer now.  I went as far as the fourth year of primary school.  I never went to secondary school, let me repeat. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the period when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi in the first instance, was that up to the fourth year of primary, is that so, or was it later? 
@THE WITNESS:
I was in my second year of primary school when I saw him, but then he was older than me, of course.  He was a young man then, and according to what people said, people I spoke with, they said that at that time -- he was in training at the time.  Subsequently, he worked at Trafipro, and he became a minister later on.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you were aware or you became aware of the death of the president sometime in April 1994? 
@A.
Yes, that's right.  That news was announced on the radio, and everyone was to remain at home following the death of the president of the republic.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did there come a time, Mr. Witness, when you and members of your family left your home to go elsewhere? 
@A.
The next day the war started.  Houses began to be burned and cattle were looted.  At that point in time my wife was able to take me to her parents' home, together with our children. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that your wife was a Hutu, was she not? 
@A.
It's true, my wife is Hutu, and we are still together today. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I'm going to have the registry hand you another piece of paper, and I want you to confirm that the address on there is indeed the address of your father-in-law or was his address in 1994. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Registry, can you assist me very quickly, please.  Can you show it to the Defence first, and then show it to the witness and bring it back to me.  Thank you.
If I can be of further assistance, Your Honours, it's -- in the English version of his statement, it's paragraph 4 on page 127 of the entire bundle.
Can you put on his microphone, please?  Don't --
@THE WITNESS:
That is the name of the place to which my wife took me.  That is the name of the secteur.  I think you can take back this piece of paper which I have here before me. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I seek to enter this as Prosecution Exhibit 14, being the name of the -- the name of the location of his father-in-law's residence in 1994.  Can I have copies made?  Thank you.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, did you remain at your father-in-law's residence throughout the month of -- the months of April, May, and June 1994, or did you leave that location at some stage? 
@A.
When the killers realised that they couldn't kill me because of the help of the family, they went to look for firearms.  As for myself, I escaped through a window and I went to stay in the bushes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you testified earlier that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi during the war.  Can you tell me when it was that you saw him during the war for the first time? 
@A.
As soon as I was in the bushes, I went into that house at night and my wife would give me food, and she was -- she would inform me about the areas which were supposed to be burnt down, so I had to leave those bushes.  So that means at one point in time I went to another secteur, given the fact that the Tutsis who were living there had been killed.
Approximately in the month of May, I hid near the bridge, but that must have been near the end of the month.  That person, Mr. Ndindabahizi, came to that roadblock, and he stopped there, and he spoke to Hassan Byiyingoma who was at the roadblock and had a grenade.  He asked that person, "Are you here alone?"  Hassani called to the others and said, "Here is Minister Ndindabahizi.  He has arrived."  Even those who were in the bar next door came to the roadblock.  He was in the middle of these people. 
There were vehicles.  The second vehicle was green, and it was on board that vehicle that were tools.  That's how Hassan Byiyingoma and one Mirasano and another named Abdullah took those machetes.  When they did that, he told them this:  "As for Tutsi women married to Hutus, have you killed them?"  And they replied in the negative.  He said then, "Kill them, because otherwise they will poison you."  That was the advice he gave them. 
And he went towards -- to the vehicle which was in front, I do not with which persons it was, and he continued towards Kibuye.  The members of the population shared out the machetes, and in the evening I left that place and went to hide elsewhere until my wife came to tell me that the French had arrived, and she took me to the French. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.
Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask that you be given a third piece of paper which contains the name and location of that bridge that you described, and I want you to confirm that that is indeed the location that you've just spoken about.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Registry, again, can I have your help.  Can you please show it to the Defence, the Judges, the witness, and bring it back to me.
If I can be of assistance to the Court whilst that is being passed around, I think it's the beginning of paragraph 6 of -- in paragraph 6 on page 127 of the English version of the statement. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is indeed the place, and the Accused knows the place. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Can I have it back?

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I now want to ask you specific questions as to what -- the events you've just narrated to the Court.  Do you understand that? 
@A.
No, I don't quite understand you.  I'm sorry, I didn't understand you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you just listen to my questions and just answer as best you can.  Thank you.
When was it that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at this roadblock near this bridge?  When was it, period, date? 
@A.
I do not recall the exact date, but it was towards the end of the month of May because roughly four to five weeks later the French military aircraft arrived in Rwanda, and my wife came and told me that it was the French who were looking for the survivors. 
In other words, Ndindabahizi came to the bridge towards the end of May and then went to Kibuye.  This was the time when practically everybody had been exterminated, and there were only Tutsi women who had married Hutu men. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  Now, you described the arrival of the French.  Now, can you help us with this?  Do you know which month the French had arrived in Kibuye?  Do you recall when they arrived? 
@A.
You know, when you live in the bush, you do not know how to keep track of the dates.  I was in hiding.  I was very dirty.  I was in dirty clothing, and I had a stench about me.  I think the French came four to five weeks later.  It's at that time that my wife told me that the French were looking for survivors.  If you calculate all this properly, you can deduce the date of the arrival of the French.  As for myself, given the circumstances, I wasn't able to know the date. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So in your mind, did the French arrive in Kibuye in the month of July or in the month of June?  That's, rather, what I asked you, Witness. 
@A.
It was in the first week of July.  Actually, it was between the last week of June and the first week of July.  I think you yourself can look for the date.  I really wasn't concerned about that at the time because I was concerned -- I was trying to survive, and so in those conditions one wouldn't be able to keep track of dates. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Something else that you mentioned, Mr. Witness, was that at the time most people had been exterminated and only Tutsi women married to Hutu men were still alive.  Now, can you expand on what you meant by that, please? 
@A.
He gave orders such that those women were to be killed.  That surprised me, of course, but Tutsi women who had married Hutu men were, at the time, killed by their own husbands.  That was something that actually happened.  There's a man known as --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has given a name. 
@THE WITNESS:
-- and that man killed his wife.  I didn't prepare this testimony; otherwise, I would have given you the names of other men who killed their wives. 
Can the Accused deny that one Gatwa did not kill his second wife with a machete?  Furthermore, it was the children of that second wife who had Gatwa arrested because he killed his wife with a machete.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, is it your testimony -- and I want a yes or no answer for this -- is it your testimony, 
Mr. Witness, that to your mind and as far as you were aware, Tutsi women married to Hutu men had not been killed in Kibuye before you saw Ndindabahizi at this bridge?  Is that what you're saying, or are you aware --
@A.
They had not yet been killed because their wives had defended -- their husbands had defended them.  But afterwards, after the Accused gave the order for them to be killed, they were killed.  He said these wives should not be -- these women should not be spared, that their husbands should kill them and marry Hutu women of their own blood. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, let's go back to the time frame.  Now, we're going back to the time when you saw the Accused at this bridge.  What time of day was it, Mr. Witness, at this period at the end of May?  What time of the day was it? 
@A.
It was at one o'clock, 1 p.m.  In fact, it was between noon and 1 p.m., and he was on the road to Kibuye. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, do you know the direction that he was coming from?  You say he was on the road to Kibuye.  Were you able to tell from which direction he had come on that day? 
@A.
He was coming from the road which comes from above there.  I don't know whether he was coming back from where his parents lived or from Kigali.  I saw him on board a vehicle, and all the vehicles belonged to them.  So, I do not know from where they were coming.  I saw him go towards Kibuye, and I wouldn't be able to tell you whether he was coming from Kigali or from his parents' home.  He is the one who can tell you that. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You talk about vehicles, Mr. Witness.  How many vehicles did you see arrive at that roadblock on this day at the end of May 1994? 
@A.
As for the vehicles that passed by that place, it is true that they were stopped at that location, and the vehicles which passed by were searched.  But his vehicle was not searched.  He stopped; he came down from the vehicle.  But the other vehicles were searched.  All the vehicles that passed there were searched by those who were at the roadblock, but his vehicle was not searched. 
He himself came down from the vehicle and gave his advice to those who were there, and then he went back into his vehicle and left. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many vehicles did you see arrive at the same time with Mr. Ndindabahizi, Mr. Witness?  Just give me the number, if you know. 
@A.
For the vehicles which came at the same time, there were two vehicles.  There were two white vehicles which were in front, in front of the lorry. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So --
@A.
In other words, there were other vehicles which were passing by there, but the vehicles which arrived at that same time were two.  I do not know how many people were in those vehicles because the other people did not come down from those vehicles. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness?  Mr. Witness, can you look at me?  I'm right here.  Can you look at me?  Mr. Witness, can you only respond to the particular question that I ask you, please?  You listen to the question that I ask you, look at me, and respond accordingly.  Can we do that?  Keep your answers nice and short.
Now, I'm going to ask you --
@A.
Very well. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- that question again:  How many vehicles did you see arrive when Mr. Ndindabahizi arrived, number of vehicles? 
@A.
When Ndindabahizi arrived, I saw two vehicles.  Obviously there were other vehicles which continued to pass, but that -- those were not linked to Ndindabahizi.  The vehicles linked to Ndindabahizi were two. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  You could have stopped at "two," that would have been fine for me.
Now, can you describe the first vehicle you saw him in, please, Mr. Witness?  What type of vehicle was the vehicle you -- the vehicle you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi in, let's talk about that vehicle.  Do you know what type of vehicle that vehicle was? 
@A.
It was a beautiful car, but I do not know the model or type of vehicle it was.  It was a white car.  It's one of these vehicles used by the authorities.  You know, I'm a peasant, I'm a farmer, so in my conditions I wouldn't be able to give you the models of or makes of cars.  We talk about lorries or pick-ups and so on and so forth, but we don't really speak about makes of cars.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let's talk about the --
@A.
Behind the first vehicle there was a green vehicle. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, this green vehicle that you talk about, what sort of vehicle was that?  The green vehicle, what sort of vehicle was it? 
@A.
As for the green vehicle, it was a vehicle of the same type as the vehicles which had been distributed to the communal administrations.  Those vehicles were green in colour, but I do not remember the exact type. 
You know, when you're being asked questions about unfortunate events such as death, I lose my head and I can no longer be coherent in my ideas.  These are things one tries to forget.  You know, there are people who you recognise who committed crimes and are pardoned and they go back home.  And here is this Accused as -- in this trial, we are wasting time.  We are asking -- we are wasting time.  Why do these people not wish to admit to their crimes since they know what they have done?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, look at me.  Look at me, Mr. Witness.  I am asking you the questions this afternoon, and I want you, very kindly, only to respond to the questions that I've asked you.  I don't want a narration, Mr. Witness.  Do you think you can help me with that?  Do you think so, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
I am with you, Mr. Prosecutor. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Let's go back to the green vehicle.  Was it a lorry; was it a pick-up; was it a small vehicle?  Can you help me with that?  What sort of vehicle was it? 
@A.
It was a green vehicle, but it was, in fact, of the Daihatsu make.  People say that it was a Daihatsu; others say it's a pick-up.  You see, we don't know makes of cars, but it was a vehicle which was green, and it was the same type of vehicle which had been given to the communal authorities in all communes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, when you saw these vehicles arrive, Mr. Witness, do you know how many people were located in the vehicle, the white vehicle?  Do you know how many people were in that vehicle? 
@A.
I saw the vehicles stop.  And the reason why I saw the Accused was that he was in the middle of the crowd and he was giving them advice; otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to recognise him.  The vehicle stopped, he opened the door to the car, and he came down.  I didn't really pay much mind to find out how many people were in the car in the front.  The same applies to those who were in the vehicle behind, because they remained in the vehicle.  Now, those who were in the front vehicle also remained in the vehicle.  They never came down from the vehicle. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know if the -- if Mr. Ndindabahizi drove himself on this occasion?  Could you see that? 
@A.
When he came down from the vehicle, he came down from the right side of the vehicle.  I saw him standing at the time when he came out of the vehicle, so I wouldn't be able to tell you whether he was the driver.
The vehicle was parked in -- facing Kibuye, and he came down from the right-hand side, so I wouldn't be able to say whether he was driving or not.  There were people around the vehicle.  Maybe those people could tell you precisely whether he was the driver.  But as for myself, I never came near the vehicle; otherwise, I would be risking death.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know if he came down from the door in front or the door at the back? 
@A.
I was not -- unable to see the door which he came out of, but when he came out of the vehicle, he closed the door.  I wasn't attentive enough to know whether it was the front or the back door, but I was only able to see him because he was in the middle of the crowd giving them advice.  Otherwise, as for the door from which he came, as to whether it was the front or the back, I don't know, but I know that it was to the right of the vehicle and the vehicle was parked facing Kibuye. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, where were you located at the time you were viewing and observing these events?  Where were you? 
@A.
I was quite close by there.  Actually, I came to that place to see whether I could find a way of getting to my father-in-law's house.  Indeed, since it was said that there were no more Tutsis in the area, I preferred to hide in that area.  I remained there, and I was about 30 metres away.  There was a bush quite close to a banana grove, and that's where I was lying down, and I could see the Accused giving advice to those in attendance. 
In the evening, as night fell, I left.  I went home and I told my wife, "You know, Tutsi women who have married Hutu men are going to be exterminated, and your sister-in-law is one of those Tutsis."  So I told my wife, "We need to leave, to go and hide in the bushes."  It was my wife who, during the war, would keep me informed of the development of the conflict. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You were 30 or 40 metres away from the Accused, Mr. Witness.  Having arrived at that location, what did you see the Accused do? 
@A.
He stopped at that place -- I'm repeating what I've already said.  So he stopped, and he talked to Hassan Byiyingoma, who was manning the roadblock and who was carrying grenades.  We, in fact, took those grenades away from him at the end of the war.
The Accused asked whether he knew him, and Hassan said, "Yes, I think I remember who you are.  I think you are Ndindabahizi, and you are a minister."  And the Accused said, "Where are the others?"  In fact, the others who were manning the roadblock were lying close by the bridge because they were on the lookout to see whether there were Tutsis in vehicles that went by.  If there were any Tutsis, they would come as one man to attack those Tutsis. 
So the Accused spoke to Hassan, and Hassan beckoned to the others who came at the same time.  Those who were at the roadblock said, "The minister has arrived."  They came out quickly from the bar, and they came to the bridge.  At that bridge, there are two bars.  There were two bars then and there are still two bars. 
So people who were drinking at those bars came -- there were many -- and the Accused spoke to them, giving them advice.  And immediately those in attendance took the machetes -- no, I'm sorry.  Three of the people in the crowd took the machetes from the vehicle, and when the Accused left, they distributed them to the rest of the group.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which three people from the group took the machetes?  Can we start with that, please?  Can you tell me their names?
@A.
You know, there are things that we say and which might compromise our safety.  Let me give you an example:  Somebody came to Kibuye recently and asked for people who could testify in the Ndindabahizi case.  I know the name of the people you are asking, but I prefer to put it in writing, and if you allow me -- if you do not want me to write them then I would be obliged to mention them, since I do not have to ask these people for any pardon.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You have mentioned them already, Mr. Witness, you have mentioned them three times already.
@A.
Yes, I have already mentioned those names, but I thought you were asking me to give the names of the people who received the machetes, but if I give three more names of people who received the machetes, that might compromise my own safety.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, Witness, who was Hassan Byiyingoma?
@A.
Hassan Byiyingoma was an Interahamwe and he received military equipment.  Abdullah was a Muslim, and another one called Miraso, were the leaders.  They were issuing the authorisation for people to eat the cows or to kill people, and they were appropriating the properties of people as well as the money they took from Tutsi.  They carried out the distribution of the booty obtained to the others.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We need the third name spelt, I am afraid.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
M-I-R-A-S-O, Miraso.
@THE WITNESS:
Hassan Byiyingoma is a Muslim and Abdullah is also a Muslim.  Miraso's first name is Patrice, and he is a Catholic.  He confessed his crime and was released, as well as Abdullah.  Their confessions were not complete, and they have to appear before the Gacaca courts.
Regarding Byiyingoma, he is still in detention.  In fact, he is my neighbour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what was the position in society of Mr. Patrice, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to Patrice Miraso?  It's Patrice Miraso.  I don't know if your question refers to that Patrice, Mr. President, or are you referring to Abdullah or Hassan?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I am referring, exactly as you suggested, to Patrice.
@THE WITNESS:
Well, you know, the Accused knows Patrice.  I think he worked with Trafipro, and I think he worked with the Accused.  He used to give him equipment which he used to take to Cyangugu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But we do not know this man, so you have to help us.  Who was he?
@THE WITNESS:
At the time of the events he was an ordinary farmer who had been sent away from Trafipro, and he was living just like any other farmers.
B MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, Abdullah, Patrice and Hassan, do you know what ethnic group they belonged to?
@A.
They are Hutus, all three.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The three men took machetes from which vehicle; the white one or the green one, Mr. Witness?
@A.
The machetes were taken from the green vehicle, which, in fact, was in the second position.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know what they did with the machetes after they took them from the vehicle?
@A.
After they took the machetes from the vehicle, I don't know what they did with them, because I went to see my wife, and my wife told me that they were no longer going to look for people in houses because they wanted to prevent the looting that the attackers were carrying out.
From that moment on, I understood that they were not going to conduct any searches in houses, so I decided to stay inside the house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was Mr. Ndindabahizi present when these machetes were taken from the green vehicle, sir?  Just yes or no.
@A.
Ndindabahizi was very well present, in fact, he presented the machetes.  I am telling the truth.  It is not that I am trying to incriminate him.  I have nothing against Ndindabahizi.  So what I am telling you is the truth.
@A.
Mr. Witness, you testified that you were some 35 to 40 metres, thereabouts, from this roadblock; did you have a clear view of the roadblock from your location, or was your view obstructed in some manner?
@A.
All these people were at the roadblock and everybody was convinced that everyone had been killed.  I was therefore in the bushes, I was lying down and I was not worried because they thought everybody had been killed.  I therefore know everything that was said at that place, and I know the people who were killed there, and I testified during the trial of some of the people who manned the roadblock.
So, I was safe where I was hiding and I was able to hear everything that was happening.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the question was: You were, according to your previous testimony, about 30 metres distance from this event.  How were you able to observe what happened?  Was there anything between you and the persons close to these two vehicles?  That is question.
@THE WITNESS:
There was no obstacle in my view, and in fact, the Tutsis were given up to the killers, and everything that was said was said out loud.  Nothing was done confidentially, even after the departure of the Accused, they were saying -- the attackers kept on saying what he had said and they were saying:  "Let us exterminate them."  All this was being said in broad daylight.  People were singing, and burning down the hills.  Everything was being done in public.  The Accused, therefore, did not speak to these people secretly.  He spoke out publicly and out loud.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could this person see you?
@THE WITNESS:
If they had seen me they would have killed me, I would not have been able to escape them.  They were so happy to kill, how then would I have been able to escape them?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So they couldn't see you.  Were you hiding behind something?
@THE WITNESS:
I was hiding in some bushes, and in those bushes you could cover yourself with the twigs, with the bushes, and no one will see you.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But the bushes and the twigs, did they obstruct your view -- did they obstruct  what you were able to see at the roadblock?  That is the question, Mr. Witness; yes or no.
@A.
No, they did not block my view, but that person said:  "I am an authority -- I am a person in authority," and he gave advice to the people.  So, I listened carefully and I heard the advice he gave them, because I was concerned about my own security and my own survival.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You've told us Mr. Witness, what you heard Mr. Ndindabahizi say to those at that roadblock.  Now, my question is, first of all, what language was Mr. Ndindabahizi speaking in what language did he speak at this time?
@A.
He was speaking in Kinyarwanda since he was speaking to Rwandans, and most of the people who were listening were farmers who had not gone far in their schooling.  So, they speak Kinyarwanda, and therefore the Accused spoke Kinyarwanda to them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified that you were some 30,35, 40 metres away.  How then were you able to hear what was being said, Mr. Witness?  Did he use a megaphone, for example? A.
@A.
No, he was not using a megaphone, but his voice could go far, and when you are speaking to a large crowd you speak out loud.  And when you are giving orders -- when you are giving orders you shout them out.  Even when a hunter is shouting at an animal, he does so out loud, and that is what the Accused did.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The comments that you testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi made, Mr. Witness, were those comments made before or after the machetes were offloaded from the green vehicle?  Which came first, the offloading of the machetes or the comments?  Can you help us with that?
@A.
He gave orders to one Hassan to offload the machetes, and when the machetes were distributed, he told them what they should do with the machetes.  Subsequent to that he distributed the machetes, and that was after he had given them advice.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, would I be correct in outlining the sequence of the events as follows:  Machetes are off-loaded from the green vehicle; he gives the advice, as you say; and then the machetes are distributed.  Or is it the following:  Machetes are offloaded from the vehicle; they are distributed; then he gives the advice?  Which of those options is indicative of what you observed, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Those that were in the bars were told that the minister wanted to see them, and when they arrived, the machetes were offloaded.  Hassan and Miraso and the Accused spoke to the two people as follows:  "If you have not killed Tutsi women married to the men, they will  poison you, if these persons are not killed.  Therefore, you have to kill them."  So this is how things happened.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How long had you been at your hiding place, the present place where you were hiding at the time in that little plantation, how long had you been there?  When did you arrive there, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I think you did not understand my explanations.  I went there very early in the morning when cock starts crowing, and I thought that at that time he was not going to see me, because I went to my father-in-law's house, and I stayed there until 9:00 in the evening.  Then I left to look for some food and I did not go back to that place.  And I do not know what happened subsequently.  I did not see the Accused anymore, and I did not go back to that roadblock.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How far was your father's house from this roadblock?
@A.
The roadblock, you know, when you are in flight, when you are fleeing, you take shortcuts.  Normally, it is a distance you can cover in 15 minutes, but since I was going through the bush, it took a longer period.  Normally, it is a distance that you can cover in 15 minutes, but since I had to take the tools through the bush, I had to cover a distance of about I kilometre to get there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified that you had arrived at that roadblock earlier that morning.  My question to you is: had there been other occasions in that month when you had sought refugee in the plantation close to that same roadblock or was this the very first time you were seeking refuge in that area?
@A.
I did not understand your question.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, had you sought refuge in the plantation near the roadblock before the day when you say you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi, or was this the first time that you sought refuge in that plantation?
@A.
When the attackers came to look for me in my secteur, from April I went back to my secteur, and I was hiding in the bushes.  In the night I would leave the bush to go and look for food.  This is how come I know the events that occurred in my secteur.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, had you been in that plantation where you were hiding before the day you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi?  Yes, or no.  Had you hidden in those plantations before?
@A.
When I hid in that place, in fact, it was to look for a way.  Normally I would hide in the bush in my secteur, but that day I was looking for a passage, and I spent the whole day there.  Otherwise I was hiding in various places.  I could hide here today and tomorrow move on to another place, for fear that they might find my traces.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And had you hidden on that particular spot before, Mr. Witness, close to that plantation; had you been there before?  That is the Prosecutor's question.
@THE WITNESS:
One week earlier I was hiding in that place -- I was hiding in that place where there is the passage on two occasions, but this was not on two successive days.  I knew there wouldn't be many criminals there, and that I could pass there without being worried.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I am going to need the registry to draw the curtains on this side.  I want the witness to walk over to the projector.  The sketch 4 in the Prosecution Exhibit 2 is generated by this witness -- well, it is generated by my office, but with the help of this witness.  So I just wish to take him through this sketch and to further assist Your Honours in locating where he was.
Mr. Registry, excuse me, can you also draw this up to about half.
Your Honours, I refer you in particular to Prosecution Exhibit P2, sketch 4, which is numbered L0019878.  Can I also have the technicians zoom in on the projector, please, so we can all see it on our screens.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you do this for the video, exercise caution now, umh?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If the witness can stand next to the microphone, Mr. Registry, and if you can kindly ensure that the paper doesn't move so it doesn't reveal the name at the top of the page.  I just said not to move the paper.
Thank you.  I don't want the name shown, please.

Mr. Witness, do you see that sketch in front of you?
@A.
Yes, I can see it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you see the road that is indicated -- I have not asked you any question yet, Mr. Witness.  Can you just wait and listen to the question.  Do you see the road indicated thereon?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLPS:
Sorry, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before doing that, court video, would you make sure that you don't transmit those seconds where the registry unfortunately showed a little bit of the location.  So, don't transmit those three seconds of the court video system from the sketch.  Thank you very much.

I am grateful, Your Honour.  I didn't even realise they had done that.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you describe to the Court the road that you see on there?  Do you know which road that is, Mr. Witness?
@A.
There is a bridge here, and there is a river there and there is a passage on the other side.  Here, there are bars here, and I was here, because I was coming down looking for a passage to get to Burombo secteur, and the other side is Kibuye, and this road comes from Kigali towards Kibuye, and I was hiding behind these bars next to this road.  The Accused person was standing here at this roadblock.  He held a meeting downhill from the bars, and I was here, even though I can see that the distance in metres is mentioned on the other side.  I was here at the cellule, the Kigezi cellule, I was behind these buildings.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, did you accompany investigators from the Tribunal to this location where you indicated your position in l994 when you saw the events at this roadblock?  Answer yes or no.
@A.
Yes, we came from Kibuye and I showed them this place, but I realise that this sketch shows Josise cellule, but I was in Kigezi cellule.  Yes, we got to that place together with the investigators of the Tribunal.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
During your visit with the investigators, did you point out to those persons the place where you were located in the plantation when you saw the events at the roadblock?  Yes or no,
Mr. Witness.
@A.
Yes, I went to that place with the investigators.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you see, Mr. Witness, do you see the  little man that is on that picture, the little drawing there?  Could you touch it, Mr. Witness?  Do you see the little man on that picture?
@A.
Yes, I can see him.  He is very close to the two houses located there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct.  Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Now, can you draw a circle around that little man, Mr. Witness, very quickly?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Or can the Registry do that for him; just put a circle around that little man.  Thank you.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLPS:
Now, can you mark that one, Mr. Witness, or the registry, very quickly, please?  Just write "1" beside it.  Thank you.
Now, Mr. Witness, do you confirm that that was the location you showed to the investigators representing your hiding place in -- at the end of May l994? is that your testimony, sir?
@A.
When we would come from Kibuye we stopped at that place, and I think the place which is marked "metres" is not where I was hiding.  The distance mentioned here is not the distance I showed to them, but I think there is no problem with that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLPS:
Leaving the distance aside, Mr. Witness, the area you have circled indicating where that little man is, is the area that the investigators have indicated as your location.  Do you agree with that or do you disagree with that?
@A.
Yes, it is in that place that I was hiding, 35 metres from the roadblock, close by the bar or the bars, in plural.  I confirm that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLPS:
Now, very quickly, do you see the barrier on that picture?  The investigators tell us that you have indicated to them that that was the roadblock as you saw it at the end of May 1994 which is the subject of your testimony in this courtroom.  Do you agree that that was the location of the roadblock and that that picture indicates the roadblock?
@A.
Yes, I can confirm that.  Any individual in my secteur can confirm that the roadblock was set up in this same place .  It is indeed where the roadblock was erected.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLPS:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.

I believe that will be Prosecution Exhibit P17?  I think we stopped at 16.  Sixteen, Your Honour, I stopped at Exhibit 16 -- It is Prosecution Exhibit16, it doesn't necessarily have to be under seal.  Thank you.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Mr. Witness, can you describe to me the man you say you saw at the - sorry, at the bridge at the end of May l994?  Do you -- can you -- just tell me what he looks like, just by describing him to me first?  And by that I mean, very simply, is he fat, thin, tall, short?  Can you help us with that sort of description?
@A.
You know, someone can change over the years, but at that time when I saw him, he was 1.6 metres tall.  But when people age, one may become bald, one can have wrinkles on the face, but I think that that's the description I will be able to give.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are there any other physical attributes concerning this person that you can recall at this time?  For example, do you know whether he was fair skinned or dark skinned?
@A.
He was dark skinned, and I can see that myself even from where I am.  We can see one another.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you testified at the beginning of this hearing that you have some problems with your eyesight.  Did you have those problems at the end of May 1994?  Did you have problems with your eyes at the end of May 1994?
@A.
I had problems with my eyesight from June.  Now, from the 16th of June I was attacked by persons who knifed me?  And in fact, I have asked that I be given treatment while I am here.  And when the sun shines brightly, I have problems with my eyesight because the muscles in my eyes become painful  -- the nerves.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that you started having problems with your eyes from the 16th of June 2003 this year:  Is that not the case, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, you are quite right.  I was attacked by people and they wounded me.  Some of the people who attacked me are in detention; others fled.  I was receiving treatment at the hospital before I came here.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I am going to ask you now to stand up, and if you need to move around, please do, and see if you can identify the man you have spoken about at length this afternoon, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Are you able to identify him in this room this afternoon, and if so --
@A.
This room is well lit, but I can see that there is someone who is behind the people of white race to that side, someone looking like him.  But there is too much light in this room, so I can't see very well.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Feel free to stand up and move around the courtroom closer to whoever you think might be 
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  No, don't feel free to stand up and move around the courtroom.  I take that back.

Let's start with standing up, simply.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you point in the direction of the person you think might be him?
@A.
He is behind these white men.  It's the person behind the two white men.  Furthermore, he knows me.  Even if one can forget someone after a given period of time, I do believe it's indeed that person who is seated to that side.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you -- can you recall what he is wearing?  Can you see and describe what he is wearing,
Mr. Witness?  Do you see that far?
@A.
I have problems with my eyesight, but I think he is wearing a white shirt and a black jacket.  As for the rest, I cannot really see well enough.  I wonder if he is wearing a tie.  I am not really sure.  But he knows me, and he doesn't have any problems with this eyesight.  He knows me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I am quite satisfied with the identification, and I would ask that the records reflect that this witness has identified Mr. Ndindabahizi as being present in this courtroom this afternoon.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objections?  If there are none --
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I would like it to be on the record that hereto there are 13 persons (sic) persons, and only one is a white person and in civilian clothing -- black, I beg your pardon, only one is black and in civilian clothing.

It is, indeed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Besnier.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you said that Mr. Ndindabahizi was a teacher in an institution where you were a student.  Did he ever teach you?
@THE WITNESS:
Ndindabahizi never taught me.  You know, when you are still very young, you have reminiscences, and he was in the highest school, and in that place, he would come to mass.  Actually, he was someone who was doing a course.  He was not a teacher at the school, he was only doing a course, and after the course he got employment elsewhere.  He was not a teacher, he was someone who was following a course.  It was subsequently when I become a young man that I knew him very well, and at that time he was working at Trafipro.  And he is a native of the place where that school is constructed.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Mr. Witness, you mentioned during your testimony this afternoon that you had been approached by some persons in Kibuye before you came out to Arusha to testify.   Now, can you tell me, who approached you in Kibuye and when?
@A.
It is about two or three years ago.  These people came, and they wanted to know whether people could come to testify for the Prosecution in the -- for the Defence in the Ndindabahizi case.  They wanted to know whether they could find Defence witnesses or Prosecution witnesses.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you say this happened two years ago?  Is that your testimony?
@A.
That is only an estimate I am giving you. It's a long time ago.  Furthermore, we thought that the investigation had come to an end.  We were no longer thinking about that matter.  They came in order to look for Prosecution and Defence witnesses.  They asked whether there could be any Defence or Prosecution witnesses.  They did not stick to only one side.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, have you ever heard of a person called *******************?
@A.
************************** came last month.  That is someone who is responsible for roads and bridges, and he is also responsible for the distribution of the land in Kibuye town.
The person came looking for those who could testify for the Prosecution in the Ndindabahizi case.  I told the person that I didn't know Ndindabahizi.  I don't know whether the person went to look elsewhere for witnesses, but some of the people who were questioned by him  refused, but we did not pay much attention to what he was saying, because it seemed to us that he wanted to use us through corruption, because that kind of corruption does not exist in our country.  Someone who tries to corrupt or be corrupted can only do that once.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your  --
@A.
However, it would seem that he was given that authority by a lawyer.  I don't know him, I didn't even know his name.  I didn't see him, but I denounced this person known as***************, and I believe there are others who went to the communeli office.  I don't know whether they are going to come here to testify, I am not sure about that.  I don't know about that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did *************** tell you whether he was contacting you on behalf of the Prosecution or the Defence, Mr. Witness?
@A.
******************* came, he asked me to get into his vehicle, he had a beautiful vehicle. but I don't know what make it was.  And on the way, he said, "If you testify on behalf of Ndindabahizi, you will receive a big reward."  I told him that I do not know Ndindabahizi, and that we were not neighbours.  Furthermore, our cattles were not eaten by Ndindabahizi but by our neighbours.  So he stopped, and I got out of the vehicle, and he went to look for other people for the same purpose.  I didn't even say goodbye to him.  He went to look for other people in that same context.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how **************** knew that you had anything to do with this case?
@A.
A lawyer came to look for ******************, and *********** was given authority by one lawyer of this Tribunal.  I don't know whether he is in this courtroom where we are together.  He said that Ndindabahizi's lawyer -- he told me this on the way.  I was happy, because I was thinking he was going to give me a job, because he gives people jobs.  Now, on the way he said those things to me, and when we reached the roundabout, I got out the vehicle and I left.  I left.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I have no further questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this incident with *******************, was this the incident which took place about two years ago?
@THE WITNESS:
No, this is an incident which took place last month.  I don't know, you can carry out investigations, and people will tell you that ************** came in search of people, but we refused, because in our country there is no corruption.  There is no longer any corruption.  You do what you do in hiding, but you end up getting caught.  There is no longer any corruption in our country, and that is why we did not associate ourselves with him.
Furthermore, when he did this, he made people go even to the commune office.  I don't know whether he is present. I am referring to the lawyer in question.  In fact, instead of contacting that person for looking for Defence witnesses, they need to use another person.  They shouldn't trust this person any more.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So did this happen, then, in September or August?
@THE WITNESS:
I think we are in the month of June right now.  So, it was in the first week of that month of June?  That is when he came.  I am not hiding this from you.  When an animal leaves its hiding place, people shout out when they see it.  When ******************** was being looked for - he is not my neighbour.  Between his residence's home and mine there is a distance that one can cover in two hours.  He is from Karongi.  I don't know whether he knew Ndindabahizi.  Look for someone else, someone who is a neighbour, or speak to Ndindabahizi.  I think we were being contacted, and three of us were contacted.
I met ************** who was coming from Kibuye.  He lives in Kibuye.  He told me that he was made to come to the commune office, and when he was asked questions about Ndindabahizi, he came out of that room.  He said that he didn't want anything to do with Ndindabahizi and that he was doing his business in Kibuye.
As for me, I was waiting for schools to open, and I was saying that before the children go back to school they needed to do some work.  So we said no to him.  We felt that one wanted to involve us in some kind of fraudulent manoeuvres.  Even people who killed our kith and kin didn't give us anything.  They confessed and they were released, and we are living together on the hill, colline.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, we are now in September.  Presently, we are in the month of September, Mr. Witness.  So when did this take place?  Which month, did you say?
@THE WITNESS:
In that case it was in the first days of this month.  The month of August, I think that is when people came to contact us, you know; because I have lost my mind, I didn't even think about writing that date down, but if there were investigations, I think ******************** would give you the date.  Even the neighbour of that man, who is known as **************i, he is a neighbour of that man, he can tell you the date.  He also he was told that he was going to be offered a job, but later he was asked for something else.  I am talking about *****************************.  These people were sought in like manner as myself.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  I am the counsel for Mr. Ndindabahizi.  I am going to ask you a few questions on the testimony you have made before this courtroom.
Let's start with this Mr. **************************.  Is that his name?  Did I pronounce his name correctly, he is called ********************************?
@A.
Yes, he is *************.  I told you that he is responsible for *********** in the town.  If you think that I am not telling the truth, there are other witnesses in Kibuye who can tell you the same.

What secteur does he live in?
@A.
He lives in Kayenzi sector.  Kayenzi.  The people who wanted to contact him lived in different secteurs.
@MR. BESNIER:
Look at me please, Mr. Witness.  In what secteur does he live?  In which cellule does ********François live?
@A.
In Kayenzi, next to the *************, but I do not know the name of the cellule.  It's in Kayenzi secteur, but his house is close to the social hall, the place where the social hall is located.  In fact, the road to his home passes by the social centre in question. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I think we have the pleasure of announcing that we have identified Mr. François **************.  I have a document here which is a statement from the Office of the Prosecutor.  This is K0225036.  It is a statement which is not included in the list of witnesses who were supposed to be called during the trial before this Court, but it was disclosed to the Defence.  The witness whose name -- I must say will not testify, he is not in the final list produced by the Prosecution.  However, this witness has given his address, and he also mentioned the addresses of members of his family.  On page 2 of that witness statement I can see that the brother of the witness that I'm referring to is Mr. François *************** who lives in Kayenzi secteur.  So, we are dealing with the brother of a witness for the Prosecution.  I am surprised about leakages, because there is a document from the Prosecution, and the parents of the Prosecution witness, or relatives, obviously know about this witness.
I believe, Mr. President, this document should be submitted to those involved in the investigations which are ongoing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, this individual we just heard a reference to, is he subject to some kind of a protection order, at least the prospective witness? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So there is no problem here? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is no problem, because there is no indication that the person that has been referred to by the Prosecution witnesses and the man mentioned in that statement are one and the same person.
I have recently had a problem with witness No. 14 on your witness list.  Witness No. 14, that was brought over the weekend and has the same name with somebody else, turned out to be the wrong person.  It often happens in Rwanda.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So I can't say one way or the other just by the mere mention of the name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what the Bench will do now is simply to ask the Defence counsel to give this documentation over to the witness protection unit, which is looking into the matters in connection with the present case, as suggested, and we will leave it at that for the time being in this courtroom.  Thank you. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I will gladly do that, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. Witness, let's come back to your testimony.  You gave a statement to the investigators of the Tribunal on 27th February 2001 in the document that you signed?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you gave that statement at the Kibuye guest house; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
And why not in your house?
@A.
At that time they were looking for Prosecution and Defence witnesses, such that they could not find Prosecution witnesses in my house, so they had to -- they had to find these Prosecution witnesses and interview them somewhere. 
@MR. BESNIER:
The investigators interviewed 27th April 2001; that is well before the publication of Ndindabahizi's indictment.  Who accompanied you to the Kibuye guest house for the interview?  The date was 27th April 2001 -- sorry, 27th February 2001.
@A.
I went alone.  Regarding the other witnesses, they went by themselves.  They contacted officials of the commune for them to contact Defence and Prosecution witnesses, and that was the case in the Ndindabahizi case.  There are Defence as well as Prosecution witnesses. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Who invited you the first time for purposes of testifying in the Ndindabahizi case?
@A.
I do not know the name of that person. I was called upon to explain what I knew as a witness, but I do not know the name of the person who invited me to do that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the ICTR investigators come to your house to ask you questions and then subsequently drafted your statement at the Kibuye guest house, or did an authority come to your house to request you to go and attend an interview?
@A.
They came to the communal office.  They sought -- they looked for Defence and Prosecution witnesses, and they told them where they would find investigators.  As far as I'm concerned, I went to see them as a Prosecution witness.  Later on there will be Defence witnesses who I'm sure will come and testify in this case.  There are neighbours to Mr. Ndindabahizi who know him, who may know him as a person of good morality, and who will come and testify for him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, before you travelled to Arusha, did you meet people from your region, people you knew were also Prosecution witnesses in the Ndindabahizi case?
@A.
In the secteur I lived in, I did not know anybody.  However, most of the witnesses live in his native secteur.  I also know that the Court will not rely exclusively on my testimony.  There are other people who will come and testify for him, particularly his neighbours.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know the name of the Prosecution witness, since you've had a chat with him, who lives in another secteur?
@A.
I do not know any Prosecution witness, and I will say I'm more -- I'm a very private person.  I do not discuss with other people.  I discuss exclusively with my wife.  I normally should be discussing with my neighbours, but they harmed me, so I do not have any discussion with anybody.
@MR. BESNIER:
You did say that you testified in other cases, Witness; is that correct?
@A.
The only time I came to Arusha is in this Ndindabahizi case.  Otherwise, I have testified as a witness in our national courts.  But in our country we have already started a process of reconciliation, and I have nothing against anybody now. 
@MR. BESNIER:
The Gacaca courts, have they started operating in your region?
@A.
This -- regarding these Gacaca courts, people are living cordially, they live well together.  That is the beginning of reconciliation, and in actual fact Gacaca has already started.  People who have harmed you will come and ask for forgiveness, and you forgive them.  That is what is happening in the villages among the people.  So I will say that the Gacaca courts have already started. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Witness.  If I am asking you whether the Gacaca courts have started or are already operating, you can answer me "Yes, the courts have started operating", so we can gain some time.
@A.
Yes, the Gacaca courts are already in operation.  We are living in peace, mutual help.  There is no longer discord, and we are even in the process of concluding the Gacaca proceedings.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please just answer the question, Mr. Witness.  You see, both counsel for the Prosecution and counsel for the Defence are very experienced, and they try to formulate their questions very precisely so that the answers can be very brief.  Now, please listen carefully. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Are all citizens of Rwanda not obligated by the Gacaca laws to give out those who participated in the genocide?
@A.
Regarding the denunciation of criminals in those proceedings, everything will depend on those who have already confessed.  It will be on the basis of their confession that they will rely to free this or that person.
But regarding the Gacaca of free persons who are not in detention, that depends.  We have agreed on a certain procedure to resolve such problems.  People who have confessed and who have been released will one day testify for or against people who are still in detention. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you -- you, yourself -- testify in the Gacaca courts or in Kibuye, in the Kibuye courts?
@A.
The occasion that I appeared before a court was when I brought charges against somebody who ate my cow.  That was the only time that I went to a court.  And I shall be content with the only cow that he gave me. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, did you not say in your examination-in-chief that you appeared as a witness in the trial of some of these people who were at the roadblock?
@A.
Regarding testimony that I gave in relation to people who were at the roadblock, I was not accusing them of anything; it was in relation to my cows which they appropriated.  Now, even the Accused in this case, I'm not accusing him of having killed anyone, I'm only talking about the events that occurred at that time in relation to him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
But is it true that you testified against people who were at the roadblock that you referred to a while ago, the roadblock at which you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in 1994?
@A.
Yes.  I am not accusing him of having killed anyone, I am ascribing the loss of property which occurred and the grenades at that roadblock.  When you tell the authorities that so-and-so has a weapon which can occasion loss of human life, it is not the same thing as saying -- when you say that somebody has attacked another person with a weapon, it is not the same.  And when you are talking about somebody carrying a weapon, when you report somebody who is carrying weapons, you want the authorities to recover the weapons.
@MR. BESNIER:
My question is:  is it the people who were at the roadblock?  You can answer yes or no, and can you be concise in your answers?  Another question:  do you recall in which year you testified before the Kibuye courts against these people who were at the roadblock?
@A.
I do not recall the year.  That is not part of my concerns.  If I reported these people, it is because they were carrying weapons and I wanted weapons to be taken from them.  But the people who committed these crimes, including those who looted my property, are still alive today, and we live together.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you testify before the Rwandan courts before or after your -- after being interviewed by the investigators of the ICTR?
@A.
But, Counsel, you are asking me to answer only the questions you ask me, but I have the impression that the testimony given in Rwanda has nothing to do with the Ndindabahizi case before us.  You want me to give you information which I do not have in my mind now.  The testimony in courts in Rwanda have nothing to do with what is going on in this case.  Cases that have been tried in Rwandan are being tried in Rwanda, or do you want to decide -- or do you want to adjudicate in the cases being tried in Rwanda?
I am in a case being tried here.  Ndindabahizi has not been -- charges have not been brought against Ndindabahizi in Rwanda.  What is happening in Rwanda is known to the President, Kagame, so you probably need to go and talk to him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Everybody in this courtroom, Mr. Witness, agrees with you that one thing is the trials in Rwanda and something else is a trial here.  These are two separate matters.  But it is not without significance, your answer to that question just posed by the Defence.
So will you please answer the following question:  when you were interviewed or gave testimony in connection with the Rwandan courts, before the Rwandan courts, was that before or after your statement to investigators on the 27th of February 2001? 
@THE WITNESS:
Regarding the testimony given in Rwanda, it has to do with somebody called ********************** ******, who looted my cattle, and his case is still existing.  And I brought charges against this person, and his case file is still there, which you can consult, and you will realise that I brought charges against this person for looting my cattle.  The case is still before the Kibuye court of first instance.
Mr. President, the person is *************************, who is still in detention in Rwanda because he committed a lot of crimes in his native secteur.  But as far as I am concerned, I was accusing him of looting my cattle.  ****************************.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That was not the question, Mr. Witness.  Now, Defence counsel will ask the question again.  Listen very carefully.  Don't provide information that we do not need, only listen to the question.  Now here comes the question again.
Defence, please. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, in this case against Mr. ******************, did you testify before the Rwandan courts before or after you met the investigators of the ICTR?
@A.
No.  Regarding *******************, it happened before my testimony in this case.  Well before.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.
Witness, since you had the opportunity to testify before the Rwandan courts against people who were at the roadblock, why is it that you had never mentioned the name and acts committed by Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I have a reason.  You know when somebody has fled and you don't know where he is, you cannot talk about him when you cannot see him.  You only talk about people you see.  Why talk about people you cannot see when you don't know where those people are?  And why will I testify against the Accused when he is not there?  I brought charges against only people I could see and whose location I knew.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you not think that it was necessary to mention the presence of a former minister at the roadblock, a minister who besides made anti-Tutsi statements and distributed weapons?
@A.
Well, there is a procedure, a legal procedure.  Talk to the Kibuye prosecutor.  He himself used to tell us, "Listen, bring charges against people who are present, not people who are absent".  And that person could have drowned in the lake, could have been killed in a plane crash.  Let's talk about the Kibuye préfet.  He is the one who used to put at the disposal of young men who were shuttling among the hills and burning the hills, making -- putting vehicles at their disposal to commit their acts.  And most of these people have been arrested and they are in prison.
So, if that person is found, he will be brought before the courts to be tried, but until then, when the person is not present, you cannot bring charges against him.
You can consult the laws in the books and you can see that there is a legal procedure to be followed to the effect that you cannot accuse people who are not present.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I would like to cross-examine the witness on other issues.  Would you think that this would be the appropriate time for the usual break, or do you want me to continue? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will take 15 minutes break now, but during the break remember, when we come back, concentrate only on answering the questions, and briefly.  I'm sure you can do that.  Thank you very much.
We meet again in 15 minutes.
$Court recessed from 1428H to 1647H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Defence. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Can the witness kindly sit forward so I can see him?
Thank you very much. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, let's now come to the facts, and let's please concentrate or focus on the date on which you learnt of the death of President Habyarimana.  Do you remember that date, Mr. Witness?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness apparently cannot hear the booth. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, do you remember the date on which you knew of the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
It was in April.  However, please do not ask me for the exact date. 
@MR. BESNIER:
From that date, bearing that day in mind, when were you personally attacked the first time by neighbours?
@A.
After the death of Habyarimana we all remained at home.  The following morning members of the population began to appropriate for themselves cattle and goats.  Many people went to the parish, and I myself went to my father-in-law's house.  My cows and those of others were eaten during that period of time, so it was the next day, the following day. 
@MR. BESNIER:
On that day, were you physically attacked yourself?
@A.
Yes.  Assailants came; my brother's house and my own were destroyed, and I wasn't spared, Counsel.  Would that have been possible?
@MR. BESNIER:
But you managed to escape, didn't you?
@A.
Yes, I escaped from them, but even the place to which I fled in Burunga, people came and found me there, but once again I escaped from them.
@MR. BESNIER:
First of all, let's talk about the day on which you were attacked, in other words, the day after the death of President Habyarimana.  Was there any official or person of authority amongst the people who attacked you?
@A.
As far as I know, they were no longer leaders per se.  They were just members of the population.  It's the population, the people themselves, who chose their leaders.  One of them was from the Parmahutu, or the MDR.  Those were the people who were selected, because the MRND movement had been, as it were, dissolved. 
@MR. BESNIER:
After that attack, Mr. Witness, you went to your father-in-law's home as you have said.  Now, your father's home -- your father-in-law's home, is it in the same secteur as your secteur where you lived?
@A.
No, it's in another secteur, but it's in fact -- they are in fact two neighbouring secteurs which have a common border.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it be correct to say that the day after your arrival at your in-laws, you were once again threatened or attacked by Interahamwe?
@A.
Yes.  They found me in that location, and I was able to escape. 
@MR. BESNIER:
So, you escaped your killers on two days, on two occasions?
@A.
Yes.  During that month of April I escaped my attackers who wanted to kill me.  Moreover, it wasn't only on those two occasions that I was able to escape from them, I also escaped at other times.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was it the same attackers who came, or were they different?  I'm speaking about the two occasions on which you were attacked, the day after the president -- President Habyarimana's death and the day following that day?
@A.
They were not inhabitants of my cellule.  All the cellules came together, and some people who lived in the cellule came and said that, "We have been attacked at such-and-such a place and we have not been able to come to the help of those who were attacked".  So, people came to attack from other cellules, and people in our cellules were attacked by others. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  The first time that you were attacked -- in other words, the day after President Habyarimana's death -- how did you escape?
@A.
On that day my wife took our children to her parents' home and I remained at home.  I think you want to get details of what happened.  So, I remained at home and I saw attackers as they came.  My wife had already left.  Now, to escape the attackers, I told them, "Here are our cattle which are being taken away by people which are not neighbours, because our cattle had never grazed in their fields.  But you, who are our neighbours, can pursue them and catch them".  So I was talking to other Hutus, I was a relative of some Hutus, and I'm saying, "We are going to look for other Hutus, and we are going to give them to you so that you can eat them".  The attackers believed me and they told -- they believed that I was going to bring back the cattle.  What I did instead was to follow my wife, and on my way I met my wife who was coming back with her brothers to save my life.  And my wife told me, "Come, we are going to go to my parents' home".  So I went to the parents of my wife, in other words, my in-laws, and I stayed there. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And the following day when you were once again attacked, how did you escape that time around?
@A.
On that day -- in other words, the second occasion, the second attack -- a group of attackers came, and it was my brothers-in-law who repelled them.  There was a third attack from persons coming from my own secteur, and since you're asking me for details I'm going to give them to you.
My wife was outside the house together with her children.  The attackers wanted to attack the children, to kill them, and my wife told them, "You want to kill these Tutsis, but he is not the father of my children.  My children are born of Hutus.  If you kill my children, I'm going to ask for reinforcement, and we are going to fight".  Among the attackers there were people who had received weapons from the state, and they said, "We are going to search the house to see whether your husband is in there".  My wife said, "You don't know whether my mother has made her bed, so let me go and check so that I can find the house is presentable".  So my wife came and told me to go through the window.  I went through the window and I escaped the attackers.  I went to the hill, and I survived by wandering around in the hills.
I told you that it was at night that my wife would bring me food to eat, and she told me the places which the attackers had the intention of attacking the day after or the two days after that.  That's how I knew how, when the attackers -- where the attackers were going to descend, and that is how I was able to survive, although the war lasted a long time.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you mean to say that the attackers waited for your wife to finish doing her chores for them to be able to search the house?
@A.
My wife went into the house.  In fact, it was a ruse she was using, and she told them, "You cannot go and look into -- look at my mother's bed".  So she came into the house and she said, "Go out.  It's better for you to be killed outside than to be killed inside".  So I left through the window.  I don't know what happened subsequently.  My wife remained with the attackers, but I do not know what happened.  Later on she told me that, "The attackers looked for you in the house.  They turned things topsy-turvy, and they didn't find you.  And we need to thank God for you being safe".  And that is what my wife told me, and that's what happened. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, after you fled through the window, where did you go to hide?
@A.
Counsel, if I were to tell you everywhere I went to hide, I would never come to the end of this testimony.  First of all I went to hide by the shores of Lake Kivu.  I was telling myself that I was preferring to throw myself into the lake rather than being killed by machetes.  It was in the secteur in which my father-in-law lived.  Later I went to hide by the river, and my wife would keep me abreast of the attackers' programs.  
Later on it was necessary to search the banks of the river, and she told me that -- my wife told me that I needed to find another hiding place.  So some days later I went into the secteur, to my native secteur, because it was believed that all Tutsis had been exterminated in my secteur, and that's how I went back to my native secteur.  I remained there.  In fact, in my cellule the bushes had not been burnt down, because people believed that everyone had been exterminated in my cellule.
So, with regard to what happened in my native secteur, I was able to see everything, when everyone had been exterminated and the attackers were dealing with the forests and the bushes in order to set them on fire. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see, as you were moving from one hiding place to another, that there were roadblocks on roads?
@A.
Do you want me to mention all the roadblocks that were on the roads and the names of the places where those roadblocks were?  I can do so if you wish. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Please just tell me whether you saw, as you were fleeing, any roadblocks on the roads.  Were there any or not?  Simply yes or no.
@A.
Yes, there were many roadblocks.  It's the French who came to dismantle them.  Otherwise there were roadblocks. 
@MR. BESNIER:
As you were fleeing, would you avoid those roadblocks or, to the contrary, would you go past those roadblocks?
@A.
But you couldn't throw yourself into the den.  I could not go round -- I had to go round the roadblocks, because if the attackers or the people manning the roadblocks had seen me, they would have killed me.  I had to avoid them so that they do not kill me.

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Mr. Witness, we are still in the month of April, just after your escape from the attackers who tried to kill you at your father-in-law's house, the day on which you went through the window.  In your written statement, you stated, "After having spent about two weeks in hiding, I went nearby the roadblock" -- the one you referred to in your cross -- in your examination-in-chief.  Should I be made to understand that the first time you went by that roadblock was two weeks after having escaped death at your father-in-law's house?
@A.
There were several roadblocks.  I would pass by some of those roadblocks which were in the area that my father-in-law lived; in fact, I avoided them.  As for the roadblocks in my secteur, that was in May, towards the end of May, and I passed close by those roadblocks.  You know, there were roadblocks all along that road, so you couldn't really ask me now to specify any specific roadblock, because there were many.
@MR. BESNIER:
Of course, of course.  I understand.  I'm speaking about the roadblock at which you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi in 1994.  My question is this -- 
@A.
It was in the month of May.
@MR. BESNIER:
Please wait.  
And that was approximately how much time after you went through the window of your father-in-law's house?
@A.
It's in fact from the middle of the month of April that I told you that I was in the bushes.  I was like a hyena; you know, hyenas live in the bushes.  At night I was brought food, but I would stay in the bush.  Now, you're asking me how much time passed after I escaped the attackers at my father-in-law's.  I wasn't able to count the days, Counsel; it was from the beginning -- from the middle of April until May, and I was in the bushes, and I tried to avoid roadblocks, and the people who were manning those roadblocks did know see me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  My question is: how much time -- after escaping your attackers -- elapsed until you were at that roadblock for the first time?  I am not asking you the time which has elapsed when you left your father-in-law's house and the time that you saw Ndindabahizi, no; I'm asking you about the first time that you went to that roadblock.  When was that?
@A.
I escaped from them in April.  As for that roadblock, I passed by that roadblock in May, and I passed by it on two occasions, and there was about one week between the two occasions on which I passed by -- close by the roadblock.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at that roadblock when you first passed by that roadblock or the second time you passed by the roadblock?
@A.
The first time I passed by that roadblock, I saw a conseiller there and he was the one giving instructions according to which people were to spend the night at the roadblock.  He asked Hassan Byiyingoma to stand up, whereas the others were sleeping.  Now, after one week, during the second time that I passed by, that's when I saw Mr. Ndindabahizi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  So, in other words, you passed by this roadblock only on two occasions, or were there other occasions?
@A.
No.  In that secteur -- in our secteur, I would pass by various places, because when people saw the traces of someone who had passed by there, it was quite easy for him to be followed, so I needed to be on the move constantly.  Today I would be in one place, tomorrow I would find myself somewhere else.  So, I passed by that roadblock, and one week later I came back by it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question is whether these two occasions were the only one when you were able to observe what happened at that particular roadblock.  These two occasions, were they the only ones?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was on those two occasions.  As for the rest, we were able to know what had happened at that roadblock after the war; in fact, the perpetrators of those acts themselves were saying -- they were saying such-and-such a person committed such-and-such a crime.  That's how we came to know about other incidents which had taken place at that roadblock.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  And you believe that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at that roadblock at the end of May 1994; is that not so?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm trying to establish a chronology and I'm seeking your assistance.  Now, first of all, you learn of the death of President Habyarimana, that's in the beginning of April; the following day you are attacked at your home; and the day after that you flee to your father-in-law's house.  Do we agree on that recapitulation of the events, Mr. Witness?
@A.
The third day we remained in our house; in fact, the second day is when houses began to be burned and destroyed, and it's at that point in time that some people went to seek refuge at the priests' place or at the stadium, in various places.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  If we were to take for reference the death of -- the date of the death of President Habyarimana, which was the 6th of April, would it be correct to say that you were informed of his death the following day, in other words, the 7th of April?
@A.
For everyone, when a day broke, we were told that the president was dead and we needed to remain at home, and the conseiller -- I remember it was being said that every individual should remain at home.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Now, the day following that day, you were attacked for the first time; is that correct? 
@A.
Yes, you're quite right.  My father went to the priests, and it's that -- it's at that time that our cattle were looted and the situation, the security situation deteriorated, and I said that's when I fled to my father-in-law.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it correct to say that that would be the 8th of April 1994?
@A.
It is difficult for me to remember the dates.  You know, I cannot really remember the dates.  You can always recount what happened to you, but it will be a lie to say that such-and-such an event took place on such-and-such a date, except for people who noted down dates in a diary; only they can give you dates.  I can give you details, but I am afraid I cannot give you dates.
@MR. BESNIER:
When you fled to your father-in-law, was it two days after the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
Yes, let's say the president died today, we will take today as a point of reference.  The conseiller held a meeting in the morning, in other words, the following day, the morning of the following day, and people began to eat cows and goats, and destroying houses.  That's what I told you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  I'm trying to find the date of the day on which you fled through the window of your father-in-law's house.  Was it three days, was it four days after President Habyarimana's death?  I'm just looking for an approximate date, I'm not asking you to be exact.
@A.
Listen, there was an attack which took place.  When the attackers were coming, they were repelled.  Maybe they came back, I don't know; I went through the window and I left.  I told you that amongst the attackers who came on the second occasion, there was a man, a neighbour, who knew me, and whom I knew very well.  As for the chronology -- chronology of events, you can do that when you're in agreeable circumstances.  Do you think that you are going to have an advantage from this exercise?  When you are faced with problems, how would you be keeping track of dates?  It wasn't a marriage, it wasn't a wedding that I had attended for me to be able to give you a chronology of events.
@MR. BESNIER:
You gave specifics in your written statement.  Let me refresh your memory by reading it to you.  You stated, and I am referring to the third paragraph of your written statement:  "The start of April 1994; I do not know the exact date.  I remember that I was at home, together with my wife and four children, listening to the radio.  It was announced on the radio that the president had died in a plane crash and the population were advised to stay at home and not to go to work."  
Let me stop there for now.  Now, on that date, when you heard on the radio about President Habyarimana's death, would it be correct to say that, since we know that he died on the 6th of April 1994 in the evening, that this was the 7th of April that you were listening to your radio?
@A.
Thank you.  You have just helped me to remember.  I realise that you are aware of the chronology of the events; in fact, you know everything you are asking me about, so I am wondering why you are asking me these questions.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  You also stated in your written statement, Mr. Witness, "The following day my wife and children went to my father-in-law's house in (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) 
I beg your pardon.  I think I have made a mistake Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that will be struck from the record, both the court video system and transcripts, and the reference will be placed under seal.
@MR. BESNIER:
I do apologise, Mr. President.  It's not very easy when you are reading a text.  I'll delete the name.  Let me begin again. 
@MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, you stated, "The following day my wife and children went to my father-in-law's house" in the cellule in which he lived, "whilst I remained in the house."  My question is:  was it, indeed, the day after you learnt of the death of President Habyarimana; wasn't it?
@A.
I'm saying the day on which my wife went to her parents' home with the children is the same day I myself left in order to go to my father-in-law's house.  I didn't spend the night in our house.  In fact, the attack had already been launched and our cattle had already been taken.  I realised that the situation was becoming untenable, so I said -- but that was a pretext -- that I was going to look for people to recover our cattle.  But I was using that pretext in order to go away.  I think you are looking for details, and I have given them to you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  You also said, "The day after, in the afternoon, Interahamwe came to the house, and l recognised Mbaraga as the leader."  Do you remember that episode, Mr. Witness?
@A.
When you're dealing with incidents that took place during this period of the war -- in fact, you can place events which took place two weeks ago and say that they took place two days ago.  In other words, these are estimates in time.  What is important is that we are still alive, and what was of import at the time is that you find yourself alive when the next day breaks.
@MR. BESNIER:
You find yourself, after two weeks of hiding in the bush, you went by the roadblock near the bridge -- I shall not mention the name -- but it's the bridge in question. I am made to understand, Mr. Witness, from your written statement, that you left and that you passed by the bridge for the first time, not at the end of May as you state, but around the 20th of April 1994.  Could you please shed some light on this matter for us?
@A.
When it's a matter of dates, it's quite a sensitive thing.  The very first time I went by that roadblock was at a time -- and a second time I passed by there a few days later, but as for dates, I didn't look at a calendar.  I was trying to give you some points of reference, but I didn't have a calendar.  If I had said that on such-and-such a date in May, that would be one thing, but I said "in the month of May."  I didn't give any specific date; I said, "towards the end of May."  So this is an estimate I am giving you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you telling us, Mr. Witness, that you do not recall at all the date on which you passed by that roadblock?
@A.
As for roadblocks, I have told you that there were many.  However, on different days during the month of May, I passed by that particular roadblock.  I think I have repeated this on several occasions already.  Now, as for dates, the dates that you are referring to, these are only some indications, some points of reference.  I don't know, when you are in the bush and you are being assailed from all sides, you wouldn't be very interested in keeping track of dates or even remembering them.  I don't think that one would be able to remember dates under such circumstances.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you hide on two occasions, close by this roadblock on the bridge?  Why did you do that, Mr. Witness; why close to this very bridge?
@A.
It's not a matter of hiding there of my own free will; in fact, I didn't say that it was a place which was appropriate for me to hide.  Actually, God was telling me that he was going to be passing close by this roadblock, and if there was, by chance, the possibility of me being seen, I would crawl on my belly so that I wouldn't be seen.  In fact, I didn't even know I was going to survive.  It was only thanks -- by the grace of God that I survived those events.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you even take the risk of going near the roadblock, since you stated a moment ago that you would avoid these roadblocks in order for you not to be killed?  Why did you get close to this one in particular?
@A.
Look closely at the distance separating me from the roadblock.  I didn't approach it so that I could be killed.  I was in the grass nearby between two places separated by 50 or 60 metres.  There were several roadblocks which were erected, but your question is this:  that I need to look for a place to go through so that I cannot be seen; in fact, it's like someone who is crossing a road when there is intensive traffic, there's several vehicles.  This is in comparison to what I was doing, so it's not a matter of having to look for a roadblock where I was going to be choosing my place to hide, it's not that -- those were not the circumstances at the time, Counsel.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the question is as follows.  This is a dangerous time.  Why hide close to a roadblock, which is a particularly dangerous place?
@THE WITNESS:
I was looking for a passage to be able to get somewhere to look for something to eat.  It was not my intention at all to hide in this place, Mr. President.  I was looking for a passage, and when I realised that day was going to break I hid myself there so that I'm not seen until nightfall.  And when it was dark again I decided to leave that place.  So, my point is it was not my intention to hide myself next to that -- close to that roadblock.  
Let me repeat that I was looking for a passage when I realised that it was daybreak.  I hid myself there.  That was the second time I did that, and no one knew.  So please understand me, 
Mr. President.  Those are the circumstances under which I found myself.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
A week before you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on that roadblock you had already passed close to that same roadblock.  You, therefore, should have realised it was a dangerous place.  Why, then, did you pass there a second time?
@A.
There are other roadblocks after this roadblock, in fact, there are three, to be more specific.  However, I had identified a passage around that place, and that is why I passed there the second time, to be able to get where I was going to look for food.  It would have been a problem if I had said that I passed there a third time during that period.  I passed there twice, because I had identified a passage there.
@MR. BESNIER:
On the two occasions that you passed close to the roadblock you stayed there for a while to spy on those manning the roadblock to see what was happening.  
@A.
Since it was daylight I could not continue on my way.   I remained where I found myself and I listened attentively.  Given the circumstances, I could not sleep.  I had to listen.  I had to listen to what was happening to know if death was waiting for me.  And since I found myself in that place, I had to listen.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it not correct to say that the first time you passed close to that roadblock you saw a conseiller called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
@A.
Yes, I saw him, he's a neighbour.  He's not someone who comes from afar.  He lives there.  He still lives there.  He was detained and he's released and he lives in his house currently.
@MR. BESNIER:
This man, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), which secteur was he conseiller of?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Objection, Your Honour.  The answer might reveal -
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, Mr. Witness.  Just a moment.  Just a moment.  The answer can be a bit risky.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.  Because of the apparent relationship between this witness's residence and this man's residence I've actually written the name of that gentleman on a piece of paper.  If we can just refer to it that way (unintelligible).
@MR. BESNIER:
$Not interpreted)
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, my question is which secteur is Mr. (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) conseiller of?  I wish that the witness himself writes the name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a piece of paper in front of you, Mr. Witness, where you can write down the name of the secteur?  Do you have that in front of you now?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Writing down the name of the secteur is not really going to be of assistance; having named that individual and having allowed the witness to draw a relationship between him and that individual really is neither here nor there.  My learned friend keeps mentioning that name and I would hope he would avoid doing that.  That's the point I that I make.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So your point, Mr. Phillips, is that we should strike the reference to the name?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is why I have given him the piece of paper with that name on it, so he can refer to it so you then draw the link.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have now the name of the person in front of you, haven't you, Mr. Witness?  Just answer my question, please.  Do you have a piece of paper with a name on it, not the location, just the name of a person?  Yes or no.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, the name is there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
@THE WITNESS:
If it's the identity of the person, I can give you details.  He was detained, released, and now living in his house.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on a moment now.  
We will delete the reference to the name from the court video system again and we will place it under seal from the transcripts there. 
Now, Mr. Witness, listen then to the question from defence counsel.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
$Not interpreted)
@THE INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Your Honour, we didn't hear.  There was a technical problem.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we shall ask the following question.  From which secteur did the person whose name is on that piece of paper -- from which secteur did he come?  In which secteur did he hold his position?  That is the question.
@THE WITNESS:
He was the ************************ secteur.  He went there often to attend communal meetings.  After the war he was detained, later on released, and lives currently in his house.  
Is there really any reason in writing all that, for me to write it?
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Witness, you've answered the question.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, in your written statement you said that this person, this conseiller, was giving orders to **************************, who was an Interahamwe.  Is that correct?
@A.
Are you referring to this man whose first name is Pierre?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, it is that person. 
@A.
He gave orders to ******** adding that he had to man a roadblock.  Pierre had been a military officer and knew how to man a roadblock.  When he left the army he became a conseiller.  If you are interested I can give you personal information.  He's confessed the crimes he committed and currently he is peacefully living in his house.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you listened to this conversation between Pierre, between him and ***********?
@A.
Yes, I listened to this conversation.  In fact, he didn't say much in that regard.
@MR. BESNIER:
On that day were you in the same hiding place where you were when you listened to 
Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes.  That is where I was and I realised that -- I remembered that I passed through that area on two occasions, that sticks in my memory.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were cars going through the roadblock at that time?
@A.
Yes, vehicles were passing but after being searched.  It was not possible for vehicles to pass through the roadblock without being searched.
@MR. BESNIER:
In general, were there a lot of people around the roadblock, I mean people, ordinary people?
@A.
Yes, there were a number of people.  Close by there was a bar.  People were drinking, taking all sorts of drinks there, sorghum beer, banana wine and so on.
@MR. BESNIER:
And people who were in those bars, to your knowledge, were they Interahamwes?
@A.
If they were Interahamwes then it will be Hassan, who was carrying a weapon.  There was also Abdullah and Mirasano; in other words, the others were members of the population who were being led by these chiefs, these leaders.
@MR. BESNIER:
The day Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, according to you, were on that roadblock, were there a lot of people around the roadblock?
@A.
In the neighbourhood of the roadblock there were people who had taken positions based on the instructions given by the first person in the bar.  There were other people who had taken drinks and who were taking the attendance.  That was the practice.  It was Hassan who was giving the instructions and who was appointing the teams that should take their turns.  I think I have spoken about this sufficiently.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question now is simply the following.  Were there many persons around the roadblock when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi on that second occasion?  And that question can be answered with a yes or no.  Were there many around there?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were many.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Were there a lot of people in the bars that you referred to, as well?
@A.
Yes, there were people who were drinking.  All the inhabitants of the cellule were either in the bar or in the proximity of the bar and were drinking.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it correct that somebody said to the people who were in the bar that the minister had just arrived?
@A.
You see, a minister is an influential person.  Let's not even talk about a minister.  Let's say a conseiller.  When a conseiller arrives in a place the entire population is called.  It is, therefore, not possible that a minister will arrive and a person manning the roadblock will not call the other members of the population.  Everybody came and listened to him.
@MR. BESNIER:
No.  My question is more specific.  Listen to me carefully. 
Is it correct that somebody told the people in the bar that the minister had just arrived?  Yes or no.
@A.
Yes, that one, Hassan Biyungoma, spoke to the people who were in the neighbourhood, as well as those in the bar.  He told them, "Come, it is true."
@MR. BESNIER:
How do you know?  Were you in the bar yourself?
@A.
No, when I heard this I was at the distance that I had indicated.  I could not go to the bar.  I could hear this from my hiding place, and I could see this from my hiding place.  I could not get close to those persons.
@MR. BESNIER:
And from your hiding place, which was about 35 metres, you were able to hear a conversation which took place in a bar?  Is that what you're saying?
@A.
No, he did not go into the bar.  He called them from where he was, from the roadblock.  In fact, an officer of his status cannot go to the ordinary citizens.  He called them from the road, close to his vehicle.
@MR. BESNIER:
So, Biyungoma shouted from the roadside and people in the back came out, is that it?
@A.
Well, he was not more than five or six metres from the bar.  Everybody was there and when he spoke to them they came closer to him.  They listened to what he was telling them, the instructions he was giving them, and then he went back, he left. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi very well acclaimed during the time that he was at the roadblock?
@A.
He ought to be congratulated.  When somebody refused -- when somebody who's known his wife to be killed, his cattle are attacked, and they are attacking his property, and he asked for this person who has been saved be killed as well.
@MR. BESNIER:
And since you said that there were a lot of people around the roadblock, ordinary people around the roadblock, and that there were a lot of people in the bar, as well, then it would mean that there were a lot of people around Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Is that not true?
@A.
I will answer yes, Counsel.  That is very true.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you yourself from your hiding place, which is at about 35 metres from the road, you are able to distinctively see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and recognise him?
@A.
Yes.  Initially I identified him; and, secondly, they themselves said it when they said the minister has arrived.  Now, with these two elements I can say that we had identified him.  There's myself who identified him and the other persons, his collaborators, who also identified him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Hold on a moment.  Did you personally identify him or you identified him by hearing people say that the minister had arrived?
@A.
He arrived at the place.  The vehicle came to a stop.  He opened the door of his car and came out.  He greeted Hassan, asked him if he knew him.  Hassan answered, "Yes, I remember you."  And the minister said, "I am the minister." And when he said those words I tried to look closely at him to be able to identify him, and I realised that it was him.  And the person I'm seeing today is that very same person I saw that day.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are now saying that he first spoke to Hassan Biyungoma, asking whether he knew him?
@A.
Well, he exchanged a few words.  Hassan Biyungoma spoke to the other members of the population, he felt it would be a vehicle with Tutsis aboard so that they can kill them.  Hassan Biyungoma told him that it was the minister.  So they came around, they off-loaded the weapons.  I think I said this initially.  And he told them what they should do with the weapons.  I think I said this on several occasions.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you did not make the reference between Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and Hassan Biyungoma.  While they were exchanging words of welcome, were they shouting out loud?
@A.
Well, he spoke out loud, even Hassan Biyungoma spoke out loudly so that everyone, people in the neighbourhood of the bridge can come around.  
People speak in a low tone when they are bandits, thieves, but somebody who is doing his legitimate work speaks out loud because he doesn't have any problem.
@MR. BESNIER:
And when they greeted each other were they shouting at each other?  Was that really necessary?
@A.
It is not a formal greeting.  A minister will not go and embrace somebody of a lower status.  He asked him what is happening?  What is happening now?  Now, an influential person would not engage into formal greetings when he's talking to ordinary members of the population.  People expect only orders from such people.
@MR. BESNIER:
If I understand you clearly, in the stay of Ndindabahizi at that roadblock he and  Biyungoma and the other members of the population did not stop shouting and screaming, is that correct?
@A.
In less than a minute everybody had come around him, those who were lying down.  There was no formality.  Everybody ran to the place just like an order.  What is the situation?  And he answered in his own way.  There was no conversation, as such, conversation between two individuals. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness, you've told the Court that you were hiding about 35 metres away, that you were lying on the ground and that you covered yourself with grass.  Did you have to uproot this grass or this bush and cover yourself with it or you just found it on the ground?  Can you explain a little?
@A.
This is a bush about the height of this stand in this table in front of me.  Bushes can get very tall, but at that time their attention was focused on the minister and I had the opportunity to listen to them.  This is not something that was reported to me, this is something I witnessed.
@MR. BESNIER:
The bushes you are talking about, did they extend from your hiding place all the way to the roadblock?
@A.
Yes.  These are bushes which grow along the road.  Currently the road is tarred, but there are traces of these bushes.  Unfortunately, it is not possible but if we go to the place I can show them to you.  You can hide yourself there and spend hours there without being seen; even though people are passing close to the place you can hide yourself there for a long time without being seen by anybody.  Unfortunately, it is not possible; otherwise, I would take you to the place and show you the place.  There are still traces of these bushes.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying, Witness, what the approximate height of these bushes, you said they were about the height of the table in front of you?
@A.
Yes, about the height of this table in front of me, and you can hide in there without being seen.  Regarding hiding places, you hide yourself when there is a serious problem, so these are bushes which are about the height of this table.  You can hide in there without being seen by anybody.

$BY MR. BESNIER: 
@MR. BESNIER:
So you were hiding in these tall bushes about 35 metres away, and yet you were able to see every detail of what was happening at the roadblock.  How were you able to see what was happening in these circumstances?
@A.
See what was happening?  If you really want to know, members of the population were called.  I got up.  The vehicle stopped.  Men -- I bent down and I -- to see if they were searching the vehicle, and then I realised at the time that the members of the population were looking at the Accused.  I took the opportunity to examine him, and they started exchanging a few words, laughing, and they were saying that, "Now we are going to take care of the people that we were asked not to killed."
@MR. BESNIER:
A while ago you said that you were lying down and you had bushes on top of you.  So, were you lying down, crouched, or in any other position?
@A.
Even here if I lie down, I can still hear what you are saying.  And when I had bushes covering me, I can still see you and I can clearly examine you.  And when you are hiding in a bush, you are like a wild animal, and a wild animal can see far.  I saw him.  I clearly saw him; I clearly examined him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, you did not answer a question that the President put to you.  The question was as follows:  What was your age when you were in your second year at primary school?
@A.
The normal schooling age is six years, and at seven years you are in Primary 2.  Besides, a child of five years who sees somebody often can recognise and identify the person.  When he sees somebody often, he will -- he knows him, a child of five years.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it then be correct, Witness, to see -- to say that you were about seven years old when you saw 
Mr. Ndindabahizi for the first time?
@A.
Could you please repeat the question?
@MR. BESNIER:
Certainly.  Would it be correct to say that you were about seven years old when you first knew 
Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Are you referring to the month of April or when I was still young?
@MR. BESNIER:
While you were still young.
@A.
When I was young, I saw him; and when I was a young man, I also saw him.  He was working at Trafipro.  In fact, our secteurs are the same, and he himself knows that.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  You said that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi almost every time you went to the Kibuye Trafipro; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.  You can proceed, Counsel, I will ask you -- answer you.  I stated that I went there when I was transporting coffee for my parents or when I went for provisions, but it wasn't every day that I went to Kibuye.  If I was going to Kibuye, that would mean I was a street child, but it was once or twice a month that I would go there, and I had reasons for going there.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement, in the second paragraph thereof, you state, "I knew -- I know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi well because we both are from Gitesi commune, and he was also a teacher at the school where I was a student."  What exactly did you mean by saying he was also a teacher at the school which you attended?
@A.
He taught at that school for some days only.  It was a few days.  Later on I don't know where he went, but I got to know that he was working at Trafipro.  He was at that school for only a few days, and that school is situated in his native secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
You never personally saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Trafipro, you only heard about him being there?
@A.
If I said that I heard mention made about it, I would have been able to tell you who told me.  Can the Accused himself deny that he didn't work at Trafipro?  No one told me about this, and he himself can tell you that he worked at Trafipro.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement, following the sentence I just read to you dealing with the school, you said, "During the period before the genocide, I did not see Ndindabahizi at all, either in my commune or in areas around.  I learned that in this period he lived in Kigali."  Would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that you did not see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at any point in time since the time you were in your second year of primary school until April 1994?  Would that be correct?
@A.
I explained to you that I saw him again when he was working at Trafipro.  I did not say that I never saw him again since I was in my second year of primary school.  I saw him when he was working at Trafipro, but after that I didn't hear of him.  But I just learned that he had become a minister, and I only learned of that in May during the war, and it was in May that I saw him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why, when the investigators of the Tribunal asked you how you knew Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, why did you not say -- why did you not tell them that you had seen him on several occasions at Trafipro?
@A.
What I told you with regard to Trafipro is -- if I didn't say that in my written statement, I can tell you today, because one cannot say everything.  And the Accused himself knows that he worked at Trafipro, and if I didn't mention it in my statement, I don't think that's a problem.
@MR. BESNIER:
That is not of essence right now, but Mr. Ndindabahizi will contest having worked at Trafipro.  
Why do you say in your statement that you never saw Mr. Ndindabahizi between the time of the genocide?  Why did you not say that you saw him on several occasions at Trafipro?
@A.
During President Habyarimana's term of office, the Accused worked for Trafipro, but in the meantime I did not see him again.  Subsequently, Trafipro went bankrupt, and I saw him again during the genocide.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you speaking about the Kibuye Trafipro or the Kigali Trafipro?
@A.
When you worked for Trafipro, you could be in Kigali today and tomorrow you could be sent to Cyangugu, but I didn't seek to know where he was based.
@MR. BESNIER:
I no longer remember what you claim, whether you heard him -- whether you had heard him or seen him, was it at the Trafipro in Kigali or the one in Kibuye?
@A.
He worked at Trafipro but only for a short time, and I didn't see him again.  Since he was someone who was educated, he went up the grades.  So I don't know how he went up in life, but I would go to Trafipro to take coffee there or to go and make purchases, and it wasn't on a daily basis that I went to Trafipro.
@MR. BESNIER:
Which Trafipro did you go to, Mr. Witness, in which préfecture?
@A.
I didn't go into any other préfecture apart from that of Kibuye.  I never set foot in any other préfecture.  As old as I am, I only remained in Kibuye préfecture.  A long journey that I've ever made is to come here for this testimony; otherwise, I always remained in my native area.
@MR. BESNIER:
In fact, this my last question, Mr. Witness, and you'll only have to give me a figure:  How old are you?
@A.
You are talking about now?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.
@A.
I am 43 years old, but at a given point in time my age was reduced for educational purposes because you know Tutsi children had problems, so my age was reduced.
@MR. BESNIER: 
Very well, Mr. President, I have finished with my cross-examination of this witness.  I have two documents which I wish to tender as exhibits.  The first one is the witness's statement, the written statement, which is dated 27th February 2001, in particular, with reference to his identification of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's D number 10?  D10A for the English, which is signed; D10B for the French.  Yes, admitted under seal.
$Exhibit Nos. D10A and D10B admitted, under seal)
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  My second document which I wish to tender as an exhibit is the witness statement in which the name ************************ appears.  I think we need to go back to that matter, question other witnesses on that aspect, and therefore I wish to tender it as a Defence exhibit, 
Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is that in one or two languages?
@MR. BESNIER:
I only have it in English, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, if you could have a look at it.  I assume that's also available in two languages, even if there is only English available now.  
So for the time being, we will then accept this as D11, the English version being signed by the witness; and if ever there should be a French version, we will add it as 
D11B.  Thank very much thank you. 
$Exhibit No. D11 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, please.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question before your re-examination. 
Mr. Witness, I wanted to take you back to the roadblock which you passed a second time.  I just want some assistance.  At what point did you realise that the person who had come out of the vehicle and was addressing the gathering was the Accused?  Was it when you saw him get out of the car, was it when his name was mentioned by Hassan as they greeted, or when he was introduced? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is asking whether the question is directed to -- at him, whether he is the one to answer.
@THE WITNESS: 
When Ndindabahizi arrived at that roadblock, he stopped, and I have testified to that previously.  He opened the door which is on the right side, and he talked with Hassan Byiyingoma, Byiyingoma.  Byiyingoma assembled the people who were in that place, as well as those who were in the bar.  So you wanted to know when I recognised Ndindabahizi, at the time when he was speaking with Hassan or when he was leaving his vehicle?
@JUDGE BOSSA:
When did you first realise that, yes, this is him? 
@THE WITNESS: 
When he came out of the vehicle I recognised him, and when he was speaking with Hassan I also recognised him.  And when the people there gathered around, I looked at his face closely because I hadn't seen him for a long time, and when you take a long time in seeing someone, you try and look closely to see whether you can identify him.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes, thank you. 
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that when Ndindabahizi's vehicle arrived at that roadblock, it was only Hassan that was standing manning that roadblock, the others were not there?  Isn't that true?
@A.
The other people were lying down in the area close by the bridge, and Hassan was manning the roadblock and he was standing.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, the others were lying down in the plantation because they were lying in ambush, were they not?  That was the plan.  Hassan was standing by the roadblock, and the two other men were lying in ambush, were they not?  Yes or no, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, these people had received instructions from this man who was the conseiller of the secteur.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct.  So having realised that the person in the vehicle was the minister and not a Tutsi, wasn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that Hassan then called out to those laying in ambush?  Was that not the case, yes or no, Mr. Witness?
@A.
He called out to all these people who were in the neighbourhood and who were listening so that they could come and listen to the minister.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  No further questions. 
@THE WITNESS:  
I am sorry, people who were waiting. 
$BY ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What about those in the ambush, didn't they have had to up (sic) of where they had been hiding, lying down in ambush?
@A.
Yes, everyone came out.  Those who were in the bars, they were many.  And they wanted to listen to the instruction, instructions from a person of great authority coming from Kigali.
@ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Exactly.  So Hassan had to inform them that the person who had arrived at the roadblock, 
Mr. Witness, was no ordinary Tutsi but was the minister.  Was that not what happened?
@A.
Yes, he was a minister, and the situation was as I have said:  He called those who were around so that they could hear the minister's instructions.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  No further questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, this green vehicle, were there any persons inside the green vehicle?
@THE WITNESS: 
The vehicle could not have been moving on its own, there must have been people in there, but I didn't recognise them.  If I had recognised them, I would have told you, but those who were in that vehicle didn't come out, and the vehicle wasn't even searched.  
You know, Hassan studied at Nyakatovo.  He knew the Accused, and he went to school in the Accused's native area.  At Nyakatovo there is Protestant centre.  Hassan Byiyingoma knows the Accused very well because he went to that school up to his sixth year in primary, and it was close to Kirambo.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you didn't see anyone come out of the green vehicle, is that your answer to my question?
@THE WITNESS: 
No, the occupants of that vehicle did not come down.  I wouldn't say that such and such a person came out of that vehicle.  No, they remained in the vehicle. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
For how long did this episode last?  According to you, you see the vehicles arriving -- just a moment, the question is not finished.  
You see the vehicle arriving, something is going on, and then these persons you say are the Accused -- is the person you say is the Accused, then he leaves.  How much time passed from when the vehicles arrived until the white vehicle disappeared? 
@THE WITNESS: 
It was only a short lapse of time.  He spoke to them, and it was as if he was someone who was in a hurry to go away again.  I would say the episode would have lasted between five to six minutes.  He went back into the vehicle and left.  So if I were to make an estimate, I would say between five and six minutes, and he went back into the car and left.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said that you saw the Accused at Trafipro before 1994.  Now, did you see that person in the 1990s or in the 1980s?
@THE WITNESS: 
I saw him during the first years of President Habyarimana's reign; subsequently, I didn't see him again.  Later on, I was to learn that he became minister.  I only saw him again at the time when he was presented as being minister.  I didn't even know what portfolio he held.  Normally in the 1970s, '75, '76, it was then that I saw him under President Habyarimana's regime; otherwise, his ascension into these various jobs I wasn't aware, because I was a mere peasant and, you know, he was someone who was intelligent, had gone to school, and he went up in grades.

@JUDGE MØSE:
So are you telling us that the period during which you saw the Accused at Trafipro was in the 1970s? 
@THE WITNESS:
Just when President Habyarimana took power, because in 1970 he had not yet gone -- become president.  But it was just at the beginning of President Habyarimana's regime that I saw him at Trafipro.  Subsequently, I didn't see him because he went up in the ranks and that really wasn't of any concern to me because it wasn't of any interest to me.  I'm saying the truth, Your Honours, kindly believe because one cannot be killed because of speaking the truth.
@JUDGE MØSE:
When we are asking questions in this courtroom, and that goes for all of us -- all of us, it's not because we are necessarily saying that someone is not saying the truth or not, and that is only to clarify, to find out what happened. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Your testimony has now come to an end.  We wish to thank you for having come to Arusha to give evidence before this Tribunal, and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much, indeed.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If the Registry could assist the witness. 
Before we do that, do we have witnesses waiting outside here, Mr. Phillips? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have just sent him back in the last hour and a half.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So your suggestion is it? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that we wrap it up slightly earlier today.  It's almost twenty-five to seven.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a problem -- there may be a problem in the military case because of illness of one Defence counsel tomorrow.  We do not know whether we will sit or not.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if we do not sit -
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- could we then spend part of the morning in this case, say from 11:00?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In lieu of the afternoon session or as well as the afternoon session?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
As well as.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Slight problem, Your Honour: There is only one witness.  Two witnesses were brought over the weekend, this witness and the next witness.  The third witness for the week -- the third and last witness for the week only arrived this evening, so we haven't seen him or her yet.  We were hoping to do that tomorrow morning.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you need that time to prepare the witness.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, to prepare that third witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, that brings us to three witnesses.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Leaving aside the expert witness, and in view of the situation which you have just prescribed --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- how many witnesses are now left? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have -- there is a slight issue in relation to -- we certainly have -- well, let me answer Your Honour's question first.  
We certainly have Witness No. 11, who is a detained witness and its --his availability is subject to a 90bis order.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, let me say that right away, that the 90bis order has been signed and finished.  We had a little bit problem because the written motion didn't give a lot of details as to the basis for the conditions in 90bis, but we were able to receive supplementary information and now that has been dealt with.  
And let me say also to the Defence that the other motion which was mentioned last week, the protection of witnesses, has been disposed of.  So both these motions pending in the Ndindabahizi case are now dealt with.
Please proceed, Mr. Phillips.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So we would have, for definite then, Witness No. 11, Witness No. 14.  In relation to 14, there was an issue and I made representations to Your Honour earlier.  The witness did arrive, turned out to be somebody with the same name but it wasn't the witness that we, you know, obviously by the time we compared the personal details with the witness on the ground it turned out to be somebody else.  So, he is here in Arusha.  He is not the person that we have asked them to bring.  There is another witness with exactly the same name but with different particulars.  So that's why we have -- we don't offer him to Your Honours this week.  So we hope to get the real Witness 14.
So that's 11, 14, the next witness is Witness 15, so that's dealt with already.  Witness 16 is the witness that arrived -- that will arrive this evening if she hasn't already arrived, and the expert.  We then have an issue with Witness 10 or Witness 17.  
Now, Your Honours will recall that I had represented to you last week that I was not proposing -- I was proposing not to call one or two of -- one of those witnesses, either CGB or CGD; they testify on the same event.  The only reason why I would call CGB -- that is, Charlie-Gulf-Bravo -- which is No. 10, is that having perused the indictment, we have used the name of Tatiane Nyiramaritetie interchangeably with her real name.  Whilst I'm satisfied about the evidence adduced in relation to that event, I am not satisfied that I sufficiently established that it is the same person that is referred to by those two names.  And the only reason why I'd be calling Witness 10 before this Court is to establish that point, and that's simply because the other witnesses have said, "Well, we know she has another name but we don't know what that name is".  And I didn't want to suggest that name to any of the other witnesses.  
Therefore, if my learned friends for the Defence are willing to stipulate that they accept that it's the same person that bears both names, then I can dispense with that witness.  However, if they don't -- if they are not able to so stipulate, then I have to call Witness CGB to establish, just to establish that point.  And that's really, honestly the reason why I'd be calling that witness, to establish that he knows that person by another name, Mukantabane, as well as Nyiramaritetie, which, if you look at the indictment, some paragraphs mention her by her nickname which at the time we drafted the indictment we had no way of knowing it was a nickname, but luckily we also allege the real name.  So that's -- that's my dilemma in relation to Witness CGB.  So, in effect, we have one, two -- another four witnesses left, without calling CGB.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And 17?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Seventeen, it's either or, Your honour. It's either I call CGB or I call CGD because they pretty much say the same thing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's your discretion.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yeah, that's my discussion (sic).  It's one or the other, or I'll drop both.  If the stipulation comes then I'll drop both, because they don't really add anything to my case.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence team want to say anything about this issue now, this question raised by the Prosecution?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  In actual fact, we ourselves are aware of this problem and I was looking for the appropriate moment to talk about it.  
I think the problem goes beyond the identity of a person.  The difficulty is the indictment itself.  We have charges against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi during the death of Tatiane Nyiramaritetie, killed on a specific date, April 1994, paragraph 26 of the indictment.  But we also have charges against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in relation to the death of Mukantabane in May 1994, and that is paragraph 27th -- 27 of the indictment.  In other words, the confusion between Nyiramarietetie and Mukantabane are found in the indictment, but there are many charges -- different charges against Ndindabahizi at different dates.  
Well, I would be glad to know that Nyiramaritetie and Mukantabane are the same -- one and the same -- is one and the same person, but then that would impact on the indictment.  If the Prosecutor would withdraw all paragraphs of the indictment that refer to Tatiane Nyiramaritetie and Mukantabane, then we would agree.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, it's not really a problem for me.  I mean, this is just about calling either Witness No. 10 or Witness No. 17.  The issue is now going beyond.  Obviously it's -- I can deal with this problems in half and hour just by putting the witness in the box and asking a few questions, and it solves my problem.  So the other issues raised by my learned friend are for closing arguments, and he is well within his rights to assume any legal or factual position that he wants to, but I have a dilemma which I want to solve, and it impacts on Your Honours' timetable.  
So the honest answer is that I will be calling Witness No. 10, following the representation made by my learned friend.  I will drop 17 and call 10.  And so, Your Honours will have 10, 11, 14, 15, 16.  We will take Witness No. 15 tomorrow.  We would take Witness No. 16 the day after, and it then remains to be seen when witness Nos. 10, 11, 14, can be brought to Arusha, certainly not this week.  The earliest that I imagine they would come would be this Friday.  Therefore, next week you would have 10, 11 and 14, plus the expert.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have had few witnesses every week, haven't we?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, regrettably, yes.  I was hoping if we could finish on Friday but we've had logistical problems, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you hear 15 and 16 tomorrow?  The reason why I'm asking this is that of course then one can plan the Military Trial in a different way so as to use -- I can simply inform that trial that we will go full time, say on Thursday.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I could hear witness, um  -- it's difficult, Your Honour, having not met with this witness.  It's very difficult.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And she is not actually one of those who I met in the field actually, so I've never -- never met her.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so we'll come back to it tomorrow, see how it develops.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, then we have no choice, unfortunately.  We start tomorrow, normal time 2:00, with 
Witness 15, and hopefully we can continue with Witness 16, and then we will see how it develops with the last three witnesses.  And then we are still not absolutely sure that we need to hear the expert witness.  So, please think about that.  
Defence? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I just want to draw the attention of the Registry to the fact that we still do not have the French version of Ms. Alison Des Forges' report, and without that we are going to have problems understanding all the shades of the meanings contained therein.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  This was raised last week and could you -- I think you mentioned, Mr. Pillips, that her report was, to some extent, based on previous larger reports.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  It's actually a cut and paste --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And those reports are of course available in both languages.  So maybe you could assist a little bit to see whether these passages from the brief report have already been translated.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, I spoke to the Language section on Thursday last week, and I got the impression that they accept that this is a cut and paste job from other broader reports.  So I really don't see what the problem is.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but they haven't produced? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Registry, will you please now get in touch with the chief of the Language section and make sure that the Defence gets it.  If we have to hear this witness, then the Defence must have it in French.  And if you are in doubt as to exactly which portions this report is being inspired from in different previous reports, then please get in touch with Mr. Phillips.  But please let us have the result now.  All right?  Thank you.  
That's very good.  We meet tomorrow then, thank you.  
Court is adjourned.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, where were you living when the president died on the 6th of April l994?
@A.
I was living in the Gasero locality.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Is that place in Gitesi commune?
@A.
Yes, it is in the Gitesi commune.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, following the death of the president, did violence break out in your area?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell the Court what violence you observed, Mr. Witness, during the first week following the death of the president?
@A.
Following the death of the president, our Hutu neighbours chased us out and we sought refuge elsewhere.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know why your good neighbours chased you from your areas?
@A.
They wanted to kill us and then appropriate our property.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did there come a time, Mr. Witness, that you sought refuge at Gitwa Hill?
@A.
No, it was the Gitwa Hill, and that is where we went.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was there a particular reason why you chose this particular place to go and hide, Mr. Witness?
@A.
We were chased out of our houses.  We lived at the foot of a hill, and we went on the hill, and those who attacked us, attacked us from the foot of the hill, and we decided to go up to the summit of the hill.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell the Court the approximate time you went to seek refuge at Gitwa Hill?
@A.
It was around the 15th April l994.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you go there alone or with members of your family, Mr. Witness?
@A.
We were many who went there.  I went with my entire family as well as my neighbours.
@MR. KAPAYA:
When you talk of your family, who do you -- who are the people that are included as members of your family?  Don't mention names, just mention their relationship.
@A.
My children, my wife, my big brother's children, as well as my cousins, then, of course, the neighbours.  Everybody left his house and we went to Gitwa.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, do you know a person by the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I know him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell the Chamber when you first got to know him?
@A.
I got to know him when he was working at the Kibuye Trafipro.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us the period in which Mr. Ndindabahizi was working at the KibuyeTrafipro?
@A.
It was in 1980.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was it during the first part of the 1980s or the second part just after -- was it between 1980/85 or 1985/89?
@A.
In 1985 I used to go to Kibuye in the Trafipro shop to buy some clothing items.  There were people who were working there, but they said that he was the manager of Trafipro.
@MR. KAPAYA:
During that period, Mr. Witness, were you living in your own house or you were living with somebody?
@A.
I was still a bachelor and I lived in my parents' house.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Considering the year you were born, would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that you were in your 20s during the 1980s?
@A.
Yes, I was 23 years old.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, what kind of provisions were you buying - were you going to buy at the Trafipro during that period?
@A.
I was going to buy clothes for my younger brothers.  My father had died already, and my mother would send me to go and buy clothes or salt -- or soap, because their prices were low.  So these were the kind of items that I bought from Trafipro.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us now how you knew that Mr. Ndindabahizi was working at that place at that time when you went to buy those provisions?
@A.
I should know, because I was living in an urban cellule and when somebody is a bourgmestre or préfet in the area you lived in, you should know.  I was living in the urban cellule in which the tower was located.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us what exactly Mr. Ndindabahizi was doing in Trafipro?
@A.
He was manager -- he was shop manager at Trafipro.
@MR. KAPAYA:
How did you know, Mr. Witness, that he was the shop manager in that shop?
@A.
There were tailors who were sewing clothes there, and when I was passing by or whenever I went there to collect clothes, I had the opportunity to know the people who were working there.  That is how I came to know.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  You have testified that following the outbreak of violence in your -- the locality you lived, you went to Gitwa Hill.  Can you tell us, approximately, when you moved to Gitwa Hill?
@A.
On the 15th, that is the day I got to the Gitwa Hill.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, while at Gitwa Hill, did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I saw him there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
How long was it after you had gone to Gitwa Hill, when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I had spent about two days there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now where were you located when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I was at Gitwa Hill, which is close to the road; Ndindabahizi arrived around 2 p.m. in a white vehicle.  There was another green vehicle.  He was holding a grenade, and he had other grenades attached to his belt.  Aboard the green vehicle, there were soldiers and Interahamwe, and there were grenades as well aboard that vehicle.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, can you tell us how many people were in the white Toyota?
@A.
Most of the people involved were aboard the green vehicle, and aboard the white vehicle there was Ndindabahizi and the driver.  There were two of them in that vehicle.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us how many soldiers and Interahamwe were in the green Daihatsu?
@A.
There were many.  I was not able to count them.  When you are being attacked, you do not have the time to count your attackers.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, you described the people who were in the Daihatsu as soldiers and Interahamwe, how do you know they are soldiers and who is the Interahamwe?
@A.
The Interahamwe were wearing white clothes, and the soldiers were in military uniform.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, what else was -- apart from people, what else was in those vehicles?  What else did you see?
@A.
Grenades were off-loaded from -- grenades and ammunitions were off-loaded from that vehicle.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What kind of ammunition did you observe, Mr. Witness, and from which vehicle?
@A.
These ammunitions were off-loaded from the green vehicle.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, while this was going on, did Mr. Ndindabahizi say anything?  Did you hear him say anything or do anything?
@A.
These people came out.  They had already come out of the vehicle, they parked the vehicle and they got close to him, and you understand that a meeting was going to take place there.  When they got close to him, they stood at a distance, and Ndindabahizi then threw a grenade and we dispersed.  There was a certain Jean who was the agronomist of the commune, and he said that, "Has Ndindabahizi also come to kill us?"  We then left, because the Interahamwe were chasing us.
These are the circumstances under which I saw Ndindabahizi.  It was in the afternoon, not in the morning.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Witness, you have stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi was in a crowd of many attackers.  How were you able to recognise him?
@A.
He was the first to get out of his white vehicle together with his driver.  I identified him because I had known him since the '80s.  Well, obviously I hadn't seen him for a long time when he went to Kigali.  I saw him again during the war after the death of President Habyarimana.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, in your statement of 6th of April -- of 4th June 2001, you state that you got the impression that Mr. Ndindabahizi was the leader of the attackers.  Did you say that in your statement, Mr. Witness?
@A.
When he -- when the attackers got close to him and they got together, since he was a minister, the agronomist -- Jean, the agronomist recognised him and said, "You have to run."  There are soldiers and even Ndindabahizi has come from Kigali to kill the Tutsi."  People were killed.  Children and women were killed.  I managed to escape, and we went to the Karongi antenna, and in the evening we left the place.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, let me rephrase my question.  Did anything give you the impression -- an impression that among the attackers --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was in charge of the attackers, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
It was Ndindabahizi, because he was the most influential personality there.  He was a minister, and he was the leader.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Is there anything else that gave you an impression that Mr. Ndindabahizi was the leader of the group?
@A.
He was leading, he was the minister.  Indeed, he was like an assistant to Habyarimana, who is dead, and he came to his native préfecture to lead the attacks.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But what the Prosecutor wants to know is whether there was anything in the way he acted during that day which gave you the impression that he was the leader, or whether it was simply because you knew that he was a minister which gave you that impression.
@THE WITNESS:
No, there was nothing else.  He was the first person to get out of the vehicle; he was the first person to throw a grenade.  Following that, his men did the same and killed our people.  He was the first to throw the grenade.  If he had remained in Kigali, we would understand, but is it only in Kibuye that there are Tutsis?
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, after Mr. Ndindabahizi had come out of the vehicle and before the attack, can you tell us how long you observed him?
@A.
After he threw the grenade and the attackers ran after us, we all ran, including myself.  I could not stay on the spot, I ran.  People were falling, people were dying.  We didn't know where to go, and we realised that those who were expected to protect us were the ones who were killing us.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, my question is this:  Before you ran, how long had you been observing Mr. Ndindabahizi, that is, before he threw the grenade that made you run away?  For how long had you been observing him, that is, from the time he got out of the vehicle and to the time he threw the grenade.  Can you help us with that?
@A.
Not many minutes before these people started running after us.  I saw the Interahamwe and the soldiers come out.  They distributed the grenades.  How do you expect us to remain there when we know that the situation is serious?  Some were running faster than others.  We did not have any weapons, so we could not fight back the attackers.  So there was nothing to do apart from running.
Normally, soldiers will ensure the security of the people.  After the death of the president, there were ministers and members of parliament who attacked us.  We had no protection, and the purpose was to appropriate our belongings.  The person who killed the most number of people would be rewarded in terms of our belongings.  Our fate was sealed at that time.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you start to run before the grenade was thrown?
@THE WITNESS:
I ran after the grenade was thrown, and there were a lot of people.  The grenade was thrown on those people who were close to the one who threw the grenade.  Following that the attackers surrounded us.  Those being attacked spread around, they ran in various directions.  There were even guns.  There was a sub-machine gun positioned at the top of the hill and many people were killed  as a result of the bomb that was thrown.  There were various types of firearms.  A lot of people were killed on that occasion.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you wait a little bit, now, Witness?  Can you wait a little bit?  You see, you have a lot of information you want o tell us, but we have to take this step by step.
Now, you just told us that you started to run after the grenade was thrown, and Mr. Kapaya's first question was the following:  "For how long did you observe Mr. Ndindabahizi" --  or the person that you say is Mr. Ndindabahizi - "for how long did you observe that person until you started to run?"  Was it after one minute, more than one minute, less than one minute?  In other words, how much time passed -- I have not finished -- just a minute -- from the time when he got out of the car until you started to run.  Can you please help us with that?
@THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't say that a lot of time elapsed, maybe one minute.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, did you observe in which direction -- did Mr. Ndindabahizi stay on during the attack or did he leave when the attack was launched?
@A.
He went up with the Interahamwe.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you see him again in the course of that day?  Did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi in the course of that day?
@A.
It was in the evening.  I ran immediately I could see people falling, and I could not come back.  I continued running to the hill until night.  So I could not come back to the place.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, did members of your family survive that attack, Mr. Witness?
@A.
They are dead.
@MR. KAPAYA:
While at Gitwa, did you observe another attack after --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, these family members, did they die during the attack on that day, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.

@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, at Gitwa Hill, did you observe another attack after the attack you just described before this Tribunal?
@A.
Yes, there was another attack later on, but the first attack cost -- took the lives of my relatives, and the second attack took the lives of those who survived the first attack.
@MR. KAPAYA:
How long was the second attack from the first one?  How many days passed before the second attack took place?
@A.
I would say three days.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi during the second attack?
@A.
On that day I did not see him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
After the second attack, Mr. Witness, did you stay at Gitwa Hill or did you go to some other place?
@A.
The second attack eliminated everybody and there were only dead bodies on the hills.  And the very few survivors on the hill, together with myself, went to Bisesero.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell this Tribunal when you went to Bisesero?  About after how many days or weeks after the second attack did you go to Bisesero?
@A.
I stayed in the bush for four days, and the attackers started burning down the bush and chasing us with dogs, and the few survivors were running so as to escape from the Hutus who were looking for us.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What part of Bisesero did you go, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I went to the Muyira locality of the Bisesero region.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, while at Muyira, did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
No, on that day I did not see him.  Many soldiers and Interahamwe and Hutus carrying clubs and machetes came, accompanied by members of the presidential guard who had come from Kigali with buses and trucks.  A survivor, who was killed the following day, told me that he saw Ndindabahizi.  On that day the Interahamwe had encircled the hills and we did not know where to go.  There were so many attackers that we could not move.  There was even no bush to hide in.  I did not -- I therefore did not see the Accused at that place.  If I had seen him I would have told you.  However, I have told you that one Kayinanura, who died subsequently, told me that he saw the Accused.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, you have talked at length about Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Can you kindly describe his physical features, the way you remember he looked at the time you saw him?
@A.
He is a man of average height, with a short nose.  And his hair extends all the way to his forehead.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Would you say -- how would you place his age?  Would you say he is an old man, average, young man?
@A.
But I am not his father to know his age.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, if I asked you to look around in this Chamber to see whether he is around: can you do that, Mr. Witness?  Can you recognise Mr. Ndindabahizi if you saw him today?
@A.
Yes, I would know him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
With leave of the Chamber may the witness, Your Honour, stand up and look around and see whether he can recognise Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, would you kindly stand up and look around and see whether you can see anybody resembling Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I can see him there at the back to that side, but what I am saying here is not a fabric of lies.  I am talking about facts.  I have never lied about anybody.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, how he is dressed?
@A.
He is wearing a white shirt, and I can see that the colour of his vest is the same as that of my pullover -- almost the same.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour may the record reflect that the witness has identified the Accused person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would like to mention that the Accused is the only person of the male sex who is black and who is in civilian clothing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That is all I have for this witness, Your Honour.  Thank you very much.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Now, Witness, this attack at Muyira Hill, how many days passed from the last attack at Gitwa Hill until this Muyira Hill attack?
@THE WITNESS:
I didn't quite follow, you know, it is as if I had lost my head.  The situation didn't lend itself to -- I was trying to survive as much as I could and I was living from day to day, waiting for my death.  So I wasn't able to follow so that I can give you an exact duration.  I was living on a hill on which there were many, many dead bodies, and we were not counting days.  The situation continued to be what I have described to you until the arrival of the French.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you said in your testimony that, "I stayed in the bush for four days."  And what I want to know now is whether this attack at Muyira did then take place, rather, immediately after those four days or a certain number of days after those four days, so that we could have an approximate idea as to when the second attack was, this one at Muyira.  Can you help us with this, please?
@THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to the period when I was in Bisesero?  I spent four days at Gitwa and many people were exterminated there.  So we went down to the other hills, lower down where there were ruins.  In fact, most of the people had been killed at Gitwa, and there were very few survivors at Gitwa.  It was the few survivors who then went onwards to Bisesero, and in the ruins we were able to find something to eat.
When the Hutus of all the secteurs met, they decided to burn down the bushes and to chase away the survivors with the help of dogs.  So after the four days following he attack on Gitwa, the night of the fourth day, the few survivors went by night to Bisesero, and therefore, to Muyira.  And when we got to Muyira, what happened I have already described, and then the French found us there.
So that is how the events developed. Subsequently, at end of the war, we were settled in the various communes and the Interahamwe -- the Hutus who had chased us were arrested by the soldiers in the bushes where they were hiding.  They were arrested and put in prison.  We were then able to go back to our ruins.  That is how the events occurred.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So after those four days, then you moved on to Muyira Hill?  And would you say that the attack at Muyira Hill took place then in April or did it take place in May?
@THE WITNESS:
That attack took place in May.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the attack at Muyira Hill, the second attack where someone said that he saw Mr. Ndindabahizi, that was in May.  Is that your testimony, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was in May.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Defence, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  I am going to ask you a few questions.  I am the lawyer for
Mr. Ndindabahizi, and I am seeking some clarification from you.
I will begin with the continuation of the question put to you by the President.  How long did you remain in Bisesero, and or specifically, at Muyira Hill, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I remained in that place until the end of the war.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it correct to say that there were several attacks on Muyira Hill?
@A.
Yes, there were many attacks.  We were flushed out of the bushes until the time when the Interahamwe stopped attacking us and Hutu civilians took over in order to look for the few survivors in collaboration with the bourgmestres and the conseillers of the secteurs.  They set the bushes on fire and those who were lucky enough were not burned, and the French came at a given point in time to evacuate the wounded and take them to Zaire.  We were assembled in the same place, we were fed and were put on a vehicle and we were transported to a place known as Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Please listen carefully to the questions.  It is not necessary for you to go into a long explanation, just please be precise and give me short answers.  I would appreciate that.  Did you see at Muyira, that the attacks at Muyira Hill were of a larger scale than elsewhere?
Did you notice that?
@A.
At the time when we were chased from Muyira, the following day the attackers dispersed us from Muyira I can say that on those two occasions those were large-scale attacks, but, otherwise, there were several attacks and the whole hill had dead bodies on it.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Do you remember approximately the dates of these two wide - large-scale attacks on Muyira Hill?
@A.
We had kind of lost our heads, Counsel.  We didn't have a calendar to keep track of dates.  We didn't have a specific programme.  We were living waiting for death.  So we didn't have a heart to be keeping track of dates.
@MR. BESNIER:
Subsequently, the newspapers, television, refugees associations spoke, in particular, of two attacks at Muyira.  You didn't even notice what those dates were, even subsequent to the events themselves?
@A.
Is that referring to the month of April?  I am speaking about what I saw.  You are talking about newspapers, but I don't know about newspapers.  I am telling you what happened, and I was there in that place.  I didn't leave that place.  From the time I left Gitwa, I remained on Gitwa until the end of the war.  So I am explaining to you what I saw.  I didn't seek refugee anywhere else apart from Muyira.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  One small clarification -- one small point of clarification.  At the beginning of your testimony, you mentioned one Jean, the agronomist, who allegedly said that Ndindabahizi came to Gitwa.  You also spoke of Bisesero and you said that one Jean Kayinamura had said that he had seen Ndindabahizi.  Would that be the same person?
@A.
There are two different people, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, do you remember having made any written statements before the Tribunal's investigators, and if so, how many did you make?
@A.
Well, people would come and question me.  I didn't count the number of statements which I made.  The investigators would come to see me, they would tell me, "You know, one day you may be asked to testify in Arusha."  So I didn't count the number of times the investigators came to see me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you recall having seen the Tribunal investigators on several occasions?
@A.
I wouldn't really say many times.  I think that I saw them on three occasions, and today's occasion is the third - is the fourth occasion.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  In any case the Defence has two written statements which you made before the investigators of the Tribunal.  Would that situation seem to you probable or correct that they are indeed two statements?
@A.
I think that you should have three statements.  I made three statements.

1500H
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  The Defence only has two, and we have worked only on those two.  There is one which is dated 4th June 2001, and the second is the 26th April 2001.  So, in other words, just a little more than one month elapsed between the first and the second statements.  Was it you who asked to be interviewed again by the investigators after your first statement, or is it the investigators themselves who asked you to return?
@A.
They came back of their own initiative. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I'm asking you the question, Mr. Witness, because in your first witness statement -- in other words, that of the 26th April 2001 -- you said that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was simply watching the fighting at Gitwa, but in the second statement you state that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi participated in the fighting, threw grenades and distributed machetes.  Why did you wait for a whole month for you to make that revelation to the investigators?
@A.
I'm still insisting on what I told the investigators from the first time that they came to see me.  I don't know what you are talking about.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, do you think your representation to the witness concerning the first statement is absolutely correct; in other words, whether the statement of the 26th of April is absolutely clear as to how you summarised it? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  In fact, I'm going to quote from that statement in order to be specific.  In the statement from the 26th of April the witness said in the middle of the statement --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel please indicate which page?
@MR. BESNIER:
Page 172 of the French version and page 169 in the English version.  Now, on page 172 -- 173 in the French version the witness says:  "Throughout the attack Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was there, he was present, watching the fighting between the two belligerent parties".
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This is a free translation, because the interpreter has not yet found the English equivalent.  I'm sorry, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This French version, Maître, what are the first four words in French there on page 173?  Is it "Pendant tout la durée de l'attaque"?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, you are quite right, sir, it is "Pendant tout la durée de l'attaque".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So this would then be the last sentence, then, at the middle of the page; namely, counsel is drawing our attention to the English version, "The same afternoon", but then he is focusing on the last sentence of that paragraph which in English starts, "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present throughout all the period of the attack watching the fighting between the two adversaries". 
Mr Kapaya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  In the same paragraph, the third sentence.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Without reading it out now, you are now drawing our attention to the third sentence in that paragraph? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  Actually it shows that what counsel has represented to the witness is not correct.  It shows that Mr. Ndindabahizi didn't simply watch what was taking place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So maybe we would have to see the whole paragraph in context.  I suppose that is the solution here. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm not sure that I have the same version as the Prosecutor and the Judges.  I am referring to the document which is K0180696, that is my French version, and I do not seem to find the same paragraph in the English version.
Oh, yes.  I am at the sixth paragraph of the English version on page 169, paragraph 6.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And what Mr. Kapaya is drawing our attention to is the third line in that paragraph, and possibly also the first sentence.  So that is the problem if you focus on the last sentence.
Could you please proceed, Maître, in a way which takes into account these elements? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
So, now, in the first statement, Mr. Witness, you stated that two vehicles, including that belonging to Mr. Ndindabahizi, arrived transporting Interahamwe.  You also stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi came down from the vehicle with a grenade in his hand.  You also said that the two vehicles, including the one Ndindabahizi was in, were transporting the Interahamwe.  You further say they started attacking the refugees, first with grenades before they opened fire.  You stated that the survivors sought refuge to the top of the Gitwa Hill and that the attackers remained until 4 or 5 p.m. and they withdrew between 4 and 5 p.m., and then you end up by saying in that paragraph that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present throughout all the period of the attack, watching; in other words, looking at the fighting between the two adversaries. 
Right.  I think I have faithfully reproduced what you said.  And can you confirm that you did make such a statement to the investigators in the first instance?
@A.
Yes, I did say as much. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you.  Now, in the second statement, that one which is dated 4th June 1994 --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  I'm sure he means different.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
-- you say that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi distributed machetes and that he himself threw a grenade.  So these are two pieces of information which do not appear in your first statement.  The question was -- please wait for my question.
The question is:  why did you wait for a whole month and the return of the investigators to say that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi himself threw a grenade and distributed machetes?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may I come in again, because in the statement of April the witness says quite clearly that after Mr. Ndindabahizi had disembarked from the vehicle with a grenade, he started attacking the refugees, which is the same as what is stated in the second paragraph.  So it is not true that there are contradictions or discrepancies between the two statements. 
@MR. BESNIER:
There is, however, a difference in having a grenade in one's hand and coming down from a car and throwing a grenade, and I think it would be up to the witness to tell us what the difference is.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, that is the question.  The question is:  why did you in one statement say the following:  "He disembarked from the truck" -- that is Mr. Ndindabahizi -- "with a grenade in his hand", whereas in the second statement you say, "I saw Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, holding a grenade and then throwing it towards you".  Why is there two different formulations there? 
@THE WITNESS:
It's not a contradiction.  He waited for the occupants of the green vehicle to approach him so that he can have a meeting, a small meeting with them, before moving into action.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Another question:  in the passage which I read to you, which I shall read again, you state -- this is the document of the 24th (sic) April 2001:  "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present throughout all the period of the attack, watching the fighting between the two adversaries", and you testified here that you only saw Ndindabahizi Emmanuel for one minute, so how were you able to say that you were able to observe Emmanuel Ndindabahizi throughout the attack?
@A.
No, I didn't say that about that specific attack.  I said that when people started to kill us and throw grenades at us, I ran away immediately.  Had I remained, I would have been dead. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Consequently you think that when you stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi was present throughout the attack, your words were misinterpreted by the investigators?  Is that what you are trying to tell the Court?
@A.
They obviously misunderstood what I told them.  I never changed my statement.  I'm telling you what I told them.  And with regard to what I said about the Accused, that is not a lie. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Another question on your statement of the 26th April 2001.  In that statement, at the end of that statement, let's say four paragraphs before the end, you state:  "Both at Gitwa and Muhira, Tutsi women were raped and subsequently killed, apart from the woman that you heard yesterday, all the women -- apart from the one you interviewed yesterday".  How did you know that a woman had already been interviewed by the investigators?
Do you want me to repeat the question for you, Mr. Witness?  You spoke to the investigators about a woman who had already testified to them on the eve of the day when you yourself were interviewed by the investigators.  How did you get to know this piece of information, that a woman had already testified before -- had already been interviewed by the investigators?
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I think there is a technical problem.  Maybe the witness is not hearing what the interpreter is saying.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you hear my questions, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Are you speaking to me?  I don't know anything about this woman.  I don't know anything about that woman. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm not asking about her name, but I was just saying, how did you know that a woman had already been interviewed by the investigators and that she told them about rapes on Muhira?
@A.
With regard to the women on Muhira and rapes, women were raped when we were fleeing.  Furthermore, others were speared at, immediately they were raped.  Others were crucified.  The person called Jean, the agronomist, his one ear was cut off, and another man was killed and decapitated.  At that time it was one Kayishema who was our prefét, and people would come and he would be shown the people whose heads had been cut off, and the people who had committed those crimes were rewarded.  So, you see, we were victims of serious forms of cruelty. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question now is -- many, many terrible things happened, of course, but the question now is, to whom did you refer?  How did you know, how did you know that one lady had been interviewed by the investigators the day before you were interviewed on the 26th of April 2001?  That is the question from Defence counsel this time.  Please. 
@THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about the investigations?  Well, I don't know this woman involving the preliminary investigations.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in your statement to investigators there is a sentence, and I will read it out to you now.  Now, I'm only quoting what is in this statement.  It reads as follows:  "Both at Gitwa and Muhira, Tutsi women were raped and subsequently killed", and then comes the part Defence counsel is interested in.  Here it comes:  "All the women were killed there", and then, "apart from the one you interviewed yesterday".  And his question is, how did you know that there was one interviewed the day before your interview? 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know this woman you are talking about.  I really don't know him (sic). 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Witness, had you, during the investigation of the Tribunal, or before you came here, spoken to other survivors of Kibuye, other survivors of 1994 from Kibuye?
@A.
Nobody.  Nobody. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Between 1994 and today, have you been called upon to testify in the Rwandan courts on the 1994 genocide?
@A.
I testified against those people who killed members of my family, and that before the court of first instance, and the accused persons have been put -- have been imprisoned, but following presidential pardon the accused persons confessed that they killed members of my family and they have been freed, and they are living in their houses now.  However, they confessed that they killed members of my family. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you testified before the Rwandan courts -- or, had you testified before the Rwandan courts before you were interviewed by the investigators of the ICTR or after?
@A.
No.  It was before I was interviewed by the investigators of the ICTR.  Besides, I was interviewed after the case had been -- a decision had been rendered in the case before the Rwandan courts. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Had you ever told the Rwandan courts that you saw the former minister Ndindabahizi lead attacks on Muhira, throw grenades and participate in attacks together with the Interahamwe?  Did you tell them that?
@A.
Do you think I will testify against somebody that I cannot see?  I can't do that.  If I had seen him, I would have testified against him, because he killed members of my family.  I could not accuse him, because he was not there.  But if I had seen him, given the fact that he killed members of my family, I was going to bring a complaint against him.  But I could not see him.  You cannot bring a complaint against somebody who is not present. 
@MR. BESNIER:
You did say that you got to know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in 1985 at the Kibuye Trafipro.  Is that correct?
@A.
I said, in 1980.  From 1985, I did not see him again. 
@MR. BESNIER:
How many times did you see him between 1980 and 1985?
@A.
Since 1985 I have not seen him again. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but the question is, how many times did you see him between 1980 and 1985?
@A.
I told you I didn't see him again.  I saw him -- I only saw him again during the war when we were on the Gitwa Hill.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not the question, Mr. Witness.  The question is the following:  based on your examination-in-chief, it is our understanding in this courtroom that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at the Trafipro, and we are under the impression that you first saw him in 1980 and that you did not see him after 1985.  Is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
From 1985 I did not see him again, but I used to see him in 1984, and I saw him after the death of Habyarimana when he came to Bisesero.  I could not have been -- I would not have been able to recognise him because of his age, but Jean said, "Do you see that even Ndindabahizi has come from Kigali to kill the Tutsi?"  And this Jean was the agronomist of the prefecture, so they used to meet in Kigali, but I never went to Kigali; I was a very ordinary citizen, and I stayed with my family.  That is why Jean said, "There he is.  There are no Tutsis to be killed in Kigali, now he's coming to kill people of his native region".  And he asked us to flee, and the attackers ran after us with grenades, and they were firing at us.
Why should I lie about him?  I have no -- I have nothing against him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And no one is accusing you of lying here, Mr. Witness, no one at all.  But what Defence counsel is about to ask you now is your observations of this person around '84, '85.  Now, listen carefully to his question, please.  Here it comes. 
@THE WITNESS:
I have nothing to add to what I have already said.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what is the question by Defence counsel?
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, how many times did you see Ndindabahizi before 1985 and after 1984?  This is the question. 
@THE WITNESS:
I used to go to Trafipro to buy some items, so I cannot count the number of times I saw him.  My parents would send me to go and buy provisions.  So I was not interested in knowing the number of times that I saw the Accused.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, you said a while ago that in 1984 -- 1994, in Gitwa, you would not have been able to recognise Ndindabahizi, but it is Jean, the agronomist, who told us -- who told you that "Ndindabahizi is here".  Was it Jean who announced the presence of Ndindabahizi at Gitwa Hill?
@A.
No.  I knew him much earlier.  I knew him, but Jean was talking to those who did not know him, but I was present there and I knew him.  Jean was talking to those people who did not know him, and you see, even here I can recognise him.  From where I'm sitting, I can recognise him.  And besides, since the end of the war, I have not seen him.  But I haven't  asked anybody to point out Ndindabahizi to me, for me to be able to identify him.  I am here, and he is on the other side.  
Why are you -- do you want me to -- do you want me to give a false testimony?  I'm saying I was present and I saw what happened. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, we will move faster if you give direct, precise answers to my questions.
Another question:  when you used to go to Kibuye Trafipro and you used to see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, what was he doing?  Was he selling goods?
@A.
He was in his office, but there were shop assistants who were in charge of the selling. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Let's move on to events of 1994.  In your written statement you stated that you remained in your native cellule, but that you moved a bit to the hinterland of the country for reasons of security, particularly to Gitarama and Massango.  I want to know if Gitarama -- by Gitarama, are you referring to the prefecture or the secteur which is in Kibuye?
@A.
It is Gitarama, more specifically Massango, where the French took us, and there the Inkotanyi were present and they were in charge of our security. 
@MR. BESNIER:
But when did you move to Gitarama?  Was it in April, May or June 1994?
@A.
It was in July, beginning of July. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell the Court the exact date on which you arrived at Gitwa Hill?
@A.
When you are fleeing and someone is chasing you, it is difficult to keep track of dates, because you become virtually like a mad person.  The attackers are destroying your houses, taking your belongings and chasing you around; you will not have the courage to keep track of dates, because you become like a mad person. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Perhaps you could tell the Court approximately on which date you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the Gitwa Hill?
@A.
It was around the 15th, 15th April, that is, middle of the month of April.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you do not recall the date on which you came to Gitwa Hill, but you remember that it was on the 15th of April that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
This is just an estimate.  It was towards the middle of that month.  I did not specify the date. 
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement, Witness, you said that you were attacked by the Interahamwe on the Gitwa Hill between the 13th and 14th April 1994.  Did you have a clearer memory of these dates then than now?
@A.
I told you that this is just an estimate, because the Hutus started chasing us out of our houses soon after the death of Habyarimana, and people were fleeing and leaving behind them their cattle without taking anything with them.  So I am unable to tell you, because here you are fleeing with your children, you have abandoned your cattle; you will not have the courage to keep track of dates.  And in that kind of situation you have children who are crying and you have nothing to give them.  It is difficult to keep track of dates.  It is really difficult to recall dates. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I understand that clearly, Witness.  Therefore, you will agree with me that this attack could have taken place on the 13th or 14th April?
@A.
Around those dates, around those dates, because some time elapsed after the death of Habyarimana.  And besides, before we fled to Gitwa, before the Interahamwe attacked us, the Hutu people chased us, took our goats, and we left with our cattle.  Later on we had to leave our cattle and take refuge on the Gitwa Hill without taking our cattle with us, because our cattle had been taken by the people.  The Interahamwe came later on, and we had assembled on the Gitwa Hill.  Besides, they came to Gitwa after we had spent three days there on that hill.
@MR. BESNIER:
Listen to me, please.  Can you hear me?
@A.
Yes, I can hear you, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Please answer my questions briefly and concisely, and don't go into -- don't develop them.
@A.
I believe I have answered you.  I have not added anything.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the attack occur in the morning or in the afternoon?
@A.
The attack took place in the afternoon.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the attack that Ndindabahizi participated in take place in the morning or in the afternoon?
@A.
The attack took place in the afternoon. 
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement of 26th April 2001 you said that "On either 13th or 14th April around 9 a.m. a large number of Interahamwe armed with machetes, grenades and knives attacked us, the Tutsi".  Was this in the morning or in the afternoon when this attack took place?
@A.
There was an attack in the morning, but this attack was launched by the Interahamwe, and around 11 a.m. the attackers left, and in the afternoon Ndindabahizi came with soldiers.  But during the morning attack, there were no soldiers.  The soldiers came in, in the afternoon, together with the Accused and two vehicles.  The Interahamwe went back at 11 a.m., and another attack took place in the afternoon, and that attack was led by the Accused.  But I would say that the Interahamwe came to scout the field.
Do you think I can give a false testimony against the Accused?  I have nothing against him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness, thank you very much.  Please avoid comments.
You did say that during this afternoon attack Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and the other attackers were at the foot of the hill and the refugees were at the top of the hill.  Is that your testimony?
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, besides the vehicles in which you said there was Ndindabahizi, before then were there other attackers or people who were at the foot of the hill?
@A.
Yes, we were on the hill.  It's not a very high hill, it's close to the road.  However, the attackers of the morning did not come to fight because they didn't have weapons, they were not carrying weapons.  They came, and when they found a roadblock, they went back.  They came to scout around, to see the number of refugees on the hill.  It was to study the field.
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, my question was this:  when Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, according to you, came to the hill, were there already people present at the foot of the hill?
@A.
No, it was not at the foot of the hill, it was on the hill.  There were a lot of people sitting on the hill.  It was a large crowd.  I would not be able to give you an estimate.  It was all the secteur.  I would say all the inhabitants of the secteur of the Gitesi commune who had met on this hill. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were there also Hutus who were waiting for Ndindabahizi who possibly participated in the attacks later on?
@A.
During the afternoon attack there were only soldiers and Interahamwe, there were no civilian population.  There was no civilian population. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were all the soldiers and Interahamwe come in vehicles together with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, or some of them came on foot?
@A.
They all came in vehicles.  However, in Ndindabahizi's vehicle he was alone with his driver.  Otherwise the others came with their Daihatsu, the green Daihatsu pickup.
@MR. BESNIER:
And all in all, how many attackers were there in that vehicle?
@A.
Do you think I would have been able to count the number of people aboard that vehicle; in addition, people who were coming to kill you, wielding grenades and guns?  I could not have counted them.  Even if -- granted that you are an officer, but I think sometimes you want to make life difficult for us.  You find yourself in that kind of situation, it is difficult. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but give us an idea of the number.  Were there 10, 20, 50, 100 people?  Just give us an idea.
@A.
I'm unable to give you an estimate.  There were many people who attacked an entire population that had gathered on a hill, and there were so many dead bodies.  I have nothing more to add to what I have already told you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, the refugees on the hill, how many were they?  Hundreds, thousands?
@A.
There were very many, and I'm unable to give you an estimate.  The refugees were killed, and the killing lasted till late in the evening, and the following day the attackers came to finish off the rest, and so you'll understand that there were many.  I saw the attackers kill, and the bodies were all over the hill. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Among the refugees, were there some carrying weapons?
@A.
No, nobody.  Where do you want them to get the weapons from?
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement of 26th April 2001 you state that, in reference to the morning attack, on the side of the attackers one soldier died.  How did he die?
@A.
When the refugees see Hutu attackers, they throw stones at them, but they did not have weapons.  If they had weapons, they would not have been killed.  The refugees did not know of this plan to kill, so they were the victims of the killing. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now to summarise the situation, would it be correct to say that in the afternoon two vehicles arrived, only one of which was carrying soldiers and the other one was carrying Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And the persons who were aboard that vehicle, soon after they got there, attacked the people; is that correct? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which -- just a moment.
Which vehicle did that question relate to? 
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm referring to the two vehicles that the witness referred to.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, in the English version we got the persons aboard "that vehicle", so are you referring to those vehicles, Defence counsel?
@MR. BESNIER:
Two vehicles.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So that is the question.  Could you repeat it, please?
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, would it be correct to say, Witness, that the persons who were aboard those two vehicles very quickly attacked the refugees who were on the Gitwa Hill?
@A.
The attackers regrouped, got close to Ndindabahizi and his driver.  They stood there for a while, and the vehicle was further on.  They first of all got close to Ndindabahizi, and next to him there were people.  Then the Interahamwes ran quickly and threw grenades at us.  This man also threw grenades at us.  He also had two grenades attached to his belt and one in his hand.  At the time they were throwing the grenades at us, we were able to escape.  At least in that first phase, there were soldiers who were shooting at us.  At the top of the hill there was a big gun that had been fixed -- that had been positioned at the top of the hill, and there were people who were falling on the opposite hill, and there was a distance between the two hills.  Others were chasing the victims.  Regarding the big gun which was positioned at the top of the hill, we couldn't even see it.
So, in the evening, as I said earlier on, the killings abated, and so I have nothing more to add to this attack that was mounted by this man.  I have nothing to add to what I have recounted with regard to that event. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were grenades first thrown or there were gunshots first?
@A.
This man was the first to throw a grenade, so the grenades were thrown first.  Subsequently there were gunshots. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Where were the refugees when the first grenades were thrown?
@A.
These refugees were on the hill.  At the foot of this hill there was a road.  We were at the top of the hill.  Some were closer to the road, and when you take that road, it takes you towards the Karongi antenna, and the road continues towards Gisovu.  So it was close to the road that goes to Gisovu.  I'm talking about the Gisovu commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the distance between you and the attackers when you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Not far, a short distance.  Not far. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Taking this courtroom, using this courtroom, are you able to indicate to the Court the distance between you and the Accused?
@A.
I would say -- I will start from the wall on the other side, and we were at the other side of the room. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you referring to the two opposite walls of the courtroom?
@A.
Let me start with the steps on the side.  But since we were on the hill, it was uphill, so we were uphill from them and they were downhill, so our position was relatively uphill in relation to them and their position was closer to the road.  We were therefore at the top of the hill and they were at the foot of the hill, close to the road.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  But regarding the distance, are you able to assist us any better?  Are you able to give the distance approximately in metres?
@A.
I have never been an agronomist to indulge in exercises of measurement.  I can tell you that the person I saw was that far or that far, so I've never been engaged in exercises of measurement.  I am an ordinary person, so how do you want me to measure in metres?  Maybe you should better put that question to somebody who is an agronomist.
When I see somebody at a distance, I can see him, but I would not attempt to give you the distance in terms of metres. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that.  It is difficult to estimate in metres; we all understand that.  But if you could just try to explain to us by using this courtroom as the measurement, approximately the distance between you and Mr. Ndindabahizi.  So, if you were sitting there where you are sitting now, can you point to anything in the courtroom and say, "I was here where I am sitting now, approximately, and he was, say, at a distance equivalent to where this or that is"?  Can you do that again to us, please, so that we have an idea?  It is important to know for the Court, you know, approximate. 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't think one can make a comparison between a level -- a place which is level, and a slope.  When you are uphill and there is one person, the other person is downhill, they are not at the same level, so it is difficult to transpose that to a level place, a level ground.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We also understand that.  We know this.  So, you are not able to say whether the distance was less than this courtroom, was it, or more than this courtroom, the length of this courtroom, bearing in mind that you were not at the same level, but that there was a slope?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I could.  The position was not level in relation to where the Accused was. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and if you made that attempt, approximately, what would you say then, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, if we were on the field I could have given you an estimate.  I cannot find a place here that I can compare to the place in question.  If I were taken to an area with a similar topography to the one on the hill, I would be able to give you an estimate, but given this level ground, I am unable to give you an estimate.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
So we do not know the distance between you and the Accused, but at least we know that you were uphill in relation to him.  My question then is as follows:  when the Accused threw his grenade, he threw it -- he threw it from his position downhill to your position uphill?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.  Because we were uphill from him, as I said, so he threw it uphill.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there no risk for the grenade to roll back to him?
@A.
Why, how is it possible, except that he does not handle it the way he ought to, unless the grenade does not explode. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, during that brief attack that you referred to when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi briefly, would you say that he was a military expert?
@A.
Well, I ran immediately he threw the grenade.  I ran immediately.  I did not -- I did not stay there.  People were getting killed.  People who were hit by the grenade died instantly, and if I had not run, I would also have died. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it not correct that the refugees ran towards the top of the hill?
@A.
Are you talking about climbing up?  There were many, and there were many dead bodies.  There were many.  There were many attackers, they chased the refugees, and they ran over a distance of one kilometre, and then there were a lot of dead bodies in the place.  If you cannot run, somebody will shoot you, and when grenades are thrown, it explodes and hits a lot of people.  It is not an attack using bladed weapons, they were using projectiles.  When guns are shot, it is over a long distance, so how can you escape from bullets being shot from sub-machine guns?  I saw a sub-machine gun at Mugina, it was positioned on a hill, and they were shooting at people who were at a very long distance.

1600H
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, I am not talking to you about sub-machine guns, I am talking about the actions of Ndindabahizi.  Let's take the sequence of events.  You see two vehicles arrive on the road; the occupants of the vehicle, the passengers in the vehicle get down; people assemble around Ndindabahizi, and then they take weapons; and at that stage they start attacking you.  That is my understanding; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
How long, to your knowledge, what was -- how long was it between when the vehicle stopped and the first grenade was thrown?
@A.
Not several minutes.  They immediately started running after us.  They were running after us, killing.  Some people were falling.  You know, people don't run at the same distance (sic), some people got killed in the process.  Elderly women, children, cannot run as fast as young men.  So, the speed of young men is not the same as elderly persons, and the attackers were generally young men, and women and children were victims, because they could not run as fast as the attackers; we were able to run away from the attackers.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, let us concentrate on the duration.  You said there was a minute between when the vehicles came to a stop and when the attack started.  I now want to know at what time did the refugees on the Muyira Hill try to escape from the attackers?  Did they wait to be attacked with the grenades or they started -- they started moving back as soon as the soldiers arrived?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say Muyira Hill or Gitwa Hill?
@MR. BESNIER:
I am sorry, it was my mistake, Gitwa Hill.
@THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can counsel repeat the question?
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
I would like to know if the refugees on the Gitwa Hill tried to run away as soon as they saw the Interahamwe or they stood there and waited for the Interahamwe to start the attack before running.
@A.
When they got down from their vehicles, they stopped for a while.  Not too many minutes elapsed before the grenades were thrown, and at the time they were thrown on those people who were close to the electric pylon which was there, people run.  Those who were able, were able to escape, others were hit with bullets.  So people spread around on the hill in all directions.  People were running; they were shooting at them.  So this is a description of the situation.  These people were chasing us and killing.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but I want to talk about the sequence before the shooting, because later on you said you left immediately.  So what I am interested in is what you saw in relation to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  So let me reformulate my question:  the refugees who were on the hill, the Gitwa Hill, did they get close to see -- did they get close to the vehicle to see what was happening or did they stand there, or on the contrary, was there movement of the crowd and flight, because the refugees understood they were coming to attack them, and fled immediately?  That is my question.
@A.
I'll answer that question for you.  When the vehicles arrived, in the first instance there was the white car belonging to Ndindabahizi, and the driver parked the vehicle.  The second vehicle did the same, and when they came down, when they disembarked from the vehicle, they took the weapons and they came close to Ndindabahizi and his driver, and after a few minutes they ran after us, and in our turn we also ran, and as we ran, they were killing us.  So that is the description of that incident.  If you still haven't understood, I don't think you will be asking me the same questions on the same subject.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  But one last question, nonetheless.  So you were on the hill at a certain distance from the Accused, other people were around the Accused; you yourself were on a hill where there were many refugees, so how can you be sure that you recognised Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, whereas you had only seen him, rare -- rarely previously, and more than ten years from that time, and you also claimed that you saw this incident for one small, short minute?
@A.
You cannot fail to recognise your paternal uncle or your neighbour or your own father, someone whom you already know; you cannot fail to recognise that person, even after one or two years, someone who was a neighbour, who works at a place which you know, to which you regularly went yourself.  Let me give you an example:  nine years ago the war took place, but I never asked anyone to show me this man; I recognised him immediately.
@MR. BESNIER:
I have no further questions, Mr. President, for this Witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Any redirect? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, one question; one or two questions.
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, from the time Mr. Ndindabahizi embarked from the white Toyota car to the time you observed him throw a grenade to the attackers, how long did you say that was?
@A.
When he threw the grenade, the Interahamwe did the same and we ran.  Some people were hit and fell, the others who were not touched continued to run.  That's what happened.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I am interested to know the time span.  It's important for me to understand how long it took from the time you disembarked from the vehicle to the time the attack started.  Can you please try to tell us, give us an idea of the time span, the time it took?
@A.
Several minutes didn't pass.  I would say two minutes, one, two minutes, not any more than that.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And finally, you testified here that you were on a slope and Mr. Ndindabahizi was on -- by the roadside.  Now, can you help us with the distance please?  Can you estimate?  We know you are not an agronomist, you cannot measure, but can you tell us roughly what you think was the distance between where you were hiding and where Mr. Ndindabahizi's car was parked by the road?
@A.
It was a place where there were -- there were steps.  All I -- I'd never been in that place before, and all I did was to try and run.  I never tried to remain in one place, as myself, like the other young men, we ran, and people were shooting at us.  There were no bushes; grenades were being thrown at us, and bullets were being shot.  Some people were hit, and they fell, and we ran, because there were no bushes in which we could have hidden, and since it was in the open there were many deaths.  Many people were killed.  There were no bushes for them to hide, and grenades were thrown on the refugees.  That is the description of the facts. 
@MR. KAPAYA:  
That's all, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President.  Excuse me, Mr. President.  I would wish to tender as an exhibit the two written statements made by the witness.  On the one hand, there is a matter of dates, which is an important issue for the Defence, because we are going to be developing a defensive alibi based on the dates which we have seen in the statement.  As for the second statement, I am not very happy with the reasons given by the witness for the additions made to the statement, and thus, I would wish that the two statements, in English, and in French, be accepted, admitted as Defence exhibits.  Your Honours, by your leave.

$Exhibit Nos. D13A and D13B admitted, under seal)
@JUDGE KHAN:
We would -- Mr. Witness, we would seek a little clarification.  In your statement you said that Mr. Ndindabahizi was known to you well before the war, being a manager of a Trafipro store where you went to make purchases.  In reply to your question, put by the learned Defence counsel, you said when you used to visit the store in connection with the purchases, "The Accused was in his office."  How could you see him, whether he would come out of his office to see you, or whether you would go and meet him in his office? 
@THE WITNESS:
I didn't have to go and see him.  I didn't have any reason for so doing.  I went to that location in order to purchase several items.  His office was next door; sometimes he was in there.  But since his office was close to the place where the sales were done, I could see him.  As for his -- as for the clothing, I would buy material or fabrics from which I had children's clothes made; sometimes I would wait throughout the day while waiting for their clothes to be made.  You know, when you stay in a -- you stay for a day in a place, in a particular place, you can't fail to see the people who work there.  Those are the conditions under which I got to know that man.  There was a tailor who was there, and when I would -- I would spend some time with the tailor.  You wouldn't be unable not to know the people who work in at that place.  I would spend -- spend some time there, and I was quite close to them.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I would like to come back to the white car which you observed at Gitwa Hill.  Which make did you say that car was?  Did you recognise it? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was a vehicle of the Toyota make, which had bars.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, did you at any time after the death of President Habyarimana in April 1994 see Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel?
@A.
I saw him.
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you very much.  Where did you see him?
@A.
I saw him at Rubengera.
@MR. TAFAH:
Where in Rubengera?
@A.
At the market.
@MR. TAFAH:
What is the name of this market?
@A.
It was the Kibirizi market.
@MR. TAFAH:
In which commune?
@A.
At the time it was known as Mabanza commune.
@MR. TAFAH:
When did he -- did you see Ndindabahizi at this market; when? 
@A.
It was in 1994, in May.
@MR. TAFAH:
What time in May, Madam Witness?  Was it the beginning of May, mid-May, towards the end of May?
@A.
It was at the end of May.
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  How did you know it was Ndindabahizi when you saw him at the market at the end of May 1994?
@A.
It's because I knew him even earlier.
@MR. TAFAH:
How long had you known him earlier?
@A.
It was from 1993 that I had been seeing him.
@MR. TAFAH:
Where did you see him in particular in 1993?
@A.
I had seen him in Kirambo.
@MR. TAFAH:
Where is Kirambo, Kirambo?  Kirambo is spelled K-I-R-O-A-M-B-O (sic).  
@A.
Kirambo is in Gitesi commune.
@MR. TAFAH:
Can you describe how you saw him in Kirambo in 1993?
@A.
He came to that place.  He found me there.  He spoke with a certain number of individuals, and it was then that I came to know him.
@MR. TAFAH:
How did he come to the place, Kirambo?
@A.
I don't know.
@MR. TAFAH:
How many times did you see him in 1993?
@A.
I saw him twice.
@MR. TAFAH:
Was it at the same Kirambo that you saw him twice or you saw him at Kirambo once and somewhere else once?
@A.
It was at that same place.  I had family in that place and I was going there to visit the family, and it would be on those occasions that I would see him.
@MR. TAFAH:
On this second occasion you saw him, how did he come to Kirambo?
@A.
I was then with people who are older than me, and these people said, "There is Ndindabahizi, who is greeting someone, and who is standing over there with the person he is greeting."  
@MR. TAFAH:
So on the two occasions you saw Ndindabahizi at Kirambo, he was identified to you by some other people who were present.  Is that your testimony, Madam Witness?
@A.
No, when I got to know him the first time I knew him, you understand.  It's not necessary for him to be pointed out to me again, whereas I had already met him.
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  So it is your testimony that the first time he was pointed to you by some older -- other people who were present, but the second time when you saw him, you already knew him?
@A.
Yes, I already knew him.
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, in your statement to the investigators of the Tribunal, you did not state these circumstances that you had known Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, before the occasion you saw him at the market.  Why did you not state this to the investigators?
@A.
The reason is that I wasn't asked any questions connected to that.  
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  
On the day you saw Ndindabahizi towards the end of May 1994 at this market, what time was it?
@A.
Since I wasn't wearing a watch, I wouldn't be able to tell you the specific time.
@MR. TAFAH:
So was it in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening or in the night?
@A.
I would say that it was between 11 a.m. and noon.
@MR. TAFAH:
In your statement to the investigators of ICTR you say it was around noon; is that correct?
@A.
You can understand that I wasn't wearing a watch.  It was only an estimate of the time I was making.
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  
Madam Witness, can you describe the man, Ndindabahizi Emmanuel, you saw on this day at the market; describe the person you saw that day, as you saw him?
@A.
Are you referring to the occasion about which we have already spoken?
@MR. TAFAH:
I am referring to the May 1994 occasion at the markets, Kirimbi (sic)?
@A.
He was a man whose complexion was between dark and light.  His nose is more or less large and he is of average size.
@MR. TAFAH:
How was he dressed on that day, if you know?
@A.
He was wearing a black suit.
@MR. TAFAH:
Apart from Ndindabahizi, did you see another person?
@A.
There were other people.
@MR. TAFAH:
Apart from other people you saw, did you see light vehicles?
@A.
Yes, there were vehicles.
@MR. TAFAH:
How many?
@A.
Two.  There was one vehicle of the Daihatsu make and a saloon car.
@MR. TAFAH:
Were there people in these vehicles?
@A.
No, there was no one in the vehicles.
@MR. TAFAH:
When you saw Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, Madam Witness, on this day, what was he doing?
@A.
When I arrived, he was together with other people.  Actually I was going to the market because I had been sent to make some purchases, and when I arrived there they told me, "Let's go and listen to the minister who is speaking to people at a meeting."  When I arrived, I realised that it was Ndindabahizi and that he was someone I already knew.
@MR. TAFAH:
Do you know how many people were at the meeting?
@A.
I didn't really count the people there, but I would say that there were between 50, five zero, and 100; and let me repeat that I did not count the people who gathered there.
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, in your statement to the investigators of ICTR, you said there were over a hundred people.  Can you explain that?
@A.
I was only making an estimate, I didn't count the people.
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you very much.  
Where -- how far were you, Madam Witness, from where Ndindabahizi was standing?
@A.
It's like the distance between where I am, up to the point where the Judges before me are seated.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the distance between the witness and the Presiding Judge is, according to the courtroom measurements, 4.50 metres.
@MR. TAFAH:
Pleasure.
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, at what point were you standing at that place?
@A.
I was standing behind those people.
@MR. TAFAH:
On that day were you able to hear Ndindabahizi say anything?
@A.
Yes, I heard some of the words that he said.
@MR. TAFAH:
What did he say?
@A.
He said, "In Kigali Tutsis have already been all killed, including Tutsi women who were married to Hutu men."
@MR. TAFAH:
Before I go to the next question, Madam Witness, why were you standing so close to Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I wasn't that close to him.  I was behind the other people in attendance.

@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, what is your ethnic group?
@A.
I am Tutsi.
@MR. TAFAH:
You are Tutsi.  Were you not afraid that they would recognise you and kill you as they had other times?
@A.
Since in my native village my parents had already been killed I had left my native village to go to a place where no one knew me.  Moreover, my looks don't enable people who do not know me to identify me as a Tutsi.
@MR. TAFAH:
Is that all the reasons why you were standing so close to Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel?
@A.
Yes.  In fact, I'm not a native of Rubengera.  The inhabitants of Rubengera do not know me.
@MR. TAFAH:
So you were not afraid because you didn't come from that area, you came from a different area, a different locality.  Is that what you are telling this noble Court?
@A.
Yes, that's correct.
@MR. TAFAH:
In your testimony you told this Court that Ndindabahizi addressed the people telling them that Tutsi in Kigali have been killed, including Tutsi women married to Hutu men.  When he made that statement what happened?
@A.
The Interahamwe got onto the vehicle and they took off the machetes which were in there and put them on the ground.  People then shared out those machetes under the watchful eye of the Accused.
@MR. TAFAH:
Who asked the Interahamwe to take out the machetes?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did anyone?
@THE WITNESS:
It was Ndindabahizi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did anyone ask the Interahamwe to take out the machetes, Madam Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Ndindabahizi, he was the one who told them to get into the vehicle and to take out the machetes.
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
In which vehicle were these machetes?
@A.
In the Daihatsu.
@MR. TAFAH:
Do you know how many machetes there were?
@A.
No.  I do not know.
@MR. TAFAH:
In your statement to investigators you stated that there were 15 -- I mean 15 machetes were distributed to Interahamwe.  Can you explain that, Madam Witness?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the sentence reads, "I also saw the machetes being distributed to 15 Interahamwe militia," which is slightly different, huh?
@MR. TAFAH:
Obliged, My Lord, that is exactly what I wanted to state.
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, in your statement you stated, "I also saw 15 machetes being distributed to 15 Interahamwe militia".  Can you explain that?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the sentence is, Madam Witness, "I also saw the machetes being distributed to 15 Interahamwe militia."  That's the sentence in your statement.  Did you say that to investigators?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I said, regarding the machetes, that it was not the Accused who distributed the machetes, the machetes were offloaded, they were put on the ground, and then he called out to the people who were there so that they could take the machetes, and each person who was in that place was able to take one.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But the question now is the number, that's what Prosecution wants to elicit from you.
@THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't be able to give you the number of the machetes, because I didn't count them.
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
Did you know the number of Interahamwe?
@A.
No, I did not know the Interahamwe.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is did you know the number of Interahamwe leaders, that's what he's asking.
@THE WITNESS:
No, I didn't know them.  I do not know who their leader was.  Maybe it was that man who gave them the weapons with which to go and kill people.
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
So, Madam Witness, you did not count the Interahamwe?
@A.
I do not know the number of those Interahamwe.
@MR. TAFAH:
So what you stated was an estimate, not the exact number?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that was a little bit leading, wasn't it?
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, what role did Ndindabahizi play in the distribution of these weapons?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did Mr. Ndindabahizi play any role in the distribution of these weapons, Madam Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, he played a role in the distribution of those machetes, because these machetes were in his vehicle, he was present when they were offloaded from the vehicle, and when the machetes were distributed to those in attendance he was present.
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
After Ndindabahizi saw that the machetes were distributed as per his instructions, what happened?
@A.
He was applauded, and that was a sign which showed that the people were happy.
@MR. TAFAH:
What did he do, then, Witness?
@A.
He, too, was happy.  He rejoiced together with the members, the people who were there.
@MR. TAFAH:
After that what happened, Madam Witness?
@A.
Subsequently -- actually that's all I saw, and then I left after having seen the incident I just described.  I went back home.  I went to where I was living.
@MR. TAFAH:
Who left that place first; was it you or Ndindabahizi, Madam Witness?
@A.
I left first.
@MR. TAFAH:
Why did you leave?
@A.
I had just heard instructions he had given, and I was saying to myself that people were going to scrutinize the area and would attack anyone, and that's why I decided to go home.
@MR. TAFAH:
At the time you were at that meeting point where Ndindabahizi was addressing this population distributing weapons, did you observe him properly?  Was there anything obstructing you from seeing him properly?
@A.
I saw him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was there anything or anybody between you and Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@THE WITNESS:
But I saw him, and when the people got to the place they said they were coming to see the Minister Ndindabahizi, and I myself when I got to the place, I immediately saw him.
$BY MR. TAFAH:
@MR. TAFAH:
How long were you at the place before you left?
@A.
Thirty minutes.
@MR. TAFAH:
You say when you left the place you went to where you were hiding.  Where were you hiding -- or where you were living?  Madam Witness, did you say that when you left that you went to the place where you were hiding or where you were living?  Let me clarify this to the Court.
@A.
It was to my hiding place.
@MR. TAFAH:
Where were you hiding?
@A.
It was close to the market place, which we referred to.
@MR. TAFAH:
Were you hiding in the bush?  How can you explain it?
@A.
I was hiding in a house belonging to a family friend.
@MR. TAFAH:
A family friend.  What was the ethnic group of the family friend?
@A.
He was Hutu.
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, you testified to the effect that you left your locality to go to this locality, to this area where you saw Ndindabahizi.  Why did you leave your area?
@A.
I left my locality because of the war.  The attackers had killed my parents and members of my family, and our house was destroyed.
@MR. TAFAH:
In which commune was your locality?
@A.
It was in Gitesi commune.
@MR. TAFAH:
You say your house was destroyed and there was a war.  Can you explain for us what was happening in your locality before you escaped, Madam Witness?
@A.
I did not understand your question, Counsel.
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you very much.  I'm asking, you say your house was destroyed and there was a war.  I want you to explain further, when you say there was a war in your locality.
@A.
Well, I meant the attacks mounted by the Hutus against the Tutsis, and we were the Tutsis, this is the war I'm referring to.
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, do you know whether Mr. Ndindabahizi was once Minister of Finance?
@A.
No.  I do know that he worked in the Ministry of Finance, but I do not know that he was a Minister of Finance.
@MR. TAFAH:
When do you know he worked in the Ministry of Finance; was that before the death of Habyarimana or after the death of Habyarimana, the president?
@A.
This was before the death of the president.
@MR. TAFAH:
Do you know where he lived, before the death of the president?
@A.
Well, you will understand that I was still very young and I didn't know where he lived.  I didn't know where he lived.
@MR. TAFAH:
You've told this noble Court, Madam Witness, that he worked for the Ministry of Finance before the war.  Where was that, the Ministry of Finance?
@A.
The Ministry of Finance was in Kigali.
@MR. TAFAH:
How long did you stay at your hiding place after you left the marketplace where you met Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I didn't understand your question, Counsel.
@MR. TAFAH:
I'm asking how long you stayed in your hiding place with your Hutu friend after you left the market where you met Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel?  How long did you stay there?
@A.
After I saw Ndindabahizi and the plans he had I went back home where I was hiding.  I left what I was sent to go and buy and I went elsewhere.
@MR. TAFAH:
Why did you leave that your hiding place?
@A.
I left because I had just heard the plan that had been drawn up.
@MR. TAFAH:
And how did you survive thereafter?
@A.
I continued hiding and I was changing hiding places continuously until the French arrived in Rwanda and they took me to the place called Nyarushishi.
@MR. TAFAH:
Do you know when was that, Madam Witness, when the French arrived?
@A.
I met the French in July, but I cannot recall the exact dates on which they came to Rwanda, because I was not in a position to know.
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness, how many of your family members were killed?
@A.
Five persons.
@MR. TAFAH:
Madam Witness --
@A.
They were my brothers and sisters, my siblings.
@MR. TAFAH:
Thank you very much.  Madam Witness, do you know whether some people were killed after this meeting by Mr. Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, at the market and the distribution of weapons?
@A.
Yes, people were killed, because the killings continued in our locality until June.
@MR. TAFAH:
So you said you lost five members of your family, brothers and sisters.  How many survived?
@A.
None survived except myself.
@MR. TAFAH:
Let's come back to this day toward the end of May 1994 when you saw Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel.  If you see the man, Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, that you saw on that day, in this Court, would you identify him, Madam Witness?

Yes, I can identify him.

Please take your seat, madam.  Please, thank you. 
@MR. TAFAH:
Would the records, Your Honours, reflect that the witness has identified the Accused.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, here I would like to refer to Article 6 of the European Convention.  Since the beginning, the identification of the witness is unfair, given the fact that in the courtroom coloured people are either in legal robe or in uniform.  Only the Accused person is in civilian uniform, and this is a violation, a fundamental violation of the European Convention in relation to what we will refer to as a fair trial. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This goes on the record.  Thank you.

That will be all, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Defence, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, it's Mr. Marçais who will conduct the cross-examination, but I would like to draw the Court's attention to the fact that we are moving away from the indictment.  Nowhere is Mr. Ndindabahizi accused of having made a speech or having gone to the Mabanza commune.  I don't know where the Prosecution is going with this testimony, but I thought it was necessary to draw the Court's attention to this, that this testimony does not correspond to any paragraph of the indictment.  Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that remark.  I'm sure the Prosecution will come back to that in due course, and so will you in your closing arguments.  Thank you very much.

Good afternoon, Counsel. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Are you able to recall to the Court how you are able to remember on 27th of May, 2001, that is, seven years later, the Accused, and for the first time, given the testimony -- or the statement that you gave, not in your residence but in another place, that is, Bethany in Kibuye? 
@A.
I was not living with my parents. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Initially, did the investigators from the ICTR come to your parents or to your house? 
@A.
The ICTR investigators came where I was living. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And it is at that time that they told you that they were bringing a case against Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
@A.
Yes, it is the investigators who worked on that case. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Was it the investigators who told you that they were bringing a case against Mr. Ndindabahizi and that they were inviting you? 
@A.
No. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
They invited you to come to Bethany guest house in Kibuye to give a statement? 
@A.
Regarding my testimony, my statement, I kept that in my heart.  They were not the ones going to tell me what to say in my statement. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Have you ever testified -- had you testified in the Rwandan courts, in any of the courts of first instance, Gacaca court, before this interview? 
@A.
Yes, I did testify in the court of first instance. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Had you already testified before the Gacaca court? 
@A.
No, I never testified before any of the Gacaca courts. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
When you testified before the court of first -- the Kibuye court of first instance, were you a victim or did you indicate to the court that you had been a victim of the events of 1994? 
@A.
Which criminal events are you referring to? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, you have just told me that you already testified before the court of first instance in Kibuye.  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, I want you to indicate the acts that you denounced and the fact that you did not speak about the alleged acts of Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
@A.
In any event, I was testifying, an accused before that court.  At that time, it was not Ndindabahizi.  Today it's the turn of Ndindabahizi, and that's what I am doing.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you waited for the -- can you look towards me, Madam Witness?  Don't look elsewhere.
So you waited for the investigators of the ICTR to come and invite you to the Bethany guest house to testify and to recount the acts that you are recounting today? 
@A.
In my testimony before the court of first instance, Kibuye court of first instance, I gave -- I made the statement -- I gave that testimony before (sic) the investigators of the ICTR came to interview me.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, can you repeat under oath what you have just said?  Can you repeat what you've just said under oath, with the knowledge that you are under oath? 
@A.
Which answer are you talking about? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Please listen to me.  You just said that you testified before the Kibuye court of first instance after testifying -- after you gave your statement to the ICTR investigators.  I want you to repeat that with the knowledge that you under oath. 
@A.
My testimony before the Kibuye court of first instance was done after my statement in relation to Ndindabahizi.  So I made a statement in relation to the Ndindabahizi case, and then I gave my testimony in the Rwandan courts, in the Kibuye court of first instance. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The Defence reserves the right to enter on the record a document indicating that witness is not telling the truth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that something you are going to distribute now? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
It's a document that I have only in the Kinyarwanda, which I will have translated.  It was forwarded to me recently.  I will have it translated into English and French, and it demonstrates that the witness is not telling the truth, and this under oath.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But if that's the case, I think you should show that document to the witness because she reads Kinyarwanda, of course, and then she can comment upon it. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I would like the registry to show this document to the Court and the witness for her to indicate if this, indeed, is her. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Here there are two yellow markings.  Are you referring to those two yellow spots, Defence counsel?

This is really, really below the belt.  This is so objectionable.  It is untrue.  My learned friend has deliberately laid an ambush for the witness, and it turns out that there is no relationship between this name and this witness, and he knows it.  He knows it, too.  There's absolutely no relationship whatsoever between the name here and this witness. 
Every other name mentioned here has a first name.  Now, a first name is mentioned here that bears no relationship with this witness, and I ask that the Defence be sanctioned and disciplined.  It is absolutely unprofessional behaviour to lay an ambush in such a manner, and we'll be looking to enter this as a Chamber exhibit, Your Honour.

@A.
Can't you see that those who recorded the statement made a mistake?  Were there students going to school during the war? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Well, I'm trying to understand your statement.  You wrote, "I knew Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as the minister of finance in the government of President Habyarimana." You said I was wrong, it was wrongly recorded.  "When I was in primary school in 1994," and you said that was wrong.  The investigator got it wrong. 
Well, I think regarding this investigator, I think the Prosecutor needs to give us some instructions. 
@A.
You understand that I saw him when I was still in primary school; however, in 1994 I was in the school called ****************.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have any indication whether Mr. Ndindabahizi went there to be treated or was he there for some other reason?
@THE WITNESS: 
He wasn't there to get treatment.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
How you do know?
@THE WITNESS: 
I was also there, but I didn't see him go into the consulting room for consultation.  He was standing with people; he was greeting them.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
All that seems to be surprising, Madam Witness.  Did he work with the ministry of finance or the ministry of health?
@A.
Do you think that someone goes to a health centre because he works in the umbrella ministry, the ministry of health?  One can also go there for some other reason.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Is a health centre, which is several hundred kilometres from the capital, a place to go and take a walk, somewhere which is so far from one's place of work?
@A.
Since he is a native of that commune, there could be people whom he wanted to visit.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So he was visiting the people who were at this health centre?  Is it a health centre where one would be an in-patient in order to have treatment?  Is it like a hospital?  Do they have beds there for people to sleep in?
@A.
Well, in any case, I can say that he was a native of that area.  Maybe he had relatives or family members whom he wanted to visit, I don't know.  Those are the possibilities.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
It's for my own information.  My question is, was it somewhere like a hospital where one can sleep, where one must sleep if one is receiving treatment? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Prosecutor, allow me to conclude my question.
@MR. TAFAH:
$Previous translation continues...) answer this question.  I don't know.  My colleague is just going around and around.  The witness has answered the question.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Non, non.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, but it's -- answer that question, Witness, because that particular question hasn't been answered.  
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, there is a hospital.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So, there is a health centre; it's not only a dispensary or where you can get out-patient treatment.  Maybe it's also a place where you can receive treatment over several days.  That's my question.  Do you understand it?
@A.
Yes, I told you that it was a health centre; however, there is a hospital where seriously ill patients can be hospitalised before they are transferred to the central hospital in Kibuye.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, Madam Witness.  So you do not know specifically on what occasion, but you have just given us some clarification on those theories.  Madam Witness, you're a Tutsi, are you not?
@A.
Yes, I am.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you please tell us the following:  You stated that you went to the Kibilizi market, but now I want to know, on what date did you go to the market?  I am specifying on what day -- date did you actually travel to that market?
@A.
You see, it's quite likely that I do not recall that date.  It was a long time ago.  Moreover, given the circumstances of the time, we were not even thinking that we would have to report on these incidents; therefore, I don't remember the date very well.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, this date is very important for me.  I do understand your difficulties, but you did indicate that you lived in Gitesi and that you were going to the market, the Kibilizi market in Rubengera commune.  Now, what I want to know -- I am not asking you about the date or day that you travelled there, that you be exact, but I want to know when it was that you travelled to Kibilizi market in Rubengera.
@A.
I do not remember the date.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
This is a question which is very important for the Defence.  I don't want us to accept some kind of vagueness, and the Tribunal should take due note of this.  The events of May - April 1994 are of such importance that such imprecision about this date should not be allowed.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We know that the witness has said end of May.  Next question.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, Mr. President.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you please tell me, Madam Witness, where you stayed in April and May 1994?
@A.
I was staying in Mabanza at this specific place known as Kibilizi.  Actually, are you asking me about this specific place where I lived?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, but also about people who provided you with shelter.
@A.
There is the Kibilizi area and then there is the stadium.  There was also Gitwa in Karongi area.  It was in those places that I hid until the end of the war.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
When you went to the Kibilizi market in Rubengera, did you take any particular precautions?
@A.
I do not quite understand that question, Counsel.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
All right, Madam Witness.  You were changing your commune.  You travelled for more than 15 kilometres.  The maps that the Tribunal has -- were there any roadblocks?
@A.
Yes, there were some, but I don't go by those roadblocks.  I would, rather, go through the bushes.  I didn't have any authority to go by the roadblocks.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I wouldn't say prudent, but wasn't it very dangerous to travel around these areas?  You mentioned the place near the market.  Wasn't it a bit dangerous on your part?
@A.
At the time, in order to get to the Kibilizi market, in fact, I was nearby that place and it was a place which -- at which no one knew me, and the fact that those people didn't know me enabled me to get rid of my fear, and that is why I was not afraid. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You don't even mention that in your statement, but a moment ago you said that you were hiding with Hutu friends, and now you're telling me that you're hiding elsewhere.  What is the truth?  Could you try and edify us?
@A.
You are speaking about other places.  What other places are you talking about?  I am talking about Kibilizi, and the person in whose house I was, was in Kibilizi.  Now, as for the stadium, when I refer to the stadium I am telling you that there's no house.  And then in Karongi as well, I was hiding in the bushes.  But, now, when I was hiding in someone's house, a Hutu, that was in Kibilizi.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, when did you move from Gitwa to Kibilizi?  I need to know that.  Approximately, to the nearest day possible if you cannot --
@A.
When I left Gitwa, I didn't go directly to Kibilizi.  You see, I cannot remember the date, and I have told you that.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Give us the period or the specific date on which you left Gitwa to Kibilizi, during this period of time which was undergoing so many difficulties?
@A.
When I left Gitwa, I didn't go immediately to Kibilizi.  I hid elsewhere, someone -- someplace other than Kibilizi.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
It's unfortunate for the Defence, for us, not to obtain more preciseness about this movement, despite our thousand and one questions.  
Where was the rest of your family when you went to Kibilizi?
@A.
The members of my family were already dead.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So why were you at the Kibilizi market making purchases?  For whom did you go there?
@A.
It was for the owners of the house in which I was living.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
People who are of Hutu origin are hiding you because you are in danger, and then they send you to the market?
@A.
These people were not worried about that particular issue because they knew that I was not a native of the area; consequently, they thought that I was not in danger.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
That's not my question, Madam Witness.  These people thought you were in sufficient danger for them to want to hide you.  Is that true or not?
@A.
Yes, they were aware.  They themselves knew the place from which I came.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I am putting my question to you back again.  So, these people are aware of the danger you -- risks you were running and they agreed to hide you, but they send you to the market in full view of the rest of the population living around?
@A.
I think I have given my explanation on that, the reason why that was done.  I have told you that I could move about because I was not a native of that secteur.  It's only the person who was hiding me knew my origins.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, in that house, no one would have been able to denounce you as a Tutsi.  The people who lived in that house or the neighbours couldn't have done that, could they?
@A.
There was no mention anywhere that I was a Tutsi.  Given my features, it's -- they are not different from those of others.  And furthermore, I didn't have any identity papers.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At the marketplace, you say you had already met Mr. Ndindabahizi who may have recognised you, if we were to believe you.  Now, you hear Emmanuel Ndindabahizi threaten Tutsis with death, and you continue to remain in that market for 30 minutes.  Is that what you did?
@A.
I made reference to the 30 minutes, and that's when he held the meeting, after I had reached the place, but that does not include the duration which elapsed after the meeting was held.  Moreover, he himself did not know my origins as a Tutsi.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I am not specialist, but I think Hutus and Tutsis know one another.  
In your written statement you state, "I was able to note that the majority of the attendants were of Hutu ethnic group."  Let me repeat:  "I was able to note that the majority of the attendants were of Hutu ethnic group."  How were you able to do that?  How would you have known that the majority of the people there were of the Hutu ethnic group?
@A.
During that occasion, no one else was suspecting except -- no one else, except for Hutus, could attend such meetings.  Had a person from another ethnic group appeared at the meeting, that would have cost him or her his life - his or her life.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
If a Hutu came to such a meeting, he would be risking his life; is that what you are saying, Madam Witness?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is the translation correct there?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe so, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you say -- what did you say? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I was repeating the question -- the witness's answer in the form of a question.  Maybe I made a slip of the tongue. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You said that if a Hutu (sic) person had ventured at that meeting, that person would be killed.  Is that what you were trying to say, Madam Witness?
@A.
No, you are attributing -- you are putting words in my mouth.  I didn't say that.  The persons who would have been killed were Tutsis, because it was the Tutsis who were targeted by the killings at that time.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You say, Madam Witness, that the majority were of Hutu ethnic group.  You used the term "majority."  Can you explain that term, please?
@A.
What do you want to know with regard to that term "majority"?  I do not understand what you are looking for.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, you used the term and I am repeating your sentence.  I don't have any comment on it.  "I was able to note that the majority of the attendants were of Hutu ethnic group."  So, I have two questions for you.  How were you able to realise that difference?  You gave me an answer, and I am inquiring from you to explain to me the word majority, which is not the same as the totality of the people who were there.  So can you please explain that for me?
@A.
Let me give you an example.  I was there as a Tutsi, whereas the others were Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The wording, Madam Witness, does this imply that you saw any Tutsi there, apart from yourself?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, on that occasion there was also another person of Tutsis origin who was with me, and it's possible that we were not the only ones to have been at that specific moment.  Maybe there were other persons who were Tutsis whose features did not enable one to identify them as such.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you recognised at least one other person who was of Tutsi origin.  Did you know that person, individually as a person?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you write that person's name on a piece of paper today for us, because we may wish it verify what you are saying.
@A.
You understand that this was during the war.  The war was ongoing at that time.  So, we were together in that place, but that person died subsequently.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.  Furthermore, you say, Madam Witness, that Ndindabahizi spoke to two Interahamwe.  Can you specify and explain to the Court how you came by determining that they were Interahamwe?   Were they wearing uniforms?  Were they carrying any weapons?
@A.
At any rate, I found them in a place where the meeting was taking place, and amongst the people who were there, I could distinguish between those who were Interahamwe and those who were not.  
@MR. MARÇAIS:
How did you make that distinction, Madam Witness?
@A.
First of all, they were happy of the fact that the Accused had just given them weapons, and I could see that they were happy.  I could hear what was being said.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were they wearing any uniform, any disguise or any particular type of clothing for you to be able to identify them as being Interahamwe?
@A.
At the time when they were going to perpetrate the killings, they were wearing banana leaves.  Now, they had come to attend a meeting.  You understand that war attire is different from what one wears when one is going to attend a meeting.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
My question is, on that day, were they wearing banana leaves?  So I'll repeat my question:  Since that day they were not wearing banana leaves, how were you, from the outset, able to identify them as being Interahamwe?  Was it because they were carrying weapons and the type of weapons they may have been carrying, if they were?
@A.
I was able to determine that they were Interahamwe because I had seen that their spirits were at their highest when they received the weapons.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you identified them.  You understood or concluded that they were Interahamwe afterwards, but you didn't identify them previously, as you had indicated in your witness statement. 
Another question:  Is it the reaction of satisfaction which makes you understand that they were Interahamwe?
@A.
Yes, it's true.  Add to that the fact that they left together with the machetes.  They took the machetes away with them, and why would have taken those machetes with them?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did these Interahamwe not have machetes already, at least some of them?
@A.
Maybe they had some, but at that time they had come to attend a meeting.  They hadn't come to perpetrate killing, so they did not come armed with their machetes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
But you did not recognise the Interahamwe by the weapons that they were carrying or the uniforms that they were wearing?
@A.
I knew them.  They were indeed Interahamwe.  Tell me, if they were not Interahamwe, why did they then take those machetes?  Why did he give them the instructions he gave them?  Wasn't it because they were in a plan and they knew what they wanted to do?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At no time whatsoever were these machetes given to the persons that you identify as Interahamwe?
@A.
No, according to what I saw, those people whom I saw were the only ones who received the machetes.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Am I correct in saying that you found people who were not in uniform, not armed, at a marketplace, and you say from the outset that -- and also it's a commune where you are not native, and you immediately jump to the conclusion that they are Interahamwe?
@A.
But, you see, there were other people at the meeting place and they did not take the machetes.  So why were these persons taking the machetes, whereas others who were also there did not take the machetes?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you would define an Interahamwe by the fact that such a person takes up a machete?
@A.
No.  I myself can take a machetes, someone else can take a machete without it being necessary that we be Interahamwe, but these people were Interahamwe.  They carried out murderous expeditions and they had passed by where I was.  I have told that you that was not my native region and people did not know me, and I could see everything that was happening, and I could see the actors, the perpetrators, and I was seeing them with my own eyes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, let's go to cars or vehicles, Madam Witness.  Do you know types of vehicles, makes of vehicles?
@A.
No, not really.  I did not study mechanics or sciences of automobile, if there is any such type of science.  I did do some primary education and I'm from a rural area, but I tried to identify the vehicles that I saw.

What was the make of the vehicle in which Mr. Ndindabahizi sat?
@A.
When I got there, there were two vehicles parked there next to where the people were; the people who were at the place were standing.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You claim you saw a car and you said it was Mr. Ndindabahizi's car.  Can you tell the Court the make of the car?
@A.
The make of the car?  Well, I don't know it.  I don't know.  I know it was a saloon car and I know its colour, but I don't know its make.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You don't know makes of cars very well?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, when you stated -- when you stated that the car was blue, was it suggested to you that it was a Daihatsu?
@A.
How can you say that?  You think the investigators would ask me questions and then they think in my place? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
No, I was just asking you if the investigators asked you whether the blue pick-up was of a Daihatsu make. 
@A.
They asked me the following question: "What was the make of that vehicle?"  And I answered that it was a Daihatsu and that is the vehicle that I saw.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
It is because a while ago you indicated that you did not know makes of cars and does not -- does that not look like a contradiction?
@A.
You are talking about make.  Maybe I don't know what you mean by make, but I know Daihatsu.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Are you sure that you are not getting it wrong?  There were all sorts of pick-ups; there is Toyota, there is Daihatsu.  You did say that you don't know makes of the cars or models of cars but that it's a Daihatsu. 
@A.
Yes, because I know Daihatsu.  But when you say in French the marke, meaning the make of the car, I don't know what you mean because I don't understand that kind of French.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam, Daihatsu is not a French word, it's a Japanese word.  I asked you a question a while ago about makes of cars and you said you didn't know about makes of cars and then suddenly you are talking about makes of cars.  I think the Court will assess that evidence.  That takes me to my last questions.

That was quite some time before you visited the health centre, wasn't it?

And this other education -- did you say that you attended the *************, was that where you then moved to?  What was your next educational step, please?

Yes, I attended ***************.

So you had then finished primary school at the age of 14, and then you went on for one year at the ***********.  Is that so? 
@THE WITNESS: 
That is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you would then be 15 years old when you finished the ***************? 
@THE WITNESS:

But did I understand you to say that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi when you were at the beginning of your post-primary education; in other words, at the beginning of the ******************?  Was that what you testified?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't think I understood the question clearly. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When you saw the person at the health centre who may have been Mr. Ndindabahizi in 1993, were you then in primary school? 
@THE WITNESS: 
At one point in time, I left school and then I went back, such that while in school I was virtually an adult.  Such that in 1993 I was, as I said, undergoing a training **********************.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This may not be significant, Madam Witness, but I do not understand this.  First I understood you to say that you finished primary school at the age of 14, and that you then started immediately afterwards at ***************, and that would bring us to 15.  But previously it was my understanding that it was during your education at primary school or ****** that it was that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Now, what is it that I do not understand? 
@THE WITNESS: 
It was at the beginning of ************* that I saw him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And didn't that start when you were 14? 
@THE WITNESS: 
In fact, I do not recall because I had to repeat some classes, and at some point in time my parents withdrew me from school.  In fact, I was -- I didn't think clearly about the years when I was answering.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So does this imply that you are not quite sure of the year you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi or are you maintaining that it was in '93?  Are you uncertain about the year you saw him?

This was the third witness, Your Honour, and in relation to this witness we do have an application to make to the Court.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In the presence of the witness? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Not necessarily.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  
Madam Witness, if you could -- Registry if you could kindly assist the witness.  
Yes, Mr. Phillips. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Grateful, Your Honour.  
Your Honour, I make a very quick application under the provisions of Rule 46 of Rules of Procedure and Evidence of this Tribunal.  The basis for my application is that counsel for the Defence's conduct in this courtroom this evening warrants a warning under that rule, and that the trial Chamber is at liberty to consider sanctions as may deem appropriate.  
The factual basis for my motion under Rule 46 is as follows: that today, the 16th of September 2003, during the cross-examination of Witness CGL, a witness called by the Prosecution, counsel for the Defence put improper questions to that witness in cross-examination.  
We submit, respectfully, to Your Honours that the questions put to Witness CGL were not put to her in good faith, and more importantly, they were not made in the legitimate -- with the legitimate objective of impeaching Witness CGL's credibility.  Rather, we submit to Your Honours that those questions, those improper questions, were posed to slander that witness, to destroy her reputation before this Trial Chamber and, more seriously, to mislead Your Honours into believing that that witness had made false representations before this Chamber.  
We say that the representations were not made in good faith because counsel for the Defence had witness statements before them.  In that regard, I refer Your Honours to paragraph 1 of page 176 of your witness bundle.  You would find there a witness statement dated the 27th of February 2001 in English, and if you are looking at your French bundle it would be paragraph 1 at page 180 of the French version.  It clearly states the witness's name.  
I further refer Your Honours to paragraph 8 on page 177 of the English bundle, and paragraph 8 of page 181 of the French bundle, which refers to the particulars of her parents.  My learned friend for the Defence had a document in his hand which clearly indicated not only the witness's name but, indeed, that of either of her parents.  We there say -- we therefore say that having been faced with such material, it was improper and a deliberate attempt to mislead the Trial Chamber to represent falsely to both the witness, Your Honours, and, indeed, the Prosecution, that the witness had indeed made a false representation.  
We ask Your Honours to consider the sanctions available under Rule 46A, B and C of the Rules of Procedure of this honourable Court.  Those are my submissions, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Defence, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Very respectfully, we do not believe that Mr. Marçais had conduct which was offensive or harmful to warrant a warning pursuant to Rule 46A.  Therefore, we are relying on this rule, but no warning has been given to Mr. Marçais; however, we are in a trial which is very special, Mr. President, Your Honours, one in which we need to determine on a daily basis and on an early basis, the evidence.  And we also -- it is up to us to determine the credibility of the witness.  That is our duty.  Sometimes we do this rather hurriedly.  And it is true that we have obtained this morning a ruling on this matter, but what is the harm done?  
The witness had the opportunity to express herself and verify and to tell us that the name was -- her name was not the one on the statement in question.  It is also a possibility that the Prosecution does make mistakes from time to time and the document -- and sometimes they say that the witnesses they have not arrived.  
Mr. Marçais was trying legitimately to carry out he is duty in relation to this witness and he did not have the intent to be offensive or misleading and he did not wish to mislead the Tribunal either.  And I, therefore, on that basis, wish to you to dismiss the application made by the Prosecutor because it has no basis whatsoever.  I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And did the Defence, when these questions were asked, know that he word Umwena means son or daughter of? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for counsel, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
The answer is no, Mr. President.  We only knew it a few -- we only received the document a moment earlier and we had not had the opportunity to have it translated and, therefore, we were misdirected possibly by the similarity in the names -- of the surnames of the witness and the name on the document we had in hand.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Further misrepresentations as these proceedings go on.  Counsel for the Defence who cross-examined Witness CGL obtained that document from his assistant, a Kinyarwanda-speaking gentleman, who sits right in this courtroom.  It is an absolute misrepresentation of the facts on the record for him to suggest, again, before the Trial Chamber, that he was not aware of the content of that statement.  And I will just leave it at that because it gets worse by the minute.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  This brings us to the end of today's proceedings.  We will look into the matter.  
Any good news about witnesses, Mr. Phillips? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Unfortunately not, Your Honour.  We have three witnesses -- three factual witnesses and an expert witness left.  We hope that they would bring them at some stage between Friday and Monday, preferably Friday.  And the next witnesses will be number 10 on your list, number 11 on your list, and number 14 on your list, and then number 19, Madam Des Forges.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So this, again, that's the third week we have been haunted this time, haven't we?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Certainly have, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- but the next week is the last week? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Hopefully, Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's the end of this portion of the trial.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  Yes, this phase of the case; yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So that's where we stand.  We are losing days again.  For the Trial Chamber is it -- it's not so terrible because we can hopefully fill in with the Military trial.  But we will then meet again on Monday afternoon and I'm sure everyone will do their very utmost to ensure that we get the witnesses and as many as possible so that they can be heard as soon as possible in the beginning of next week.  
Thank you very much.  The Court is adjourned.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to everyone in the courtroom.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are Witness CGB in this Court's proceedings, that's your pseudonym, and you are a protected witness.  So you have to make sure that your identity is not disclosed and when you are asked questions by the Prosecution and later by the Defence, please be careful so as not to give information which can reveal your identity.  
You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take the solemn declaration to that effect. (Declaration made by Witness CGB in Kinyarwanda)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, do you have a document in front of you? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it your signature that we see at the bottom of this document? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is my signature.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, do you recall hearing of the death of the president, President Habyarimana, in April 1994? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, did violence erupt in your area of residence following the death of the president? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did that violence consist of attacks on members of Tutsi civilian population by members of the Hutu ethnic group? 
@A.
The attacks targeted Tutsis and it was the Hutus who were mounting the attacks. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
When that violence broke out, did you and your family flee to safe location? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Where did you go? 
@A.
I went to the Kirambo parish.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What is the approximate date that you fled to Kirambo parish? 
@A.
Approximately, I would say that it was around the 14th. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us in which secteur and commune Kirambo parish is located, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
The Kirambo parish is located in the Kibuye secteur, at Gitesi commune. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Approximately how long did you hide at Kirambo place? 
@A.
Approximately two days. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And why did you leave that location, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
I left that place about two days later and I continued hiding.  I went to the Gitwa hill but before then, I tried to hide. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us approximately when is that you went to Gitwa hill?
@A.
This was around the 16th, 17th.  It was around that period. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And how long did you stay at Gitwa hill? 
@A.
Approximately two days. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, did you leave Gitwa hill because you were attacked, Mr. Witness? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why did you leave Gitwa hill, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
It is because the attacks had been mounted on that place. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us where you went after Gitwa hill? 
@A.
I went to hide in Kayenzi.  There was a valley close to the Nyakagenzi river.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And in which secteur and commune is Nyakagenzi river, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
It is between Kibuye secteur and Gitesi secteur, and the two secteurs are located in the Gitesi commune.
@MR. KAPAYA:
How long, CGB, did you stay at that river? 
@A.
Two weeks.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, from Nyakagenzi river, can you tell us where you went, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
From the Nyakagenzi river, I went to the Gahigiro cellule and I went to hide in the house of a Hutu who lived there. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Why is it not mentioned in your statement that you hid in a house of a Hutu, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
If they had known that, they would not have liked it and for that reason attack this person in question.
@MR. KAPAYA:
With the leave of the Chamber, the witness can write down the name of that witness on a piece of paper, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, who would have attacked this Hutu, Mr. Witness, if they had heard of it? 
@THE WITNESS:
His kinsmen because he had given refuge to Tutsis, so they would have attacked him.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you avoided mentioning this in your statement of 2000, and then there may not have been a risk of attack.
@THE WITNESS:
When somebody testifies and gives the name of a certain person, in the long run people get to know.  I don't know how they got to know, but they got to know. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to read this, Mr. Kapaya?  Is it clear to you, based on your conversation with the witness, how you spell that name?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it is quite clear to me, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Could you kindly, with your handwriting, assist us a little bit there.  It is not very easy, I think.  
Any problems with the Defence?  It is difficult to understand the writing.  So show it to the Defence or maybe we could get some clarity afterwards.
@MR. BESNIER:
I am unable to read what is written on this paper, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you able to write this again but with capital letters, because you see, you have a very nice handwriting but it is a little bit difficult to read it?  So if you could kindly write it with block letters, please.
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now we have it very clearly, that was of great assistance to the Court.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the Prosecutor tenders that document as Prosecution Exhibit P20. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
P20, under seal.
$Exhibit No. P20 admitted, under seal)
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, were there other people hiding with you in the house of that person? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
About how many and what was their ethnic group? 
@A.
There were three and they were Tutsi. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Approximately how long did you stay in that house? 
@A.
I remained there for three weeks. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Why did you move from that house? 
@A.
It was because his house was attacked.  He was telling them that there were no Tutsis in his house, and the Interahamwe would go back.  But because they were not satisfied with his answer, one day they decided to search the entire house and its neighbourhood, and that was when he told us we had to leave because we might be killed in the process. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who were searching the house? 
@THE WITNESS:
The Interahamwe. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us where you went after you left that house? 
@A.
We left that house at 4 a.m.  Each one went his own way and did whatever he could to find a hiding place.  I, on my part, went to hide in a small kitchen which the Swiss constructed for school pupils in a place called Gasharu.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you please describe that kitchen sort of structure so that we know how it looked like? 
@A.
It is a small kitchen which was all covered with smoke or soot, where they used to cook for the pupils, and it was very dirty, but that was not the problem.  My concern was to find a place I could hide. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
In which secteur is that house? 
@A.
That kitchen is in the Gasharu commune in the Gitesi secteur.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, while in that structure, could you tell us what you observed? 
@A.
It was between 9:00 and 10:00 and I saw the vehicle of Mr. Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel.  He came and stopped at the roadblock.  He met Ndabukiye who was there as well as his son, Emmanuel.  The two of them were standing at the roadblock.  They first greeted each other, then there was a conversation.  After the conversation, they went to where Karara was, they started bringing people together, gathering people together.  And then he told them that, "I have come to congratulate you, but all the same, I have criticism against you.  I heard that Karegeya, Cyprien, as well as Mukamana also known as Nyiramaritete are still alive.  I am just coming from Kigali where there is no Tutsi alive, and I don't know what you are doing because we don't want any Tutsi alive".  
He then added that: "Even if I go to Kibuye, you and your son, I have promised you, Ndabukiye, and your son, I have promises for you.  Ndabukiye would be préfet and Ndabukiye's son will become bourgmestre.  I am now leaving, but when I come back, I don't want to hear about Tutsis in our locality.  And when I come back, if everything has been done, I will appoint you to that position as a way of rewarding you, and that will contribute to the progress of our locality and our region. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, let us start from the beginning.  You were with this person whose name you wrote on a piece of paper, for about three weeks; is that so?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you moved to some other place and you mentioned a kitchen; this other place, was it a house? 
@THE WITNESS:
I did not understand the question.  If the question can be reformulated so I can answer. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you know what this witness is about to tell us.  Can you slow him down and start from after he left the person at P20, provide some more details where he is and then take it from there? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.   
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, you testified here that you stayed at a Hutu man's residence for three weeks; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, after those three weeks, can you tell us where you went? 
@A.
When I left that man's house, I went to this place, this locality where there was a kitchen, and that is where I was hiding.  And when I left this locality or the kitchen or when I was in that kitchen, that was when I saw a vehicle belonging to Mr. Ndindabahizi, a white vehicle.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, slow down there, please.  Now, you are now arriving at a new place and there is a man living there, is it?
@THE WITNESS:
No, there was nobody at that place. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it a house, this new hiding place?  What kind of place were you in? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was a kitchen built by the Swiss.  They used to cook there, they used to cook meals there for pupils who were being trained in that region, agricultural training in that region.  Now at that time, the Swiss were no longer living there, they had left that place much earlier. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this Swiss kitchen place, was that an outdoor kitchen or indoor kitchen?
@THE WITNESS:
It was a small kitchen, which was separate on its own, and they used to cook meals there.  There was a main house separate and then the kitchen, the small kitchen on its own. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, was this place -- was it inhabited by anyone when you came there? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, there was nobody in that house, but farther on, there were people who were living but in that particular house, there was nobody living there anymore. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So then, I understand that this was a kitchen in an empty house; is that true? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, there was no one living there anymore, people living there had left because there was the training.  The training programme was no longer being conducted in that place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you sought refuge in an empty house; is that correct?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And did you seek refuge alone or with other people in that empty house? 
@THE WITNESS:
I was not with anybody; each one of us went his separate way and I went on my way and found that place. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you stayed in the kitchen of that empty house; is that so?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then you said that you saw something in the morning, and that is what the Prosecutor is going to ask you questions about now.  There was something -- was it in the morning?  You said it was between 9:00 and 10:00; was it in the morning or in the evening, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was in the morning, during the day.   
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, before we leave the geography of that area, could you tell us how that kitchen was constructed?  Did it have a roof, doors, windows and that kind of thing? 
@A.
Yes, the kitchen had a roof.  It was covered -- it had a window and a door, a window which was protected with some kind of burglar proof.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, could you be able to give the size of the kitchen?
@THE WITNESS:
The kitchen was about five by two metres.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You confined yourself in the kitchen only, you did not reside in the house; is that right?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I never went into the big house.  I confined myself to the small kitchen. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, CGB, we reached a point where you were describing what you observed while you were in that kitchen.  Could you please tell us your observation, what you have just told us?
@A.
It was at that time that I saw a vehicle, a white vehicle on which were Mr. Ndindabahizi.  The vehicle came, it stopped at the roadblock which was there, and the specific place is in Gasharu.  Ndindabahizi came down from the vehicle in the company of soldiers.  He spoke with Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel.  The two were manning the roadblock in question. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is good.  Now wait for the next question, please. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, after Mr. -- the person you described as Ndindabahizi had arrived, were there other people at that place where the car stopped? 
@A.
There was a roadblock, this man Joel and his son, as well as Karara and others and Interahamwe who were drinking in a bar next door, those were the people who were there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Give us the names of the person manning the roadblock, one by one, Mr. Witness.
@THE WITNESS:
There was Ndabukiye, there was his son  Emmanuel, there was one Rukundakuvuga; these were the people who were manning the roadblock. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, give us the third name, please.  The third name, we managed to have Ndabukiye.  What was the father, Ndabukiye's first name?  
@THE WITNESS:
His first name was Joel, Ndabukiye's name, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then comes his son, Emmanuel Ndabukiye, and who is now the third one you are referring to?  Please spell that because we have problems with those names.
@THE WITNESS:
The spelling is R-U-K-U-N-D-A-K-U-V-U-G-A.  The name is Rukundakuvuga. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And who were these persons, who was Joel Ndabukiye, what was his position in society?
@THE WITNESS:
Normally, he was a teacher but at that time, he was, in fact -- he was the director of the Kirambo centre. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
And what was the occupation of Emmanuel?
@A.
He had just finished his studies at the official technical college in Kibuye. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And can you tell us what Rukundakuvuga normally did in life? 
@A.
As for Rukundakuvuga, he had just finished his first year of secondary school. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us how many people disembarked from the vehicle, the white vehicle that you saw there? 
@A.
Two people. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us who or what they are? 
@A.
First of all, there was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and then a soldier who was carrying a firearm. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, can you tell us what you observed Mr. Ndindabahizi do after he had arrived there? 
@A.
When he came, he spoke to Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel at the roadblock and he said the following:  "I am coming to congratulate you.  However, I must reproach you.  One Cyprien Karegeya and one Mukantabana, alias Tatiane Nyiramaritete, are still alive.  I am from Kigali.  In Kigali no Tutsi has remained; all have been exterminated.  Now, what are you doing?  If you do your job well, we will be happy with you.  Now, you Ndabukiye, you will be appointed the préfet and your son Emmanuel will be appointed bourgmestre.  As for Karara, he will be member of parliament.  I am going away, I am going to Kibuye.  When I come back, I would like to see that there is no Tutsi here and at that time, I will reward you by appointing you to the posts that I have mentioned so that we can ensure the progress of our region". 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, how far were you when you saw this event?  How far were you from Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
@A.
I would say I was about 20 metres away. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Apart from Ndabukiye, his son and Rukundakuvuga, were there other people at that roadblock? 
@A.
When people saw the vehicle, everyone ran to come and greet the people who were arriving and everybody was happy.  I am talking about the people who were in the neighbourhood and those who were in the bar. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
When you talk of the bar, what do you mean?  Which bar?  Whose bar? 
@A.
It was a bar which belonged to one Augustin Karara.  In that place beer was sold and banana beer was also sold -- bananas wine. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us who Augustin Karara was, Mr. Witness?
@A.
He was a trader. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did he, to your knowledge, hold any other post apart from doing his trading business? 
@A.
You know, there were two people with the name of Augustin Karara.  There was Augustin Karara the bourgmestre and  Augustin Karara the trader. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
I am talking about Augustin Karara who had a bar there at that place, near the roadblock.  Do you know whether he held any position? 
@A.
No, his only occupation was that of trader.  Furthermore, even today, after having been released from prison, he continues with that occupation. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, how were you able to recognise Mr. Ndindabahizi in the midst of the people who had surrounded him? 
@A.
You know, I knew Ndindabahizi and that wasn't the first time I was seeing him again.  So as soon as I saw him get out of the vehicle, I recognised him. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
You testified that you were about 20 metres away from where he was.  How could you hear him talk at that distance, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
I think that when one is at a distance of between 20 to 30 metres away from someone speaking to a group of people, one can hear that person.  I would say that the same would apply in this room where we are, if someone were to be speaking to you and was at a certain distance away from you, you would still be able to hear what the person is saying. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, how long did you observe Mr. Ndindabahizi at that roadblock?
@A.
I think he remained there for about 15 minutes, one-five minutes. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know -- could you tell where he went after that? 
@A.
He said he was going to Kibuye. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, you testified that in the course of a speech Mr. Ndindabahizi wanted to know why Mukantabana and Karegeya are still alive.  Could you tell us whether you know who Mukantabana was or is? 
@A.
Mukantabana was a teacher at the Kirambo school complex.  Her husband was known as Charles Munyanhindi, and he was also a teacher.  Both were teachers at the Kirambo school complex. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you know whether Mukantabana had a nickname or another name? 
@A.
I spoke to you of Mukantabana, Nyiramaritete and Tatiane.  So she was known by these three names that I have just mentioned. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know what her ethnic group was? 
@A.
These people were Tutsi. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
When you say these people, do you include Karegeya also? 
@A.
Yes, both.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know Karegeya's first name? 
@A.
His first name was Cyprien. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you know what he did for a living in April 1994? 
@A.
Are you referring to Karegeya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
That is right. 
@A.
He was a farmer and he also kept livestock.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did Mukantabana or Karegeya had any relationship with Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
@A.
There was no relationship between Mukantabana and Ndindabahizi.  On the contrary, there was a relationship between Karegeya and Ndindabahizi. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
What was the relationship between Karegeya and Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
@A.
They were cousins. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, do you know whether -- what happened to -- whether anything happened to Mukantabana and/or Karegeya? 
@A.
Both are dead.  Karegeya died and so did Mukantabana.  But as for Mukantabana, she was first of all taken to her home by the attackers because they wanted to see where she had allegedly hid money so that the assailants could take it.  
The assailants took her body to go and throw it into a pit because there was a matter of counting the dead.  I believe Karegeya was killed at the roadblock that we have been speaking about.

@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us how many days passed before they were killed following Mr. Ndindabahizi's appearance at the roadblock?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see any of these persons being killed yourself, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Mukantabana's body was brought so that it could be thrown into the hole which was at the roadblock.  As for Karegaya, he was killed at the roadblock itself. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you yourself see any of these two persons being killed? 
@A.
Yes, because I was still there at the time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, what did you see?  Take one by one.  Did you see both being killed or one of them?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was killed by a club, and I saw that.  He was killed at the roadblock.  As for Mukantabana, she was killed and then her body was brought so that it could be thrown in that place.  In fact, bodies were brought to that place so that they could be piled up in a hole near the roadblocks because the attackers wanted to know those who had already been killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see Mukantabana be killed, yourself?
@THE WITNESS:
No, but her body was brought to that place. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know who killed Mukantabana, Mr. Witness?
@A.
It was Vuguziga, Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel.  It was those people who brought her back from -- to her house so that she could give them some money.  In fact, she was at Ndabukiye's house and it was from there that she was led to her home.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know who killed Karegeya?
@A.
It was Joel Ndabukiye and his son Emmanuel who killed her.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, do you know whether other people were killed at or near the roadblock, apart from these two at that particular time?
@A.
They killed one Kiranyuye (phonetic).  They killed a light-skinned man from Kayenzi, who was known as Nahiko.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Can you tell us how long you stayed in that house -- or kitchen?
@A.
In that structure which was used as a kitchen, I stayed there for more than four days, I believe, after which I went along the river and I spent the night close by the waterfalls until the end.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, I asked you the period you stayed in that kitchen where you claim that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi.  How long did you stay in that place before you moved to another place?
@A.
To answer the question you've just put to me, I would say that it was the day that I arrived at that structure which was used as a kitchen that I saw Ndindabahizi. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
From that place, can you tell us where you went?
@A.
I went to Congo.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay.
@A.
In fact, it was on Idjwi Island.  That island is, in fact, in Congo and I arrived there on the 4th, so it was on the 4th that I arrived on Idjwi Island, and then I crossed the lake in order to get to Gituku area, which is still in the Congo.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us the date or the approximate period you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at that roadblock?
@A.
It was towards the end of May.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, in your statement you say that you saw him at the Gasharu roadblock in early May.  How do you explain that?
@A.
One thing is clear: I was trying to go over the events by memory and this was based on the date on which I arrived at Idjwi.  I arrived there on the 4th.  I arrived at Idjwi Island on the 4th, and when I go back in my mind as to how I saw the Accused, I come to the fact that I must have seen him around the end of May.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You arrived at that island on the 4th of which month, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
The 4th of June.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, I had asked you how long Mukantabana and Karegeya were killed after Mr. Ndindabahizi had talked about them at the roadblock.  How long was it after he talked about them?
@A.
I think that it was about four days later.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Both of them or one of them? 
@THE WITNESS:
The two were not killed at the same time but I think were killed on the same day.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Both were killed on the same day, approximately four days after this incident at the roadblock? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I think I understood him differently.  He said Mukantabanya was killed elsewhere and brought to the roadblock, whereas --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, we know that; we know that.  But now you asked him the question when they were killed, and that is -- and that's what we are following up now.  No, we know the evidence. 
So, are you saying that they were both killed four days afterwards; yes or no, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I will say that it was about four days later.  That is an estimation. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
And when did you flee to Congo, Mr. Witness, did you say?
@A.
It was on the 4th June.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And how long was that after you had seen Mr. Ndindabahizi at the Gasharu roadblock?
@A.
It was one week later. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, have you known Mr. Ndindabahizi before May '94, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
Yes, I knew him already and I used to see him often.  And I must say that he first worked for Bralirwa; that is, the brewery and lemonade factory of Rwanda.  And then in the '70s he came to his region to see the inhabitants of his village and to have the road leading to his parents' house done so his vehicle can go all the way to his father's -- his parents' house, particularly at the time he was going to bring his wife and show her to the people. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you help us with the year; when was this?
@A.
It was in the '70s, and I'll say that it was between 1970 and 1980, if my memory serves me right.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And can you tell us what he was doing in 1994, after the death of the president?
@A.
When he came, he introduced himself as the minister of finance. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know where he lived?
@A.
He lived in Kigali.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you describe to us the person you knew as Mr. Ndindabahizi in the '80s and 1994?  Can you tell us how he looked like?
@A.
Normally, people have different complexions.  There are people who are fair complexioned and others who are dark complexioned, and those who don't have any of the two is a blend of both, so I would say that he was a blend of both complexions, dark and fair. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, would you be able to recognise him if you saw him today?
@A.
Yes, I'll be able to recognise him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
With the leave of the Chamber, could the witness, Your Honour, look around and see whether he can recognise anybody as resembling Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, would you kindly look around -- if you wish, you may stand up -- and tell us if you see anybody who resembles the person you've described as Mr. Ndindabahizi.
@A.
He's sitting behind those three people and he's close to the wall, towards the wall, and he's wearing a white shirt and a jacket.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may the record reflect that the witness has recognised Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Defence would like to point out that the conditions for identifying a witness have not been met.  The witness said that the Accused is wearing a white shirt and a black -- and a jacket.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I was a little bit puzzled by that remark, Defence. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, with leave of the Chamber, I would request the witness to go and touch the witness he describes as Mr. Ndindabahizi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If you could draw the curtain.
All right, Mr. Witness, if you could point that person out to us again, if you think that person is here.  
Court video system, please be careful now because the witness is about to move in the courtroom.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, let it be shown that the witness has identified the accused person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  There can be no doubt about that, thank you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, my comment remains the same.  I do not dispute the fact that the witness has pointed Ndindabahizi out, but I just want to say that the Accused is the only person here in civilian clothes and that it is easy for the witness to identify him because there are no other people around him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That remark is of a different character and is certainly noted for the record.  Thank you very much, Defence.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the witness had expressed some concerns about his security.  Now, I wanted to ask him whether he can now tell it to the Chamber what he experienced before he came here to testify in this case.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please follow that up. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, before you came to Arusha to testify, did anyone approach you and ask you about your prospective testimony in this case?
@A.
One **************************************************************************************.  And he asked me to come and see him.  I thought it was to give me an employment as he did earlier on, but when I got to his office, I found a short man in his office who was of fair complexion; he was wearing spectacles.  He did not tell me his name, but he asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi and if I knew if he came to my region and participated in the killings.  I told him that I did not know anything about what he was telling me.  I categorically denied what he said.  He therefore used somebody who was -- who came from Kigali.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you mean with that last sentence, Mr. Witness, "He therefore used somebody from Kigali"?
@THE WITNESS:
This person came from Kigali, from my former employer in Kibuye, and I was taken to the office of my former employer.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you have mentioned your employer, a former employer, and you have mentioned a short man.  These are two persons, correct?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two persons were present in the room when the short man asked this question; is that correct?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did this happen? 
@THE WITNESS:
He wanted to ask me three things.  First of all, he did not introduce himself.  He first asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi.  That was the first thing; secondly, if I had seen him in my region; and thirdly, if I had seen him kill.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did this conversation take place, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
This was recent, toward the end of August.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why does this incident make your -- make you worried?  Please explain that to us. 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, they asked me to come and, knowing that he was my former employer, I thought he was going to give me another job.  And I got the impression -- I thought it was an interview to enable me to get a job.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, was anything said during this conversation which could in any way be linked to the present trial? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  He asked me to tell him if the Accused came to my region, if he killed and if I knew him.  Now, after that conversation, he told me that I had been selected as a witness.  And I asked him by whom, and he said, "You have been selected as a witness to go to Arusha and you'll be very well rewarded", and they were telling me a lot of fantastic things.  But I told them that I don't even know that place and I don't want to go.  That was the answer I gave them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So this person, did he inform you that you had been selected as a witness to come to Arusha?  Was that the first time you had ever heard that you had been chosen to become a witness in this trial?
@THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I didn't understand the question.  Do you want to repeat?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What we have heard now in the English translation -- of course, this is going through two languages -- what we have heard is that the short man said to you -- that's how I've understood it -- that you have been selected as a witness to go to Arusha.  Is that true?  Is that rightly understood?  
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the same man also said that you would be well rewarded; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what he was saying.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when this short man said to you that you had been selected to go to Arusha, did you know at that point in time that you were in fact going to Arusha in the present trial, or was that the first time you ever heard about this trial taking place in September this year and that you would be here? 
@THE WITNESS:
Regarding coming to testify, I knew I was going to come to testify, but I do not know the person who gave this information.  Besides, another colleague was requested to come and we meet at this place.  There were two of us at that place. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, did that short man tell you how he knew that you'd be a witness in this case? 
@A.
He told me that he had been informed and he then asked me how I was going to go, and I told him that I did not know that place; I mean Arusha.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did he -- what did you understand him to mean when he said you would be rewarded?  Is that rewarded for coming to testify or not coming to testify?
@A.
He told me that I was going to be rewarded, but I did not want to come and receive any rewards; I only wanted to come and testify on the facts that I had -- the acts that I had seen.  I was not interested in the reward; I only wanted the truth to come out. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did you understand that person to be talking on behalf of the Office of the Prosecutor or on behalf of the accused person?
@A.
I believe he was speaking on behalf of the Defence.  In any event, he had other means of achieving that objective. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did he say that he was from the Defence side? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, he was part of the Defence because he told me that he should explain to me so I know whether it is the truth or not. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
And he also said that you would be rewarded if you do not testify in the court, in the Tribunal? 
@THE WITNESS:
Can you please repeat the question?  I did not understand.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did he say that you would be rewarded from the Defence side, you would be given a reward by the Defence if you refuse to testify before the Tribunal? 
@THE WITNESS:
No.  However, he told me that I should come and that I will receive rewards if I came, but I told him I will not come because I did not know the place.  I, however, asked him to tell me how he got these lists which includes my name.  And he told me that when he returns -- and he was going to come back on the 25th September -- that he would then give me explanations on the lists and the person who put my name on the lists.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see any list? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, he did not show me any lists.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what we're trying to find out now is what is your basis for assuming that this person represented the Defence team in any way.
@THE WITNESS:
I'm saying that because he came and asked me to explain to him if I had seen Ndindabahizi come to my region, if I had seen him killing, and if I knew him.  He, therefore, wanted me to give him explanations on these three points.  I ignored his request because I'm not part of his programme, and I did not want to tell him on what I was coming to testify.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Many persons interview people in Rwanda:  NGOs, journalists, prosecutors, investigators.  What was it which made the list between this short man and the Defence team? 
@THE WITNESS:
Why then did he ask me all those questions?  Where did he get all that information?  Is it not true that he was told that I'm a member of that team? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, witness has just mentioned his name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you just mention the name of the short man?  Without giving us the name, did you do that; yes or no?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, no, witness mentioned his own name. 
@THE WITNESS:
No, I do not know the name of the short man.  He didn't tell me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, let it go on record that it's not the Office of the Prosecutor who sent that short man to ask the witness those three questions which he has just talked about.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That's noted.  Defence. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
^Before the Defence starts, I have a question for the witness.  Mr. Witness, I would like to know whether you know where Gitaka centre is. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know the place.  Gitaka centre is situated in Gasharu region. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it near where this roadblock was? 
@THE WITNESS:
It's at that very place. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, the Defence finds it intolerable that, once again, it's been suggested that Defence teams have exerted pressure on a witness to withdraw his testimony.  This is obviously something which is not in favour of the Defence.  For three weeks now it has been, more or less directly suggested that members of the Defence team have themselves intervened or have sent somebody.  One time it' **************************; another time it's a short man, and this is in order to exert pressure on witnesses.  
So, the Prosecutor has just said that it should be noted that it is not the Prosecutor which has sent anyone to the witness, and I wish you to grant me the same, that we have not sent anyone to exert any kind of pressure on the witnesses.  We work with ethics and during this trial we have shown that ****************************** was the brother of one of the Prosecution witnesses, and we also believe that some Prosecution witnesses know one another, and we do assert that if there have been any leakages around the identities of the Prosecution witnesses, it is not on the Defence that this should be blamed.  And I think I would like on that note to thank you for your attention.
$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, I would like to put to you a few questions in my capacity as counsel for Mr. Ndindabahizi.  You have mentioned the name of Charles Munyanhindi who was the spouse of Mrs. Mukantabana.  Is that right?
@A.
Yes, that is quite so.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know what this Mr. Charles Munyanhindi's profession was?
@A.
He was a teacher. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Charles Munyanhindi is dead today, is he not?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did he die?
@A.
He was killed by Vuguziga in a classroom where he was hiding in the Kirambo school complex.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know on what date he was killed?
@A.
No, I what wasn't keeping track of dates because my heart was not in that kind of exercise.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you a direct witness of the death of Mr. Charles Munyanhindi?
@A.
Vuguziga himself came to brag about it and, furthermore, that is why he is presently in detention.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you an eyewitness?  Did you see, with your very own eyes, Vuguziga strike Charles Munyanhindi?
@A.
I have told you that Vuguziga himself was boasting about having killed him and today he has confessed to having killed him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But all we are interested in now is to find out whether you saw the event, and that implies either a yes or no answer.
@THE WITNESS:
I did not see it with my own eyes, but I know that he is the one who killed him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the next question was: When did this happen?  Even if you didn't see it, do you know when this incident took place? 
@THE WITNESS:
In 1994.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That, we understand.  When in 1994?  Can you help us with that, please?
@THE WITNESS:
I think Munyanhindi's death goes back to about the 14th and 15th.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which month? 
@THE WITNESS:
Around the 14th and 15th April 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, in your written statement which I have here and which you yourself signed on the 12th November 2000, you state at the seventh paragraph, "I saw how Appollinaire Vuguziga, presently detained at the Kibuye prison", and so on and so forth.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter has still not found it. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
And now you are saying you did not see the killing with your own eyes, so how can you reconcile those two? 
@A.
Vuguziga himself stated that with his very own mouth. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that when you hear mention being made of an incident, that you imagine yourself to have been an eyewitness of that incident, generally speaking?
@A.
When someone asserts that that is a true fact, you yourself will take it to be the truth. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Mr. Witness, let's now go back a bit to the sequence of events that you recounted.  You said that you were at Gitwa around the 16th or 17th of April.  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you witnessed many attacks on Gitwa; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, I was a witness of those attacks.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement you say that on the 18th of April you saw soldiers in the company of Préfet Kayishema; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Isn't it also correct to say that you heard Préfet Kayishema say, "Exterminate all the Tutsis on the hills"?
@A.
Many Tutsis were killed there. 
@MR. BESNIER:
But did you yourself hear Préfet Kayishema say those words?
@A.
He himself, in fact, was the one who started off by shooting the first shot. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I believe you were hiding somewhere, were you?
@A.
When we were attacked at that time we were not hiding.  We saw them arrive. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  After the attacks of which you were one of the victims in Gitwa, you escaped and, according to you, you went to the Nyakagenzi river.  For how long did you hide alongside the river Nyakagenzi?
@A.
I testified that I hid in that place for two weeks. 
@MR. BESNIER:
After having hidden yourself for two weeks close by Nyakagenzi river, I understand that you said that you went to hide in the home of a Tutsi whose name you just gave in writing a moment ago.  Is that correct?
@A.
Yes, you're right. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you go back to that area, because you had first of all left it for security reasons?
@A.
You know, I was trying to look for that person who had hidden me, and when he was teaching at an *********************, he had been my teacher and he taught me the**********************, and at a point in time I was converted and I became ***********************. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the distance approximately between Nyakagenzi and Gitwa?
@A.
I think you go through forests, and if I were to make a guess, I would say from Gitwa to Nyakagenzi you need to walk for about 25 minutes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what is the distance approximately between Nyakagenzi and Kagabiro?
@A.
From Nyakagenzi to Kagabiro, you need an hour to walk, and that's an estimate. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Right.  My question was: Why did you leave Nyakagenzi, where you seemed to be in security, for you to walk that long distance to Kagabiro, whereas you already knew that Kagabiro area around Gasharu was not really very safe for Tutsis?
@A.
No, you have just distorted what I said.  I never spoke about Kagabiro.  There, you have really distored what I said.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let's go over this again.  After having gone close to the Nyakagenzi river, did you not go to Kagabiro to seek refuge in a Hutu's house, or did I misunderstand you?
@A.
No, that wasn't it. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was it not rather Gahigiro?
@A.
Yes, exactly, it was at Gahigiro.
@MR. BESNIER:
All right.  My question was: What was the distance that you covered between the area near the Nyakagenzi river and Gahigiro?
@A.
I covered a distance which took me an hour.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is Gahigiro close to Gasharu?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
How close, approximately?
@A.
A ten-minute walk.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, this is my question:  Why did you leave this relatively safe area of Nyakagenzi river in order to go to the danger that that would place you in and the roadblocks that you would have to pass through to go and seek refuge at Gahigiro?
@A.
Normally, I did not take the road on which roadblocks had been erected.  At certain times, from 
11 p.m. until 4:00 in the morning, one could walk, and you would stop wherever you got to at 4 a.m. so that you could hide.  That is how I was hiding in order to try and survive. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  And you state that as you were walking you did your best to avoid roadblocks which you may have come across; is that not so?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why -- after having left your Hutu friend who provided you with shelter, why did you go and seek refuge only 20 metres away from a roadblock?
@A.
I hid in that area because, as I have just said, it was 4 a.m.  You needed to stop wherever you were so that you are not seen, whether it's a place where there was grass or whether it was close by Interahamwe.  You needed to hide.  Furthermore, one could even hide close to an Interahamwe's house because he wouldn't think that you were hiding there. It was highly improbable that the Interahamwe would find such people around his own house. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  But you said, however, that you had taken care to avoid the other roadblocks.  Was this roadblock in particular less fearful for you -- or less dangerous for you?
@A.
I was saying that at the distance of 20 metres away from a roadblock, if you are hiding there, no one from there would think of coming to look for you around there because those people didn't believe that anyone could come and hide so close to a roadblock.
@MR. BESNIER:
Between Nyakagenzi and Gahigiro, how many roadblocks did you see, if any?
@A.
There was only one.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you quite sure that you only needed one hour to go from Nyakagenzi to Gahigiro on foot?
@A.
Normally, when someone is not afraid and it's during the day, that distance can be covered in about 40 minutes, but since it was at night and I was walking slowly so that I do not raise anyone's suspicion, that is why it took me a whole hour to cover that distance.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  So, you remained hidden in the Hutu's house for three weeks, you stated; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that's correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Therefore, it was not certainly at the beginning of the month of May that you saw at the Gitaka roadblock the events that you spoke of and which involve Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; is that so?
@A.
It was at the end of May.
@MR. BESNIER:
However, in your written statement you're very categorical and you state -- this is in the last paragraph of the first page of your written statement, you say that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the beginning of May, in early May.  How could you be so sure? 
Let me repeat my question.  Let me repeat my question: How could you have been so sure in November 2000 and, also, how can you be so sure today by saying that you -- that this incident took place almost a month later?
@A.
I've explained that.  I have stated that I took as my point of reference the day when I arrived on Idjwi Island on the 4th of June, and the last time that I had seen him, a week had passed in relation to the time when I reached Idjwi Island at the beginning of June.
@MR. BESNIER:
Should I understand that you thought about this since you signed your written statement and that recently you came to the conclusion that you must have seen him, taking all into account, at the end of May 1994?
@A.
Counsel, you asked me a question concerning the distance between Nyakagenzi  and Kagabiro.  I told you that it was an hour's walk, approximately.  So, you understand I went into retrospect and I took as my point of reference the 4th of June, the day on which I reached Idjwi Island, and I tried to estimate the time I saw him last and I realised that about a week had elapsed, the day he had said that he didn't want to speak -- to hear mention made of any Tutsis.  So, I was trying to find out how much time I had been remaining in hiding and I realised that that must have been the duration.  
This was a person of authority who had spoken by saying that this is over; someone who is trying to save the life of a Tutsi will have to leave together with that Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, six years after, you remember a date which you say was about the beginning of 
May 1994, but after some reflection of some month you say that you remember that it was indeed the end of May 1994.  Have you decided on that finally?  Was it the end of May 1994 or was it the beginning of May 1994?  Can you please be more specific about that today?
@A.
As for dates, I am telling you that it is not very easy to remember exact dates, especially when you are hiding.  But the only date that I can recall is the date on which I arrived on Idjwi Island.  It was during the day.  Even an animal in the bush, when it comes out of the bush, it is afraid; it is frightened because it is used to moving about at night.  So I'm telling you I thought about it and I realised that I reached Idjwi on the 4th of June, the beginning of June.  
Now, I stayed at that place for one week, the place where those words had been said.  So, it's after a week that I reached Idjwi Island, and those words were saying that it was the end for the Tutsis.  He no longer wanted to hear mention made of Tutsis.  That's what he said.  So that's what I used as my point of reference in order to try and remember the date.

@MR. BESNIER:
One last question on this, Mr. Witness.  Did you, as you said, think of it or did somebody asked you to change this date from the beginning of May to the end of May 1994?
@A.
Well, if there is anyone who reminded me of that date, he would have given me the exact date.  I'm saying that I tried to recollect the date on which I got to Idjwi, and I said it was on the 4th of June, that is what they told me anyhow when I got there.  That is what led me to go over the chronology of events.  I remained in Rwanda for one week.  
Now, when you take it from there, I conclude that the last time I saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was toward the end of May.  At the time he made the statement that I referred to. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Witness, let's focus a bit on the kitchen in which you sought refuge at the Gasharu centre.  At what time did you realise that there was a roadblock close to that kitchen; was it before you went into the kitchen or after?
@A.
I already knew the position of that roadblock.  But at 4 a.m., I decided to stop because at that stage I needed to look for a hiding place, somewhere I could hide.  You could be -- you could be found, but it was not proper to be seen by others or to expose yourself to other people.
@MR. BESNIER:
And in order not to expose yourself to other people, I suppose that you hid yourself very well in that kitchen and that you locked the window and the door?
@A.
The window was already closed, but the door was not closed.  If I had closed it, people would start wondering.  Normally when a door is left ajar no one can suspect the presence of a person in that room if the door is left open.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, in relation to Joel Ndabukiye's house, where was the position of this kitchen?
@A.
Ndabukiye's house which is in Gitaka, there is also his own house; so which one of the two are you referring to?
@MR. BESNIER:
Maybe with the assistance of the registry we can give the witness photos of the Gitaka centre, which is in Exhibit P2 and maybe the witness will be able to recognise the kitchen in which he was hiding.  Exhibit P2, there are documents L0019894, and L0019895, which show the Gitaka centre.  
Maybe the registrar can show the photographs to the witness, and let the witness tell us if he is able to recognise the kitchen.  
If the witness is able to recognise the kitchen, then he should point it out on the overhead projector.  Otherwise it would not be useful.  The L- number is L0019884.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
19884.
@MR. MUSSA:
Yes.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, you have in front of you two photographs of the Gitaka centre.  Please scrutinise them carefully and tell the Court if, one, you are able to identify the kitchen in which you were hiding?
@A.
I'm sorry, if you allow me, if you can -- if I can have somebody next to me because I have a sight problem.  So if someone could show me the Gitaka road on the photograph as well as the actual car marketplace -- if someone can show me the marketplace.
@MR. BESNIER:
If witness is unable to identify those things, then I wish that he does not answer this question because I don't want any assistance to be given to him.
@THE WITNESS:
If you can identify those places on the photographs, I have told you that I have sight problems, if you have been to the place and you have taken photographs of the place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness.
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know, maybe it is the road that I am seeing in the photograph; if that is the road then I can use it as a landmark.  And that road continues all the way to Gisenyi.  Will it be the road that goes to Ndindabahizi's parents' house?  I don't know; I told you that I could not see clearly, but I'm asking for help --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness.
@THE WITNESS:
-- so as to find some landmarks.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Unfortunately, we cannot help you with the photographs.  So the first question is: when you look at this photograph, you will recognise this place, have you seen it in real life?  Does it remind you of anything?  You are looking at the top photo on this page, there are two photos on the page.  And the first question now, is: do you recognise the place?  Have you been there before?
@THE WITNESS:
$No response)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not expecting an answer that's affirmative if it is difficult to recognise it.  So just start with that question, will you, Mr. Witness -- do you recognise this place?  Do you know where it is? 
@THE WITNESS:
I'm trying.  I can see a banana plantation, but I have problems with my sight.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see -- 
@THE WITNESS:
I'm not able to identify the road as well as the Gitaka centre.  In any case, the roadblock is located between Karara and Ndabukiye's house.  And let me add this, now, the kitchen I referred to, which is a bit far from the marketplace, is downhill from a banana plantation; but I think at the time this photograph was taken, a forest had grown in that place, all around that place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, if I understand you correctly, you have now recognised the place, is that so; yes or no?  Only yes or no answers now, is this a place that you have recognised; yes or no?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see a banana plantation, but I cannot see where -- I cannot see the location of that market, nor the road which I normally should be able to identify.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And the next question, and that is:  The call -- can you see the kitchen on that picture, yes or no; only answer yes or no, Mr. Witness, we don't need more, you see.  Can you see the kitchen where you hid on that photograph?  Is it there or is it outside of the photograph? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, I cannot see the kitchen in question because where that kitchen was located is covered by bush.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you had sight problems for a long time?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, you said that you overheard a conversation between Mr. Ndindabahizi and Mr. Ndabukiye and Mr. Karara; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, I saw them when they were holding a conversation.  They first greeted each other, asked for each other's news; that was the beginning of the conversation.
@MR. BESNIER:
You did not mention Mr. Karara in your written statement; is there any reason for that?
@A.
You mean, I did not mention Karara's name?  People were having a drink in the bar which belongs to Mr. Karara; that is what I said.
@MR. BESNIER:
No, I just meant that in your written statement, written in 2000, you did not mention Karara's name.  And I just wanted to know if you had any particular reason for not mentioning it; probably at that time you did not remember?
@A.
You mean when these investigations were being conducted, I could not mention Karera.  In fact, I was wondering about the number of people that I saw at the roadblock.  They only asked me about those who were manning the roadblock.  That is why I did not mention Karara.  He was busy with his trade in drinks.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Counsel for the Defence, which Karara are we talking about here?
@MR. BESNIER:
We are talking about Karara the bourgmestre, madam.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That, you can't  mean, Counsel. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Well, that one is mentioned in his statement.
@MR. BESNIER:
No, I'm sorry, the bar owner.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is how the witness understood your question, and that is what he responded to.  
So that is being put to you now that you did not mention the trader Karara, the bar owner, in your statement to investigators, and the question is why is that so.  Your answer was that they only asked me to mention those who manned the roadblock; is that your answer?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct, that is what I said. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Let's now come back to your hiding place in a kitchen.  Were you very well within the kitchen or you were at a threshold of the kitchen or the structure?
@A.
I did say that I was within the kitchen, very close to that small window which was covered with soot.  I was inside of the structure, but the door was not closed.
@MR. BESNIER:
I don't understand, Witness, were you close to the window or were you in front of the open door?
@A.
I was close to the window, because the view from the window is on the road -- shows the road.
@MR. BESNIER:
So it is through the window, it is through the window that you saw what you were describing; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, it is visible from the window.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there no danger that the Hutus who were at the roadblock could see your face through the window?
@A.
When people are happy about the presence of a VIP -- let me give you an example.  When somebody comes to you and you haven't seen him in a long time, you rather focus on looking at him.  And that is why they did not look elsewhere.  Besides, when I saw the vehicle arriving, I thought that somebody aboard that vehicle could bring -- could possibly bring a message of peace.  And they were more interested in looking at the person who was come in that vehicle.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you maintain, Witness, that at the distance at which you were at that house, you could see and hear all that you testified on?
@A.
I was a witness of these events and I heard the -- I heard the statements that were made at that place.
@MR. BESNIER:
You immediately recognised Emmanuel Ndindabahizi because you knew him before then?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
When did you see him for the last time before this event that you recounted?
@A.
The last time I saw him was on that occasion which we are talking about.
@MR. BESNIER:
No, when did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before this occasion that we are talking about?
@A.
In the 70's, '78, '80, and I told you that I used to see him in '89 and he used to come and visit.  On some occasions I met him, I bought a vehicle and he was going to Kibuye; when he came to visit people in Kibuye and when I was close to a road I could see him.  So, in summary, I would say that I knew him already.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you be a bit more specific, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi only when he was passing in front of you in a car on the Kibuye road; is that what you are saying?
@A.
I'm saying that before then I used to see him when he was a student of the university he used to come to visit his parents; I use to see him on various occasions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now try to communicate efficiently.  What counsel wants to know now is the last time you saw him before May 1994 and was that in 1989; was that what you said?
@THE WITNESS:
$No response).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year was it, the last time before 1994? 
@THE WITNESS:
I believe the last time I saw him was in '87, I believe that was the last time I saw him in that locality, in that region.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So in 1987 you saw this person.  Did you see him once or several times in 1987?
@THE WITNESS:
That year I saw him on one occasion, but what I know is that I knew him very well.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now, when you saw him on that occasion in 1987, was he then -- did you then see him inside a car passing, or did you observe him in some other situation?
@THE WITNESS:
I believe that it must have been the very last time he came to our locality.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But when you saw him then in '87, was he then inside of the car when you observed him or did you see him somewhere else?
@THE WITNESS:
He used to come with a car, but he would normally park it somewhere on the road and go to his parents' house on foot.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you saw him in '87, did you see him inside of the car or was he walking around, what were the circumstances when you last observed him in '87? 
@THE WITNESS:
In my explanations, I said that he was walking, coming from his house and going to where he parked his car.  So he was walking, there is a slope, so he left his vehicle at some point downhill from his parents' house.

Were you living in the same cellule as Mr. Ndindabahizi between 1970?

Yes, it is.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you also said that you stayed there for about four days in that kitchen; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we missed the very beginning of counsel's question.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Regarding -- how were you feeding yourself during the four days? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Repeat, sir, Counsel.
@THE WITNESS:
The person that I have already mentioned as coming to see me, that person used to give me food and then I would go back to my hiding place.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I understood.  Is it the person who gave you refuge initially who used to come and to give you food?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did that not raise the suspicion of the Interahamwe who were just a few metres from this kitchen, that a person already suspected of giving refuge to the Tutsi should come to this kitchen and bring you food?
@A.
Well, that was being done at night.  We took -- we were in the habit of eating only at night, around    23 hours, and it was only on those occasions that we could eat; that is, obviously, if we are able to find food in the first place.
@MR. BESNIER:
You admitted to this Court that you yourself did not witness the killing of Tatiana, Mukantabana, but that you deduced it from the fact that you saw her body, subsequently; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, they brought her body.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statements, in the last paragraph, you were more assertive and you said Ndabukiye, his son Emmanuel Ndabukiye, Karegeya and Mukantabana with clubs, and I witnessed this from a distance of about 20 metres.  How do you explain that you were able to tell the investigators of the Tribunal that you witnessed this killing, when in actual fact you did not?
@A.
In my written statement, as well as my testimony, I did say that it was only Ndabukiye and his son who took Tatiane to her house for her to show them where she had buried an amount of money, so that the money does not rot.  They were carrying clubs when they took her to her house and they came back with her dead body.  And it was after they brought her dead body that they now went and looked for Karara.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is different, Mr. Witness?
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, the question is why did you tell the investigators of the Tribunal in November 2000 that you witnessed the killing of Mukantabana from a distance of 20 metres, whereas in this court you said that you were not witnessed -- witness to that event?
@A.
This is not a contradiction because I saw her body when she was brought back; I personally saw her body brought by the same people who -- who led the deceased person to her house before bringing her body back.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness, that is your answer.  Another -- in another answer you said that you left your Hutu friend who was hiding you and that you found a hiding place in this kitchen by chance; is that -- was that your testimony?
@A.
I have already clarified that issue.
@MR. BESNIER:
In other words, your friend did not know where you were going to hide when you left his house?
@A.
When you leave a person's house to go to another place, that person will find out -- would like to know where you went.  And you yourself would give some information.  And it is a manner of proceeding to find traces of the person you are looking for if he is, indeed, a friend.  That is how this person was able to trace me and find me where I was hiding in order to give me food.
@MR. BESNIER:
So, were other people apart from this Hutu friend, aware of your hiding place?
@A.
No, no one else knew my hiding place.
@MR. BESNIER:
So, how could this friend bring you food every night, since he did not know where your hiding place was?
@A.
I have told you this.  There is a manner or there is a way of proceeding.  You may -- you may signal to someone who is looking for you by putting on a torch light or making a -- showing a sign.  People were moving around, around 23 hours and that is when we ourselves could come out of our hiding.  And we -- we will move around until 4 a.m. because the roadblocks were not operational during that period between 23 hours and 4 a.m.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, let me backtrack a bit, because there was one thing that I did not understand.  Did you say that Mukantabana, Tatiane and Nyiramaritete, Tatiane, were one and the same person, that these two names refer to one and the same person?
@A.
Yes, these names refer to one in the same person.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you say that you situate the death of Nyiramaritete one week after Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's visit at the Gitaka centre?
@A.
No.  I said it was about four days after his visit.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, I have one or two more questions, Witness.  
Are you able to tell the Court how you were able to contact the investigators of the ICTR when you gave your statement in November 2000?
@A.
They came to look for me at the said centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
Which centre, I did not understand your answer?  Don't mention the name of the centre if that is a problem for you.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, witness has just mentioned the name of the centre.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this centre, if it is stated in open court, would it reveal your identity, were many people arriving at that centre, so that there is no risk involved?  Just tell us whether it is sensitive information or not, please.
@THE WITNESS:
That would raise a problem because my sisters, my nieces and my nephews go to this centre and this could be a problem for them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is why the interpreters picked this up and did not translate it.  They are very vigilant.

I will show you a name of a person and then ask you whether you know who that person is.

With leave of the Chamber, Your Honours, I have a name I want to show this witness.
@MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President, unless the name has already been mentioned in the examination-in-chief or in cross-examination.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to show this name to the Defence because we are not quite aware why this is coming up now.  So if you can show this document to the Defence.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, actually, Your Honours, it is -- it is the seventeenth name on the witness manual.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you see, that is all right, but why is this coming up now?  Is it -- did it arise during           cross-examination?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it arose because this name is related to the Exhibit P20, to the name on Exhibit P20.  There is a direct connection between P20 and that name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you -- have you identified the name, Defence?  Are you aware of which name they are talking about?
@MR. BESNIER:
No, I know the name mentioned in P20 -- D20.  But I do not see why the Prosecutor is asking the witness to mention another name.  And I don't know what I will be able to say about the new name which is being brought about by the Prosecutor.  And I do not believe this name came out of the examination-in-chief.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, why don't you show us this piece of paper, Mr. Kapaya, and then we will see what we will do with it.  
Registry, if you could kindly show us the document, and then we will deal with it. 
Yes.  Now, that is, as the Prosecutor just said, No. 17 on the witness list.  And now you have to tell us, Mr. Kapaya, why this is coming up now.  You have to explain that, please. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, this name -- the name the witness wrote on Exhibit P20 appears in paragraph 8 of the particulars of this -- of the name which I am circulating now.  That is on page 185, the witness bundle it is the second name there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We know that page 184 contains the particulars of the witness No. 17 on your list.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  Now on page 185 --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Paragraph 8, if you will look at the second name, it rhymes with P20.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is true.  Now, why is this coming up now?  Why didn't you draw our attention to this when you produced P20?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, it is coming up now because I want to show the link between P20, the failure of the witness to mention for the three weeks -- I mean the failure of the witness to mention why it was -- the fact that this matter is not contained in the witness statement, but to account for the three weeks that are not in the witness statement.  And this goes to the credibility of the witness.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I strongly object to this.  The Prosecutor is wanting to ask questions of this witness about testimony which has not been heard.  And I strongly object to this, Mr. President, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I mean, of course, one can ask the Court to raise something in the direct which is not mentioned in cross.  But here we feel, all three of us, that you raised this issue about the possible explanation concerning this three-week period in your chief.  You produced P20, and you could have drawn this into the testimony at that occasion.  So we are disallowing that question now.
Next question, please.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could I, Your Honour, at this state maybe produce the statement of this witness as a Prosecution exhibit and then we will deal with it in closing, Prosecution Exhibit P21.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
By the way, you didn't produce this statement, Defence, as an exhibit, in spite of wishing to draw some contradictions to the attention of the Chamber between the oral testimony and the declaration.  Was that your wish or have we overlooked anything?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, you know I normally do this following the discussions, and I do, indeed, wish that the document be admitted as an exhibit.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, because if you do that, then your problem is solved because it is being admitted as a defence exhibit.
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour, this one relates to --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for Counsel, please.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Sorry.  The statement that I'm talking about relates to the statement of witness No. 17.  And as I said, it goes to credibility because on page 183, there is a list of people who are shown to have been hiding with the parents of this person, and the name of this witness appears, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@MR. MUSSA:
Yes.

Objection, Mr. President.  It is even worse than what he wanted to do earlier.  We have certain rules to follow here.  We must hear witnesses and we cannot be satisfied merely with their written statements.  In the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, there are rules to be followed.  If the Prosecutor needs to have a written statement of a witness without hearing that witness, that statement must be authenticated, and he must also respect certain legal aspects.  And we, therefore, believe the Chamber should dismiss this request being made by the Prosecutor because he cannot have as an exhibit a document from a witness who has not yet been heard.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid I have to agree, and all Judges, again, with the Defence here, Mr. Kapaya.  I mean, all of this you could have raised in-chief, but you are trying to introduce evidence in redirect, so we can't allow that, unfortunately.  
Any other questions?
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Well, Mr. Witness, you wrote down the cellule in which you said that you lived before 1994.  Now, my question is: between that cellule -- firstly, in which cellule did the accused person's parents come from?
@A.
Is that question for me; is it meant for me?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I'm asking you a question.  I want to know the cellule from which the parents of Mr. Ndindabahizi come from?
@A.
It was Gasharu cellule.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, can you tell this Tribunal how many cellules, if any, lie between the cellule you were living before 1994 and Gasharu cellule?  Are there any cellules that are between the two cellules or whether that cellule and Gasharu adjoin each other?
@A.
They are not neighbouring cellules but, in fact, between the two cellules passes a stream, such that a person on one side of the stream can call out to another who is on the other side of the stream, in another cellule.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you tell us how far it was from the cellule, how far it was from the place you were living, in the cellule you mentioned and Gasharu cellule?
@A.
It is a distance one can cover on foot in ten minutes; in other words, from the cellule where I lived to Gasharu cellule.  In fact, when you are in my cellule, you can call out to someone who is in Gasharu cellule, and that person will be able to hear you.
@MR. KAPAYA:
You also testified during cross-examination about a sight problem.  Did you have a problem with reading or identifying objects?  Does your problem relate to reading documents or identifying objects?
@A.
I'm unable to read well and I cannot identify objects clearly.  You see, for instance, that I have a screen here which is showing images, but I'm unable to tell what the images are on my screen.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, in May 1994, how did you identify Mr. Ndindabahizi at 20 metres away?
@A.
At the time, I didn't have any problem with my eyesight; it was before I developed problems with my eyesight.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
That is all, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Witness, was your eyesight normal in 1994; is that what you are saying?
@MR. WITNESS:
Yes -- no, I didn't have any problem with my eyesight.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You saw Karegeya being killed; did you?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who killed him?
@THE WITNESS:
It was Ndabukiye and his son, his son who is known as Emmanuel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Where did they kill him?  Where did they kill him?
@THE WITNESS:
It was at the roadblock.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The same roadblock which you have testified to previously in this testimony?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The body of Mukantabana was piled up where, together with other bodies?
@THE WITNESS:
It was below the roadblock.  There was a hole which had been dug there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this is still the same roadblock to which you have referred in this testimony; is it?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have now heard your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha and testifying before the Tribunal.  And we wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you very much, indeed.
@THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, I have an application to make.  I note Your Honours decision following my learned colleague's application pursuant to Rule 85.  I seek to renew that application pursuant to Rule 89(C) of the rules of procedure of this Tribunal, in that the Trial Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which has probative value.  
I also renew that application under the provisions of 92bis, 92bis(A) and 92bis(B) of the Rules of Procedure of this Tribunal, and that Rule states as follows:  "Proof of facts other than those admitted by oral evidence".  Why is 92bis relevant in the incident case?  
The facts are as follows:  The witness that appears before you today, and I forget his pseudonym, CGB testified on a fact that is not contained in his witness statement.  However, that fact is contained in the witness statement of Witness CGD, CGD, Charlie, Golf, Delta.  
Now, what is the relationship between Witness CGD and this witness?  Well, the relationship is as follows:  In Prosecution Exhibit P20, Witness CGB states that he sought refuge at the residence of a certain man named in Prosecution Exhibit P20.  Now, it so happens that that person is Witness CGD's father.  
Therefore, following the provisions of Rule 92bis, such a matter is prime facie admissible in evidence by virtue of the provisions of Rules92bis(A)(1).  It says:  "Factors in favour of admitting evidence in the form of a written statement include, and is not limited to circumstances in which the evidence in question is of a cumulative nature; in that other witnesses will give, or have given oral testimony of similar facts." 
Now, what is a similar fact here?  The similar fact is the witness that just got off of the stand -- namely, Charlie, Golf, Bravo -- states under oath, before Your Honours, that he sought refuge over a period of three weeks at the residence of CGD's father.  He then enters CDG's father's name as a Prosecution exhibit.  
Now, CGD's statement confirms that statement.  And we seek to renew our application under that Rule 92bis.  Failing that, I renew that application under Rule 89(C), just on the basis that it has probative value of the fact that this witness sought refuge for a three-week period at the residence of CGD.  
Your Honour, I'm grateful.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  
Anything from the Defence?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, three brief observations.  The first is that I come from a question -- a country where the rulings made by a Bench is not questioned by any of the parties.  
My second question is that your ruling dismissing the proposal by my learned friend is based on the fact that he did not during his examination-in-chief mention that issue.  So, there was no problem with that.  
My third observation is that we do not find ourselves in the situation of Rule 92bis; but the Prosecution intends to tender as an exhibit the witness statement of a person who is not going to be testifying before the Court.  And it will have the obligation to authenticate the document, some kind of witness, and on which witness statement the Defence will not be able to put any questions.
As for Rule 92bis, you will note that when one wishes to tender an exhibit in the form of a written statement, a certain number of forms or standards have to be respected, and these have not appeared.  And, therefore, I do strongly oppose this application made by the Prosecution.  
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much to both parties, we will come back to this later on.  Now, let us plan this week then.  Mr. Phillips?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Grateful, Your Honour.  Your Honour, we have Madam Alison Des Forges in Arusha.  She arrived last night.  I will be working with her once I leave here, and I propose to call her tomorrow afternoon.  Thereafter, depending on Your Honours' ruling, I reserve my right to now call Witness CGD, but that is a separate matter.  
We have -- as planned, we expect Witness Charlie, Golf, Charlie, No. 11 on Your Honours' list.  And I think we also expect Witness Charlie, Golf, Papa, No. 14 on Your Honours' list; and depending on Your Honours' ruling, Charlie, Golf, Delta.  None of those witnesses are in Arusha as we speak. 
None of them would arrive before Friday of this week.  So once Madam Des Forges has left the stand, I regret that we have no further witnesses to offer the Chamber for the rest of this week.  Hopefully, they will come in on Friday.  Hopefully, they can take the stand on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  And that being the case, we should be in a position to close our case on Tuesday of next week, but it depends on the availability of these witnesses, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Has the Defence now received the French translation of the Alison Des Forges document?
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, but I was promised it by the registry for this afternoon, so I'm hoping the promise is going to be kept.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Promises, promises.  Have we seen -- have you seen the document?  Registry have you received it?
@MR. DIALLO:
Mr. President.  We haven't seen the document yet, but according to the language section we were promised that the document would be ready by the end of the day.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if you get the documents before the end of the day, then you will be able to proceed tomorrow afternoon; is that how I understand the position of the Defence?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, it all depends on what the Prosecutor needs to do.  I understood it to be said that the Prosecution was not going to go too much in depth in Ms. Des Forges' report, in which case we won't have any problem.  If the Prosecution intends to ask questions of the witness of each item of her report, I think we would need more time so I can discuss with my client and my team.  
I'm asking, once again, whether the Prosecution is going to go into an in-depth examination of          Mrs. Alison Des Forges or not?
$Pages 24 to 41 by Donna M. Lewis)
1715H
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is -- it is very difficult at this stage to tell him what an in depth examination of Madam Des Forges's report would consist of.  If my learned friend is suggesting that I am going to have her go through the entire report, then that's not my intention, but rather, my intention is to dialogue with her or at least adduce her testimony in relation to certain aspects of that report, very issues of a general nature.  She might -- she may often need to refer to certain paragraphs in her report and other documents as well, that are not in this document, but have been disclosed to the Defence.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But are you in a position to indicate some of the areas now?  Because my problem is this:  If suddenly there is a delay with the translation, then -- and since we have no other witnesses for this week, and if she is around, then we could hear military, entirely tomorrow, and hear Alison Des Forges on Wednesday, and then we will give more time to the Defence to read the report with the French version and -- but there is a need to know. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The honest answer to Your Honour's enquiry is this:  When I had indicated Tuesday afternoon for Madam Des Forges's testimony, I had done so on the basis that I had been assured that my learned friend for the Defence would have that report in his hands this morning.  I regret that has not been the case, and it has crossed my mind that in view of the fact that he wouldn't have a chance to read it until after he leaves here, it may well be the case that we want to take Alison on -- Madam Des Forges, rather, on Wednesday as oppose to Tuesday.  That's fine by me.  I'm willing to do that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Even in English I can read the document.  I know specifically the points on which I expect to put questions to Ms. Des Forges; I know about that.  Those are elements on which she insisted -- or she mentions Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and they are very few.  
My learned friend has mentioned documents which were attached to that report, and I have not received any disclosure of such documents.  I don't want us to be surprised at the last minute with documents containing materials on Mr. Ndindabahizi, and I wouldn't be able to have gone through them.  I think from Ms. Des Forges's report, we need to identify matters on which I could ask questions of Ms. Des Forges, otherwise the other matters are really of no interest to me. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it's up to you which questions you want to ask.  I'm sorry -- the question now is only a practical one.  And are there any possible documents that the Defence should be apprised of now?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The -- yes, the -- Madam Des Forges will refer to, and she has done so in her report anyway at the last page of the 26th.  She will be referring to the transcripts of the May 3rd meeting, which is a document that has been in circulation for a long time, has been disclosed to --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that is the document you are referring to? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the main document that I referred to, transcripts of the May 3rd, meeting.  He is indicating that in the negative, I'm quite surprised about that, but again, that's the document that we can make available to my learned friend.
@MR. BESNIER:
Unless I am mistaken, I have not received disclosure of this document.  It would seem that this is an extremely important document because it's the only aspect from Ms. Des Forges's report which concerns Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi personally.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If my learned friend has not received it from me in this case, he will certainly have come across it in the Kayishema and the Ruzindana trial.  It was used in conjunction with that case.  As far as it mentions his client, there is a tiny little paragraph of a speech that Mr. Ndindabahizi alleged to have given at the same meeting, which we can have available to him.  As far as I'm concerned, I thought I had given it to him.  If I haven't, I would make it available to him, but again, it's a public document and it's a document that has been referred to over and over again.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, then Mr. Phillips, you will make available the 3rd of May speech, and not -- there will be no need for you, Mr. Besnier, to go the way through the Kayishema, even if that is a public document.  So then we know which document is coming up. 
Any other document coming up in connection with the report of this witness? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is -- there is one -- the one or two interviews of the Accused himself to the Office of the Prosecutor, which I have disclosed to my learned friend in English and in French.  She may or may not be referring to it.  It's just a minor part of it that she wants to talk about, but then again we've disclosed that.  That I did personally, so I know that.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Two interviews with Mr. Ndindabahizi, and that's known to the Defence? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I have those documents, but I am not in possession of the transcripts of the meeting of 3rd May. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would -- I undertake to give that to him as soon as I leave this courtroom.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But in view of what I hear now, maybe Wednesday will be the right time then for this expert's testimony. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm flexible enough.
@MR. BESNIER:
You mean Wednesday afternoon, Mr. President?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, certainly.
@MR. BESNIER:
Readily.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  All right.  So then we decide that we drop this -- we will then adjourn until Wednesday at 
2 o'clock for the testimony of Alison Des Forges.  
Now, I know you are as unhappy as the Bench is, with the frequency of witnesses in this trial, 
Mr. Phillips.  And now I am making -- giving instructions to the registry.  
Registry, by the end of this case, the Chamber wants a written report why it was not possible to ensure the steady flow of Prosecution witnesses, but how we are deprived of witnesses after three days; four days; two days, during these weeks in the courtroom?  So please, provide us with an explanation, and we want that in writing at the end of the Prosecution case.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, there is just one -- if Your Honour has finished addressing the registry, there is one housekeeping matter that I need to address the Court on.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honours, it's in relation to Witness No. 14 on your list with the pseudonym "Charlie Golf Papa".  Your Honour would recall that I had indicated to Your Honours that this witness was brought to Arusha last week.  I haven't met with him.  We then realised that even though he was the person, he was indicated to be as is named on -- in that paragraph.  He was not the person that we intended to speak with.  We then made enquiries and the feedback we got as of last Friday is that somehow along the line, the names of this witness has been mixed up with another witness.  
So the practical situation is this and it's a very unsafe reward:  It's the statement of a certain man, but the witness statement bears all the correct details and all the correct information apart from the name.  The name is that of someone else.  And the only reason why we've been able to ascertain this is that we contacted the next of kin on the statement.  And through the next of kin, who is a local authority in the commune mentioned on that statement, we were able to decipher that rather than the witness being known by the name indicated there, that witness had been responsible for contacting the person with that name, and somewhere along the line the investigators, after this witness's testimony, had put his name - sorry, the name you see on 14, against the statement of his man.  
I have asked for a written explanation as to how this witness -- this mixed up has occurred, and I am only alerting the Court and my learned friend for the Defence, I would present my learned friend for the Defence with the real name -- and not the real name, but the name that has arisen as the owner of the statement.  It's a very unusual situation.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are you now referring to page 152 of your bundle?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you are drawing our attention to the fact that the name on page 152 of the bundle, that is not the correct name?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, it isn't.  It's the correct particulars, but it's not the correct name.  We have another statement from another witness with exactly the same name taken round about the same time.  And I think in cutting and pasting, our investigators somehow have mixed the names up.  And whilst the particulars are correct, the statement does not belong to the person named on that -- on paragraph 1 of page 142; it belongs to somebody else.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But the name is actually correct then.  It's mistaken identity. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The name -- the name is -- the name exists, but it doesn't exist in relation to the statement.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  So, it's the wrong name that was on paragraph 1?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's the wrong name.  The maker of the statement exists; all the personal details on the witness statement are correct.  They belong to someone who has able to confirm that they belonged to him, but for some reason, it's not his name on the statement.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this was Witness 14, but that's someone you will -- that is, yes, CGP who is No. 14 that you may call.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We thought CGP bore this name, but it transpires that whoever CGP is, would not be bearing this name.  It's a statement -- it's CGP's statement, Your Honour, but it's not CGP's name.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So CGP's statement is correct, but the information on paragraph 1 is wrong?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's wrong.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I see.  And you will now inform the Defence of the right name of that witness? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honours, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So that's the situation.  The Prosecution will immediately now inform you of the right name of this witness, 14, which is a witness that you intend to call to Arusha around Friday this week?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Friday this week, yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And he will be heard next week?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Monday, next week.
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm not satisfied, Mr. President.  I'm not all satisfied with the explanations given by the Prosecution.  Since the beginning of this trial, since October 2001, we have received a certain number of documents, most of which were disclosed -- were given to the Judge who confirmed the indictment.  
Now, as for Witness CGP, we did -- we did indeed receive two statements of that witness.  And now we were being told that, "No, there are two different people involved, and one usurp the name of the other".  I'm rather disturbed about the authenticity of this testimony, and I am against all this in the interest of my client.  If the Prosecutor were to be allowed to call this witness, the Defence will question him or her seriously, and in depth, in order to find out how he was brought to testify.  And at this present moment, I would just merely say that, we, at the Defence, are very, very disquiet -- disquieted by the situation.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you mention that there were two statements of this witness, Mr. Besnier.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  In the list which was disclosed in October 2001, that list indeed contains the mention of the witness, CGP.  He was then No. 13 in the first list issued in October 2001, and that witness was interviewed twice on the 4th of April 2001 and the 2nd of June 2001.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
In the bundle, there is only one such statement.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, that's my worry, Mr. President.  That's indeed my concern.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Because they referred to two separate people, Your Honour.  My learned friend is aware that we have two witness statements from persons bearing the same name.  That was the first problem we had in this -- in this case.  One of them we were interested in speaking with.  One was a 41 year old; one is a 38 year old.  That's what we thought until last Friday, that it was coincidence we had two people bearing exactly the same name, but different dates of birth and different particulars.  We opted for the -- we opted to call the 38 year old, who appears in your bundle as CDP -- CGP. However, last week they brought the 41 year old.  When we showed him the statement, he said, "This is not my statement.  This is not my signature".  So we informed the Witness Protection Unit that, "Well, we are aware that there are two people by this, you've brought us a wrong person."  So they took him back.  
In looking for and searching for the real CGP with this name, they couldn't find anyone with this name.  So they decided to go to the next of kin, and said to him, "Well, you've been listed by a certain person as the next of kin.  Do you know this person?"  It then transpired that no such person existed, and the next of kin said, "The only person that you are referring so is my X and X, and he is known by this other name."  We got hold of the person by that name, put this statement to him, compared the personal details at paragraph 8, name of father, name of mother, date of birth, place of birth, signature, it turns out to be our man, but with the wrong name.  I am terribly embarrassed by it.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, the other document which is not in this bundle belonged to whom? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The witness that came last week.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Exactly. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Who is not the person we intended to have a call in this trial.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So you have actually, in view of the fact that this is the right -- the right statement of the intended witness.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's why you want to call this witness on Friday? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, exactly.  Your Honours, just -- yes, Your Honour hit the right -- the nail on head.  The issue is this witness was short-listed for this trial on the basis of this piece of paper in your bundle.  I never met him; I don't know who he is, and the basis for him being in this bundle is this piece of paper.  It turns out to be someone with a different name.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does this clarify matters, Defence?  Apparently the other one you have refers to the one who arrived last week, but who has now disappeared.
@MR. BESNIER:
Not at all, Mr. President.  I can see that Mr. Ndindabahizi was incarcerated because a certain number of statements were given to the confirming Judge, and today the Prosecutor is telling us that these are not the right people who made the statement and names were being mixed up and that other people have produced these statements.  I'm very disquieted. If it were -- if I were in the shoes of the Prosecutor, I would not call this witness, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, you heard that remark, and we have been going on for sometime with the Ndindabahizi's case now.  So you will assess the situation, Mr. Phillips and find out how many witnesses you want to call, but I mean, the Prosecution case is actually coming to an end.  
Then we will meet on Wednesday at 2 o'clock then.  
The Court is adjourned.

Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, Dr. Des Forges.
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Madam Judges.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now could you kindly indicate your particulars for the record, for instance, your date and place of birth, please.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I am Alison Des Forges.  I live at 591 Ra Feitta Avenue, Buffalo, New York, in the United States.  I am a historian by training and I currently work as senior advisor to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  You are an expert in this trial.  Like all other witnesses, you have to tell the truth and follow the normal standards. 
Registry, will you please take the solemn declaration?
@MR. MUSSA:
Madam Des Forge, please stand up.  Raise your right hand and say after me.
$Declaration made by Alison Des Forges in English)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, we have received your report in English and a French version was made available recently and communicated to the parties.
Mr. Phillips, you have the floor.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Your Honours, just a housekeeping matter before we start.
Your Honours, we have received quite a substantial amount of documents I will start with the loose documents, the ones that are not bound.  
The curriculum vitae of Madam Des Forges, is included in your bundle in two languages, English and French.  Your Honours, we then filed another loose document which is entitled, "The Interim Government, established on the 8th April", and contains a list, pretty much of those who formed that government.  That's another loose document.
Your Honours, would you then have another document dated 25th May l994, in English?  It's entitled, "Directives of the Prime Minister to all préfets on the organisation of civil defence".  We may or may not be referring to that document, but, in any event, Your Honour would have it.  
And then Your Honours would have the map, a colour map, which is another loose document there, yes.  And we also have it on the projectors for people in the public gallery.  We will be referring to that map in the course of Madam Des Forges's testimony.  
Going to the bound documents, Your Honours would have bound document entitled, "Interviews with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi".  There are two separate interviews and the reason why we have tabbed them, 1, 2, 3, 4, is that we have English and French versions of each interview.  In particular we will be referring to the last interview, which is on tab 4, and tabs 3 and 4 of that bundle.  These were interviews given to the Office of the Prosecutor over a period of several years by Mr. Ndindabahizi and it's not in dispute.
The final document, may look a bit lost and it's because I don't have the document, the way 
Your Honours have it, is, "The minutes of the May 3rd, meeting in Kibuye.  And again, Your Honours, would have that -- it's a bound copy and I think the colour is white.  Yes, Your Honour.  And 
Your Honours would have that in Kinyarwanda, French and in English.  Again the witness may or may not be referring to that document.  And that would be it, as far as the documents are concerned, 
Your Honour.

Good afternoon.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying, Madam, that you have previously testified before this Tribunal in the following cases:  The matter between the Prosecutor and Akayesu, the Media Trial, the Military Trial and the Gatcumbisi trial.  Would I be correct in saying that you have testified as an expert in all those four cases?

That is correct.

Would I also be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that earlier on this year you prepared a report at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor in the Trial of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, a report that is contained in English on 26 pages and it was filed before this Tribunal on the 1st of September 2003?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Madam Des Forges, in your report you have outlined in some detail the political and to an extent social events that took place in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994.  In that regard, 
Madam Witness, can I start off by asking you if you recall the events that surrounded the advances of the RPF on the 1st of October 1990, very briefly?
@A.
Yes, I do recall those events.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you concisely tell the Trial Chamber the factors that surrounded the incursions in October 1990?
@A.
The Rwandan Patriotic Front launched an attack across the Rwandan frontier with approximately 7000 combatants.  Many of these were descendants of Tutsi, people of Tutsi ethnicity, Rwandans of Tutsi ethnicity, who had lived abroad since the 1960s, after having fled a social and political revolution in their own country.  At the time of the attack they were resident inside of Rwanda, a considerable number of Tutsi civilians, comprising then approximately nine percent of the population.  The government in power was predominantly Hutu.  That is to say, the members of government were of the Hutu ethnic group which was by then, of course, the great majority of the population.  
The President who had taken power in a military coup nearly 20 years before had been losing power, partly as a result of objective conditions over which he had no control.  That is to say a serious down turn in the economic, but partly in response to growing corruption and favouritism as it was perceived by many Rwandans, that had developed considerable at that time in other parts of Africa, considerable movement to end single party states to institute multipartism, and this found echoes within Rwanda among those people who were tired of Habyarimana's Rule.  
When the military combat began, some surrounding President Habyarimana, and almost certainly Habyarimana himself saw this as an opportunity even more than a threat.  That is an opportunity to rebuild his shrinking power base by reaching out in a new attempt to generate popular support, seeing Rwandans and particularly Hutu Rwandans against the enemy, seeing -- creating a sense of an unparalleled people against that enemy who had come from across the boarder.  This was carried a step further in that the enemy became defined over time as those Tutsi civilians inside the country, and the enunciation of that idea, of that theme was clearly within two or three days of the beginning of the war, in part, because the government, on the 5th of October, following a faked attack on the capital, began a programme of massive arrests.  Finally some 11,000 people, many of them were Tutsis and accused of being "accomplices" of the RPF.  
Subsequent to that some two weeks, later, people in the commune of Kibilira, Hutu, attacked Tutsi and killed some 300 Tutsis.  So these were the first events which indicated that that military attack would then be used consciously by political authorities inside the country to depict a link, which was at that point largely a non-existent link between Tutsi civilians and the military force coming from outside the country. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that the end result of that was that Tutsi civilians within Rwanda were then branded as accomplices of the invading force; is that right?
@A.
That was indeed the eventual result.  It was over a period of years, that this idea was developed and actively propagated by certain authorities and by the press so that by the time of the great genocide of 1994, that idea was indeed very widespread.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that the events that you have described and the events that followed thereafter, eventually led to a constitutional amendment in June 1991, that led to multipartism in Rwanda?
@A.
That is correct.  The effect of the military attack was to heighten the pressure on the government, pressure which was already reeling from various donors, who were also anxious to see political reform and heightened the effect also of political descent within the country so that by June, the president was obliged to cede his exclusive political control and to permit the creation of other political parties.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall how many new political parties were formed in the aftermath of June 1991, Madam?
@A.
Depending on exactly when you are speaking of, there were three or four formed almost immediately.  In fact, one had already begun organisation before it was legitimate to do so, but eventually, there were 15 or 16 parties that occupied the political scene of which only four or five were really important.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that the MRND had been in power for some 17 or 18 years prior to 1991; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The main political parties, would you be able to outline them who they were for the Court, please?
@A.
The party, which in numerical terms was the most important after the MRND was the MDR.  The Democratic Republican Movement.  A party which drew its inspirations from an earlier political party, is the PERMAHUTU, which had been important in the first republic.  The Habyarimana government was a second republic.  As I said, it was established as a result of a military coup and it had overthrown the first republic which was dominated by the PERMAHUTU, the PERMAHUTU had their strength largely in the centre of the country, in the préfecture known as Gitarama and in Ruhengeri.  When Habyarimana took over, he shifted the geographical focus even more clearly to the northwest, and his main strength came from Gisenyi and from Ruhengeri.  So the MDR essentially drew on the same kind of constituency as the MRND.  That is the largely role; agricultural, population, but represented a different regional focus.  
The Social Democratic Party, the PSD, was a party generally supported by the intellectuals as they were called, by people in such occupations as law, not so much the businessman, but some high ranking government functionaries, people who had had the benefit of higher education, people like teachers, in some cases, medical assistants and so on.  Geographically the PSD had its greatest strength in the southern part of the country, particularly the préfecture of Butare and in the capital city of Kigali.  The Liberal Party was smaller in number and was very much the sort of party of free enterprise, and of the business community of business people.  In part, because the first and second republic had discriminated against Tutsi.  That is, had made it difficult for Tutsi to obtain higher education and positions in the administration.  Many Tutsi had gone into the area of business and this helps to explain why the Liberal Party was also a party that had the proportionately greatest percentage of its membership who were also Tutsi.  
Eventually, another party was formed in March 1992, considerably after the others and that was the coalition for the defence of the republic, the CDR which represented the most radical form of Hutu ideas, a party which stated clearly that it was to be the representative of Hutu and that was to remain essentially separate from Tutsi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was there a party called, "The PDC party?" And if so what did that party, stand for?
@A.
There was the Democratic Christian Party which was a very small organisation, and which drew its strength, as far as, I recall, from sort of marginal areas of the country, particularly from Gisenyi and from Cyangugu, somewhat from Kibuye as well.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You say in your report at page 4 to 5, that the advent of multipartism led to the creation of a coalition government in 1992, in April.  Do you know how the ministries were distributed in this government?
@A.
That was indeed a watershed in Rwandan history, because the MRND was forced to cede a realistic share of power to the MDR, to the PL and to the PSD, so that the President remained, of course, in the hands of the MRND as did a significant number of ministries.  But approximately half of the ministries went into the hands of the opposition and as was also the case for the post of prime minister.  So the MDR held the post of prime minister as well as certain other ministries and the PL, and the PSD, and the PDC also had a number of places at the governmental table.  This had immediate repercussions all down the line because those parties that had the chance to obtain ministerial posts used them to extend their strength and influence by making changes in the administrative posts within their ministries, so that, in fact, the division of political power at the ministerial table was replicated all down the line, so that persons who had posts in the ministry as well were replaced by members who belonged -- by persons who belonged to the same political party as the minister, so that for example, in the ministry of finance, which was a ministry that fell into the hands of the PSD, important persons not everyone, of course, but important positions in that ministry would then be assigned to people who were a part of the PSD party.
In the perspective, in the long term perspective of elections, this reshuffling within the administration was, of course, important because the party that had posts to deliver, that had control over resources could attract a greater number of adherence than a party that didn't have such opportunities, and this then would give them a better chance in some future elections that were being planned for.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Needless to say, Madam Witness, the coalition government of 1992 then led to negotiations with the RPF and eventually the signing of the Arusha Peace Accords in 1993, did it not?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How were the Arusha Peace Accords received?
@A.
As far as we can tell from comments at the time, the vast majority of Rwandans were extraordinarily relieved to have this long and punishing war finally settled, and there was great rejoicing among many people.  There were, however, several groups who did not regard the settlement as final and who were not satisfied with its terms.  
On the side of the government, there were particularly some military leaders, as well as some civilian political leaders, notably people from the CDR, as well as some from the MRND, who are even as the ink was drying disavowed the Arusha Accords and made it clear that they did not regard this as a final settlement.  And on the side of the RPF, there were, apparently from indications we now have, other? Persons who also believed that the war was not finished and to begin to make preparations for a further battle.  I do not know and I do not know of anyone who has done the work, to say, with any assurance, which, if anyone of these parties took the lead, that is, was the initiative in the hands of Rwandan government soldiers and others who were not satisfied and who began to prepare for further battle, and this then provoked further preparations on the side of the RPF.  Was it the contrary or were they both -- were both sides preparing simultaneously without regard to the plans of the other.  I simply do not know.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would it be correct to say, Madam Witness, that the signing of the Arusha Peace Accords in essence created three blocks of political power in Rwanda, namely, the MRND, the party which was in power, the internal opposition and the RPF? would it be correct to say that?
@A.
That is correct, and the diplomats who had laboured long and hard to achieve this settlement regarded that as one of the strong points of the arrangement, because rather than being a bi-polar or two sided agreement, it was a kind of a three-legged stool, and it was anticipated that that would give greatest stability to the arrangements for the transitional period to come, a series of events which had already been on the way at the time the Accords were signed, but which speeded up throughout the rest of the year, ended up in fact dividing that three-legged stool in half, so that by end of the year, the three-legged arrangement was finished, and it was a bi-polar, a two sided political situation in Rwanda.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Madam Witness, what were the factors in your opinion that led from the shrinking of the three power structure into the two power structure?
@A.
The internal coalition of parties, that is the PSD, the MDR and the PL had, as we established earlier, entered into the first discussions with the RPF that led eventually to government negotiations with the RPF.  But there were some within that group of parties who were not completely at ease with the alliance, with the RPF for several different reasons.  And then in February of 1993, before the peace Accords were signed, the RPF violated the ceasefire by launching a major military offensive from the north down towards the city of Kigali.  They were eventually persuaded to stop their events and to withdraw, and there was a new ceasefire, but in the interim, this had shattered the faith of a number of people in those three parties, the PSD, the MDR and the PL, had shattered their faith in the good intentions, in the good faith to the RPF.  So there were some who began to say, "How is it possible that these people are continuing to negotiate and at the same time launched a major offensive.  Doesn't that indicate perhaps their intentions are not what they would appear to be?  So that was one consideration.
The second was, the accords themselves gave a remarkably large share of power in the military to the RPF.  The RPF obtained 40 percent of the rank and five in the army and 50 percent of the command posts.  And this was seen as many -- as further proof of, should we say, an excessive appetite on the part of the RPF and an indication of danger.  
Then the final event which really was conclusive for many, was the assassination of the president of Burundi.  The country to the south of Rwanda, a country which is demographically quite similar although its political history has been very different, but it is a country where Tutsi had held a dominant role until 1993 when Hutu won a free and fair election.  A Hutu candidate won a free and fair election for president, that was Melchior Ndandaye.  He was assassinated by Tutsi soldiers at the end of October 1993.  This then led to an enormous barrage of propaganda within Rwanda, distorting the details of Ndandaye's death and depicting the Tutsi as a group united to either continue or 
re-establish domination over the Hutu, and in this propaganda, the RPF of Rwanda was associated with the Tutsi of Burundi.  
So they were treated as a single unit.  This caused further concerns and doubts among Rwandans, including many who had previously been willing to support a form of alliance with the RPF.  So it was a series of events like that that contributed to this realignment in the political scene.  The realignment was symbolised by the division of two political parties, that is, the MDR and the PL which divided into each one, into two wings.  One wing known as the MDR and the other known as the MDR power.  And in the case of the PL, PL and PL power.  The term was taken from the idea of Hutu power, meaning an ethnic  -- an ethnic union of great solidarity which would in fact minimise or subsume a previous party divisions among the Hutu.  So it was that Hutu party -- Hutu power ideology which found expression in the division of some of these political parties.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was the PSD involved in this division? 
@A.
There's indication that there was strain within the PSD, particularly in November and December, some fairly shock debates within the party but they did reach the point of tearing the party apart as they had with the other political organisations.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At page 10 of your report, Madam Witness, you describe in great detail the speech of a man called, Karemera of the MDR in Gitarama, in October 1993.  Are there any portions of that speech that you would like to talk about this afternoon?
@A.
Well, that speech which was broadcast on the radio was regarded as the clearest and most aggressive enunciation of the idea -- expression of the idea of Hutu power, and it said basically that, "We, as Hutu, we must unite.  We are threatened by the Tutsi and, or, party distinctions should now become reduced in importance and we must remember that we Hutu are brothers and we must get to work".  And one significant aspect of the speech was the use of the term, "To work", which was a term that referred back to the 1960s at the time when people attacked and in some cases killed Tutsi.  So work had a very peculiar and specific special connotation and when Karemera called on people to, "work", that then was seen as incitation to violence, and as an indication that this very highly placed political official was, in fact, calling upon people to mobilise for future attacks against Tutsi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When we look back at a colourful map, Madam Witness, can you tell us, was Hutu power received throughout Rwanda or, was it limited to certain sections of that country, at the time, in 1993?
@A.
Well, the map shows areas of MRND strength, but it's somewhat misleading here because in 1994 at the start of the genocide, there were, in fact, large areas of the north of Rwanda that were no longer occupied because with the advance of the RPF, there had been a massive displacement of the population, so that if you were to have a snapshot of April 1994, you would not have the same dispersion of MRND members across the country.  But in general, this gives you a sense of which areas were of MRND strength. Those areas would certainly have been identified with Hutu power.  
Now when it gets to MDR, its more complicated because the MDR which you see here in green are -- this map does not distinguish between MDR power and the other wing of the MDR.  And while the MDR power areas would also be joined with the MRND in accepting Hutu power, those are communes -- were préfectures which, and I am thinking particularly of Gitarama, where the préfet was not of the MDR power.  Those areas would have had a far more divided allegiance if any at all, to the ideas of Hutu power.  And then if you move further south, into the area of the PSD, both somewhat over there in Kibuye and then Gikongoro and Butare, there Hutu power would have been at its weakest and perhaps non-existent in some areas certainly.  So that in general, you could say the Hutu power ideas were well established in perhaps a half of the country, but that in the rest of the country, the ideas were known, but either not widely accepted, or accepted but not with any intention of putting them into action.  So you can think of three levels.  People who believed the ideas and were ready to act on them, people who perhaps believed the ideas but were not convinced of the need for action and then people who rejected the idea completely.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You have not made any mention of the CDR party.  Was the CDR involved in the coalition government or indeed any of the council of ministers after 1993?
@A.
The CDR had no official role in government institutions.  It was by its very expression, regarded as too radical, too extreme to be part of legitimate government structures at that time.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Going on now to the events of April 6th, 1994, and the killing or, the death rather, of the president of the republic, Madam Witness, several members of the cabinet were indeed eliminated following the president's death.  Do you recall why these people were eliminated and who they were?
@A.
Yes.  After the president's aeroplane was shot down, a group of military led by Colonel Bagosora took control of both the military and the civil situation for a brief period of time.  And Colonel Bagosora attempted several times to persuade other military officers and to persuade also the International community in the form of the UN representatives, to persuade them to allow him to establish a military government. 
His fellow -- some of his fellow military officers did not trust Bagosora, did not want to allow him to do that and the UN representatives categorically refused and pointed out that although the president had been killed, the prime minister was still alive.  And indeed we have abundant testimony from many people about the effort on the part of General Dallier, who was the UN commander at the time of the peacekeeping force and Mr. Boo-boo who was the UN Secretary General special representative, of their efforts to persuade Bagosora, to accord, Madam Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, the opportunity to establish control and to reassert the power of the government in this critical situation.  
It was perhaps at the very insistence that Bagosora must pay attention to Madam Uwilingiyimana that in fact sealed her death because Bagosora understood that taking over the reigns of power would not be possible so long as members of the legitimate government or any significant number of them remained available to be seen as the real leaders of power. So as soon as this became clear in the early hours of April 7th, various military groups were sent out to assassinate a number of leading members of the government, including the prime minister and various others who were representatives of political parties opposed to the MRND.  And in that way, Colonel Bagosora was able, with the help of other military, to clear away the legitimate authorities and to make the argument that there was a power vacuum, and that he would then need to step into that vacuum, to take control. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the court would prefer that we stay a little bit away from the military key players and that we concentrate on this Accused.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Therefore, Madam witness, quite a number of ministers were eliminated in the first few days, the first week of April, in particular, the 7th of April.  Do you happen to recall who those were.
@A.
Well, among the ministers who were eliminated, of course, there was the Prime Minister, 
Madam Uwilingiyimana.  There was Landol Ndasingwa, who was the minister of labour and social affairs.  There was Faustin Rutogoza, minister of information, there was Fredric Nzamarumbaho of the PSD party, who was the Minister of Agriculture, and then there were a number of other ministers who fled.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The president of the constitutional court, was he killed on 7th April as well?
@A.
That is correct. Joseph Kavuruganda, the president of the constitutional court was killed, as was also Felicia Ngago of the PSD party.  And the importance of the death of both Ndasingwa and Ngago is that one of those two were selected to become the president of transitional assembly and might therefore have been called upon to replace President Habyarimana.  The importance of assassinating Kavurunganda was that as head of the court, he was the person -- he was the person who would have been needed to swear in a new legitimate government.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In essence, after the president's death on April 6th, l994, there were three types of politicians in Rwanda.  Those who were killed, those who fled, and those who formed the new government, isn't that correct, Madam Witness?
@A.
You could summarise it that way, certainly at the national level, yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

Your Honour, yes.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could we take this opportunity to ask for a slow down and a break between the question and answer.  Thank you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In relation to the interim government which was established on the 8th of April 1994, can you explain to the Court the circumstances that surrounded the nomination of the president of the country at the time?
@A.
The provisions of the Arusha Accords as I recall, did not provide for the succession, if the president would be killed in the transition period.  So that the authorities making the decisions, instead went back to the provisions of the 1991 constitution which were to have the president succeeded by -- that is, have the president of the republic succeeded by the president of the National Assembly, and, in this case, that was Dr. Sindikubwabo, who was, in fact, installed as president on April the 9th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And his installation or election as president was in furtherance of article 42 of the 1991 constitution, was it not, Madam Witness?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Jean Kambanda, he was appointed prime minister, was his appointment predicated?
@A.
The naming of commander was perhaps predictable in the sense that he had been the candidate for prime minister of that transitional government of the MDR power faction.  He had been defeated by Madam Uwilingiyimana, but his name had surfaced in July of '93, as a potential prime ministerial candidate representing the MDR power wing.  Because the new government was in fact an embodiment of the Hutu power ideology, it was perhaps predictable that Kambanda would be named to that position, although his age and relative lack of national stature might have been seen to weigh against him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did Kambanda have any influence in your opinion in choosing his cabinet, members of his cabinet at that time?
@A.
As I understand, Mr. Kambanda had little, if any little influence.  I believe he was himself in hiding and needed to be located and persuaded to accept his post, and then some members of his government did not meet him until the actual day of installation, and this certainly is unusual situation for -- if one --  if one were to have supposed him to be in the driver's seat, one who have supposed that he would have known the persons he was naming to his ministries.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That was indeed the case, was it not, Madam Witness, in relation to the accused in this case, 
Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
To put it differently, do you know whether Mr. Kambanda knew the Accused?
@THE WITNESS:
According to the information that Mr. Ndindabahizi himself had supplied in his interview, he met

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Going back to the other members of that cabinet, do you know if there were any ministers that had been retained from the previous coalition government in this present interim government?
@A.
Yes, there were a considerable number who were retained.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know why those people might have been retained in the interim government?
@A.
The government was established, on its face, as a fulfilment of the -- as a continuation of prior political arrangements; that is to say, it was a multiparty government as the previous government had been.  But, in fact, despite the facade of various parties being represented, normally, one would suppose that a multiparty government represents different points of view.  Because of the Hutu Power bond, this new government, despite its multiple parties, in fact, represented only a single political view, so that those ministers who were continued from the previous government were those who agreed with -- to one extent or another agreed with the power -- the programme of Hutu Power.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If we look at the list of members of the interim government, the first category that is listed there -- namely, ministers retained from the previous coalition government -- apart from the tenth name on that list, that of Rafiki Nsengiyumva who belonged to the PSD, and the third name on the list who was a PDC member, would I be correct in saying that most of the people on that list had some affiliation of the order to the MRND party or the MDR Power?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, looking at Nos. 8 and 9 on that list, we have described them there as PL members, but they are pro-MRND.  Can you explain why that is?
@A.
As I indicated, before the Liberal Party, the PL, had divided into PL Power, if you want to call it that kind of wing, those two people were representatives of that wing.  Mr. Mugenzi was, in fact, the leader of the PL Power faction.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When I then look at No. 10 on that list, Rafiki Nsengiyumva, he belonged to the PSD party and he obviously was retained in the new government.  Now, Madam Witness, what would have been the explanation for this, in view of the fact that you had testified that the PSD had no known factions at this time?
@A.
I did say that there had already been considerable debate within the PSD, not sufficient to lead to a division within the party.  But the events of April 7th and April 8th had led to -- had resulted in the killing of a significant number of PSD political leaders, all of them of the group that was opposed to the MRND and the Hutu Power ideology.  This meant that there were very few senior PSD politicians left on the scene and those who were left were almost certainly to be identified with the Hutu Power factions.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When we look at the second category, that of ministers who joined the interim government, are you able to tell the Court whether or not these men were known extremists -- men and women were known extremists or not?
@A.
From my knowledge, I would say that some of them had already established a reputation of some extremism, but that there are others who would have been relatively unknown and who perhaps would have had a relatively low political profile; that is, that they would not have been clearly identified as strong proponents of the Hutu Power ideology.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When we look at No. 9 on that list, the man named Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, do you know whether or not he held any notable position within the national structure of the PSD party at this time?
@A.
I believe he was a member of the préfectural leadership, not of the national leadership of PSD.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would that have qualified him for nomination to the cabinet at this time, in your opinion?
@A.
Under normal circumstances it would have been unusual for someone who had a position in the préfectural level leadership and no other national ties of importance to be named minister.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know what ethnic group those who composed the interim government -- by that I mean, Nos. 1 to 10 on the first list and Nos. 1 to 9 on the next list -- do you know if they belonged to different ethnic groups at this time?
@A.
I believe that all these people called themselves Hutu and were generally acknowledged to be Hutu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, was that not a recipe for disaster at the time?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What does that question mean?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Just a question, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What does it mean?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your expert opinion, a government formed of one ethnic group in a country that has ethnic diversity, was it or was it not a recipe for disaster?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The fact that this government was composed in that way, did that have any impact on the following development in the country?
@THE WITNESS:
Certainly, the fact that members were of a single ethnic group had importance, but it would not, in and of itself, have been of major importance had that group of people represented a diversity of views.  What was perhaps most significant was not the fact that they were Hutu, but the fact that they were proponents of an ideology which was extremely aggressive against Tutsi, because one could imagine a government made up of Hutu of other points of view which would have, of course, resulted in a very different outcome.

If we turn to a bundle of interviews with Mr. Ndindabahizi, tab 4, page 2 of that document.
@MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I don't know whether my learned colleague intends to tender the document as an exhibit, because we have a problem with it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have there a document with a K-number.  What is your problem with the document, please?  Is it the whole bundle or is it this particular page?
@MR. BESNIER:
It's the whole document, Mr. President.  This document seems to me to be a compilation of interviews that the Accused allegedly gave to the investigators of the Tribunal where (sic) he was already a suspect.  Now, I'm referring to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and Rule 42 provides that at the very least before a suspect is questioned or interviewed he should have a right to counsel and he also has the right to remain silent, and this was not respected.  I think these interviews were carried out in violation of Ndindabahizi's rights and the information he provided was taken from him by a wily manner.  In this case, Mr. President, I don't think it would be faithful or fair to refer during these proceedings to documents which were taken in violation of Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Those are the bases for my objections, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Prosecution?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There are several issues that arise here.  Both Mr. Ndindabahizi and his counsel have been aware of these interviews for the last seven years.  The interview I refer to and the great majority of the interviews in this bundle were obtained voluntarily -- voluntarily -- in 1996.  Mr. Ndindabahizi was not indicted by my office until the year 2001.  Now, I don't see the basis for my learned friend's argument.  It's clear.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But do you know whether the provisions in Rule 42 were respected or not during the process?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, 42 is only triggered if he is a suspect, Your Honour.  I have no knowledge of that.  If he was not a suspect and if he was acting in some other capacity, Rule 42 is not triggered.  Rule 42 is only triggered when he was a suspect.  That is as far as I understand Rule 42.  To me, it applies to suspects.  And they have to be able to show, and they have the burden of proof, that in 1996 Mr. Ndindabahizi was a suspect of the Office of the Prosecutor.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So he was indicted in 2001?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, and all the witness statements that surround this case, as you, yourself, know, are dated in the year 2000, 2001.  So what's the legal or factual basis for arguing that Mr. Ndindabahizi was, indeed, a suspect in 1996?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have proof that Mr. Ndindabahizi was a suspect because, in the documents submitted to the confirming Judge, we have two witnesses -- witness statements, JK and that statement was taken on the 10th November 1994; and then we have ACV, and his statement was taken on the 19th of August 1996.  Therefore, Ndindabahizi was indeed a suspect at the time when these statements were collected.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court has taken a moment to deliberate.  Of course, for the time being we are not at the question of entering this document as an exhibit; we are at the stage where counsel wants to refer to the document.  I assume that this will be entered later on as an exhibit so we can well have that consideration in mind.
The Court doesn't know at this stage whether there was a breach of Rule 42 or not.  We have not been informed so far whether we are -- we note that the two parties argue that Rule 42(B) is available here and, according to the Prosecution, this -- one issue is whether he was a suspect, and the other one is whether he voluntarily waived his right to counsel and then decided to proceed with the interviews.  We do not have any knowledge at this stage to conclude that there is a violation of Rule 42, and further documentation would have to be submitted to that effect, and even if there were a violation of Rule 42, the next issue would then be the effects of such a violation.  But for the time being we will admit the question.  And that's where we are now.  So what was the question?

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Madam Witness, if we turn to page 2 of tab 4 of this bundle, have you had a chance to reflect on the contents of the first bundle which starts "On 8th of April"; and, if so, what do you make of the contents of the paragraph in relation to the basis of which Mr. Ndindabahizi came to become a member of the interim government?
@A.
This paragraph confirms information which we have from a number of sources that indicates the events of the day of April 8th.  As is indicated here and elsewhere, the authorities, and these were largely military, who were engineering the creation of this government had been able to assemble representatives of the other political parties which then engaged in a discussion as to which ones of their members would be named to ministerial posts.  This had not been the case for the PSD, whereas I mentioned most of the national leadership had already been killed.  And it was apparently in search of representatives of the PSD, so that there could be a full complement of all the parties that had been in the previous government, that Colonel Bagosora came to the residence of Mr. Nsengiyumva, where he found Mr. Ndindabahizi.
On route back to the ministry of defence where the discussions were going on about forming the government, they picked up also a Mr. Ndungutse who was of the PSD membership, and it was those three who then represented the PSD in the discussions that followed and as a result of which it was concluded that Mr. Nsengiyumva would keep his cabinet post and that other two PSD posts which had become vacant -- one by the flight of the previous minister of finance, the other by the murder of the previous minister of agriculture -- that those two posts would be given to Mr. Ndindabahizi and Mr. Nsabumukunzi.  This suggests to me that the process was one of, shall we say -- desperation is perhaps too strong a word, but one where there was not a multiplicity of candidates available in any case, and that, by chance, Mr. Ndindabahizi was on the scene.  He was someone who had a background in finance and it was that which then tipped the scale in favour of his being named minister of finance.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  Now, when we look at the representation of the members of the interim government, has anything struck you as to the origins, the geographical origins of those people; and, if so, what?
@A.
Yes, it was remarkable that both the préfecture of Kibuye and the préfecture of Butare were very helpfully represented.  This was extremely unusual because in previous governments both of those préfectures had been very under-represented.  It appears that there had been a conscious decision to reach out to those two préfectures which would not ordinarily have been within the ambit of MRND and certainly not of the MRND-Hutu Power coalition.  So it was an attempt to integrate potential voices of opposition into the governmental structure so that they would then be able to cooperate in carrying forward government programmes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And when we look at the list of ministers, are you able to indicate how many ministers had come from the préfecture of Butare?
@A.
I believe there were four from Butare.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know which ones they were?
@A.
I believe Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, Straton Nsabumukunzi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I think I misled you a bit, actually.  The president was on the list.
@A.
Of course.  The president, of course, he is of great importance, and then, in addition, in the interior ministry, the actual minister of interior at the time was Mr. Munyanzesa who had not returned to Rwanda.  He had been on the president's -- part of president's delegation in Dar-es-Salaam and he had not returned and he did not return.  But the government continued to list him as the minister of interior until May when Mr. Karemera of Kibuye was named to replace him.  But in the interim the business of the ministry of the interior was carried on by the administrative head of the ministry who was a very important figure from Butare named Callixte Kalimanzira, so it was his name that I was thinking of in terms of another figure from Butare.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know where the prime minister hailed from?
@A.
The prime minister, of course, is as well as from Butare.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When we look at the list, do you know which ministers on that list originated from the Kibuye préfecture?
@A.
From Kibuye it would have been Agnes Ntamagyaliro, Eliezer Niyitegeka, Edouard Karemera, when he was eventually named to the ministerial post, and Mr. Ndindabahizi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, when we go back to our map, would I be correct in saying that it is indicated on that map when we look at Butare préfecture that there was some diversity in the political representation in Butare préfecture, looking at the multitude of colours staring us in the face there?

That is correct.  There was more variety in Butare préfecture than in any other single préfecture.

Well, Kibuye has one very large commune which is in the hands of the PSD bourgmestre, Gitesi, a very important commune, and the other one of Gishyita which is in the hands of the MDR, the rest being MRND.  Kibuye had been known as a place of fairly vigorous political competition; in fact, actual conflict and strife, particularly between the MDR and the MRND.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know, Madam Witness, which of the communes in Kibuye the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi hailed from?
@A.
I believe he was from Gitesi.

And that is the commune indicated on that map as being a PSD stronghold, is it not?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, let's look at Gikongoro préfecture.  What are your comments in relation to that préfecture, also in the south?
@A.
Yes.  Gikongoro was not quite as mixed a préfecture as Butare, but nearly so.  The MRND was no longer of great importance there, although the préfet was an MRND loyalist.  But at the level of bourgmestres, the MDR had gained a considerable amount of terrain and -- as had the PSD, and within some of these communes there was a very active struggle going on between those two parties and also between each party and the MRND.  So it had been in the previous period an area of considerable political conflict.  I should point out that in -- beginning in 1991 and going through 1992 and part of 1993, there had been very vigorous competition between political parties, and it was this that had given birth originally to the militia.  They had fought against each other in this context of developing multiparty activity, attempting to secure increasing numbers of adherents.  So in some cases there had been actual bloodshed between parties.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I think I said: "What, in your opinion, Madam Witness, would be the single most important reason for the representation of ministers from these southern préfectures?
@A.
As I said, the obvious political reason was to engage these areas in the execution of government policies that they might otherwise not have been inclined to support.  In this connection, it's significant that Butare was the préfecture of where -- with the highest proportion of Tutsi population.  It had been known over time as an area where there was considerable intermarriage and considerable harmony between Hutu and Tutsi, so that if the -- given the context of growing violence against Tutsi, were there an intention to carry out actual violence against Tutsi, it would be important to have southern leaders participating in the government authorities directing that violence.  In the first hours and the first days after April 6th, a number of political opponents of the MRND and MDR were inclined to see the violence as an attempt, once again, by northerners to take control of the political scene, and it was to ensure that that image not continue, that southerners were so important to the political combination.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Having been established on the 8th of April or the 9th of April, thereabouts, were the policies of the interim government a continuation of the previous government or were they different?
@A.
The previous government had included people of a diversity of political views, but it was a government which had been committed by its signature to implementing the Arusha peace accords.  The new government did not manifest any such clear intention and, as I say, it represented a point of view, a far more homogeneous point of view in terms of hostility towards Tutsi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The negotiations that had commenced with the RPF in 1993, did those negotiations continue under the new political dispensation?
@A.
The negotiations of 1993 had produced the Arusha Accords in August which were, in theory, a final peace treaty so, in theory, there was no longer a state of war.  But after the shooting down of the president's airplane, combat was again renewed, so the question of renewed negotiations was indeed an important issue.  Although the government on a number of occasions proclaimed its willingness to participate in such negotiations, in fact, there were no successful negotiations carried out.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At page 16 of your report in English you state that by Monday, April 11th, 1994 an estimated 20,000 Rwandans had been killed, the vast majority of them being Tutsis.  My question is this: in view of the prevailing situation in Rwanda, was the government -- the interim government able to afford its citizens with security of life and property, to the entire populace?
@A.
Certainly not.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And can you expand on why you answer in the negative?
@A.
Within hours of the downing of the airplane, military leaders and militia leaders went into action organising attacks, particularly against Tutsi but also against persons of political parties felt to be opposed to the MRND and MDR Power group.  These military and political leaders eventually also, with the help of administrative officials, were able to encourage and promote these killings which had within a period of a very few days produced a death toll of 20,000.  So in those circumstances it was clear that the authorities were not protecting their citizens, or not protecting them on an equal basis and were, some of them were certainly, actively encouraging their slaughter.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indeed, in your report you describe those killed as the vast majority being Tutsi, implying obviously that there were people who were not Tutsi.  You also testified, that afternoon that certain members of the initial coalition government prior to the president's death had been killed.  Now my question to you is this: how did the population in Rwanda react to the initial killings of highly placed and visible moderate Hutu politicians together with these ordinary Tutsi civilians; how did they react to this?
@A.
The members of those political parties whose leaders had been killed -- that is, the PSD and the wing of the MDR that was not associated with MDR Power -- the supporters of those parties saw this as basically a coup being engineered by the Hutu Power adherents with the cooperation of the military to take control of the political system, so that those people were very afraid.  They felt that they could be targeted because they had been opposed to the MRND and its other allies, and many of them went into hiding.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On page 17 of your report, you talk at length as to what was defined as "the enemy", and I don't intend to go into that only to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to pages 17 and 18 of the English version of your report.  My question to you is very simple: who, in your opinion, was perceived as the enemy in April 1994?
@A.
It was the position of authorities spread by them directly in speeches to the population and propagated also by the press that operated under their guidance.  It was their position that Tutsi by their very ethnicity were to be regarded as allied with the military combatants, RPF, and, therefore, as, quote, accomplices or part of the enemy.  This position which was put forward many times in propaganda over a period, really, of years, becomes particularly pronounced after April the 6th, when officials, administrative officials, government authorities, political leaders, referred to RPF supporters throughout the country as being necessarily linked to an equivalent with RPF combatants.
It's important to remember that as a result of the peace accords the RPF had become in a sense a legitimate political party.  It had been assigned positions in the transitional government to come and as a result civilians in Rwanda who had supported the RPF or had been sympathetic to its ideas, some of them in any case, now felt the confidence to come out publicly and to indicate that they were supporters of the RPF.  Those people were among the first targeted and described as enemies.  And over time the category grew to include anyone who was Tutsi, even those people who had never manifested any political interest or sought any political role, including women, the elderly and infants.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Until the first days of the massacres in Rwanda, Hutu and Tutsi refugees and civilians sought refuge together.  Do you know why that was?
@A.
As I explained, in those first days those Hutu who were opposed to the MRND, and sometimes just those Hutu who came from the southern part of the country, expected that they, too, could be targeted because they saw this as a coup attempt to -- or an attempt to take power by people from the north affiliated with the MRND and MDR Power.  I have spoken to many people who have explained to me exactly how afraid they were in those early days, even though they were Hutu.  And I have had witnesses tell me that, "Yes, we too fled with the Tutsi".  Then usually they indicated to me that it was on the 12th, that they understood the message, that for the first time they got the message that the Tutsi alone was the enemy.  And then they said, "We knew we were safe and then we went home".
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how the message was transmitted from the 12th of April?
@A.
Certainly, we know that the radio was used and we have assembled excerpts from the radio in which political authorities explain that the enemy is the Tutsi, the enemy is the person who wishes to restore the monarchy, and because of Rwandan history, because the Tutsi were -- the monarch was thought to be Tutsi, because the elite which ruled with the monarch was Tutsi, "those people who want to restore the monarchy" was simply another way of saying "the Tutsi".  And this was clearly stated on the radio, that these are the people who were the enemy.  There was a song that was sung in the streets: "There is one enemy and he is the Tutsi".  It was a theme which was repeated over and over.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know, Madam Witness, if the RPF had any military presence in the préfecture of Kibuye between April and June 1994?
@A.
To my knowledge, the RPF had no military presence in Kibuye préfecture during those months.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And if people referred to infiltrators whilst referring to activities in Kibuye commune, what, to your mind, would that refer to?
@A.
"Infiltrators" was a term which was used to describe many people.  In reference to Kigali city, it would have been a legitimate term to use in reference to several hundred RPF soldiers who entered the city illegally in violation of the Arusha Accords and who were, in fact, present in excess of the terms agreed to.  But that was not the ordinary sense of the term.  It was used throughout the country in areas where there was no RPF military presence and it was used to create the expectation, to create the fear that ordinary Tutsi civilians could be, in fact, infiltrators for the RPF.  It was a term much like "accomplices", meant to cover the wide range of Tutsi civilians who could be perceived as people sympathetic to or in support of RPF -- the RPF force.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know the date when the RPF came to Kibuye?
@THE WITNESS:
Probably not until the end of Operation Turquoise; although, if you are looking -- I'm not sure what the boundary line was to the east, the eastern part of Kibuye.  It's possible that there were RPF troops in the eastern part of Kibuye in early July, perhaps indeed the last days of June, but it depends on a closer knowledge of military events than I'm aware of.  The great thrust of military activity for the RPF was beginning in the north-eastern part of the country, and moving in a crescent-shape movement along the eastern frontier and then heading west across the country.  But Kibuye was pretty much preserved and then eventually was occupied by the French under Operation Turquoise.  So it is possible that there was some small advance of troops in late June but I'm not sure, but certainly not before then.

On page 21 of your expert report, the first paragraph, you state that from April 11th to the 1st of May, killers carried out the most devastating massacres of the genocide.  My question to you is: was there any official response to these killings; and, if so, what was it?
@A.
Well, there were several official responses to the killings.  How to express it in a concise and simple way?  The bottom line is that the killing went forward.  That's the most important point, that the killing went forward despite some official protestations that the government did not want killing to happen.  But it's protestations were shown to be insincere, to lack meaning, by the actions that the government took and by its actions.  Particularly beginning in mid-April, it's clear that the intention was to spread the killing, to expand the zones of slaughter and not to stop it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On the 11th of April 1994, representatives from various local authorities -- namely, préfets -- were summoned to a meeting in Kigali.  Do you know what the purpose of this meeting was?
@A.
The new government had just been installed, and I believe it was a first meeting to allow members of the government to establish contact with those people who would be administering the population at the préfectural level.  It was, of course, also a time when there was massive killing already in the capital and in certain outlying areas, so presumably to -- in addition to this objective was a government objective to become informed on the situation throughout the country and presumably to give some instruction on how to deal with it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And, in that regard, do you know whether the government issued any specific orders to the local administrators to stop the violation if, indeed, they had occurred in their areas of origin?
@A.
It is my understanding, based on two testimonies of people present at that meeting, that there was an exchange of information.  Préfets were asked to describe the situation in their préfectures.  There was some negative comment made upon two préfets in whose préfectures there had been little or no killing -- in other words, a message of disapproval for those -- and then no clear and specific orders given about halting the killings.  In a political culture like that of Rwanda where direction is very much given from the top down, the absence of an order to stop killing after multiple killings have just been described can be understood only as an unspoken order to continue the killings.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which two préfets do you refer to in your testimony, Madam Witness?
@A.
It was the préfet of Butare, and I believe it was the préfet of Kibungo.  It might have been Gitarama, but I think it was Kibungo.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your report you discuss at page 18 another meeting which took place a week after the 11th of April meeting.  This time this meeting was in Gitarama préfecture.  Do you know why the meeting was convened at Gitarama at this time?
@A.
Gitarama was, as I explained, an area where the MDR party dominated and, as we have seen, the MDR party was divided into the power wing and another wing.  The préfet of Gitarama was someone who was not of MDR Power and he had done his best to limit the killing in his préfecture.  A number of bourgmestres had agreed with him and as a result there had been relatively little killing in many parts of Gitarama.  On the 18th, he called a meeting of his bourgmestres at the préfecture centre to discuss further measures to try to ensure security and to stop the killing.  A member of the government -- and I believe it was the prime minister -- got wind of this planned meeting by the préfet and ordered the meeting moved from the préfecture to Murambi, a place some kilometres away, where the national government had taken refuge.  So, in other words, the préfet's meeting to try to stop the slaughter was taken over by the national authorities who actually moved it from the préfecture office to the place they were located, at Murambi, and then they used that occasion to make clear to the administrators of Gitarama that the killing of Tutsi was indeed the approved programme and that those administrators should begin carrying it out.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And what was the situation of the violence in Gitarama after this meeting?
@A.
The violence increased dramatically after this meeting.  The hard-line position taken at the government meeting by political leaders as well as government authorities was reinforced by a series of other measures, notably by the use of militia, particularly from Kigali city and Kigali-rural préfecture, who then came into Gitarama to raid those communes where there had been little killing.  And in these raids they attacked not just the Tutsi but those Hutu who had not participated in the killing.  At the same time, radio RTLM was used to ridicule and to threaten certain bourgmestres, such as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune for not being sufficiently strong in carrying out action against the, quote, unquote, accomplices.  So it was a pressure which was exerted both by direct, official discourse at this meeting, then reinforced by militia and reinforced by the media, and the effect was that killing in Gitarama increased enormously.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, how would you describe the situation in the two southern préfectures of Butare and Gikongoro at this time?  Were there killings in Butare as at the 12th of April?
@A.
Butare was the préfecture which resisted the killings longest and as of mid-April there had been relatively few people killed there.  Gikongoro was a more mixed situation because you had some MRND leaders who were strong -- for example, in Mubuga -- not in Mubuga, but in the subpréfecture around Mubuga and in other parts of Gikongoro who were, in fact, carrying out considerable killing but you had areas like Musabeya commune where there was still resistance.  So Butare was the clearest case at a préfectural level while Gikorongoro was more mixed, but some communes were still resisting.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did the central government react to such resistance; and, if so, how did they react?
@A.
The weekend of April 16th and 17th, was a turning point.  It was that weekend when it became clear to the government of Rwanda that there would be no new UN intervention and that, in fact, the UN peacekeeping troops would probably all be pulled out.  In fact, they were not.  Later in the week a small number -- a decision was made by the Security Council to leave a small number of them but, as of the end of the day, April 15th, which was a Friday, the sentiment at the Security Council was to pull out everyone.  That was known certainly to the Rwandan government in Rwanda because Rwanda had a representative sitting on the Security Council at that time.  It was a non-permanent member and, therefore, was privy to these discussions.  On the Saturday, after that Friday afternoon, the government decreed a change in military leadership removing General Gatsinzi as chief of staff and replacing him with someone who was known to be much more hard line in his attitude towards Tutsi and at the same time they removed the préfet of Butare and the préfet of Kibungo; that is to say, that same weekend.  The Monday morning after was the Monday morning when the national political authorities took over the Gitarama meeting from the préfet, and the day after that, the Tuesday, was the day when national political authorities descended to Butare and to Gikongoro to carry the same message that they had passed to the Gitarama administrators on Monday; namely, "You are all involved; there is no way that you abstain from this; it is time to get to work".
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Talking about the visit or the involvement with the Butare commune -- I'm sorry, the Butare préfecture, rather, are you aware of a government delegation to Butare; and, if so, when did that delegation visit?
@A.
After the préfet of Butare was removed and a new préfet was named, a very important delegation, including the president and the prime minister and a number of ministers, went to Butare to participate in the installation and power of the new préfet.  This was a remarkable display of force to arrive in Butare, people in such a numerous delegation, and one which had added importance because, of course, the president and the prime minister were from that same préfecture.
Rwanda is a very small country, one where political authority from the centre has always been very important and where that political authority is sometimes exercised by members of the national government going home to their places of origin to carry the particular message of the national government, and it was in that context that the arrival of this strong delegation, led by the two Butare political leaders, has to be seen.  The speeches given by the prime minister and the president -- the president's speech, in part, was broadcast on radio -- had enormous importance in setting the clear line that everyone had to choose sides, that you either had to be in favour of this government, and that meant in favour of its programme, a programme of genocide, or you were against it; it was not possible to remain in-between.  And that was a message which was decided upon apparently the weekend of the 15th, 16th, 17th April, and then was implemented beginning the following week and carried forward throughout the genocide.  There was no possibility of a middle ground.  You were either with the government or you were against it.  If you were against it, then you would expect to pay the consequences, and those consequences were symbolised in Butare by the public humiliation of the préfet -- the removed préfet who was publicly humiliated at the installation ceremonies of his successor.  He was then hunted down and eventually killed, as were all the members of his family.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know if such visits were made to other préfectures in Rwanda at this time, similar visits, rather?
@A.
There were, it is my understanding that ministers and other political and administrative authorities made regular visits to all parts of the country.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know if there were any visits to Gikongoro préfecture? 
@A.
Yes, there were visits to Gikongoro préfecture, one of which involved President Sindikubwabo, and there may have been others as well. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What about Kibuye préfecture, do you know if there were any visits to that préfecture by central government officials? 
@A.
Indeed, we know that there were several visits by ministers to Kibuye, and I suppose other officials as well, one of which we have the minutes of the meeting on May the 3rd, which was led by Prime Minister Kambanda and involved other government and political leaders. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And have you had a chance to look at the transcript of the said meeting? 
@A.
I have. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that the prime minister, Jean Kambanda spoke at the said meeting on the 3rd of May? 
@A.
That is correct. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  Mr. President, we have an objection against this document because we do not recognise its authenticity.  We also challenge the reliability of said document. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a K-document disclosed to you?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, it is the document which bears that code and is presented as minutes of the meeting held on the 3rd of May 1994 by the prime minister at Kibuye.  I have objections on this.  Do you wish me to wait until the Prosecutor asks for the document to be tendered as an exhibit or can I go ahead and challenge the document regarding its authenticity in particular?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be tendering this afterwards, Mr. Phillips?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we hear you immediately then?  And please go ahead. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, our objections are based on four arguments.  The first being that this document was disclosed to us two days ago and that the document which is under tab one, in green, which seems to be a photocopy of an original in Kinyarwanda, was disclosed to the Defence only a few minutes before this session.  That is already a violation of Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
Our second argument is that this document seems to have come from Préfet Kayishema, who, apparently alone, wrote the transcripts more than a month after the said meeting.  If we were to refer to the translation in English, we will come to realise that a cover letter is signed by Préfet Kayishema and it's dated 8th June 1994.  
We are unaware of the sources of Préfet Kayishema for the drafting of these minutes.  We do not know whether Mr. Kayishema used recordings of the meeting.  We do not know whether he was using his memory in order to draft these minutes.  Above all, we do not know whether Mr. Kayishema did not voluntarily or otherwise, modify the real words which were pronounced during the said meeting. 
We should not forget that Mr. Kayishema was sentenced for life by this Tribunal for the crime of genocide, and it is possible that he may have favourably, for his own interest, modified this document.  We therefore believe, to conclude with that argument, that only Préfet Kayishema can authentify (sic) this document, and that it would be useful to call him to the Bar in order that he authenticate this document.  
Our third argument is that we find some information to be suspect in this document.  If we were to refer to the English translation, in other words, tab 3, at page 24, we realise that this document is signed by a rapporteur who is named Joseph Bugingo.  
On the following page, we have a list of participants at the meeting, and we see that participant No. 11 is one Mr. Joseph Bugingo, whose address is Kibuye Prison.  We are wondering how a rapporteur of that meeting could at the same time be a prisoner at the Kibuye prison.  
We also note that the person at No. 26 is Mr. Augustin Karara, bourgmestre of Gitesi, who was also at Kibuye prison, that's his address, and we know that the bourgmestre of Gitesi, Mr. Karara, was imprisoned only much later.  We therefore believed that this document is suspect, and, therefore, arises the question of its authenticity.  
Our fourth and last argument is that, we know -- we are aware that in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Niyitegeka -- I don't know whether it was the document in this form, but that document was not admitted as an exhibit in that case.  
In the session of 20th June 2002, at 11:30, the Prosecutor stated that she could not guarantee neither the authenticity nor the fullness or completeness of the transcripts.  This is the case of the Prosecutor v. Niyitegeka.  The date of the transcript was 20th June 2002.  
Therefore, we raise objections regarding the authenticity of this document, and we advise -- we submit that it be not accepted as an exhibit, Mr. President,  Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Prosecution?  
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have certain procedural issues here.  The first is that the transcript of the May 3rd meeting has been known to almost everyone of this Tribunal for several years.  Certainly my learned friend has come across it more often than once, he was in the Kayishema case.  But, in any event, the matters he raises in relation to the authenticity of this document are not questions that I can answer, they come from my evidence unit.  As far as we are concerned, there is a photocopy there, and these were documents that were actually found on Mr. Kayishema's person when he was arrested, and I don't see what the prejudice is to my learned friend, quite honestly.  I know he has profound reason to be worried of its content, like he does in many of the other things, including matters that were actually said and spoken by his client.  But, I mean -- that's not my problem.  The document exists, there from the evidence unit, they're K'ed as you have rightly observed and we want to put it to this witness. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When was this document disclosed to the Defence in this case? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In this case, I think in the last hearing I said to Your Honour that I wasn't sure whether I had disclosed it to them beforehand and that was on Monday or so, the last time, so I did it again.  They then asked me for a French version, which I gave them, and the only thing we have added to it is the original version in Kinyarwanda.  So basically, we disclosed it two days ago, but I thought this was a document upon the records, sir.  I may have disclosed it for the first time two days ago, I can't honestly remember. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what happened in the Niyitegeka case, according to the transcript of the 20th of June?  Do you have anything to --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I was not in that matter.  I have no information as to the matter, and I don't think these transcripts relate to Niyitegeka in any way.  So, if they were not allowed in that case, then there is no bearing on this case.  I have read these transcripts and I don't see how they relate to Niyitegeka.  So I don't know what the factual basis for denying the transcripts was in Niyitegeka.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We know for the time being, we will also look at the decision which was taken on the 20th of June and we will come back to it.  But for the time being, we don't take a position on its admissibility, but you may ask questions.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Madam Witness, have you had a chance to peruse the portions of these transcripts that are attributed to the prime minister Jean Kambanda during this meeting?
@A.
Yes, I have.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, do you have any comments to make on the content of his alleged speech at this meeting? 
@A.
Yes, it was a speech like many others of the time, which can be read at different levels.  First of all, I find it interesting that he does refer to a document which is an authenticated document, a real document, and that is the instructions for restoring security dated April 27th.  That is a document that I collected myself and I am convinced with its authenticity, and he speaks about that document, which was a document that was attempting to organise the so-called security measures which were being imposed to control the movement of Tutsi and to track them down.  It's a speech which, on the one hand, talks about the need for peace and for the negotiations, but on the other hand, repeats a number of pernicious ideas, i.e. including that there are RPF soldiers throughout the country in every commune and that they are posing an imminent danger to the population.  
This is of greatest importance because, perhaps the strongest argument that the government authorities made to the civilian population was: "You are in danger, the RPF is going to exterminate you if you do not protect yourselves".  And it was this appeal to self-preservation which made, in the eyes of many people, made their behaviour legitimate, the idea that they were doing what they were doing, they were killing only to protect themselves.  It was a measure of self-defence, and, therefore, it's legitimate, and that is the basic thrust of the prime minister's remarks that this is something you must do to protect yourselves. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, also present at that meeting was the accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Have you had a chance to look at the portions of the transcripts of that meeting attributed to him? 
@A.
I have.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are there any particular comments that you would like to make in relation to the contents of his speech? 
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You would find those on page 12. 
@A.
Yes, in the English version at tab 3, on page13.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.
@A.
The argument that the RPF had always intended to resume the war, and that evidence is given of this in terms of documents that were said to have been found with its members that showed how this war was planned in 1993 and early 1994.  I think that is what this translation is meant to say, although it's awkwardly worded.  This is important because in developing the theme of self-defence, local authorities often would find "evidence", that is objects which had been deliberately planted with people in order to prove their allegations that these were RPF infiltrators and that there was an immediate danger to the population.  
So often you would have cases where a bourgmestre would, for example, come out of the home of someone who had been killed and hold up a piece of paper and say: "You see, here is the list, here is the list of RPF people in this community.  They have paid dues, you can see that this is written on this paper, and these are the people who must be killed".  
In other examples, you would have, for example, the discovery of arms which had already been planted -- which had previously been planted by the authorities, and so, soldiers would go -- and there was a case at Kibungo Cathedral, where they went and discovered arms in the bushes behind the Cathedral, arms they themselves had placed there in order to prove to the population that the danger was real.  So this kind of cinema  -- this kind of play-acting was something that was carried out on a systematic basis in many parts of the country.  We have reports of this from many different places.  So, I would draw your attention here to this reference to documents which were found supposedly and which proved the existence of plans for war.  
In the next paragraph, the assertion that the RPF never wanted any power sharing, but what it wanted was exclusive power for itself.  That was also a frequent allegation made.  
The paragraph after that, the RPF wanted the Rwandan government to remain paralysed from December '93 until the time it would seize power.  It was true that the government was paralysed during that time in part because of disagreements between Habyarimana and other members of the government.  But here, it is also attributed to an RPF plot, everything is seen in terms of an RPF plot, all of these events.  The allegation again that it was making preparations to take over the country.  
And then comes a very important paragraph saying, no Rwandan leader will ever again be negligent, will never be deceived again.  And if there had been no accomplices among Rwandan leaders, if there had been Interahamwe, Rwanda would not have fallen so low.  The official position was that there had been "accomplices" among those members of the government who had negotiated the Arusha Peace Accords, and it was because they were RPF accomplices, that they had signed away the kind of concessions that had been agreed to, and the point here is that if these people had been Interahamwe, a reference to the MRND militia group that was then engaged in killing Tutsi, if we had had people of that quality in our leadership, then there would have been -- Rwanda would never have been in the position it is in now.  
And then once again, coming back to this theme of the found documents -- the retrieved documents, it is no longer a secret as evidenced by retrieved documents that the RPF had soldiers in each commune, whose objective was to exterminate us one day.  Clearly, this is a false statement.  Clearly any responsible politician would have known it was a false statement.  It led the population to believe that ordinary civilians were to be identified as "soldiers", and, of course, it was legitimate to attack soldiers who were intending to kill you.  
On the radio there were a number of messages which said: "You must be aware of the RPF, they are found out throughout the country.  They are wearing civilian clothes, so that you must not believe that a civilian is necessarily a civilian."  In that context, this kind of message telling people that in each and every commune of this country there are RPF soldiers, that is a very dangerous message to communicate, and particularly when you then add to it that the objective of these people is to exterminate us.  That was a message that went back to 1992, even in 1991, for the first time, you guard MRND pamphlets circulating, saying the objective of the Tutsi is to exterminate the Hutu, to carry out a genocide of the Hutu.  Improbable as that seems, given a relative demographics of the country, this was the argument that was made, and here the speaker has taken off that theme and is presenting it to the audience, saying to them:  "You must remember that all around you there are these "soldiers" who mean to exterminate you".  
And then dropping down two paragraphs, the RPF has become too confident about its strength.  It has openly stated that it wants a ministry for Tutsis, that of justice.  The ministry of justice was at that time held by a member of the power branch of the Liberal Party, Agnés Ntamabyaliro who was from Kibuye.  So here he is saying the ministry that belongs to one of our Kibuye citizens is going to be taken over for the Tutsi, which is quite remarkable because according to the peace treaty, the RPF had the legitimate right to a number of ministry seats, but they were not seats for Tutsi, they were seats for members of the RPF political party.  
So, you see that the shift in speech -- the shift in discourse so that the RPF becomes the Tutsi.  The ethnic group is the important reference here not the political party.  And then the speaker called on PSD members to join others, again the Hutu power theme.  We must all join together in fighting for the country's security, even if many accomplices were from their party, it's a kind of apology.  You know, it is unfortunate that some PSD people were actually supporters of the peace treaty, were supporters of an alliance with the RPF.  Those people, of course, have since been killed.  But here, the sentiment expressed, you know, even if some of your party members had been on the wrong side, it's all right, we will go forward and continue to fight this fight.  
It happened also in other parties, some reassurance to the PSD members: "Don't be ashamed".  People in other parties also held those ideas which did not mean that this party should stop working.  There I would have to refer to the Kinyarwanda text to see if this is really a use of work in the sense of killing people.  I can't make that conclusion without looking at the text and thinking about it.  
But in any case, the speaker then calls upon PSD members to join the civil defence in big numbers.  Now, the civilians of defence movement was an effort organised by the national government to channel and control the killing of Tutsi which was threatening to spin out of control, and here he is asking members of his party to join in that effort.  
And the final paragraph, asking the people to point out any leader who might lead them astray.  In other words, asking for popular denunciation of any bourgmestre, cell leader, conseiller, who was not actively participating in the government programme, and this fits with an effort that was made throughout this period to remove those officials and authorities as the préfet of Butare had been removed; as the préfet of Kibungo was removed, as the préfet of Gitarama eventually, because they were not sufficiently active.  
So here is an open door to popular denunciation of authorities who were not actively involved, because it's now clear which side each supported, and you will be able to see clearly if your bourgmestre, conseiller is on the right side or not, and if he is on the wrong side, then you should denounce him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At page 25 of your expert report, you describe both these meetings of 3rd May and the meeting in Butare under the heading of "Pacification".  Now, why would you describe these two meetings as in that context, why the word pacification? 
@A.
That was the term that was used by the authorities themselves to describe their efforts.  And it's important to come to terms with the word and to understand its meaning, because on the surface, one would say a government engaged in pacification should be congratulated, but that was not the case here.  
As you will see by examining these speeches and not purely the one I have just referred to, but if you look back at the speech of Mr. Murego, which is very interesting, the MDR person, on page 11, you will see that he says very clearly:  "The enemy is the RPF and its accomplices, not all Tutsis are accomplices".  So you have a message which is ambiguous, which is a double message, and throughout the whole pacification effort, it is a double message but often it is the militia leaders engaged in the worst killing, who are the ones in charge of pacification, which gives you a sense of what the term meant.  It was a policy adopted by the government for several reasons: One, because they needed to try to convince the international community that what they were doing was not a genocide.  For another in some places, it was clearly used to lure Tutsi out of hiding, to say to them, the killing is finished, it is safe to come back and then they were killed.  
And then, in other cases, it needs to be understood in the complex dynamics among Hutu themselves because what happened eventually was that the killers began killing each other.  And pacification was meant to make clear who the target was and to say to people, you may not kill for jealousy or greed or personal motives; you must kill only for the right reasons and the right people.  
So pacification was meant also to persuade, particularly those young men who had now been given guns and grenades, that they were not to use them on other Hutu who happened to be members of other political parties or people with whom they had quarrels or people they just intended to rob.  So it was an attempt to take control of the violence and to channel it and to make sure it reached its object. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now at some stage during the genocide, Madam Witness, were there Tutsis married to Hutus who were saved?  Now, do you know, first of all, why that was the case?  Why were Tutsis married to Hutu men -- Tutsi women married to Hutu men not killed in the early part of April, and did that policy change at some stage, and, if so, why? 
@A.
There are many Tutsi who survived because Hutu protected them.  In some cases, husbands protected their wives.  In this particular instance, there is another aspect to the situation, and that is that women have been received -- that men have received their wives in return for payment to the bride's family.  They have paid in a sense for the productive and reproductive services of that wife.  If Hutu men are permitted to kill the Tutsi wives of other Hutu men, those men -- those other Hutu men, are deprived of their investment and will feel justly aggrieved.  What have they done to lose this wife in whom they have invested?  So it was in order to avoid conflict among Hutu, that in many places there was an actual instruction given that Tutsi wives were not to be touched.  That policy changed eventually, although we have no official declaration of it, but if you look at the facts from mid-May on, there is an increase in attacks on women and children; also on people who had been generally protected by communities, nurses, teachers, others who rendered service to the community had often been protected.  But from mid-May on, there was -- it appears a change in policy and the directive to kill was to kill all Tutsi regardless of age or gender.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour often takes a break at about 4:30 or slightly before.  I have ten minutes left of my examination.  Would you like to adjourn now?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It would be fine if you could complete, please.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why that change in the middle of May?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know, Your Honour.  The genocide is an enormously complex phenomenon with many dynamic turns and twists, and what motivated this particular one, I am not absolutely sure, but there are two possibilities; one is that there was -- the RPF was advancing very successfully on many fronts and there may have been a fear.  There was a fear that the war could be lost, and if it were lost, that those people responsible for the killing could be brought to justice, and women who were left could testify against them.  And we see, for example, that on the radio, at about this time, there were some very strong statements about "you need have no fear, all you must do is win this war and then there will be not all of this talk of international justice of commissions and tribunals.  All of that will fade away if only you win".  So there may have been a fear that, in fact, they were losing and that these women could be witnesses.  
The second consideration is that it was in mid-May that the French were originally -- were first talking seriously about an intervention that eventually becomes operation turquoise -- it doesn't actually arrive in Rwanda until the third week in June, but it was already being discussed and known to Rwandan authorities at that time, and perhaps the fear that outside observers could also come across witnesses who would then convince the French to change their policy and could make known to the world what was happening, perhaps that was part of it.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  Finally, Madam Witness, if we go to the area of your testimony described on page 26 as governmental control, certainly the events and the massacres that took place on 11th April to 1st May 1994, happened while the government was either in Kigali or Gitarama, and you say here that the government continued to function.  When I look at page 3 of your report and contrast what you say in relation to the attacks in 1990 at Kibilira commune, I wondered if you'd have any comments on the reaction of the government in 1994 to attacks and the reaction of the government as you outlined on page 3, in 1990? 
@A.
At the time of the Kibilira massacre in 1990, the authorities waited three days to intervene during which time some 300 people were killed.  When the authorities finally did decide to intervene, it took only the arrival of the national police and their blowing of a whistle to stop the killing.  
Now in 1994, the situation was considerably more complex.  The number of actors was multiplied enormously in scale.  The wartime situation was far worse; people were suffering from real hunger and dire poverty, so that the economic impetus for involvement was greater than it would have been for the people at Kibilira in 1990.  But it is important, I think, to underline that the killing after April 1994, like the killing in Kibilira in 1990, was not spontaneous.  In most cases, it was organised and directed, and there is no better proof of that than the information that I have presented already today about how the killing in the centre and south of the country had to be sparked by government action, by pressure from the radio, by the movement of militias into areas that had previously been peaceful.  Had the government pressure not been there, had the directives not come from government officials that you must join, you cannot stay silent, you cannot be inactive; had those messages not been given, it is highly unlikely that we would have witnessed anything like this genocide.  So the role of the authorities, the legitimisation that they gave was of enormous importance. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In that regard, Madam Witness, what was the significance of setting up roadblocks outside bars in commercial centres in 1994? 
@A.
Many roadblocks were located outside of bars or restaurants and little drinking places, places where beer was brewed, for the simple reason that that gave the people at the barrier easy access to drink.  In a somewhat grizzly analogy, you might think of the phenomenon of businesses that support a football team and give their sponsorship to a football team.  In some cases there were businessmen or bar owners who gave their sponsorship to a barrier, then the barrier would be set up outside of their bar and they would provide the people at the barrier with drink and with food.  That was their contribution to the cause.  This meant that people at the barrier, many of them were drunk or in some cases high on drugs. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When we look at page 4 of the interview of Mr. Ndindabahizi under tab 4, he describes one of his duties at the time in 1994, as ensuring the payment of salaries to civil servants.  Did this have any significance, Madam Witness, and, if so, what was it? 
@A.
A government that doesn't pay its civil servants risks losing its legitimacy quickly.  The concern to pay people at all levels and to pay them regularly was an important one, we can see it reflected in the speech of Prime Minister Kambanda in Butare in mid-May, when he made a great deal about a promise to give some form of compensation to the lowest level of administrative cadres, political leaders who had not been paid.  
It is clear that if the government intended to ensure the execution of its orders among its administrative cadres, it would have a far better chance of doing so if those people were paid and thought that they were representing a functioning, legitimate government. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Madam Witness, on page 5 of your report, you outline the administrative structure in Rwanda as it existed in 1994.  In your submission on page 5, you indicate that although the bourgmestre ranked below the préfet or souspréfet, he exercised more immediate and persuasive power over ordinary people than did his superiors.  Now, can you explain how that happened and what the significance of that was in 1994, in relation to the killings? 
@A.
The bourgmestre was the authority whom ordinary Rwandans saw most often, that is the authority of importance.  They saw other authorities more frequently, for example, conseillers.  But the bourgmestre was the nearest really important person to ordinary Rwandans.  He had the power to mediate disputes, to settle all kinds of conflicts.  He had the power to lock them up in the lockup, in the cachot, to impose fines and he also had control of the distribution of land, and for an agricultural population, there is nothing more important than access to land.  
In theory the property -- the land of the nation belongs to the government, and it was the bourgmestre who had the right of distribution.  
During the genocide the bourgmestre  was the senior local authority who was the most important one in mobilising the population, giving directions, punishing those or authorising the punishment of those who did not obey directions, and rewarding those who did.  It's remarkable how soon after the first violence we have proof of attempts to control the distribution of the property of the people killed.  Within days committees were set up to supervise the various forms of property and to organise the distribution of land, in particular, to those who have participated.  So the bourgmestre as the senior local authority in charge of all of this, and as the person who was the bridge, the liaison from the population to political party structures, to administrative structures, and eventually even to military structures, it was the bourgmestre who channelled all of those orders to the population and ensured that people obeyed them.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, you have the floor. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  First of all, a clarification for the Tribunal.  I mentioned a session which took place in the Niyitegeka case on the 12th -- on the 20th of June 2002.  I think there was mention of transcripts from audio cassettes of the meeting of the 3rd of May, so maybe it's not quite the same thing.  So, since these audio cassettes do exist and that they appeared in the Niyitegeka case, why not listen to them so that we can determine the authenticity of words attributed to Mr. Ndindabahizi?  If the Prosecutor does not take that initiative, the Defence will do so, and I wish to bring this to the attention of the Bench.  
As for my cross-examination, Mr. President, Your Honours --
@MR. PRESIDENT:

Thank you, Mr. President. 
As for my cross-examination of Dr. Alison Des Forges, I wish to say that her testimony does not directly concern Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  We have gone through history; we have done sociology and politics, and now we need to go into law.  
When I was contacted for this case, I received an indictment which was dated 7th July 2001 in which my client was accused for conspiracy to commit genocide, and the individual responsibility of the Accused was taken into consideration under Article 6(3); in other words, command responsibility.  In the two indictments, paragraphs 20 to 23 concern exclusively the meeting of 3rd May in Kibuye.  And this is very different from the current situation, Your Honours. 
In the indictment in its last amended version, there is nothing said about the Accused as a member of the government.   The meeting of the 3rd May disappears from the indictment; it is no longer included in the indictment which was amended pursuant to your decision of 3rd June 2003. 
As for the activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as minister, we find traces of that at page 1 of the indictment; in other words, the general presentation of the Accused person, but in no paragraph whatsoever of the indictment do we find anything whatsoever concerning the activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi within the government or, of course, his participation or attendance of the meeting of the 3rd of May.  Consequently, the Defence believes that Miss Alison Des Forges's report can be considered as a piece of information, but the Defence would consider it superfluous in this case, given the allegations against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  That is why, Mr. President, Your Honours, that I have only one question for Dr. Alison Des Forges, and the question is as follows.
$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER: 
@MR. BESNIER:
Good afternoon, Madam Expert.  I think you have written this important document, that Let None Be Left to Tell the Story (sic).  I think this document -- this is a very document -- an important book which has more than 900 pages, and I would like to know in how many instances do you refer to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in that book. 
@A.
Without referring to the book, I could not be absolutely sure because, in fact, the index unfortunately is not reliable.  So, there is no quick and easy way to ascertain whether there is any mention anywhere of Mr. Ndindabahizi, but I can certainly say that if he is mentioned, it is only in a relatively minor role and perhaps, for example, in a list of members of the government. 
This is not surprising, given that the focus of the book was predominantly Butare préfecture and, after that, activities of the national government, and only occasionally drew information from Gikongoro or Kibuye for comparative purposes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I have no further questions for this witness, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any knowledge about this document from the 3rd of May; in other words, its origins, where it comes from?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, I have some knowledge of this document.  I had previously seen the attached list of persons who attended the meeting; that is, not the minutes themselves but the attached list of names of persons who attended.  This was in conjunction with a deportation proceeding in the United States where I served as an expert witness and where that list was used to establish that the person in question had attended that particular meeting.  I do not recall having seen these -- the minutes themselves before they were shown to me by the Prosecutor perhaps a month ago. 
I, of course, knew about the meeting.  It had been described to me by a number of witnesses.  And I have since looked at some other documents that I know to be authentic from Kibuye.  I know them to be authentic because they were gathered by my colleagues from the local offices.  
And I note certain surface similarities, in any case, that would lead me to conclude that this is in its presentation certainly an authentic document.  There is a similarity in the signatures -- although this is obviously a very poor sample -- and in the seal, but more interesting perhaps are the serial numbers, the identification numbers in the upper right-hand corner of the documents.  
In the exhibit presented to the Court today, it appears to me to be No. 325, perhaps -- although that may have been corrected -- /04.09.01.  And I have previous documents from a month earlier that bear the same classification number at the end but at the start have the classification number 0280.  So that would mean if this were 0325, in approximately a month's time, that would be perhaps a reasonable number of letters to have been sent on the subject of security.  This is the category that has to do with security, I believe.  
In addition to that, I would say the procedure as I am familiar with it would have been for someone to take the notes at the meeting, and that was apparently Mr. Bugingo, and then to write them up.  We have no indication of when he wrote them up.  He might have written them up the same day.  What we have is the date on the letter when the notes were forwarded from the prefect to the prime minister, which was obviously approximately a month later, but that does not establish the notes were made a month later. 
My other comment would be based simply on a reading of the text, that the use of words, the kinds of themes, to me, fit well with other similar speeches given in similar circumstances.  And in this regard, if you recall, I mentioned -- I pointed out to you the phrase in Mr. Murego's speech where he said, "Not all Tutsi are accomplices."  
Had the document been completely fake and an attempt to establish a totally biased document, a phrase like that would not be found.  It's too contradictory to the sense.  It's in reality that we find contradictions.  Things which are false are often too simple.  So, that would lead me to believe it to be authentic, as well as the identification numbers, the signature, the presentation of the document.  But, of course, I cannot attest to the accuracy of the notes taken, whether the note taker actually paid attention and did a good job.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Mr. Joseph Bugingo?  Have you heard that name before?
@THE WITNESS:
I am not familiar with that name, no.  I would suppose that he would have been a préfectural employee because that would be the kind of person who would ordinarily take notes at such a meeting. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
On the front page of the Kinyarwanda version, that's tab 1, which is the letter apparently from 
Dr. Kayishema, that's where we find the reference you just referred to.  And the date is the 8th of June '94, as you said, about a month after the meeting. 
Now, the method is number and then possibly "325" or "B25" written by hand.  Now, this mixture between handwriting and typewritten versions in that part of the document, would that coincide with what you have seen in other documents from Kibuye, or is it different? 
@THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, it is exactly the same.  If you would like to take a look at this other document which I simply happen to have on my desk, it's very similar in appearance.  It's also -- I don't know if it has a K-number or not, but it is a document from the Office of the Prosecutor in any case.  But you'll see that the format is very much the same; it's the same mixture of handwritten and typewritten.  It is not produced by the same typewriter, however.  That is different. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And why did you say you knew this list?  Is that the list in the Kinyarwanda version from K-number 0248675, starting with the word "umugereka" (phonetic)? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So why did you say that list was familiar to you?  Is that the list from No. 11 -- or 001 to 188?
@THE WITNESS:
The list is familiar to me because it was shown to me by an officer of the court in the United States in February of 2003 in connection with a deportation proceeding of a person from Kibuye, and it was shown to me to establish his -- that this person had, in fact, attended this meeting. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, now you are confirming that this is indeed the same list with 188 names but you did not see the remainder of the document, if it is the same document.  You only saw the umugureka list.
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me stress that this was only a way to see whether we could get some more clarity about these two documents that are in dispute.  I don't think I will ask you anything about the other document in dispute.  And no decision, of course, has been taken as to whether there is any kind of relevance by this document.  Whether it's relevant is quite a different matter and I have certainly noted, together with the two other Judges, your statement, Defence Counsel, that as the indictment stands now, according to you, it is of limited relevance.  But that remains to be seen and that's for the merits. 
Your testimony has come to an end, unless there is a question in re-direct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, no.  You've asked the question that we would have posed to the witness.  
Just to draw Your Honours' attention to a matter raised by the Defence in relation to the annotation on the English version of this list.  The issue raised by the Defence which forms, to my mind, the basis of his challenge of the authenticity of this document is as follows: if you look at the list of participants in the English version, which is in tab 3, at the end of tab 3, you would see that against the names of Joseph Bugingo, listed on No. 11, and Augustin Karara, which is listed on No. 26, there is a notation on there that that -- or those persons, apart from being in Kibuye préfecture, are also in Kibuye prison, and the argument runs thus, that, well, if this document was prepared in 1994, those guys were not in prison then, why is it indicated thereon that they are in Kibuye prison?  Well, that's true and it's a legitimate point to make. 
What I would then do is to draw Your Honours' attention to the original document in Kinyarwanda which is under tab 1, and then if you cross-reference and look at the list, the original list, all these are translations, English-French.  If you look at the original list under tab 1, at the end of it, and you look against No. 11 and No. 26, Karara, Augustin and Bugingo, there is no indication on there that they're in Kibuye prison.  The reason is obvious: the English translation must have been translated at a later stage beyond -- well beyond 1994.  Whoever did it probably knew that those two people were in custody and made the notation.  The operative document is the one in Kinyarwanda.  
I don't speak Kinyarwanda but it's pretty obvious from the level on 26 that there's no notation on there of Kibuye prison; therefore, it defeats the argument.  The operative document is in Kinyarwanda, not in English, and I just wanted to bring that to Your Honours' attention.
@JUDGE KHAN:
What is "prison" in Kinyarwanda?
@THE WITNESS:
Gereza.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I was told earlier, Your Honour, and I have it on good authority it is not there.
@THE WITNESS:
I can also say it is not there.  But it does -- looking at Kinyarwanda, does give us the answer to 
Judge Møse's question about who was Joseph Bugingo, and he is indeed identified in the Kinyarwanda as a worker, a préfectural employee in Kibuye, which does not appear in the English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, he was actually one of Mr. Kayishema's employees; that's what transpires from the Kinyarwanda version.
@THE WITNESS:
I would say so, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Anything else to be added, please? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very briefly, Mr. President, and I thank my colleague for pointing this out.  But the point is, I will have to proceed on the way of the truth.  The basis of my objection is not this; this is just a detail.  Obviously, we have a problem of the authenticity of this document.  
There is the issue of reliability and relevance of the document.  If the Préfet Kayishema drafted this document after the fact, my question is: based on what source does he draft this document?  And I continue to believe that the cassettes would shed light on the relevance and reliability of these documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are certainly free to pursue that road if you so wish. 
Your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you for coming the long way to Arusha and testifying, and we wish you a very safe journey home. 
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could kindly assist the expert witness out, accompany her out, Registry.  Then we have a few housekeeping matters. 
$Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, turning now to the interviews which are also, I understand, a possible matter of dispute.  Now, on the one hand, I see that there are K-numbers both in the English and French versions in this document, but it doesn't really transpire except from -- for instance, to use the English version, after the blue separator, after this blue paper, this blue stuff here, you find K0217398 and, there, there is a reference I see to a date: "Today, the 30th of November 1996, I interviewed Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi", but there is -- usually, when there are interviews previously, Mr. Phillips, then we have a cover page, something explaining who were the investigators; there may be an introduction about the witness being informed about his rights, all that kind of stuff we usually find.  We don't find it here.  Is this an excerpt?  Where are we here? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The explanation is very simple, Your Honour.  In 1996 Mr. Ndindabahizi was in the Republic of Kenya, in exile.  Our investigators knew he was there.  He was not at that time a suspect, and he was cooperating with the office of the investigator in relation to other persons who were subsequently arrested in that country.   That is the basis from which he was often contacted by investigators, and these were notes of those meetings that were held with him at various periods between 1996 and 1997.
After some time the subject matter left Kenya and went to Belgium.  In between, investigations had revealed that the Office of the Prosecutor might be interested in indicting him, but that was several years afterwards.  At the time they were talking to him on these matters, he was not on our suspect list, and these were exploratory meetings with Mr. Ndindabahizi.  It was not even proposed that he would be a witness in any particular case; rather, they were just asking him, "What are you all about and what's your story?"  They were clearly exploratory.  
The statements and the interviews are not disputed, at least as far as my learned friend and I are concerned.  We have talked about this on several occasions before today.  It is not in dispute.  
Whether or not he has issues with the procedure, the legalities of it and the procedure under Rule 42, that's a separate matter but, in essence, the Defence don't dispute that Mr. Ndindabahizi was in regular contact with my office in the early days after the genocide whilst he was exiled in Kenya.  That is not in dispute.  
So, to answer Your Honour's question, these are the circumstances that form the background to all the notes contained in these interviews.  He was helping my office with investigations concerning several other people that are mentioned there, and if you actually read the first interview, you will see it talks about everybody else, apart from Mr. Ndindabahizi, because that was the context in which it was obtained.  
The first one talked about him because they wanted to explore and find out the extent of his possible culpability in genocide, so they asked him all these general questions about what he was doing, and then went back and started working with him in relation to the finances of the interim government and other people who might have been involved in the transaction of arms and other matters.  And that's how this -- that's the long and short of how these interviews have arisen.  
They then were stored into our database, our evidential database, brought to our knowledge, promptly disclosed to the Defence in all the languages.  There was no issue raised.  
I met with my learned friend in Paris over this, no objections, and the authenticity of the document is not in dispute.  I see Your Honour's point that it is not signed, it doesn't have the -- but they were not generated in the context of -- in that context; they were just statements of, you know,
Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to confirm this, Defence, that the substance of these -- I understand, actually, that there are only two interviews in these folders: one rather voluminous, one typewritten; and one more limited which seems to be an excerpt because there are three dots at the beginning.  
Now, is it true that there is no dispute concerning these two documents?  The point is taken about Rule 42, of course. 
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, the issue is not the authenticity of this document.  The issue is to determine if the rights of the Accused were violated, if any of the investigators had the possibility of interviewing the Accused at the time he was a suspect.  I think this interview or discussion was such that they do not -- such that it is not possible to enter these documents into evidence.  
The issue was to know whether Mr. Ndindabahizi was a suspect at the time he was interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal.  At the time, indeed, he was a suspect because the list of witnesses as was presented for confirmation by the Prosecution, Witness No. 1 testified 19th August 1996 against Mr. Ndindabahizi and Witness 25 testified against Mr. Ndindabahizi 10th November 1994. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"1994", says counsel. 
@MR. BESNIER:
So, obviously, he was a suspect.  
The second thing is to know the content of what Mr. Ndindabahizi -- is it accusations against other accused or is it some biographical material.  Defence thinks that it is the biographical material against the Accused and we believe these documents have been tainted by the violation of Rule 42 against Mr. Ndindabahizi.  It has to do with the protection of the rights of the Accused, protection of the rights of the suspect. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, often when -- it's often usual to see matters in context.  And I just want to clarify whether behind this procedural discussion, this question of the rights under Rule 42, whether there is something else; in other words, whether there is a dispute as to whether these two documents are authentic -- I understand that they may well be so - and, secondly, whether there is a dispute as to the substance of the document, and it would be useful for the Bench to know that even if that's not the key issue here because otherwise the whole question about the procedural rights becomes a little bit abstract. 
@MR. BESNIER:
The answer to your two questions is no, I'm not challenging the substance of these two documents.  But the protection of the rights of a suspect is not only an abstract issue, it's a question of law and a question of justice.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And there I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly, but it was a little bit difficult to see what this procedural issue was about without knowing whether this was linked to some other matters; namely, the two issues I raised now.  But now the situation is clarified.  That was helpful.  Thank you very much.  
Then we will come back to these two documents later on, after having looked at them and possibly having received anything from the Defence in the same context. 
Then you made an application, Mr. Phillips, on Monday that we should review a decision we made concerning the admissibility of a witness statement of a witness, and the question was raised in connection with P20.  The Judges have deliberated and we have looked carefully at your arguments, but our inclination is that we will not review or decision and we stick to that one, even after having considered your arguments under Rule 92bis.  
So, what you therefore have to do is possibly, if you really think that element is necessary to your case, then you must envisage to call that witness -- I think it was CGD, or whoever -- who had that reference to the father where someone may have hidden, but whether you will wish to call the witness for that purpose is, of course, another matter.  So, that's the decision of the Chamber. 
Could we now, then, finally hear anything about the witnesses?  I assume that even if they were planned to come on Friday, you may, in spite of that, have some indications and more recent information, or is that not the case? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Regrettably not, Your Honour.  We have no indication in relation to the detained witness, which is 
No. 11 on your list -- who is No. 11 on your list, and the witness No. 14, the one with the mistaken 
identity -- the mistaken identity case -- will come on Friday and hopefully -- hopefully, witness No. 11 on your list would come on Friday as well and in that case we'll be able to wrap our case up by Monday.  But I was actually hoping they could have brought them today or tomorrow, but it's not possible.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, all right.  Now, there will be a need for a pre-Defence conference.  We will need a status conference then early next week in order to plan the next stage of this trial.  Do you have any information to provide as to the timing of that conference, for instance, and substance matters that you would wish to raise? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I'm at the disposal of the Court to hold a pre-Defence conference.  We've already worked in collaboration with the witness protection section, as we committed ourselves; we are ready to call our witnesses within a period of three weeks beginning from the end of the -- the end of the Prosecution's case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good, and then we can discuss the exact timing and the number of witnesses and other related matters, shall we say, on Tuesday?  Would Tuesday be good if we finish the witnesses?  Because now if only one witness would arrive on Monday, then we will actually have spare time on Monday so then we could all be ready for the pre-Defence conference on Monday.  Would that be all right? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you very much.  Then we meet again on Monday at 2 o'clock.  Thank you.  
Court is adjourned.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.  So, which witnesses are we to hear today, Mr. Phillips?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  We propose to call first, Witness CGP -- Charlie, Golf, Papa -- who is now known by the name on the witness statement which is on your desk. That document, Your Honour, is in French.  We only received it today -- at least over the weekend.  I only got it today, and it is a statement that confirms the circumstances that form the background to the mistaken identity of this witness and the person listed on No. 14.  Essentially, it is the witness confirming that the interview did occur as indicated on the 4th of April, and that the signature on the witness statement contained on pages 152 and 158 relate to him, Your Honour.  I don't know what my learned friend's position is -- latest position is in relation to this witness, but in anticipation of any issues that you might have, we have the investigators that took the original statement here in Arusha.  We brought them in over the weekend so that you can hear directly from them the circumstances that led to this mix-up, and to also afford my learned friend of the Defence opportunity to put questions to them prior to hearing the witness himself.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, these investigators that are not on the witness list, are they Mr. Amahumisiliza and Ms. Julia Watson?
@MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that is correct.  Both of them are present, but only one of them needs to give evidence, and that may be Julie Watson.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you are offering Julie Watson?
@MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
I am offering both of them, Your Honours, but either of them can give evidence.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, all right.  So there are two issues, one starting with CGP and the other one whether we want to hear the investigators.
Defence, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Defence cannot absolutely work under such conditions, and Defence would like to oppose the calling of Witness CGP.
We base this on two arguments.  First of all, the combined provisions of Rule 20 -- Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure obligate the Prosecutor to disclose the name of the witness at the very least 21 days before the beginning of the case.  In respect of CGP, this has not been done, and his identity was disclosed only on the 26th September 2003.  However, the name and address of the witness are an extremely important element.  Indeed, Defence could have interrogated -- examined, cross-examined the witnesses of Prosecution who have already appeared on the possible presence of CGP at the sites in Gitwa.
Until now Defence has tried to assess the credibility of witnesses by cross-examining them on the presence of other witnesses and sometimes by even giving their names on a piece of paper, so that Defence could have verified if the witness has not already testified in judicial proceedings in Rwanda, or more generally, on any relevant investigations on the file.
Defence is therefore of the opinion that this would prejudice its case pursuant to Rule 66, and also that this runs counter to Rule 85(B) and 90(G) of the Rules of Procedure if this witness was allowed to testify.
Secondly, the Defence is of the view that the Court should examine this issue in relation to Rule 95 of the Rules.  Indeed, the context in which this witness is being called appears a bit strange to us.
In October 2001 Defence received 26 statements -- redacted statements and under No. 13 there were two statements for Witness CGP dated 4th April 2001 and 2nd June 2001.
Registry, can you please hand on this document to the Court and the Prosecution.  The first of these statements appear in the bundle of documents disclosed by the Prosecutor, and this is the second statement.  The similarities between these statements are extremely worrying.  First of all, in both cases the witness refers to events that occurred at Gitwa in Gitesi commune.  Secondly, in both cases, it is claimed the Accused was distributing machetes.  Thirdly, in both cases, the witness points out that the presence of a certain bourgmestre who has already been mentioned, and the préfecture Kayishema.  Fourthly, the witness leaves Gitwa to go to Bisesero.
In conclusion, it is impossible to say that there are two separate witnesses or one and the same witness.  Finally, which one did the investigators investigate?  And it is surprising that the error of identity persisted until last week when the witness was transferred to Arusha.  All this discredits the testimony such that if they are admitted they will go -- they will run counter to the integrity of the Court.
Defence therefore concludes that Witness CGP should not be allowed to testify.  Thank you,
Mr. President.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I hear what my learned friend for the Defence has said.  But a lot of issues that he raised, unfortunately I am unable to answer to because I did not take the statements, but in terms of the legal issues that are raised, to my mind there are two issues here, and the main issue is, what prejudice, if any, have the Defence suffered by this unfortunate mix-up.
Now, one matter is the question of notice.  Have they received adequate notice of the allegations being made by this witness?  That has to be answered in the affirmative.  Clearly in the pre-trial brief, the disclosure does contain the evidence of the witness, and that has not changed in any manner or form.
What is in issue here is the identity of the witness, and, of course, they do have legitimate rights.  And the Accused has a legitimate right under Rule 20, to know who his accusers are.  The issue is, have they suffered any prejudice at this stage, not knowing before Friday for sure, what the name of this witness was?  They certainly have a right under Rule 66, which we certainly concede, and we did make disclosure to them well in advance under the requirements of that Rule.  There was no deliberate attempt to hide the identity of the witness.  It was an honest mistake, and the investigators are here to explain it.  Now, if they have suffered any prejudice, then the Chamber is at liberty at any stage to recall the witness if indeed any sort of allegations arise following his testimony here to put those allegations to him.
I did point out when this issue arose that I personally am very embarrassed at the developments, but this is the situation and I would offer the investigators who took the statement to address the Trial Chamber so that you can make your own assessment of whether or not this was a genuine mistake or a deliberate one on the part of the Prosecutor.  Those are my submissions.
And then in relation to the statements that have been handed out, there are two separate -- it's not correct for me to say there are two separate people with the same identity, it is just one person, and it is this witness with the statement dated 2nd June 2001 that is responsible for the mix-up in the first place, and you will hear it more directly from the investigators.  It was the witness with the statement dated June 2001 that the investigators went to interview in the first place.  However, they interviewed somebody else because he was not available, but they had anticipated meeting him and had entered the name prior to the commencement of the interview on their computer, and they will testify as to how that happened.
So, to answer my learned friend's question, it is not the same person; there is only one person by that name.  He is the person whose statement is dated the 2nd of June 2001.  We were not interested in calling that person.  However, it was in attempt to locate the person dated -- the person with the statement dated 2nd of June that the mix-up arose in the first place.  And that is the explanation.  There are not two people, just one person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, do you have -- we have now received this document which was given to us from the Defence, CGP2, and here we have, of course, the redacted version.  We have page 3 and 4, but we do not have page 1 and 2 containing the particulars of the witness, when it comes to that witness that gave a statement on the 2nd of June 2001.  Now, that is normal, because this is the redacted version, but, do you have the unredacted version, so that the Court, in order to see the full picture, could see page 1 and 2 of this document of the 2nd of June 2001, please?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@CGP2 is exactly the same as this one in French.  It is the English -- what they have simply done is that they have given you the statement in French, and the one that has the cover, CPG2, is the English version of the French.  It is an English redacted version of the one you have in French, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  Now, do you have the English version of this document CGP2?  Can we have that one, please, then we have both the English and the French version.  We have the French version, but that one is dated the 23rd of September 2003.  But there is probably in the file also, the document with the identification of the witness dated the 2nd of June.
@MR ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I am just handing that to you, it is in English.  It is coming to you, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
Defence, have you seen this unredacted version?
@MR. BESNIER:
All I have is the version that I handed in a while ago.  I don't know if this is another version.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the Defence work in French, and there would be no reason to give them the English version because we didn't call the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is quite understandable, what you are saying, but now since this is an issue, do you have the French version of the 2nd of June witness statement, identification of witness, do you have that in your file as well?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the French version which is the one that has been handed to you by the Defence.  We have all the statements in our files.  If you look at the statement 2nd of June that the Defence handed to you, it is the French version of the one I have just handed to you now.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but in that French version which we were not handed, we were just handed by the French --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In that version there is not page 1 and 2 containing the particulars.  Maybe you have it, but the Bench was only given -- we haven't seen that.
Mr. Besnier, you now just gave us, didn't you, Témoin CGP -- and that starts with page 3.  That is what you have just handed to the Bench?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, in English.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and now my question to you is:  Do you in English or French have page 1 and 2 of that document, in other words, the unredacted version of this document of the 2nd of June 2001?  Do you have that?
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, I received this document in October 2001, and I received only a redacted version, and only the English version of that document.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now, what I could imagine could be useful, would be that we all had page 1 and 2 of this other document of the 2nd of June 2001, before we proceed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is -- this is -- that is the one I just handed to you, Your Honour, and I am handing another one to you in French.  I thought we all had it because I thought it came from my learned friend for the Defence, anyway.  I thought he handed two documents to us.  This one and a French statement.  I certainly got two documents from him just now; no?  My mistake.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What we can see from this 2nd of June statement is that on that statement we have the name which is listed as No.14 in our binder.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
While as you explain it, that is a wrong name.  The right name should be the name on the -- 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On the 23rd of September statement.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And, in fact, both the statement of the 4th of April 2001 and the statement of 2nd June 2001 contain then the wrong name?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No. The statement of the 2nd of June 2001 belong -- contains the right name, that is the name and statement of the person who rightfully has that name.  The problem is with the 4th of April 2001 statement, and the explanation is this:  It was with a view to procuring the 2nd of June 2001 statement that the investigators went out into the field through an intermediary.  Unfortunately, they were meant to meet him in April; he didn't turn up.  Somebody else turned up instead.  They took a statement thinking it was the 2nd of June man they were talking to.  It turned out not to be, Your Honour, and we only realised that this year, four years after the fact.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Prosecutor, the name mentioned at file No. 14, CGP and CGP2, they are one and the same person?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the confusion.  It is my learned friend for the Defence that has called that person CGP2.  He is not CGP anything, because he is not a witness in this case.  Do you understand, Your Honour?  We never gave him this pseudonym.  As far as we are concerned, the pseudonym CGP applies to the name on the statement dated 23rd September 2003.  However, it is misleading because my learned friend has called this other man as CGP2.  There is no such person as CGP2.  I guess he has just done that just to illustrate to Your Honour.  I mean, it is not from us, it is from them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then now when we look at this document dated the 23rd of September 2003, there is a person identified.  What about that name then?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is CGP -- CGP, that is the name of CGP.  That is CGP, that is his identity -- those are his particulars.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And that is what I meant.  So the real person, CGP, the one who is being offered now as a Prosecution witness, that is the person under Arab (1) in 23rd September 2003.  Is that correct?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then when we compare that to the names in the 4th of April statement and the 2nd of June statement, we see that the names in those two statements are the same, in other words, it is a different name, and it is the same name in both these statements.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So none of these previous statements contain the right name of the witness.  Still correct?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.  Second of June statement contains the right name of the witness, because 2nd of June and 4th of May do not belong to the same person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, that is what I don't understand, because when I now look -- you remember I asked to see your page 2 of the 2nd of June statement?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRSIDENT:
Now, I have that in front of me, and it seems to me that that name is the same as the name as I find on page 152 of your binder.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, it will be, Your Honour, but that is exactly the mistake.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the name is the same in these two documents.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.  Now, the problem then is that in relation to one of these documents that name is wrong, but the statement is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  The statement is the 4th of April 2001.  The name on that statement is wrong, but everything else in that statement is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So when the Defence argues that they have only known the right name of this person since the 26th of September approximately, then they are right, are they not?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
They are right, Your Honour, yes, because that is when we received confirmation of who he was based on this statement.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the name under Arab (1) on the 4th April 2001 statement should have been the name now listed under Arab (1) under the 23rd September statement?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the first observation, and that observation is correct.  Then, the second observation, Your Honour, and that based on your question, is that the details that are listed in paragraph 7 of the 4th of April 2001 statement should, in fact, have been the details listed in paragraph 7 of the 23rd September 2003 statement.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So also the place of birth, et cetera, also that is wrong?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  There were three essential problems with that 4th of April statement, and I can take Your Honours through what the problems were.
Paragraph one, the name is wrong.  It should have been the name in paragraph 1 of September 2003.  That is the first problem.  However, having said that, if you look at the French version in your bundle of the 4th of April statement, you will see that it has the same nickname as the same nickname listed under 23rd September 2003.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Help me with where I can find the nickname, please.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The nickname is under paragraph 1, under I think where the first name is -- if you look at the French bundle in your -- if you look at the nickname in the French, it doesn't exist in the English translation, but in the French, the nickname is the same with that on paragraph 1 of the 23rd September statement.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Prosecutor, you are referring to the nickname of CGP?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
@JUDGE KHAN:
On page 152 of the English version?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, the French version, Your Honour.
@JUDGE KHAN:
No, on the English version.  Nickname -- okay.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you look at page 155, Your Honour, if you look at pager 155, if you look under the nickname --
@JUDGE KHAN:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you look at the 23rd September statement, they are referring to one and the same person, but that was the first indication that we knew that we were talking about the same person, but there was a 
mix-up somewhere.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.  This nickname on page 155, French version, is correct?
@MR. ADEGOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
The nickname is correct?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The nickname was correct, but the real name was not.
@JUDGE KHAN:
But the first name and the last name are not?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are not.  And the French version is the operative version because that is the real statement.  The English was just the translation from the French.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So that was where the confusion started.  The name --
@JUDGE KHAN:
Even the nickname on the first --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- is wrong, it is spelt wrongly.  It is spelt slightly wrongly.  There is an M there, but --
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.  The last name and the first name in the French version are also not correct?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The last name and the first name are not correct on the French version.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Only on the French version?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, it is not correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the first observation.  Now, the second observation is paragraph 7 on the 4th of April statement, be it French or English, is incorrect -- it's incorrect.  Those details belong to the real person and not the person on the 23rd September 2003.  And again you can cross-check that, because if you look at the 2nd June statement, 2nd June 2001 statement, you will see that the place of birth coincides with that person.  So what had happened there was that they had -- the investigators had some prior information before they met -- the investigators had some prior information to identify witnesses.  That information consisted of name, place of birth.  In anticipation of meeting the person that is indicated on the 4th of April 2001 statement, they, before the interview, filled in some of those columns.  It is a pro-forma form on their computer.  So in anticipation of the meeting, they filled in the name, the place of birth and all the things you see in paragraph 7.  However, that person did not turn up, and someone else turned up instead.  Also, someone they wanted to see, but not the person they were expecting at that time.  Forgetting that they had entered column 1 and column 7, they just continued with the interview and entered column 2, 3, 4, 5, et cetera, and that is really where the confusion arose.  They forgot to delete the name they had entered there before.  That is why we have this problem.
So paragraph 1, paragraph 7, are not correct on that statement, and also paragraph 13 is not correct.  This man is not a member of that organisation in paragraph 13, but the real man is.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question, Mr. Prosecutor.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
The details in paragraph 7 appearing on the 23rd of September 2003 statement --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Are you saying that they should be replaced with the details which appear on the 4th of April?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No. The details -- rather it is the other way round, Your Honour.  It is the details that appear on the 4th of April paragraph 7 that should be replaced with that of paragraph 7 of the later statement of 23rd September 2003.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And this statement of 2nd June, I don't seem to have a copy.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, we have very limited copies of that one, because we didn't think it would be relevant.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
By whom was it made, was it by the --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The real man, the person with the same name on the 4th of April.  That is the person -- the person --
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it CGP?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, no.  We gave the pseudonym to him, thinking he was the person we wanted to talk to.  So that is why he is called CGP, but CGP actually belongs to 23rd September.  The person we thought was CGP, yes, Your Honour, so to answer your question, the person we thought was CGP, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Turning now to the substance of these documents.
@MR. ADEGOUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, does the substance come from the same person or from two different persons?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The substance comes from two different persons -- actually, I have to take that back.  The substance comes from the same person known as two different names.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So only one person has actually been interviewed on the 2nd of June and on the 4th of April?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In that regard, two different people.  I thought Your Honour was referring to something totally different.
Now, in relation to the 2nd of June and the 4th of April 2001, the substance comes from two separate persons, two separate bodies who are individuals.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And who is the one who is now being referred to in the 23rd of September statement?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The one  with the statement of the 4th of April 2001.  The one we sent back the week before last was 2nd June 2001.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the substance on page 3 of this document in the English version, the 4th of April 2001 statement is the basis for what this witness CGP may be telling us?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  That is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this 2nd of June statement then, here you have the wrong name?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, we have the right name, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, we have just agreed -- well, well, it depends on what we compare to.  But what matters now is the witness that is actually called, and in relation to that witness, we do not have his name, we have the other name, 2nd of June 2001.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, the 2nd of June statement, Your Honour, does not really have any part in all this.  It is just -- it is a distraction.  The 2nd June -- there is no problem with the 2nd of June statement.  It belongs to the man indicated on that statement and it is intended to be his statement.  It has no bearing whatsoever here.  The only problem is between the April and the 23rd September.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see, the Bench also has to see this in the perspective of how this must have looked for the Defence, and the Defence was confronted with a situation where the names in the two documents were the same, namely, under Arab (1), and now I understand that the substance now on page 3 of this document of the 2nd of June 2001, is that right, that it belongs to that other person but not this witness that is now being offered?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  Your Honour, yes, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is why you are saying that page 3 is not really relevant or has no bearing, but it was disclosed as the other statement of this real CGP?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, it wasn't, Your Honour.  That is exactly why I say it is confusing.  It was not disclosed that way.  As far as we were concerned, up until last week, I would have sworn on oath that I had two witnesses with exactly the same name.  That would have been my position.  I had two witnesses in this case. Now, I only wanted to rely on one f them in trial, and that has been very clear to my learned friend for the Defence.  Now, that is why I say the 2nd of June man is irrelevant, because I never indicated to him that I was calling the 2nd of June man.  Even if they had the same name, assuming two witnesses have exactly the same name, but different particulars, I at some stage had made a choice between one and the other, and it was not the 2nd June.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We just were handed a list of witness statements for the confirmation of the amended indictment against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there under paragraph 13, we find CGP.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, I see that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there, there are two statements.  One, dated 4th April 2001, and one 2nd of June 2001.  That would seem to give the impression that there were two statements disclosed as being CGP statements.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
A very dreadful error which is terribly regretted.  I haven't -- it is the first time I have seen that.  But then, let us talk about this list.  This is a list that was handed to my learned friend in the early days when the indictment was confirmed.  This document must have been prepared by the people who handled the case before I did.  But then in any event I see Your Honour's point that the way it is written -- and it is the first time I have seen this document, actually -- it looks as if the person CGP has two statements.  It is indicated like there are two statements obtained from the same person.  Well, it is understandable because, I mean, everybody at some stage thought that them having the same name, they were the same people, but having taken over the file we realised that they were two separate people, but we didn't actually realise there was even a further complication, that there was an error.
So my learned friend is actually correct, in that at the time the disclosure was made to him, our office had indicated that CGP had two statements.  That is wrong.  That is not so.  That is regrettable.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But tell us, what you are saying is that when you look at the binder which you have been using in this trial, you only offered one document, and that was the 4th of April statement, and that is where the name is wrong, but where the substance is right?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In other words, between the time we had prepared this statement, this list, and disclosed it to my learned friend, and the time we had prepared the pre-trial brief in anticipation of this trial, we had realised that those two statements belonged to two separate people, and had therefore chosen to rely only on one of them which was the 4th of April 2001.   We made that very clear, that we were relying only on one of them.  I had no idea that he had been misled prior to then, that the same person had two  statements, and now I understand why he keeps saying that CGP had two statements.  Now I understand, I didn't understand that before.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Prosecutor, which of the two statements is correct; 4th of April 2001 is correct, is that what you are saying?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, 2nd of June is correct, in that it belongs to the maker.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, now we must not be confused.  The substance of the 4th April 2001 is correct in the sense that it belongs to the witness in the corridor.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But the name is incorrect.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question on the statement made on the 23rd of September.  It is in French, so I don't understand what it is all about.  It was made by -- am I correct in saying that it was made by the witness in the corridor?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, it was made by the witness in the corridor after we realised the confusion in the identity, and it was for him to confirm that the interview that took place on the 4th of April 2001 did, in fact, take place; that the content of the commentary on page 3 of that statement were his comments and that he intended them to be his comments, but that the name on the April 2001 statement was not his name.  That is all that 23rd statement says.  He is acknowledging our mistake.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the rule about variation of witness lists, Mr. Phillips?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Rule 73bis(E), Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, I would like to hear your opinion on the following questions.  Is article -- is Rule 73bis(E) applicable here, since, in fact, the name of the witness originally in the bundle and the name in the 4th of April statement is the name of a different witness?  In other words, in your view is -- what you have to do now is to vary under 73bis(E) or is it your view that since the person has all the time been the same and it is only this unfortunate error in terms of the name, that you don't have to go the way of 73bis(E)?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I would argue on behalf of the office that the provisions of Rule 73bis(E) relates more to the substance of the testimony that is being adduced as opposed to the identity of the witness.  The intention clearly there is to cater for events where you do want to add or vary the nature of the testimony.  Well, testimonies are made by witnesses, they are made by bodies.  Certainly, the intentions of the people who drafted 73bis could not be to cater for the bodies minus the testimony.  What we have here is different.  We have the testimony being for the most part consistent -- entirely consistent.  There is, therefore, no prejudice, because notice of that testimony has been given way above schedule.  The problem now is with the body -- the human body which I respectfully would submit, is not what Rule 73bis is trying to address.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when it comes to your argument about prejudice, the fact that the Defence has been unable to investigate and prepare until the 26th of September, it is true that the Defence can always start investigations after the cross-examination.  But still, how do you say that this is no prejudice?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, there is -- I can't say there is no prejudice.  I mean, clearly there is an element of prejudice, because I accept that an accused person has the right to know those who accuse him.  So I certainly cannot argue that there is no prejudice.  But, can the prejudice be cured?  I believe it can, Your Honour, and I believe that we can cure that if any material evidence comes to light by recalling the witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is your submission.  It is prejudice, but it can be cured?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President I think the prejudice is irreparable -- incurable, because it is important for the Defence to have investigations before hearing the witnesses.
Now, we have done this throughout the trial, and we have compared testimony of witnesses.  We have looked at the recognition of the Accused by the witness.  If we don't know the name or the address of the witness, how are we going to question the witness under conditions which he got to know and recognise the Accused?
We didn't have any verification which was possible to us.  There are errors which are completely irreparable, particularly in the fact that in one situation the witness belongs to a political organisation and not the other.  And therefore the cross-examination turns out today, the 29th of September 2003, practically impossible to carry out, given the error, even if it was an error committed in good faith by the Prosecutor.
Therefore the Defence believes that this is an irreparable damage which has been caused, and the only solution would be not to admit any testimony from Witness CGP.

1450H
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will have noted that generally we rule directly, orally, from the bench after a brief discussion here.  This time we would wish to discuss the matter a little bit further, so we will probably come back in between five or ten minutes and deliver an oral ruling.
So the Court is adjourned for about ten minutes.
$Court recessed from 1454H to 1530H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we took a moment to deliberate because this is an unusual situation.  The Judges have reached the following conclusion.
It follows from Rule 69, protection of victims and witnesses, that, subject to Rule 75, the identity of the victim or witnesses shall be disclosed within such time as determined by the Trial Chamber to allow adequate time for preparation of the Prosecution and the Defence.  Moreover, we have a relevant provision in Rule 73bis, which provides in connection with a pre-trial conference that there will be a pre-trial brief; there will be a list of witnesses the Prosecutor intends to call, with the name or pseudonym of each witness; and that the Trial Chamber or the Judge may order the Prosecutor to provide the Trial Chamber with copies of written statements of each witness whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify. 
Now, in conformity with the system, the bundle of witness statements was then provided both to the Defence and the Trial Chamber shortly before the trial started.  As soon as the unredacted version of the witness statements were disclosed, the Defence must have been under the impression that Witness CGP had the name listed under No. 14 in the bundle, and that would be confirmed by looking at the statement itself. 
Moreover, in a previous list provided by a previous team within the Prosecution, it was stated that this witness, CGP, had not only the statement of 4th April 2001, which is the one reproduced in the bundle, but it also follows that there is a statement dated June 2001, and also in that statement the same name as No. 14 in the bundle was listed.  So there were two documents, then, indicating the wrong name of the witness. 
In addition to this, as mentioned by Mr. Phillips, the location of the witness was wrong in the 4th April statement; in other words, his particulars as to his commune, cellule, secteur and so forth, which are important elements to identify the witness, were misleading. 
It is true that in that statement there was a reference to a nickname, but a mere reference to a nickname cannot replace the full name of a witness. 
Consequently, the Chamber has to conclude that the Defence has been unable to prepare for the preparation of this witness, and it was only in connection with the latter part of this trial when the mistake was discovered, and in particular on the 26th of September, when I understand that the real name was disclosed to the Defence.  It was only on that occasion that the Defence was able to understand that this witness actually bore a quite different name. 
Now, this certainly constitutes prejudice to the Defence.  The question is how grave it is; can it be cured?  And it is true, as stated by the Prosecution, that the witness may be recalled and that further investigations may be carried out until the commencement of the Defence case.  But we are now at the end of the Prosecution's case.  We have heard virtually all the witnesses.  It is obviously of interest to the Defence to know the identity of all the witnesses in order to compare their statements and also the testimony in order to check their credibility.
So, therefore, we are of the opinion that we cannot now say that this prejudice can be cured.  Consequently there is a breach of Rule 69(C), and it would not be in conformity, in our view, to allow this witness, bearing in mind the provision of Article 20 paragraph 4(b) of the Statute.
Let me stress that it does not in any way imply any criticism against the Prosecution.  The Prosecution did not know what was happening.  This is a human error, a genuine mistake, but when it comes to balancing the interests against each other, the Chamber had to reach this conclusion. 
So, Witness CGP, with the right name, will then not be allowed to testify, and we do not see that there is any need to hear the two investigators. 
That is the ruling of the Chamber. 
Are there any other witnesses in the trial, Mr. Phillips? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is one more, Your Honour, CGC.  In terms of logistics, we had asked that he be brought in when we have the afternoon break, because we thought we would be busy with this witness.  So I'm not sure if he is here yet, but he is certainly on his way here.  But they can check and find out.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If the registry could check whether he is already in the neighbourhood, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, before the break I have a point to raise.
Last week we raised an objection regarding the admissibility of the interview made of Mr. Ndindabahizi by the investigators in 1996.  We intend to renounce that objection.  In other words, we now admit that those documents be admitted onto the records.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  That was helpful.  In other words, we are referring to this white binder. 
Yes, Prosecution, that will be P -- registry?  It could be P25, maybe? 
@MR DIALLO:
Twenty-five and 26; 25 for the May 3rd and 26 for the interviews of Mr. Ndindabahizi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So you accept both documents, Defence; is that so?  Both the interviews and the minutes? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Your Honour, all the documents.  
Just a moment. 
No, I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I was referring only to the interviews of Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Regarding the transcripts of 3rd May, we will deal with that later.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, exactly.  So we are talking about the interviews in the blue folder.  They are accepted as P25 for the time being.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you said that you would come back to us and make submission after having listened to transcripts regarding the other document. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  Regarding the transcripts, we intend to disclose to the Court the cassettes.  We have already contacted registry, and we should be able to resolve that problem within the hours ahead together with the registry.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will come back to that other document at the end. 
Now, do we have good news or bad news?  
The witness is on his way.  Any suggestion, Mr. Phillips, as to when we should resume? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would say 4:30, Your Honour.  I had indicated that we normally took a break between 4:20 and 4:30.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, let's do that.  At 4:30 will be the last Prosecution witness.  Thank you very much.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, I know him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How do you know him?
@A.
I've known him for a long time.  That was around 1991, '92.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you describe to the Court the circumstances that led to you knowing Mr. Ndindabahizi during that period?
@A.
I used to see him when he came to visit his sister as usual.  The sister was suffering from a chronic disease and Ndindabahizi used to bring her medicine.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know what his sister's name is or was?
@A.
Yes, I know her name.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell the Court, please?
@A.
She's called Marcianne.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You referred to --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you just repeat that name, Mr. Witness?

Yes, she was married.

Do you know who she was married to?  And I just want you to answer yes or no.
@A.
I knew her husband, but I don't think it would be proper for me to give his name here.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Yes.  Your Honours, can I have a name shown to the witness just for him to -- I've circulated it to all the parties. 
Very quickly, please, Mr. Registry.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you recall how many times you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi visit his sister?  Do you know how many times; numbers?
@A.
I do not recall the number of times, the number of times, because on each occasion he came to see his parents he would visit the sister.  In short, he visited her on several occasions.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In term -- in terms of number, can you estimate for us, would you say it was more than two times, four, five, that sort of thing?  Can you help us with an indication of how frequently you may or may not have seen him?
@A.
On more than two occasions at the very least.  However, I am unable to say whether it was three or four times because he used to visit his parents on so many occasions, and each time he visited the parents, he also visited the sister.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you recall, approximately, the period that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi visit him, the period, the year or years?
@A.
Ninety-one, '92, thereabouts, but I cannot specifically recall the year, but it was during that period, between 1991 and 1992.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You talk about his parents' home.  Do you know how far his -- Mr. Ndindabahizi's parents' home was from his sister's home?  What was the distance between those two locations, if you know?
@A.
It's a long distance because there is a secteur separating the two places.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And when you say "long distance", do you mean -- I mean, what do you mean by "long" in terms of metres or kilometres?  Can you help me?  Don't mention the secteurs, but please, just indicate for us the distance you refer to as long.
@A.
In fact, I cannot give the distance in terms of kilometres because I haven't been to school.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you and Mr. Ndindabahizi come from the same secteur and cellule?  Just answer me yes or no.
@A.
No.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In that case, can you tell me or can you tell the Court what secteur Mr. Ndindabahizi's parents lived in, if you recall?
@A.
Yes.  I do not know the parents, but I know the secteur in which they lived.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell us which secteur that was, please?
@A.
The secteur was called Gitesi. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What about Mr. Ndindabahizi's sister, do you recall the secteur she lived in at the time?
@A.
Yes, I recall the name of the secteur, but I personally do not believe it is a good thing for me to mention the name.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it close to where you lived at the time, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I would rather say it is the same secteur, but I don't think it is proper to give that name.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I just draw Your Honours' attention, in that case, to paragraph 7 of the witness statement on page 128, if that is - was the testimony.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, the person that you identified on the piece of paper I showed you a while ago, was that person related to you in any way?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Without mentioning his name, Mr. Witness, what was the relationship between yourself and that person on Prosecution Exhibit 27?
@A.
He was my maternal uncle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, Mr. Witness, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi throughout 1994?
@A.
I saw him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall when you saw him; by that I mean the date?
@A.
That was a long time ago, and please bear with me if I do not get the dates right, but I believe it should have been the 20th of May 1994.  If by any chance I make a mistake with regards to the dates, please bear with me because that was a long time ago.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is there any reason, Mr. Witness, why you remember the date as being the 20th of May 1994?
@A.
No, I just think that it must have been around the 20th, that is, the 20th of May.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Where did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi on the 20th of May 1994, and by that I mean the location?
@A.
I saw him at a place called Gaseke.  There was a roadblock where people had been killed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Gaseke for the record is spelt G-A-S-E-K-E. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, what were you doing at this roadblock at Gaseke, or were you, in fact -- what were you doing at the roadblock at Gaseke?
@A.
In fact, I was led to that roadblock because it was being said I was a Tutsi, but miraculously I was not killed by the people who took me there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
First of all, can you -- is this roadblock anywhere near your -- was it anywhere near your residence then or now?  Just answer yes or no.
@A.
I'll say that from where I lived to the roadblock, one could cover the distance in -- within about ten minutes, so it's not a great distance, it's not a long distance.  However, the two places are not that close.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  In that case, can you tell us which cellule or secteur Gaseke can be found and in which commune?
@A.
The roadblock was mounted in the Gitesi commune between the Kayenzi secteur --

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

@A.
It's between Kayenzi and Ruragwe.  Ruragwe is R-U-R-A-G-W-E, Ruragwe.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And Mr. Witness, in terms of the location of this roadblock, can you tell us, if you recall, the road that this roadblock was mounted on, do you know what road that was?
@A.
No, it's not a matter of remembering the road, I know the road very well; it's the road that leads to Kigali.  There is a turn that take -- that goes to Birambo. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So the road leads to Kigali from where, Mr. Witness?
@A.
From Kibuye.  Also, when you come from Kigali you pass by that location on your way to Kibuye.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Was the road tarmacked?  Was it a tarmacked road or what sort of road was it?  Can you help us with that?
@A.
No, it was not tarmacked at the time.  Mention was being made of the tarmacking of the road, but it hadn't yet been done.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

I was taken to that roadblock to be killed because it was said that I was a Tutsi.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Who had taken you to the roadblock to be killed? 
@A.
Yes.  The people who did that, they're there, but I do not think that it would be a good thing for me to mention their names in public, unless you guarantee that these names will not be divulged to the public. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you related to any of the people that took you to the roadblock?  Can you just answer yes or no? 
@A.
No, I was not related to any of those people. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, what ethnic group were the people who took you to the roadblock?  What ethnic group did they belong to? 
@A.
They were Hutu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And from where had they taken you to the roadblock?
@A.
They had taken me away from my own secteur. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Any particular place in your secteur?  On the streets, near your house somewhere?  Can you help us with that? 
@A.
No, it wasn't from my house; rather, it was from the bushes, because at that time no one was still living in his or her own home.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you were in hiding, Mr. Witness, were you not? 
@A.
Yes, quite so. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When was it that you were taken from the bushes to the roadblock?  And by that I mean date, if you recall. 
@A.
It was indeed that very date we've already mentioned.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The 20th of May, 1994, is that correct? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What ethnic group was your mother, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
My mother was Hutu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And your father? 
@A.
He was a Tutsi. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you have any brothers and sisters, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
No.  What I can say is that at the time I did, but for the time being, they are no longer there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You say you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi whilst you were at the roadblock.  How long had you been at that roadblock before you saw the man you describe as Ndindabahizi?  How long? 
@A.
I don't think I can remember the duration for which I had already been at the roadblock.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was it hours?  Was it days?  Can you help me with that sort of estimation, please? 
@A.
No, it wasn't days.  In wasn't in terms of days.  It was a few moments, but I'm unable to specify to you how long the time was. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, when you arrived at the roadblock, did you find anyone there, and if so, who were those you found at the roadblock? 
@A.
I found many people there.  I think in my written statement I mentioned the names of those people, but I do not think it would benefit my security in any way whatsoever if I were to mention those person's names in public, because those people are still there.  They're still alive. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In that case, Your Honours, I draw your attention to page 130 of the English statement, it's the last paragraph, two names mentioned there; and also on page 133 of the French.  And of course, the present location of those people, those persons, has a bearing on the witness's security as well. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to table this statement as an exhibit?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I will.  I will, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I will.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So then you are referring to --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I think I might as well do it now, actually.  If I can just enter that statement as Prosecution Exhibit 28, Your Honour, so I don't forget.  And the relevant part of the English statement is the last -- the two, the two names on the last paragraph on page 130, and the two names as well on 133 in the French.  So that would be 28 or 27A and B.  I think we're on 28.  Twenty-eight?  Okay, 28A for English and B for French.

Yeah, so admitted in English and French, under seal.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, we've taken note of those names.  Can you tell me what ethnic group these people belonged to? 
@A.
They were Hutus who were manning that roadblock, and they did nothing else but kill.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how old these people were?  Do you have an idea of how old they were at the time? 
@A.
I wouldn't be able to tell you their ages.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were they young men or old men?  Can you help me with that sort of description?  Were they your age, for example? 
@A.
One of them was young, others were older, but I wouldn't say they were old men because old men wouldn't be manning roadblocks. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Had you known any of these men before you saw them on the 20th of May, 1994?  Before you saw them at the roadblock on the 20th of May, 1994, did you know any of them before? 
@A.
I knew all of them. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you know why these men were manning that roadblock? 
@A.
They were not doing anything else, except to ensure that the Tutsis who were considered the enemy were unable to escape.  That was what they were doing. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how they sought to achieve that goal of not enabling the Tutsis to escape?  Do you know how that was done? 
@A.
Well, you see, I didn't spend all my time with them.  I didn't spend my nights with them; I didn't spend my days with them.  All I know is that they would stop people at that roadblock and would kill them at the very roadblock. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, whereabouts at this roadblock were you located on the 20th of May, 1994?  Do you recall how far away from the roadblock or how close to the roadblock you were?  And can you describe the distance in terms of metres, as far as you remember? 
@A.
In my opinion, I was about 2 metres away from the roadblock.  In fact, I was at the roadblock where I was. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And from -- and in what position were you 2 metres from the roadblock?  Were you -- and by that I mean, were you kneeling, sitting, standing?  Can you help us with that, with your physical position at the time whilst you were at the roadblock? 
@A.
I was sitting. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified that you had been captured in the bushes and taken to the roadblock.  Were you restrained in any way whilst you were at the roadblock?  Were there any physical restraints on your person whilst you were there, or were you free to roam around? 
@A.
No, I wasn't touched at the time when I was at the roadblock.  It's the attackers who took me to the roadblock who wounded me, but those who were at the roadblock did not wound me. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, why was it necessary for the attackers to take you from the bush to the roadblock? 
@A.
The reason was that I had said to the attackers that I had 30,000 francs which I would give to them at the roadblock.  The reason why I was taken to the roadblock was because I had said that at the roadblock there was someone who was owing me 30,000 francs and that I was supposed to ask that person for the money so I could give it to the attackers, but I knew that the attackers were going to kill me whether I gave them that money or not. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was there any connection between those who took you from the bush and those who manned the roadblock, and if so, what was that connection? 
@A.
No, there was no relationship between these people, except from the fact that they were all Hutus. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And how far was the bush where you had been found to the roadblock in terms of distance? 
@A.
I would say that between the roadblock and the bushes where I was found would be a distance of about a 40-minute walk.  You could cover that distance in 40 minutes when walking. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What time of the day was it when you arrived at this roadblock on 20th May 1994?  What time of day was it? 
@A.
It was during the day.  I would say that it was around 11.  You will understand that that is a mere estimate because I wasn't wearing a watch at the time. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you aware of the existence of that roadblock before the 20th of May, 1994, and if so, how did you become aware? 
@A.
Of course I knew that, given the fact that I had first of all hidden at another place, and in that place I had heard people say that there was a roadblock at Gaseke and that no one was able to cross that roadblock.  At the time when I reached the roadblock, I realised that there was indeed a roadblock at Gaseke. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you, do you recall describing the location of the roadblock to investigators from the Tribunal? 
@A.
Yes, I do.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you also recall describing where you were located at that roadblock to those investigators? 
@A.
But I know where I was.  Generally speaking, this was where I was born.  I was a native of that area, so it's an area which I knew very well.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you accompany the investigators to that area, or did you just describe it to them from the location of your interview? 
@A.
I described it to them.  I didn't take them to the site. 
@MR. ADEOGUN    -PHILLIPS:
May I draw Your Honours' attention to Prosecution Exhibit P2, sketch 2 in particular, which is serialed -- serial numbered L0019877.  That sketch is indicative of the witness's description of where he was located at the time.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you, you testified earlier that whilst at this roadblock you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Can you describe to the Court the circumstances surrounding your -- surrounding you seeing Mr. Ndindabahizi at the roadblock?  What was he doing there? 
@A.
No, he was not doing anything in particular at the roadblock.  I saw him pass by.  He was passing by.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  How had Mr. Ndindabahizi arrived at that location on that day? 
@A.
I wouldn't be able to tell you that.  I saw him passing at the roadblock.  I recognised him because of the fact that he stopped there for a moment. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you able to tell us whether he had arrived on foot? 
@A.
Well, you will understand that he obviously didn't come to that place on foot.  He was on a vehicle. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, are you able to describe the vehicle that you saw him arrive in?  And let's start with the colour of that vehicle.  What was the colour? 
@A.
I'm quite sure, from my memory, that it was a white vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you able to recall what sort of vehicle he had arrived in when you saw him? 
@A.
I am unable to tell the different makes of vehicles, but it was a vehicle with a long chassis.  It was the kind of vehicle on which one normally mounts antennae.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was it a pick-up vehicle, for example? 
@A.
I really don't know how to differentiate makes of cars.  All I noticed is that it was a long chassis vehicle.  But it was sort of like a Pajero kind of vehicle, but it was not the same vehicle as those which transport merchandise, for instance. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how many people were in this vehicle when you saw it? 
@A.
It was a very long time ago, but I'm quite certain that there were three persons aboard that vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many people got out of the vehicle, if anyone? 
@A.
It was the chauffeur and Ndindabahizi who came down from the vehicle.  The other occupant did not come down from the vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When the two occupants, Mr. Ndindabahizi and the chauffeur, got down, did they do anything in particular?  Do you know why they got down from the vehicle? 
@A.
I remember that with regard to the driver, he opened the back end of the vehicle and from there he brought out machetes.  That's all I remember. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you know what he did with the machetes he brought out the back of the vehicle? 
@A.
What he did with them?  But these machetes were meant for killing.  There was no other use for them in that place.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you see them kill anyone with those machetes?  How do you know they were meant for killing, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
I'm quite sure that that was the use for those machetes because, first of all, Ndindabahizi said something.  He asked them why they were not killing the Tutsis, why they were allowing them to go.  That is why I was saying that there was no other use for those machetes except that of being used for killing. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke about Tutsis.  Who was he speaking with at the time?  Was he talking to you? 
@A.
No, he wasn't talking to me.  He was talking to the people who were manning the roadblock. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And what exactly did you hear them say -- I'm sorry, did you hear him say, Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
@A.
As for what he said, he asked the question why the Tutsis were being allowed to go without being killed.  Those were his words, and they were the only words he said at that place. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And did he say those words before the chauffeur took out the machetes from the back of the vehicle or afterwards? 
@A.
I don't remember that very well, but I think that he first of all said those words and then the driver off-loaded the machetes from the vehicle. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In what language was Mr. Ndindabahizi speaking on this occasion? 
@A.
He was speaking in Kinyarwanda because he was speaking to Rwandans.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the machetes that were taken from the back of the vehicle, were they just left by the roadside, or do you know what happened to them? 
@A.
After his departure, people took those machetes and they were taken to houses which were below the road.  In fact, that's where the people manning the roadblock lived. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How far away were these houses from the roadblock? 
@A.
It was actually a small structure, a small kind of house.  It wasn't a house as such.  You need to make a distinction between normal houses and this little structure in which the attackers lived.

Did he make any reference to your presence at the roadblock, to your knowledge?
@A.
No, he didn't say anything about me.  As I have just told you, I cannot confirm categorically, in other words without making a mistake, that he saw me and recognised me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was Mr. Ndindabahizi dressed when you saw him at the roadblock on 20th May 1994?
@A.
Since that was a long time ago and that it was during the war, I have already mentioned this in my written statement.  He was wearing a black suit.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Apart from saying those words to the men at the roadblock, did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi doing anything else whilst he was at the roadblock?
@A.
No, nothing else, apart from the fact that he took money from his jacket and gave that money to the people who were manning the roadblock.  I do not know why he gave that money to those manning the roadblock.  I believe the Accused would be better placed to answer that question.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How long did Mr. Ndindabahizi remain at the roadblock on that occasion, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Well, I wouldn't be able to answer your question.  I think he remained there for a few minutes, maybe five minutes, I would say, but in any case not very long.  I had the impression that he was in a hurry, given what he was able to do in that place.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And, did there come a time when you left that roadblock and, if so, how did you leave that roadblock and when?
@A.
I wouldn't be able to give you the exact time at which I left the roadblock, because I wasn't wearing a watch.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you leave the roadblock several days after you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi or when did you leave, in terms of days and months and weeks?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
After he left I remained there for just a few moments.  It wasn't a matter of several hours, nor days.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And how were you able to leave the roadblock?
@A.
As for my departure from the roadblock, it is someone who helped me leave that roadblock.  But I don't think I should mention that person's name, because that would endanger my safety.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you have any relationship with this person and, if so, what was that relationship?
@A.
Yes, there is a relationship between myself and that individual.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell me what that relationship was or is?
@A.
I would say that I was his son, but actually the investigators made a mistake by saying that this person was my maternal uncle.  But I can say that I am like his son, like one of his children.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that this person was your father or are you saying that you took this person like your father?
@A.
No.  He was not my biological father, but, actually, I looked upon him as a father.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I would just have the registry show him this name just to confirm that we are talking about the same person.  It's the piece of paper with the "P" name on it.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is indeed the person.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'll have that introduced as Prosecution Exhibit P29 under seal.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  
$Exhibit No. P29 admitted, under seal)
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was the person you identified on Prosecution Exhibit 29 able to rescue you at the roadblock?  How did that happen?
@A.
I think he must have given an amount of money to persons manning the roadblock, but even if he had not given that amount of money to those persons manning the roadblock he would have been able to save me from the roadblock, because I can say those who were manning the roadblock were like brothers to that person.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Had this person been at the roadblock whilst Mr. Ndindabahizi was there?
@A.
No, that man came to the roadblock later, after Ndindabahizi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How long after Mr. Ndindabahizi's departure did the man arrive at the roadblock?
@A.
I wouldn't be able to tell you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall if it was a matter of seconds, minutes, hours?  Can you help us out with that sort of thing?
@A.
Let's say that it was a matter of minutes rather than .
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And when he arrived at the roadblock, how was he able to secure your release?  How long did it take before he was able to secure your release from that roadblock?
@A.
That did not take a very long time; I would say maybe five minutes.  Actually, he was drunk.  He had been drinking and he didn't stay at that place for a long time.  I think that's the reason why he didn't stay there for a long time, because he was drunk.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And is it your testimony that some amount of money was paid to secure your release?  Was that the only reason why you were released? 
@A.
Yes, it's for that reason, but I think that even if he had not given that amount of money to the people manning the roadblock they were linked by a bond of friendship.  I think there must have been some kind of exchange between some of those people manning the roadblock, maybe an exchange of cattle or something like that.  So he didn't need to offer that amount of money in order to obtain my release.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What ethnic group was this person who secured your release from the roadblock?
@A.
He was Hutu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, earlier on in your testimony, Mr. Witness, you testified that those manning the roadblocks were there to kill Tutsi.  Do you recall saying that? 
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you actually see or know anyone who was killed at that roadblock?
@A.
Many people were killed at that roadblock; moreover, there was a smell emanating from dead bodies.  And I know one person who was killed at that very roadblock.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know that person's name, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell us?
@A.
That person was known as Nturusu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can the interpreters help us with the spelling of that name, if they know?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nturusu is spelt N-T-U-R-U-S-U.  S as in Sierra.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Nturusu, was this person killed before or after Mr. Ndindabahizi's visit?  Can you recall?
@A.
If my memory serves me right, that person was killed after Ndindabahizi's departure.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But would I be correct in saying that that person was not killed in your presence?  You didn't see this, did you?
@A.
That person, yes, you're quite right.  When this person was killed I was not present.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know if anything else happened at the roadblock whilst you were there, before your uncle rescued you, apart from Mr. Ndindabahizi's drive through there?
@A.
People were being killed at that roadblock.  Nothing else.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were these people killed at the roadblock in your presence or before or after you had left?  Can you help me with that? 
@A.
Before I arrived, people were being killed there, and even after I left the roadblock.  I'm saying this because those who were manning the roadblock there only were to kill people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you describe what -- can you describe what the man you say was Mr. Ndindabahizi -- can you describe what he looked like on that day?  What did he look like in terms of his physical appearance?
@A.
You mean Ndindabahizi?  Ndindabahizi is a man of average height.  His skin is not dark nor light.  His complexion is neither dark or light, it's average, between the two.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall making a statement to investigators, Mr. Witness, on the 10th of November 2000?
@A.
I don't recall the date, because after that I experienced a problem and I fell ill.  So I cannot remember those dates.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  In that statement you referred to a Rwandan half-caste being killed after Mr. Ndindabahizi's departure.  Do you recall saying that in the statement? 
@A.
I did not quite understand the term that you used.  Yes, I made that statement.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, was this person killed in your presence or was this something you were told, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I have explained to you that that person was killed after my departure, but I do not know how the investigators took down my statement.  I think I explained to you that this person was killed after my departure.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So any reference in that statement to the fact that you were present at the roadblock when that incident happened is wrong, is it not, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Do you mean the incident in which that person was killed?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  You were not present, were you?
@A.
I have explained to you that that person was killed after my departure and that I do not know how the investigators took down my statement in that manner, because I had already left when that person was killed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you are currently detained, are you not -- and I don't want you to mention the location of your current detention -- but can you confirm whether or not you are currently detained in Rwanda?
@A.
Detained in Rwanda, yes, yes, I am detained in Rwanda.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, how long have you been in detention and, again, please don't mention where you are detained, just answer me as to the length of time, how long a period?
@A.
I cannot tell you the date when on which I was detained because I don't think that would be good for my safety.  However, I am a detainee.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay, can you tell me how long, like one year, two years, three years, can you give me that sort of assistance?  How long you have been detained?
@A.
No.  I have told you I do not wish to tell you the year during which I was detained, because I do believe that may cause me a problem regarding my safety.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I understand that, Mr. Witness.  Can you tell me why you were detained?
@A.
I am in detention because of crimes I committed, and there is a law which provides for sentences for persons found guilty of a crime.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell me what crime you have committed?
@A.
The crime that I committed, well, it's genocide.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you have just testified to this Court that you are of the Tutsi ethnic group.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to ask him a question.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Judge.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Are you a convict?
@THE WITNESS:
No.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that you're on remand where you are detained?  You have not been convicted of any crimes yet.
@A.
Yes.  What you're saying is true.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, Mr. Witness, you've testified and, again, it's on your personal identification details, Prosecution Exhibit 26, that you are of the Tutsi ethnic group.  Why is it, then, that you are currently detained on genocide charges?  Can you help us with that? 
@A.
Yes.  I can shed light on that for you.  There are many people who are in detention, and you yourself can carry out investigations.  There are many Tutsis who are in detention, many.  The only thing is that anyone who commits a crime must be punished.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And are you able to particularise the crime that you are suspected of having committed, Mr. Witness?
@A.
No.  I do not believe I can do so, because that would be detrimental to me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you, Mr. Witness, carry a false identity card in 1994?
@A.
What do you mean by a false identity card?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you known as a Tutsi in 1994 after the event at the roadblock?  Did you continue to be known and recognised as a Tutsi?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
Yes.  I was known as such.  I was a Tutsi and I was known as one.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you are alleged to have committed acts of genocide; is that your testimony?
@A.
Yes.  It is the crime of genocide that I committed those crimes after the date I mentioned to you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you are alleged to have committed this crime of genocide after the 20th of May, 1994.  Is that what you say, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes.

All right, now --

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you have spoken at length about the man you described to be Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  With the leave of the Court, if I asked you to look around this room, do you think you would be able to recognise him?
@A.
Yes, I can identify him.  However, before the war I was 15 years old, and during the war I was 17 years old, and I think that was nine years ago, and if a person who, at that time, did not have grey hair, that person may have grey hair now or maybe someone who was not balding at the time may now have a bald head.  So there are risks of making a mistake.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, Mr. Witness, does your release from that roadblock on 20th of May 1994, does your release from that roadblock have any bearing on the charges of genocide which are currently levied on you?  Can you help us with that?
@A.
Yes, there is a link between my release, but I do not think that to, to -- I don't think the fact of having committed this crime -- I don't think the fact of saying there is a link between my release and the fact of having committed a crime is good for me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  Your Honour, I have to make an application to go into closed session, just to deal with this very little area of this testimony, at the very tail end of his testimony, just to get the point across.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will grant that application.  
Mr. Witness, we will now ask the public kindly to leave the public gallery so that no one will be listening to this case, and then we will enter into a closed session where you can speak freely.  And the transcripts will be placed under seal and court video system will not be transmitted to the outside world.

Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, since Defence did not know until now the charges brought against the witness in Rwanda, we believe it would be proper to obtain the criminal records of the witness.  However, I don't know how we are going to proceed, how we are going to go about it.  I don't if it's the Prosecutor or the Defence or the registry should be taking that initiative, but I shall leave it at that for now.  We can bring it back.  They are just thoughts that are coming into my mind.  I have no clear idea how to deal with it, but I just want to mention it this evening so that we can possibly come back to it.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. Witness, let's go back to April 1994.  How long after the death of President Habyarimana did you hide yourself in a bush?
@A.
I cannot give you the date, but I know that when I was hiding I saw Tutsis fleeing.  On the way, they were being killed.  So it was within that context that I went to hide, but I cannot recall the date.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you personally threatened or chased?
@A.
Well, if I fled, it only means that those who were around me were wondering why I did not follow my kinsmen, because they were making reference to these Tutsis who had been -- who had fled to the stadium.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Your Honour, we didn't understand counsel.
@THE WITNESS: 
There was no doubt, there was no doubt these people clearly know my -- knew my ethnic background, and as far as I am concerned, I know my ethnic background.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We didn't hear your question, Mr. Besnier.  Can you just repeat your own question?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
The question is:  Was there no doubt surrounding your ethnic background?
@A.
No, these people had no doubt whatsoever, and they were speaking knowing what they were saying.  But as far as I was concerned, I did not (sic) know my ethnic group.
@MR. BESNIER:
And these people who had no doubt about your ethnic origin, were they convinced subsequent to the act that you committed and which you referred to a while ago?
@A.
Those who had no doubts about my ethnic group were not the same people who brought me somebody to be killed.  That was another group of people who brought me somebody to be killed, and after that act, they were satisfied that I was a Hutu.
@MR. BESNIER:
When you hid yourself in a bush, as you said, did you go to other communes, apart from your native commune, to hide?
@A.
No, I remained in my secteur.  There were a lot of people that I knew.
@MR. BESNIER:
And in the first sentence of your written statement dated November 2000, it is the second sentence, "In April 1994 and throughout the war, except for a few times when I hid to escape death, I remained in my commune of origin."  Am I to understand from that that you left your commune of origin to hide or did you mean something else?  May I repeat the question, Witness?
@A.
At this place there were relatives, and that is why I did not leave that locality.  So there were relatives within that locality, and it is still my current place of residence.
@MR. BESNIER:
But the question is that in your written statement, I understand that you left your commune to hide, whereas you are saying today that you never left your commune.  I therefore realise that there are two different things.  Which one is correct?  Just hang on a minute, let me finish with my question.  Have you understood my question?
@A.
No, I think that is from your own notes.  All I know is that I remained in my own secteur and my commune of origin.  I did not go beyond that commune.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, in your statement, Mr. Witness, there is a sentence which gives the impression that you did on some occasions leave the commune.  Is that wrong or correct? 
@THE WITNESS: 
No, no.  I do not understand where you get that from because that's not the truth.  I hid within my commune of origin.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Defence counsel gets that from the statement you gave to investigators.  Do you understand where the investigators got that from?
@THE WITNESS: 
No, they misread that sentence.  In fact, I don't know where they obtained that formulation from.  I remained within my secteur and also within my commune of origin.

Mr. Witness, when you were interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal, did you come spontaneously to see them or is it they or someone else who came to fetch you?
@A.
I personally was at the guesthouse and I made that statement.  I am the person who gave the statement; no one else made me do so.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did you know that the investigators were looking for information regarding Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, I was able to know that because where I was staying there was someone who spoke in French.  I heard him say that.  I heard him say that information was being sought concerning one so-and-so and I told him that I knew that person.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  So who was this other person who was speaking in French and who asked you to speak to the investigators of the Tribunal?
@A.
No, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to say the name of that individual.  (By order of the Court this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal).  I heard them say -- they were speaking about Ndindabahizi, and I was saying why were they looking for information on Ndindabahizi.  And that is how come I provided the information concerning that individual.
@MR. BESNIER:
If I understand you properly you were at the Kibuye guest house and you came upon a conversation during which one was mentioning Ndindabahizi and that's when you suggested that you'll provide that information.  Do I understand you correctly?
@A.
I first of all wondered why they were looking for information concerning Ndindabahizi.  When I was given an answer, it was at that time that I was able to give the information I possessed concerning that individual.

@MR. BESNIER:
Do you recall the day that you went to the market and heard about the death of the president?

Normally, the market day, it's Wednesday, so it must have been a Wednesday.

Thank you very much, Witness.  Let's now focus on the Gaseke roadblock, and you said that you were led -- you were taken to the Gaseke roadblock on the 20th -- on or around the 20th May.  What margin of error are you giving to this statement, would it be one day, plus or minus one day, plus or minus three days; can you be more specific?
@A.
I'm saying without any doubt that it was on that date.

Who arrested you and took you to that roadblock?
@A.
There are people who did it but since they are still alive, I cannot -- I cannot name them under the current circumstances.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why are you protecting them if they are criminals?
@A.
Even if they are criminals, I believe I have told you that they are currently detained, and to ask me to mention their names under these circumstances would create a problem.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you testify against them in the Rwandan courts?
@A.
You want to know if I testified against these people?  Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
When you got to that roadblock how many Hutus were already there?
@A.
I told you they were many and I mentioned those I could remember.  I believe you have their names in front of you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  You did say in your examination-in-chief that you knew them all, but you mentioned only these names, whereas you say that they -- those who manned the Gaseke roadblock were 20, in your written statement.  Do you remember other names of these people?
@A.
No, there are no others.  I only estimated the number of people who were at the roadblock.  Now the names that I recall -- I mentioned the names that I knew.
@MR. BESNIER:
So, then, how many people were at that roadblock?  If you do not recall, you do not recall.
@A.
I told you they were many and that I was only to recall the names that I have given you.  I gave you three names, but you will understand that a roadblock is not manned by just three people.
@MR. BESNIER:
But in the Prosecutor's examination-in-chief you recalled that there were 20.  Could there have been many more or less?
@A.
It is not true that I gave that number in my testimony here.  I think I mentioned 20 people in my written statement, but I'm not saying that that is the absolute truth.  I mentioned the name of some of these people, and regarding the number of people that I mentioned, it was just an estimate.
@MR. BESNIER:
All the Hutus who were around the roadblock, were they armed, were they carrying weapons?
@A.
You are asking if they were carrying weapons?  Well, I saw only one person among them who was carrying a spear.  The other weapons were the machetes that were given to them at that roadblock.  That is what I managed to see.
@MR. BESNIER:
So, you are saying that before Emmanuel Ndindabahizi visited that roadblock nobody, apart from the person carrying the spear, was carrying a weapon?
@A.
Possibly they could have been carrying weapons but I did not see them.
@MR. BESNIER:
And yet you were at two metres from that roadblock as you said and you did not observe their weapons?
@A.
Counsel, what do you want me to tell you?  I have told you that even if the attackers were not carrying weapons they can kill through their mere presence given the furore in them.  But I am saying that the only person I saw carrying a weapon was the one carrying the spear.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Witness, Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, when he came to the roadblock, as you claimed, did he really say that, "There are a lot of Tutsis going through here, why don't you kill them?"  Did he say that?
@A.
He added the following: "Why do these people -- Tutsis go without being harassed?"  I think he himself is aware of this unless he is trying to be smart.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could Tutsis really go through that roadblock, Witness?
@A.
I am unable to tell you if he met some but I can tell that you Tutsis were killed at that roadblock.  Maybe he got it wrong or he got to know that Tutsis were able to go through without being harassed, but what I'm telling you is what he said and which I'm recounting.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, don't you find it strange that the Tutsis (sic) who were at the roadblock did not immediately point you out to Ndindabahizi as being their most recent discovery of a Tutsi and did not try killing you immediately in the presence of Ndindabahizi?
@A.
You find that strange?  But I told that you that from among those manning the roadblock there was one influential person and that a message was sent to that person and they knew that that person was coming to release me -- or to free me from that roadblock.  That is why those manning the roadblock did not harass me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who then would have sent this message?  I thought your uncle came by only subsequent to Ndindabahizi's departure?
@A.
The person who sent the message -- well, the information went round because he was not far from where I was.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, if I should go over what you said in examination-in-chief, they arrested you, took you to the roadblock and you stayed at the roadblock for just a few minutes, then you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi arrive and he stayed for just a brief moment.  Within that short period you are saying that somebody circulated the information to the effect that you would be saved and at that very time the minister comes to the site.  Is that what you want the Court to believe?
@A.
There were even screams or shouts that I had been arrested, and that person heard that I was at the roadblock and he sent a message to say that, "Don't kill my son".  He was somebody who was very -- who was well listened to by the people mounting the roadblock, and that is how come I was saved.
@MR. BESNIER:
Am I to understand that all those people at the roadblock, including the killers that you referred to, hid from the minister, who came there himself, that there was a Tutsi close to that roadblock?
@A.
I have told you that the leader of those mounting the roadblock played a role.  He, in effect, is the employer of the people manning the roadblock.  So I don't know if we're understanding each other, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Thank you, Witness, for this answer.  After the departure of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, how long did you remain at the roadblock?
@A.
I have already told that you I was not wearing a watch, that I stayed at the roadblock for about five minutes.  I would not be table to give you the precise duration since I did not -- I was not wearing a watch.
@MR. BESNIER:
The half-caste who was killed subsequently at the roadblock, and the person called Nturuso, is it the same -- is the one and the same person?
@A.
It is that person called Nturuso, he was the half-caste.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you admit today that you did not witness that killing, whereas you said the contrary in your statement to the investigators of the ICTR?
@A.
Counsel, I expressed reservation and I did say that the investigators might have got it wrong or maybe the interpreter got it wrong, or for some other reason.
@MR. BESNIER:
I understand, Witness.  I just want to know, based on what you were told, if the killing of the half-caste had anything to do with the visit of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi to the roadblock?
@A.
I have already said that regarding Ndindabahizi and the killing of that person, the killing of this person occurred subsequent to Ndindabahizi's departure.  I don't know if you understand me, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  But this killing occurred after, but was it after, in the course of the same day, in the course of the week?  Do you have any further information on this?
@A.
Well, Counsel, I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.  There wasn't a long lapse of time.  I don't know if you need someone else to explain what I'm telling you, but I believe it's clear.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you say now, Mr. Witness, can you repeat your answer? 
@THE WITNESS:
I said that it was not after a long time -- it was not a long time thereafter.  I cannot even say hours, let alone days.  It was soon after the departure of Ndindabahizi.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it correct to say that this killing took place on the 20th of May 1994?
@A.
Yes, on the same day, that same date, around 11:00 or a bit after 11:00.  It was not in the night, it was in the morning but not early in the morning.
@MR. BESNIER:
Rwandan half-caste, exactly what do you mean?  Is it a child of a Hutu and a Tutsi or a white man and a Rwandan woman?  Explain exactly what you mean by half-caste.
@A.
It was not a Hutu or a Tutsi nor a Twa.  Briefly I don't know how to describe him to you in French.  I think that in French you say naturalised.  Maybe you are in a better position to understand that than myself.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he have any white blood?  Did he have any parent who was of the white race?  Do you know anything about that?
@A.
No, I wouldn't say that he had white blood but, in fact, it was said that his mother was Rwandan, but that his father was allegedly white.  Now, as for his physique, he had the traits of a Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you know him yourself?
@A.
No.  It was only at that location that I learnt of his existence and people spoke about him saying that he was called Nturuso.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know any other name that he may have had or a nickname?
@A.
How would you want me to know that, Counsel? 
@MR. BESNIER:
In your written statement you mentioned the fact that this half-caste was in his vehicle and that his driver was driving.  Did you also come by this information through other persons?
@A.
You are referring to the driver?  No, no, I knew the driver before.  That is not something which was reported to me.  I knew the driver.
@MR. BESNIER:
And the driver did indeed answer to the name which you mentioned in your written statement?  I don't want to mention the name out loud, but you stated that he was driving his vehicle and you mentioned the name.  Do you remember the name that you mentioned?  Don't say it out loud.
@A.
Yes, of course, I know that name.  I do remember his name but of course I won't say it out loud.

@MR. BESNIER:
I want to give you a piece of paper, Mr. Witness, so that you can confirm that indeed it is the same person we are talking about.  It is very important.  
@A.
Yes.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to counsel.  Your microphone was not on, Counsel. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you recognised the name of the half-caste about whom we are speaking?
@A.
Yes, yes.  That indeed was his name.
@MR. BESNIER:
I have two or three other small questions.  I do not want to go back --
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I am seeking a clarification.  Was the name written on the paper the name of the half-caste or of the driver?  
@THE WITNESS:
Are you speaking about the name that I have here before me? 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes. 
@THE WITNESS:
I didn't understand your question, Your Honour. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Does that name relate to the late half-caste who was killed at the roadblock, or the driver of the vehicle? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, it's the driver's name. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
I want to go back a little to your situation and your alleged crime.  I simply want to know whether that crime was committed in the same cellule where you were living in 1994 or whether it was somewhere else in Rwanda.
@A.
Oh, you make me laugh, Counsel.  It is indeed my native cellule, that's where I committed that crime. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm sorry that these things make you laugh, Mr. Witness, and I want to know approximately when this crime was committed.  Was it in the month of May, was it in June, or do you still want to remain vague? 
@A.
I cannot give you the exact time because I do not remember myself, but it was the day after the incident we referred to, the following day in the morning, the morning following the day on which I left the roadblock, but I cannot specify the time.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no further questions for this witness. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No re-examination, Your Honour. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
You mentioned that you were taken to the roadblock at around 11 o'clock in the morning; is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
I cannot tell you that that is the absolute truth.  It was not during the evening, but neither was it very early in the morning.  I gave a period of time which was approximate. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
In the morning; okay.  How long after that did the Accused arrived? 
@THE WITNESS:
Just a little after my arrival at that place. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  And how long after that was the half-caste killed?  Because you said he was killed in the morning as well. 
@THE WITNESS:
Briefly, that happened about five minutes after I left the roadblock.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did you get into hiding?  When did you start hiding in the bush; which month? 
@THE WITNESS:
I do not remember the exact date, but it's obvious that that was in the month of April.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was it before the event at Gataharo stadium or after the event at this stadium? 
@THE WITNESS:
With regard to the time that I went to hide, it was before the incident that took place at the Gataharo stadium.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you stayed in the bush from before the event at Gataharo stadium until the 20th of May; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you ever -- was this bush far away from your home, or were you simply in the bush? 
@THE WITNESS:
You must understand that one can't live in the bush without eating.  I would go somewhere where I was given food to eat, but I must specify that this was in the cellule where I was born.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.  So you were living in the bush day after day, but given food to eat by someone in your cellule; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
It's not only one person who gave me food, it was several people.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In my language what I said, it wasn't only one, it could be one or many, and now you are clarifying that it could be many.  All right.
Now, how are you then able to remember that this happened particularly on the 20th of May, this event, after having stayed about for four weeks hiding in the bush? 
@THE WITNESS:
When one goes into hiding, that doesn't mean that one loses one's mental capacities.  I cannot forget that date.  It's true that I was living in the bush, but I had contact with the outside world, and I must tell you that there were obviously bad people in 1994, but there were also people who were good.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But can you explain to me how it was possible to keep trace of the dates in this period, Mr. Witness?  Can you explain that to me? 
@THE WITNESS:
I'll never forget that date, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In the beginning of the testimony you said that you were not certain about the date; later in your testimony you said, "I can never forget that date".  Can you explain those two remarks for me? 
@THE WITNESS:
It's a fact, the memory of an individual retains certain facts and forgets others.  I think that this is a normal process when we are dealing with retention of information.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, one of your first remarks in the testimony you gave today was, "I may be wrong about the date", and later you said "I'm absolutely certain about the date".  That is what I want to put to you now:  what is your answer now? 
@THE WITNESS:
The explanation I can make is that when you have students in a class, there are some who will have a good memory and others who have poor memory, who do not retain what they are being taught, and if you are being taught a hundred lessons, you can, for instance, maybe only remember one lesson.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Around '91-'92 you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi, you were still a child, you saw him from a distance.  Do you remember telling us that? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, but obviously it was a distance which was not very far.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what kind of distances are we talking about here? 
@THE WITNESS:
You see, you can take as a point of reference a road used by vehicles.  You know that vehicles are parked to one side of the road.  Now, put yourself in the place of someone who would be standing by the road on the opposite side of the place where the vehicles are parked.  That's where I was.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So did you see him always in a vehicle or outside the vehicle? 
@THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't be able to tell you that he was outside the vehicle.  In fact, I could say that he never left the vehicle, but it's true that when he came to visit his sister, he came out of the vehicle and he would go to see his sister, and after the visit he would go back to the vehicle and leave.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you observed him, did you see him when he was in the vehicle or when he went out of it to visit his sister? 
@THE WITNESS:
I am unable to be more specific about that.  I cannot -- I can tell you that I saw him when he was walking, going towards the sister's house.  In fact, as far as I know, he didn't go to the sister's house because the road was quite steep and he would park by the road, and I think he never went to that house because he could never have gotten there on foot.  The place was steep, and I don't think he could have reached the house.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So did you see him leave the vehicle on his way to his sister's house or did you not? 
@THE WITNESS:
No.  No, I never saw him go up that walk in order to reach his sister's house.  Maybe he would go there at times when I didn't see him, but personally I never saw him actually making that trip.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you only observed him while he was inside the car; is that your testimony? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was only on those occasions that I would see him, only then.  Maybe he did indeed go to his sister's house, but I cannot confirm that because I never saw him walk towards his sister's house.  I can therefore not testify to something of which I was not a witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, how can you be certain that the man you saw in '95 was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, when in '91-'92 on a limited number of occasions you had only seen Emmanuel Ndindabahizi inside the car? 
@THE WITNESS:
I can confirm that, and I have no doubt whatsoever about that, because, firstly, in other words, in 1992, it was said, "The brother of one such lady has come", his name would be mentioned by the people, and then on the 20th of May, 1994 some people who were at the roadblock asked who was that personality and his name was mentioned.  People were asking questions about where that man was working, and these people were saying amongst themselves that "He is now minister for finance", and it was at that point in time that I realised that it was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi they were talking about.
Now, as for the occasions during which I had seen him earlier, I had seen him two or three times, so when I saw him at the roadblock it wasn't the first time I was seeing him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Your testimony has now come to an end.  Thank you for coming the long way to Arusha to testify. 
Do you have any particulars so as to facilitate our task to find the file concerning you in Rwanda?  Is there any identity number or anything which could assist us?  Don't mention the detail, just answer yes or no.  Do you have anything which could facilitate finding those documents? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, I have no indication to provide to you in that regard, but I think that you can approach the relevant authorities, in other words, the Prosecution, because that file is with the Prosecution, the Office of the Prosecutor.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I wish to request that the written statements of the witness in French and in English be tendered as an exhibit, because I have some interest in that. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is already Prosecution Exhibit 28.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think Mr. Phillips has already tendered it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes; Prosecution Exhibit P28.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but I was under the impression that it was only partially admitted for certain passages from the statement.  I wanted to be certain that it was admitted as a whole document.
Also, Mr. President, I wish to tender as an exhibit the name which I showed to the witness a moment ago which would reveal the identity of the half-caste's driver, because we shall come back to that, I'm certain.  Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  D16, says the registry.  D16, under seal.
$Exhibit No. D16 admitted, under seal)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is good.  So have a nice journey home, Mr. Witness.  Thank you very much.  
It is now 7:20.  May I propose that we have the pre-Defence conference tomorrow, maybe after 5 o'clock, then we can continue with the Military trial in the afternoon.  For how long do you think this pre-Defence conference will last, Mr. Besnier?  Are we talking about more than half an hour? 
@MR. BESNIER:
It won't be very long, Mr. President.  I have some information to give to the Chamber, the names of my witnesses, subjects on which they will testify, and the duration.  I think I will be quite brief, but I'll be dealing more with the pre-trial brief.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say the pre-trial brief? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  I mean the pre-Defence brief.  It's not quite ready, because we haven't concluded with the Prosecution case, but it will be ready immediately before we move into the presentation of our case.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any things to raise tomorrow, Mr. Phillips?  I'm just thinking about when we should start tomorrow. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour, I have not seen the pre-Defence brief, we have no issues.  We have some outstanding exhibits to finalise now.  Before we close our case we have to sort these Prosecution exhibits that are in limbo out, so that we will leave our case open until that is sorted out.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right.  Do you envisage any contentious matters in connection with these exhibits? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, we have one contentious matter as things stand, and that is very important to us.  It is the 3rd May meeting, I believe, and that is very contentious.  That is a major part of the Prosecution's case, and it is a Prosecution exhibit that is very important, so unless we have some way forward with that, it is very difficult for us to actually make a decision as to whether we are able to close our case at this stage or not, Your Honour.  It is an exhibit that cannot really be entered outside the Prosecution's case.  It can't.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but is there any other problematic issue than the 3rd of May? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, it is the only one outstanding, to the best of my knowledge, as far as our case is concerned.  For the Defence case, I have no knowledge as of now what the issues are.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When do you think, Defence, that you will be able to clarify the issue about the 3rd of May?  Can that be done tomorrow? 
@MR. BESNIER:
With the cooperation of the registry it would certainly be able to be done during tomorrow.  I know that we have in the Niyitegeka case a transcript in French, in Kinyarwanda and in English of that document.  If I can consult that document tomorrow morning, I think towards the end of the morning or in the afternoon I would be able to express myself on these transcripts with regard to what the Prosecution is saying about the same.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what I am wondering now is whether we could start at 5:30 in the afternoon and go on to 6:00, or whether it would be more cautious to start a bit earlier in the afternoon. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Maybe it would be wiser to start a little bit later so that we have enough time to go through the research that we have to do, which I have spoken about.  So I think for me 1800 would be ideal. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Eighteen-thirty, I'm sorry, 1830.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  From 6:30 to 7:00 then, tomorrow, and that's that.  That gives time, and that is the time that we will be sorting out the exhibits and look a little bit at the future. 
Thank you very much.
The Court is adjourned until tomorrow afternoon then.

P R O C E E D I N G S
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Now, let us start in an open session to deal with the public matters, namely, whether there is anything to be said about the last exhibit and possibly to hear any announcement once the exhibit issue has been sorted out.
So who will start on this issue about the exhibit? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good evening, Your Honours.  We just renew our application to enter this 3rd May document as a Prosecution exhibit in connection with the testimony of Madam Alison Des Forges.  The -- if we revisit, my learned friend certainly has not made any -- has not laid any foundational basis for which this document should not be admitted in evidence.  The only observation that I recall him making was the notations on the English translation on pages -- page 25, namely, number 11, and the notation there that that person listed there is in Kibuye prison, and also on page 26 where the bourgmestre is also listed as being in Kibuye prison.  And he says, well, they were not in Kibuye prison when this document -- when these minutes were taken, so where did those notations come from?  And therefore, the document is, for the most part, unreliable.
Now, in response, our submissions are as follows:  First of all, it is the Kinyarwanda translation under tab 1 that is the operative document.  The notations that my learned friend talks about concerning number 11 and number 26 actually exist in the Kinyarwanda translation.  And I have only just found out this evening that if you look at the list of those who attended the meeting, there are two separate copies of the first page.  In other words, list number 1 to 43, there are two copies of it with two separate tab numbers.  
So if you look under tab 1 where the list of those who attended, K0248675 is one list, and if you flip over, K0248676 is exactly the same list.  The only difference is that 675 has handwritten notations against certain names.  If you look at 11, there's an underline there with "prison, Kibuye" written; 15, "deporté"; 26, "prison, Kibuye," and so forth.  Now, it's very obvious that whoever then did the subsequent translation from Kinyarwanda into English just translated those words that were written.  And that's the explanation for why, in the typed version under tab 3, you then have the extra notations there that say "Kibuye prison," et cetera, in brackets.  That's where they got it from.  And I actually didn't realise that this document was in the bundle at the time, but I've just seen that some commentaries have been made.  
Therefore, the very essence of the challenge is defeated.  There's no -- nothing to suggest that this document has been tampered with.  
As to the chain of custody, well, it's obvious from the reading of tab 1 that these were minutes of the meeting taken by the préfet and forwarded by the préfet to the minister of the interior, or whoever it was forwarded to, and there is a covering letter at the beginning of tab 1 to that effect.  The document originates from the evidence unit of the Tribunal, of the Office of the Prosecutor.  It's been 
serialed (sic), and there is no impropriety in relation to the documents whatsoever.
The 3rd May meeting have been used in a variety of cases in this Tribunal, especially the Kayishema trial, and I'm sure that this matter was raised or this document was brought to their attention.  If it wasn't, it doesn't depart, anyway, from the veracity of the contents of this statement.  And I would be very eager to see what my learned friend has to say following my submissions.  I'm grateful.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Defence. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The Defence is not against having this document admitted as a Prosecution document, but I think we can deal with this rather quickly.  I would wish that the Tribunal can take note of the reservations which I have expressed.  My main reservation is that we are not formally contesting or challenging the authenticity of the document but its reliability.  We know that this document was drawn up by a préfet, Kayishema, or his secretary maybe several weeks after the meeting was held, and we are wondering about the sources available to the préfet or his secretary to enable him to write this document.  Was it from memory or was it from a private recording or was it from notes which were taken during the meeting?  We do not know.  Consequently, we are insisting on the fact that we do not know how this document is a reflection of what was said during the meeting.
If these words I have said are taken into due account by the Chamber, I would not be against this document being admitted as an exhibit for the Prosecution.  
Furthermore, I have here today, thanks to the registry, Exhibit P5 -- P5, I repeat -- which was filed in the Niyitegeka case.  It's an exhibit from the Office of the Prosecutor which constitutes the transcripts of a cassette which was, itself, a recording of a broadcast of Radio Rwanda during that famous meeting of the 3rd of May.  So here we have the transcripts which are quite different, in fact, from the document issued by the Prosecutor.  It's different in its form and in substance.  I think the Chamber should have these two documents which may supplement one another.  Let me underline the fact that it has been indicated that this document, in other words, the transcripts of the cassette from Radio Rwanda, was somewhat incomplete.
I am now requesting that this document, which is available to the Tribunal in English, be also admitted as a Defence exhibit and therefore be -- the Chamber will have at its disposal the two documents, and they will be available for any assessment necessary when we come to closing arguments.  I thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for placing this on record, Mr. Besnier.  So the Chamber has noted your remarks in relation to the interview, and you will, of course, in addition, be free to address this when we come to the merits and the closing arguments.  So that's noted.
We will then enter this as P26.  Is that so, registry?  Thirty?  P30, that's where we are now.  All right, P30.
$Exhibit No. P30 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then we had the issue of the transcripts.  Do you have the document made available to all of us here?  
Mr. Phillips, any comments on that, please?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have a preliminary objection to these transcripts being entered.  First of all, as a matter of procedure, I don't see the basis for my learned friend entering transcripts, wherever they have been derived from.  There's no witness in the box.  There's no foundational basis for entering those transcripts, and he can't seek to enter transcripts in limbo.  The right procedure would have been to enter the transcripts when Alison Des Forges was there and give her a chance to comment on the transcripts.  We gave Alison Des Forges a chance to comment on the 3rd May meeting documents.  Now there is no witness in the box, and we're now entering transcripts in limbo.  I mean, that's something that I have great problems with.  That's the first thing.
The second thing is the representation to Your Honours that they're transcripts.  They may well be transcripts, but they're not a contemporaneous record.  They're not a contemporaneous record of the proceedings on the day.  Rather, what my learned friend seeks to enter, and refers to as transcripts, are bits from a news broadcast following the meeting of 3rd May where reference is made to various speeches that are made there.  So it's news broadcast on Radio Rwanda which was recorded, and the transcripts are derived therefrom.  So it's a different thing to have a recording of a live broadcast, which is a contemporaneous broadcast, it's a different thing to have a reporter reporting on what may have happened and summarising what took place.  So that's the nature of the document, because I'm very familiar with the document that he talks about. 
But well apart from that, it's the evidential basis and the procedural difficulties in entering documents into evidence without actually having somebody giving someone the benefit to comment on those documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have your comments on those two matters, please, Mr. Besnier. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I don't see why that shouldn't be done, because this matter came up after 
Mrs. Alison Des Forges testified.  That's when the document was filed.  It was after that that we questioned its reliability, and we were able to carry out research investigations to verify and obtain, with the assistance of the registry, the document in question.
Secondly, I believe that the Tribunal is free to admit as an exhibit anything which could help us find the truth at the appropriate moment, and this is why the -- it's because the Prosecution provided evidence that we are providing evidence which will supplement that which is already on the table.  And I think it is a good idea for the Chamber to have the two documents.
Finally, the Prosecutor and the Defence will be able to argue on the reliability and the authenticity of these documents in their closing arguments. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Besnier, do you have any Defence witness testifying about the 3rd of May? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Truly speaking, no, Mr. President.  As matters stand, given my list of witnesses, I don't have a witness which will -- who will testify on that meeting of the 3rd May.  
Let me remind the Tribunal that this meeting of the 3rd of May is not part of the indictment, and it -- it's not a document in dispute, given what is available in the Ndindabahizi case file. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips is right that this is a slightly unusual situation.  On the other hand, this unusual situation came up because there was discussion about these minutes at a very late stage in connection with Alison Des Forges's testimony.  The issue of the minutes was raised just before her testimony in the witness stand, and then the Defence said that they would come back and, after inquiries with the registry, look into the matter.
Now, this is a matter -- the transcripts have been tendered in previous trials.  Even if there is no -- the witness Alison Des Forges was not given the possibility to comment directly on this, that is due to the particular sequence which we have outlined now.  It was only later that this -- rather late that this came up.  So we will, in the interest of fairness, receive both, then P30, as we have accepted from the Prosecution, and these transcripts, which we will now receive from the Defence, it being understood that in relation to both documents, the parties will be free to address us on the reliability of these documents.  The Defence asked us some time ago to exercise caution in relation to the -- with the minutes.  Mr. Phillips just asked us or drew our attention to the fact that this may be rudimentary and not complete, and that they are news reports.  But all this we will come back to on the merits stage.
So then it's also admitted as an exhibit, namely, D17.  Now, is this both transcripts and tape?  Are we talking about two different -- are we talking about A exhibit being the transcripts and then B exhibit being the tape or vice versa, or are we talking about only one exhibit? 
@MR. BESNIER:
For the time being, I only have the document, the hard copy, in English. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  So, then, the right sequence would be, then, P -- did you say 17, registry?  D17.  Now, D17A will be the sound version, if it's ever found; D17B will be the transcript in French; and D17C will be the transcript in English.  So that would clear the matter.
$Exhibit Nos. D17, D17A, D17B and D17C admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there anything else to be said at this stage? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Another observation in relation to the witness Your Honours heard yesterday, Witness -- I'm just trying to find -- CGC.  I've heard mention being made of obtaining the criminal antecedents of this witness.  Whilst I don't have any objection to that, and neither does the witness, I would ask that the witness be recalled if those antecedents are going to be made use of during the deliberation so that he's given an opportunity to comment on the document.  So in other words, if we are going to obtain documents concerning this witness, then in essence we are going to have to make provision to recall that witness, have that document put to him, and give him and afford him an opportunity to comment on the contents of that document, if any reference is going to be made to that document in these proceedings.  So that's, that's the first observation.
In that case, because he's a Prosecution witness, then that leaves us with the practical problem of whether or not we're able to close our case if we are still recalling Prosecution witnesses, and I'm in Your Honours' hands in relation to that, but that's a procedural matter that we have to bring to your attention at this stage, Your Honour, and -- yeah. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You will, of course, be free to raise this issue should this document ever appear, and you will then ask a request -- request the Chamber to call this document, and maybe a practical way to do this would be that you could do it in terms of a possible rebuttal. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It wouldn't strictly be a rebuttal witness, especially if -- I mean, strictly speaking, it wouldn't be a rebuttal witness because rebuttal testimony has to be limited to matters raised in the Defence case, and if there's nothing to rebut, it's just a question of --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  But I'm envisaging a situation where the Defence will receive these documents -
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and then tries to use them and show that the witness is not credible, and that's where you will come back and say, listen, this is not a good argument because the witness was never really given the opportunity to comment upon this document, and in that perspective, it is some kind of a rebuttal.  
So we can do this two ways:  Either call it rebuttal, or you can close your case subject to the issue of recalling that witness.  These are the two ways to do it.  I think I'll leave that, actually, to the discretion of the Prosecution.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
To us, it is more or less the same, I think.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'm grateful.  In that case, the Prosecution closes their case.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Thank you very much, Mr. Phillips.  
Anything else to be said in the public session by the Defence before we go into the closed status conference in order to plan the next stage of the trial? 
@MR. BESNIER:
No particular observations, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I will then note for the record that this is trial day 12 of the Ndindabahizi trial.  During those 11 days, until yesterday, we had heard 15 witnesses for the Prosecution, and this marks the end of the Prosecution case, and we will then resume at a date to be decided after consultation with the parties to hear the Defence case.
So thank you to both parties for their expediency, and now the Prosecution case has come to an end, and we will go from an open to a closed session.  Thank you very much. 
And I think maybe I would say, I think the parties -- but actually, it's the Prosecution witnesses, so you, Prosecution, you presented the 15 witnesses in 11 days, and I think that's very efficient.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  There was a slight delay because of some practical problems, but I understand that they have been sorted out. 
This is the opening of the Defence case.  Is there anything the Chamber should be apprised of?  I see that there are some documents in front of us.  Do you want to introduce them, Maître Besnier? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have transmitted to the Chamber a bound document which is the list of witnesses as well as their identifications -- with their identification forms and their written statements.  You'll also find in this bundle of documents a list of exhibits that we intend to put in to support the Accused's defence of alibi.  It also includes a copy of the statement of the expert witness that we intend to call at the end of our case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now, you have here on page 2 of this document -- I can see a priority list of 1 to 20.  Is that the order in which you intend to call these witnesses? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  That is the order in which we intend to call the witnesses.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will start with Witness DJ? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  If there is nothing else to be said from either side, could we then call Witness DJ, please? 
Do you intend to make an opening statement, Mr. Besnier, before we call Witness DJ? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  I think I can make the opening statement before the witnesses are called.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Please go ahead. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, in April, May and June 1994, Rwanda was inhabited by demons.  This sentence is not from survivors or from history books; it was said at 25th October, last 25th October, by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi when I visited him at the detention centre.  In April, May and June 1994, death lurked in the hills of Kibuye.  Yet all the Hutus did not become demons, even if all the Tutsis were potential victims.  Several Hutus themselves fell under the true barbarism, others did the best they could under the circumstances to save lives, to preserve their dignity or simply to protect their family. 
It is one of the tasks of the Defence before this Court to demonstrate that the Accused was one of those who went through hell without losing their dignity, those who faced up to their responsibilities, these civil servants who remained at their posts to ensure the survival of the state, without their work, meaning their support for killings, without their signature at the bottom of an administrative document, meaning their signing up to a crime. 
Defence is not obligated to supply evidence; in law, it should simply draw the attention of the Judges to the doubts which attend the demonstration of the Prosecutor, and we believe that at this very stage, the charges brought against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi are not solid and true.  But in the case at bar, the Defence will go beyond refuting the evidence of the Prosecutor. 
We on this side of the courtroom are not afraid to face up to the facts.  And let's keep to the facts.  It is a judicially -- judicially proven truth, since the judgement of this Tribunal on 21st May 1999, in the Kayishema case, that tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed in the Kibuye préfecture.  It is a fact, judicially proven, that a great number of them were collectively killed at the Gatwaro stadium on the 18th April 1994. It is also a fact, judicially proven, that several survivors took refuge in the Bisesero region and were massively exterminated, particularly on the 13th and 14th May 1994. 
The suspects of these killings were sought and arrested by the Rwandan authorities as well as the Prosecutor of the ICTR.  Some were sentenced.  The judicial records of these proceedings cover several thousands of pages, witnesses were heard for hundreds of hours, and in the ICTR, five judgments have been rendered, covering more than 800 detailed information on the Kibuye killings.  But is it not strange that the name of Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, never appeared in these proceedings, not in Rwanda and not in the ICTR? 
In the case that I referred to, more than 100 Prosecution witnesses were called, and they testified against a number of people, outside the Accused, but never this man.  Dozens of businessmen, bourgmestres, low-level civil servants, were accused and names were revealed, their roles were specified in the case of this event, and never was the name of the Minister of Finance mentioned. 
Is it not strange that while -- that according to the Prosecutor, his presence alone will amount to incitement to kill?  Is it not also -- does this not cast doubt on the fact that -- is there not doubt in the fact that this man was accused only seven years after the events, whereas he was regularly in contact, and for several years, with the investigators of the Prosecutor?  Is it not curious to see the Prosecutor, a few weeks before the trial, divest Ndindabahizi of his political position and to retain against him the simple crime of individual responsibility?  Is it not surprising that observers, experts, historians, specialists of genocide and human rights, never mentioned the name of Ndindabahizi, never write his name, whereas they do not -- they always mention individuals whose functions were less important than his?  Even Madam Alison Des Forges, who did not honestly answer the only question I put to her, never wrote the name of the Accused, never once, not even once, in her book, which is an authority,  "Leave None to Tell the Story." 
Are these not objective elements of doubt, even before we start examining the evidence of the Prosecutor, which we are going to be doing at another stage? 
In Rwanda, on the crime sites, names -- which the names are familiar to you -- Gasharu, Gitaka, Gitwa -- nobody accuses Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Preliminary reports on the massacres perpetrated in Kibuye, the first of which was published in 1996 by the Rwandan minister of higher education, does not mention his name anywhere, whereas dozens of suspects are mentioned.  On the hills, nobody does not take serious these charges brought against him, and I do not think that the witnesses or the Prosecutor themselves believe in that.  You don't have to limit yourselves to my assertions.  The witnesses, our witnesses, in the days ahead are going to be called before you. 
The first batch of them are mainly Tutsis, genocide survivors.  Their names or their parents' names are known to you.  They are sons and daughters of persons who have been assassinated and who Prosecution witnesses have already made mention to.  You will then be able to finally put faces to the victims.  Before you, and before the Accused, these people, whose families sometimes have been killed, will tell you what they think about the charges brought against Ndindabahizi. 
Other witnesses are well-placed to know the truth.  They themselves are the killers.  Most of them have pleaded guilty. 
I pray the Court to allow me to bring this evidence before you, because sometimes the recounting of these facts are difficult, but it is a necessary state to finding the truth. 
In April, May, June 1994, death was in the hills of Kibuye, and I did not see the face of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi there. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Besnier.  I have two questions for you in light of your opening statement.  The first question relates to the matter that none of the witnesses in previous cases have referred to Mr. Ndindabahizi.  That sentence, does that refer to the finding in the five judgments which you referred to, namely, the Kibuye judgements, or does that statement refer to their testimony also in the transcripts?  That's one question. 
And the second question was your reference to Alison Des Forges.  There you said that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi's name does not figure in her book.  Her answer was that it didn't figure in the registry, in the registry of the book, in the index, but that she wanted to reserve her position because there may be mistakes in the index.  So your statement, does that imply that you have checked the book itself and that you have not found any reference to Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  On the first issue, we have carefully examined judgements which have been rendered in the case of Kibuye and we realise that Ndindabahizi's name never appeared in these judgments.  We then looked at the transcripts, and witness statements.  I'm not asserting that we have absolutely checked all the transcripts of the testimony of witnesses.  We have gone through some of them and I believe that should account for about half of the testimony, and I'm sure the name of Ndindabahizi does not appear therein. 
Regarding the second question, Mr. President, we have also carefully examined the totality of 
Madam Alison Des Forges's book and not only the index, and I can assure you that the name of Ndindabahizi does not appear therein, not even when the expert is talking about the formation of the interim government. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Then I suppose this is the right moment to call the first witness.  Registry, could you please call Defence Witness DJ. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Your Honour, so far as the judgement (sic) is concerned, there is something concerning Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence that I should like to mention.  As far as that witness is concerned, she will talk about things that occurred in a small cellule of the Kibuye préfecture.  It's a cellule where she always lived in, and she lives there still, and it's a location of crimes described in the indictment.  Now, the person we are referring to could be easily identified.  That person is one of the survivors, and there are not many survivors from that préfecture -- from that cellule, but I do remember that the Prosecutor, on the basis of these very same circumstances, had applied for a sitting in camera, which was granted.  I shall therefore question the witness concerning the location at which the witness was, and probably these questions may reveal the witness's identity, so that I will be compelled to apply for a sitting in camera for this particular witness as compared to the others.  We shall try to limit ourselves in time to ensure that the sitting in camera is done properly, but I would not be able to assure you that we will exhaust all the questions in this sitting in camera, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, your application for the closed session under Rule 79, does it apply to the entire testimony of the witness, because of the particular nature of the evidence, or are you only saying that you want to start in closed session? 
@MR. BESNIER:
I shall try for as much as possible to limit the closed session.  I shall try to finish with the closed session and go on to more general questions, but I'm not quite sure this will be possible, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problems, Prosecution? 
Could you indicate approximately for how long we would have to close this session so that the public could come back again at a certain time?  Approximately? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, 45 minutes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that indication.  
Well, I must say then that we have to close this session in pursuance of Rule 79, but you have heard the indication of Mr. Besnier, and we will open as far as this will be possible in the interests of the witness.  So Registry, make sure that the public gallery is being closed.  Thank you very much.

Who informed you of the existence of a roadblock in Gasharu cellule?
@A.
It was my mother; in other words --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has mentioned the relationship between himself.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please remember that we are in a closed session, so you never, for instance, mention names of your close relatives.  Now, please proceed.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
From your observation, Mr. Witness, what did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi do or say during his visit to that cellule?
@A.
When he came into the cellule he made the killings to be stopped.  He asked the members of the population why they were killing people.  He even arrested one person, one man, and put him in detention.  And this person was put into detention because it had been said that that person had killed people; Ndindabahizi had been informed of that.  And from that day onward no one else was killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you, yourself, remember the date on which you left your hiding place?
@A.
I was hiding in two different places.  I left the first hiding place in the beginning of June after Ndindabahizi's departure from the cellule, and I left the second hiding place on the 4th of July.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the cellule you were living in, were there any other Tutsi survivors?
@A.
Yes, there are.
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you had discussions as genocide survivors regarding the events that took place in Rwanda in 1994?
@A.
Yes, we speak a lot about these events.
@MR. BESNIER:
From the end of the war did you ever hear the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi mixed with killings, or did you ever hear his name being mentioned as being a perpetrator of whatever crimes during the genocide?
@A.
No.  Sometimes on the radio one hears that he is in prison, but we are saying that these allegations are false.  His name has never been involved with any responsibility whatsoever for crimes committed during the genocide.

And your father was indeed killed during the genocide, was he not?
@A.
Yes, he was.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are there any reasons why you would wish to be testifying on behalf of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and not necessarily have anything to do with the respect for the truth?
@A.
Could you please repeat your question, Counsel?
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you have any personal reasons for defending Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, despite the fact that you are a Tutsi and that you were nonetheless a genocide survivor?
@A.
Yes, I do have reasons, and the reason is that I am defending him because if he hadn't come to the cellule all the Tutsis who survived would not have remained alive.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi visited Gasharu cellule in the month of June 1994 and not before then in 1994?
@A.
Actually, Ndindabahizi visited the cellule in the beginning of June.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, that's what I thought you said.  How come is it then that the Tutsis alive owed their good fortune to him?  The last thing you said a few minutes ago was that he -- his intervention saved the lives of Tutsi.  Now, at the beginning of June, how many Tutsi who were alive were walking the streets of Gasharu?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
After Ndindabahizi's departure, there were Tutsis who were still alive in Gasharu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, certainly.  And I'm sure those Tutsis were walking around, walking through roadblocks, were they not, Mr. Witness?
@A.
No.  As for moving around, around roadblock (sic), nobody would go there, but in July all Tutsis could come out of their houses.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  And that's thanks to Mr. Ndindabahizi, is it not, as far as you are concerned?
@A.
Yes, with regard to our cellule that is indeed my statement.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Mr. Witness, how old were you in 1994, in April 1994?
@A.
I think I was 22 years old.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you were certainly aware that Tutsis were being sought following the president's death in April 1994, are you not?
@A.
Could you please repeat your question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Will do.  Were you aware, Mr. Witness, that Tutsis were sought following the death of the president in Rwanda in 1994?  Were you aware of this fact?
@A.
Yes, I knew.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know why Tutsis were being sought at this time, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Could you please repeat that question for me?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you have any idea, Mr. Witness, why those Tutsis were being sought in 1994?
@A.
Tutsis were being pursued because there was a government which hated Tutsi, but all the government members were not harbouring the same hatred for Tutsi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was Ndindabahizi a member of that government, by any chance?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was he a member of that government from April 1994 until July 1994, to your knowledge?
@A.
Yes, he was part of that government.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you have any discussion with him between April and July 1994 as to how he felt about Tutsis?
@A.
No, I didn't converse with him on that subject.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So how are you able to tell us that he was not against Tutsis?
@A.
Can you please repeat the question for me, because I think there is background noise which is prohibiting me from hearing you properly?  I am please requesting you to repeat your question for me.  I didn't quite understand you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you hear me now?
@MR. BESNIER:
We do indeed hear background noise which is very disturbing.  We cannot really hear the Prosecutor's questions.  Can the technician please come to our aid?

Could we have that sorted out?  There was a little dash of noise also in the English for a moment.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, Mr. Witness, did you speak to Mr. Ndindabahizi between April and July 1994 about his feelings for Tutsis?
@A.
As for any discussion whatsoever regarding ethnic groups, I do not believe that Ndindabahizi said at any moment whatsoever when he was sharing a glass with other people that he was against any such group or other.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You haven't answered my question.  I will ask you that question again: did you speak with Mr. Ndindabahizi about his feelings for Tutsis between April and July 1994; a simple yes or no?
@A.
I did not discuss that matter with him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you, yourself, a member of the cabinet of the government of Rwanda between April and July 1994?
@A.
I cannot clearly understand your question.  Can you repeat it?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you work for the government, yourself, between April and July 1994?
@A.
No, I was not a leader.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you attend any cabinet meetings between April and July 1994, Mr. Witness?
@A.
No.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You described that government that was in power between April and July 1994 as a government that hated Tutsi and that not everybody in that government hated Tutsi.  How are you able to come to that conclusion?
@A.
No.  What you are saying is not true.  I am not the one who said that.  I said that government existed, and I added that not all members of that government had evil intentions towards the Tutsis.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Wasn't it your testimony in this courtroom only two minutes ago that that government hated Tutsis; yes or no?
@A.
Up until this minute that I'm speaking to you, I am confirming that not all members of that government hated Tutsis.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you were able to come to that conclusion because you, yourself, in fact, were a member of that government, were you not?  You sat down through their meetings, deliberated with them, therefore, you are able to come to that conclusion, Mr. Witness.  Is that not your testimony?
@A.
Relying on what Ndindabahizi said when he came into our cellule, I'm able to assert that all members of the then government were not against the Tutsi because when he came into the cellule he asked them to stop the killings.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You have only come here to tell us a pack of lies this morning, have you not, Mr. Witness?  You were not at that meeting were you?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which meeting?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The meeting he has just referred to.  He referred to the meeting, himself, and he knows the meeting he is talking about.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we in June now?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no idea.  I am about to find out, Your Honour, if he would answer my question in due course.
@THE WITNESS:
I have not lied.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  Now, you said that, based on what he said when he came to Gasharu, you came to the conclusion that he was not against Tutsi.  Is that not what you mean?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
All right.  So there was only one meeting, according to you.  Your testimony is that you only saw him once there.  Is that not your testimony; you only came there once in June, in the beginning of June 1994?
@A.
Yes, that is my testimony.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good.
@A.
And he organised a meeting to stop the killings, but not to encourage them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  And you attended that meeting from your position in the ceiling of your mother's house, several metres away, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Those who attended that meeting can testify to it, but I did not attend that meeting because I was in hiding.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, if you did not attend the meeting, how can you testify as to what was said at the meeting?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
Let me try to explain to you: those who attended the meeting -- among those who attended the meeting there was a brother of Ndindabahizi, and when he came back he told me what was said at the meeting and when he was telling me this, Ndindabahizi was with him.  Ndindabahizi came to his sister and then -- and said that from that day on no one was to kill the Tutsi.  And it was his sister who was telling me what Ndindabahizi told her.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I understand that, Mr. Witness.  So why isn't that brother of his sitting in the box where you are now, telling us about what he heard his brother saying?  Why are we having to rely on your evidence?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
I don't seem to understand you.  Can you repeat your question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You said that you based your information on what you were told by Ndindabahizi's brother after the meeting.  Do you understand me thus far?
@A.
Yes, I understand.  Ndindabahizi himself came to the sister soon thereafter and told the sister that no one should kill the Tutsi, once again, and that, "I do not want people to continue killing the Tutsi".  My impression -- I did not understand the last part of your question.  If you want to repeat that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you understood every question put to you by my learned colleague for the Defence, did you not?
@A.
Yes, I understand your questions, but I just want you to repeat this last one.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, so that you can think about the answer in your head before you speak it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is the question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm still waiting for an answer to my question.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I want the answer -- I want your question again, Mr. Phillips, please.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, were you, or were you not, at the meeting that Ndindabahizi addressed in June 1994?
@A.
I was not at that meeting and the reason for which I did not attend that meeting was that I was in hiding.  I also told you that the brother of Ndindabahizi attended that meeting and that in the company of Ndindabahizi they came to Ndindabahizi's sister.  Ndindabahizi spoke to the sister, telling her that from that moment on no one was going to kill Tutsi anymore.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yeah, right.  And this was in June 1994, was it not?  Just yes or no would do.
@A.
That is correct; at the beginning of June.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is your testimony that all the Tutsi who survived in Gasharu thereafter owed their survival to this man, Mr. Ndindabahizi, is it not, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, that is my testimony.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good.  Now, how many witnesses for the Defence have you met or do you know personally, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I did not understand your question.  Are you talking about Defence witnesses, and for which Defence?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is only one Defence in this courtroom, and you know it, Mr. Witness.  How many Defence witnesses do you know?
@A.
I believe I met seven of them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's a substantial amount of witnesses.  Do you know how many witnesses are in this case, in total?
@A.
I cannot know the number of witnesses.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that there are indeed seven witnesses from the location where you hail from in this Defence case; there are actually seven of you from that location?  I don't want to mention the location, but I am trusting that you understand what I'm talking about; the cellule.
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that you had a hand in inviting those seven persons, or six persons including yourself, to be witnesses in this case?
@A.
No, I'm not the one who looked for these witnesses.  However, let me give you this explanation: in the search for the witnesses that you are referring to, I saw some white people come who were investigating into the Ndindabahizi case.  They asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi.  I said yes.  I told them how I knew him and they asked me if there were other people who could say the same thing that I was saying and I said, yes, there were people in my cellule who would be able to say the same thing.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you know if any of those seven persons that come from your cellule have any prior relationship with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, relationship either by blood or by marriage?  Do you have any idea if any of those seven individuals had a relationship with him?
@A.
Two of them, yes.  These are the children of Karegeya and these two people have the relationship with Ndindabahizi.  Now regarding the others, out of the seven, they don't have any relationship with Ndindabahizi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's your evidence, Mr. Witness, isn't it?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now let's go to your location during the events of 1994, April 1994.  It's your testimony, Mr. Witness, that you were hiding at your mother's residence.  Is that not so?
@A.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And is it also your testimony, Mr. Witness, that you remained at that location until sometime in June 1994?
@A.
I remained in that house.  In fact, I told you that, first, I was hiding in the ceiling, and when the situation became worse I came out and I was hidden under sorghum stems in the compound, and I only came out of this hiding place when Ndindabahizi reassured the people, and then I went back to the house and I only came out of that house in July, more specifically 4th July, and that was when I started moving about in the neighbourhood.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Now, do you remember where Cyprien Karegeya was killed, according to your information?
@A.
He apparently was killed in the centre of Gitaka, according to the information I got.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And, roughly, how far away was that location from where you were located, in distance now?  Don't mention names, just the distance.
@A.
Approximately one kilometre from the centre to where I was; the distance was about one kilometre.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you are one kilometre away from the alleged crime scene, hiding in a ceiling or under sorghum grass or whatever you call it, and you, to the best of your knowledge, believed that everything that you were told about the death of Karegeya was true and reliable enough for you to repeat it here.  Do you think so?
@A.
That is true and I'm ready to swear on that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let's talk about Mukantabana.  Do you know where she was killed?
@A.
I also learnt that he was allegedly killed at the Gitaka centre.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Again, a kilometre away from where you were located, was it not?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, in your statement you describe that you were an eyewitness to Higiro's death, Simon.  Do you recall saying that in your statement, or was that a mistake?
@A.
Let me give you an explanation.  I told you that I saw -- I saw, myself, Simon when the killers were taking him away.  They passed in front of Ndindabahizi's house.  He was being led to his death.  I see him pass, but I did not say that I witnessed his killing, his execution.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you expecting this procession to pass by where you were, or was this just an accident, you seeing this procession go past?
@A.
It was just incidental that I saw the killers led Simon by.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you saw this whilst you were covered with dry grass or whilst you were in the ceiling?  In which location were you at this time?
@A.
Let me explain to you: when Simon was being led to his death, they had not yet started killing the Tutsis.  In fact, it was the day he was led to his death that they started killing the Tutsis and it was from Ndindabahizi's house that I saw Simon passing by with the killers.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  But you still haven't told me where in Ndindabahizi's house you were.  Were you in the ceiling at the time, or standing at the window, or covered by grass?
@A.
Let me continue explaining to you.  And I'm saying that I saw him pass by together with the killers, and the day he was being led to his death, the Tutsis were not yet threatened.  It was from that day that they started killing the Tutsi.  It is to tell you that all the Tutsis were not hiding at that time.  I was, therefore, (By order of the Court, these words have been struck from the record and filed under seal) when the killers passed by with Simon.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was Simon a Tutsi or a Hutu?
@A.
Simon was a Tutsi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So why was he being led to his death if Tutsis were not being sought at that time?
@A.
I told you that it was on that day that the killing of Tutsis started.  This was about three days after the death of Habyarimana.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The reference to the house, this precise location where the witness observed this, will be deleted both from the transcripts, where it will be placed unseal, and from the court video system.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that the information you gave us as to those who were responsible for Karegeya's death and that of Mukantabana were things that were told to you, the people who were responsible for their death?  You didn't see that; it's just things that were told to you, was it not?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Also, you were not present when Ndindabahizi visited Gasharu cellule and, again, his visit was reported to you, was it not?
@A.
I told you that I was in the cellule and it is in that cellule that Ndindabahizi's house is located.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct.  Sorry; you were not at the meeting that he held with other people from the cellule.  That's what I meant.  Is that correct?
@A.
It is correct.  I did not attend the meeting.  But I told you that it was not a meeting to incite killings; it was, rather, intended to stop the killings.  That is one point that you need to understand.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I certainly, do, Mr. Witness.  Now, how much of the evidence that was adduced in the Prosecution's case were you aware of before you became a witness for the Defence?
@A.
I don't clearly understand your question.  Can you please repeat it?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How much of the evidence of Prosecution witnesses had you become aware of before you travelled to Arusha; in other words, the evidence against Ndindabahizi, how much of it were you aware of before you came here to Arusha?
@A.
I have no idea.  I don't know about that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When my learned friend for the Defence asked you to mention those Tutsis who had been victims of the attacks in Gasharu cellule, was it then a coincidence that you mentioned only the names of victims that have been mentioned already before this Court?  What do you say about that, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Your question is very long.  Can you reformulate it more concisely?  Your question is too long.  Is there no way of shortening that question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There certainly is.  Now, when the lawyer for Ndindabahizi asked you about the names of the victims, people who had been killed in Gasharu cellule, you only mentioned the names of Karegeya, Mukantabana and other people who had already been mentioned in this case.  How did you know that those were the names to mention?  Is it a coincidence that you just happened to mention the same names?
@A.
If I mentioned the names of these people, it's because these were people I knew and whose names I remember.  You will understand that this happened nine years ago and that -- it would be difficult for me to recall the names of other victims.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When you were asked to mention the names of those who were responsible for their death, is it also a coincidence that you only mentioned names of assailants who had been mentioned already in this case, or are these just the names that you remembered from your hiding place at the time? 
@A.
If I mentioned names of other people mentioned, this will not mean that these were names of attackers; there were many attackers and it would not be easy to mention all their names. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You were not an eyewitness to any of the attacks, how come then that you were able to recollect the names of not only the victims but indeed the assailants, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
That is due to the fact that when we are in our various cellules, we talk.  We talk about names of persons that killed other people during the events and names of victims for the purpose of reassuring ourselves as to what -- as to whether what we say about the responsibilities of such and such a leader is true or not, because some of the attackers are now in prison or at the time were in prison.  So we try to refresh our memories as to what we say about the attackers, and some of the attackers are in prison and they are said to be guilty. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Have you testified against any of the attackers that you mentioned in this courtroom this morning?  Have you ever been to any of their trials and testified against them for the bad things they did at Gasharu; if so, which ones and when? 
@A.
Personally, I was a prosecutor's witness for Rukundakuvuga but that trial had not yet started; the other two Accused pleaded guilty.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you say you were Prosecution witness for Rukundakuvuga; is that what you say, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
Yes, sir, that is correct. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How did you go about being a Prosecution witness when you just told us that you were not an eyewitness to any of these activities?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
I do not get the question clearly.  Could you kindly repeat?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How can you be a witness against Rukunda at his trial, if you were not an eyewitness to any of the crimes that he committed? 
@A.
Now, I am in a position of accusing him because he came to seek me and my mother hid me, and on that day, Rukundakuvuga beat up my mother. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you testified that before the events of 1994, Ndindabahizi often visited your location, your location in --
@A.
I didn't say that.  I didn't say that he came often.  I said that he did not come often.  I said that he came approximately once a year.  I did not say what you just said. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is precisely my point.  Now in your --
@A.
No, sir.  He said that he came often, that was not what I said. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your witness statement, you described knowing him from childhood and state that he came back frequently to greet his family and then you go on and on and describe your relationship with him.  How do you explain that in your witness statement; it is no longer frequently now? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which line is this?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have a --

RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, you came from your country to Arusha.  Were you alone or were you with other countrymen or women on your journey to this place?
@A.
I came with other people. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you in Arusha guesthouse or a house in Arusha; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
And also those people are housed in the same house.  Are they in the same house, they live in the same house? 
@A.
Yes, we stay at the same house. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And how many other people are there with you in that house? 
@A.
We are eight in that house. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Is that the right reason that when the Prosecutor asked you whether you had met other Defence witnesses, you said that you had met seven other people? 
@A.
No, it is not that reason, sir.  I didn't get the question very clearly.
@MR. BESNIER:
Earlier on, I asked you whether you had met other witnesses for the Defence, and I wanted to know whether you had answered that question because you thought that you met them here in Arusha or probably you may have met them in Rwanda.
@A.
Well, we met in Arusha, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you. 
@MR. BESNIER:
No other questions, Mr. President. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a few questions for you, Mr. Witness.  
What was the relationship -- was there any relationship between the Accused and Karegeya, the father of the son with whom you were hiding?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, there was a relationship, a relative. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
How were they related?
@THE WITNESS:
They were cousins, madam.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And to what ethnic group did he belong, Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was Tutsi, madam.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
But he was a cousin of the Accused?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have another question.  You stated that you had two hiding places, in the ceiling and in the garden, and that you left one, the first one in June after Accused's visit and the second in July, is that what you said?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam, on the 4th of July.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  And when did Accused come to your place of hiding? 
@THE WITNESS:
I didn't understand that question clearly.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Did he come at the beginning, middle or end of June, to your place? 
@THE WITNESS:
He came at the beginning of June. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And, so that brings me to my next question.  If he stopped the killings as you allege, why did you remain in hiding until the beginning of July? 
@THE WITNESS:
After his departure, I left my first hiding place and I went to the house, and nobody came into the house to look for anybody after that.  He had already made the statement and after his departure, we couldn't have been absolutely sure that we were safe.  We could not therefore go out, but what is certain is that after his departure, nobody went around seeking people out in houses any more. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And initially, you stated that you hid in the ceiling, then you left and went out in the garden.  Now, you are adding that you returned to the house in the ceiling again, or generally in the house.
@THE WITNESS:
Well, let me explain.  I didn't go hiding in the ceiling; I was in the house.  I could move around the house but I did not go out of the house.  I went out of the house and remained in the compound.  I remained in the compound.  I never went outside the compound, and after that, I no longer hid in the ceiling as was the case before. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, would it be correct to believe that you survived because of your close relation with the Accused? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is not the reason why I survived.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You were hiding in ... ...  ... ..., idn't you?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
So it means that you were protected by the Accused ... ... ... ?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct, madam. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Were there other relatives of Tutsi origin of the Accused who were also protected by him? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam, some of them, for example, Karegeya's child. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Karegeya was also related to him; why was he not protected? 
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya had gone to seek refuge in other families, but his child came to the same house as I was hiding.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Who told you about the killing of Karegeya?  How did you come to know about the killing of Karegeya? 
@THE WITNESS:
I heard it through my mother. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Had she herself seen the killing? 
@THE WITNESS:
From her house, you can see the Gitaka centre and the killers took us to the centre of Gitaka.  My mother never went too far away from her house, but from her house, you could very well see what was happening at the Gitaka centre where Karegeya was killed.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You were, I think, .... ... ... ... .
@THE WITNESS:
I have told you that I was hiding in that house.  I was with my mother.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is talking about relationships. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now this has happened three times.  Isn't it possible to avoid this?  
Now, Mr. Witness, please do not mention where you were hiding in terms of the Accused because that could reveal your identity.
Now, could video system -- all the references to the house in which the witness hid will be deleted, same with the Court video system.  Next question, please?  
@JUDGE KHAN:
From the house where you were hiding, you could not see the killing of Karegeya? 
@THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to me personally?  No.  Personally, I was not an eyewitness of the killing of Karegeya
@JUDGE KHAN:
From the same house your mother could see or witness the killing.  How come that you could not witness the killing? 
@THE WITNESS:
My mother could go out.  You see, I was hiding, I couldn't have seen anything.  I didn't want to show myself. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.  Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you mention the name Nkurunziza earlier today?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why did you mention his name, what was his significance? 
@THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I talked about him because I knew him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What happened to him? 
@THE WITNESS:
He was also killed during the war, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, did you mention any other names of persons that were killed?  And now we will not talk about Karegeya.  We will not talk about Tatiane, and we will not talk about Simone Higiro.  Did you mention any other persons that were killed when you were asked about victims earlier today? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I gave other names. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat those names, please?  Would you repeat those names, please, in case there was a lack of clarity?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya.  Mr. President, do you want other names that I did not mention?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, only the names that you mentioned in view of the examination so far.  So you have now mentioned Karegira, Nkurunzira.  Did you mention everyone else today?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya, Mutemberezi, Nkurunziza, Karegira and Habimana, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what was Habimana?
@THE WITNESS:
Do you want to know his ethnic group, sir? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Habimana?
@THE WITNESS:
Habimana was one of our neighbours and he was Tutsi, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Nkurunziza?
@THE WITNESS:
Nkurunziza was also a neighbour, a Tutsi, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you mention the name Mutemberezi?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I talked about Mutemberezi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was he?
@THE WITNESS:
He was also a Tutsi. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for having come to Arusha and testify.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you kindly not to discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.  
We may well now have the lunch break.  
The next witness then, Defence pseudonym is?
@MR. BESNIER:
The next witness will be DH, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You said DH, didn't you?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I am not sure that we have received the DH documentation so far.  We have some intimation from another witness including DU, but we were -- we will then need DH. I have DG and DU.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the document we submitted to the Tribunal, isn't it in that stapled document?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course, it is in the main document, like all your other documents, we have it in the main document.  But since your technique so far has been in addition to this binded folder also to provide us with a separate document for exhibiting purposes.  I just draw your attention to that kind of documentation concerning the next witness, we have not received.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I understand.  We tried to situate that the witnesses for this morning, their documents be submitted to you.  That is what we tried to do.  And for this afternoon, the document will also be sent to you before the beginning of the afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is quite understandable.  So why I am raising this is that in front of us, we have DU and another one which does --  and these two do not form part of this morning's session, and that is why we just draw your attention to the fact that we got, of course, the two documents for this morning session, but we did not -- but in addition, we got something which could appear to be for this afternoon session.  But now, we know that it is DH which is the next one and that is the one we need at 2:30.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  Mr. President, what happened was, there was a mistake on the part of witness protection or probably it's on my part.  Witness DU was confused with DJ.  The letter was not clear, this is why there was this confusion error and I should like to apologise for it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you are a protected witness and you will be referred to with a pseudonym Witness DH in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now make the necessary arrangements to that effect. 
@MR. MUSSA:
Would you please stand up, raise your right-hand and say after me.
$Declaration made by Witness DH in Kinyarwanda) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And, Mr. Witness, we are now in an open session, and that implies that you have to be a bit careful when you respond to questions.  So please do not reveal your identity when questions are being posed which may imply particulars relating to your identity.  Do you have a document in front of you? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your signature at the bottom of the document? 
@THE WITNESS:
It is indeed my signature. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now does that imply that the information contained in that document is correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information is correct.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I have to request a motion under Rule 79(D) because we are going to have to question the witness closely on his identity.  So we are requesting for a closed session for the next ten minutes of our session this afternoon, by your leave.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are simply asking for about ten minutes. 
Any problems with that, Prosecution?  No.
And we have to grant that motion, but the public will note then that in about ten minutes we will revert to the open session.  And the purpose of this closed session is simply to protect the identity of this witness.  Thank you very much.

@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Mr. Witness, who took you away from hiding place No. 1? 
@A.
My father. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did he take you to that place, specifically? 
@A.
He was a family friend. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And you stated that you remained there for two weeks in that hiding place?
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Apart from yourself, were other Tutsi refugees hiding in this hiding place No. 1?
@A.
Yes, they were.
@MR. BESNIER:
How many others? 
@A.
Two. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you tell us the names of the people who were hiding together with you in hiding place No. 1?
@A.
There was Mukantabana and her daughter.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was Mukantabana's first name? 
@A.
I do not remember.  Yes, it was Tatiane.  Yes, Tatiane was the name.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, I am requesting the witness to move closer to the microphone, because I cannot hear him properly.  Thank you.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You stated that you remained for two weeks in your hiding places No. 1, why did you have to leave it?
@A.
It is because people had just discovered that hiding place. 
@MR. BESNIER:
After hiding at hiding place No. 1, did you go immediately to hiding place No. 2?
@A.
Yes, that is where I went. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did someone accompany you there or did you go there alone? 
@A.
I left together with the members of that family who accompanied me there.
@MR. BESNIER:
The Tatiane we referred to, did she also accompany you to hiding place No. 2?
@A.
No, I left her in the first hiding place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know the owner of the house in which it was located, hiding place No. 2?
@A.
Yes, I knew the man. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Had you known the person for a long time? 
@A.
No.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was he living in that house in 1994? 
@A.
No, he was living in Kigali. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did that person go frequently to that house or to the cellule in which that house was located? 
@A.
He would come there about twice a year. 
@MR. BESNIER:
That owner whom we are referring to, was he present when you went to hide in his house? 
@A.
He was not there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was present in that house? 
@A.
I think his sister was there. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Apart from his sister, did you notice anyone else being there when you reached hiding place No. 2? 
@A.
I only found one person there who was also hiding. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, not verbally but in writing, can you also tell us the names of the other persons that you had been hiding with?
@A.
Yes, I will do so. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Ask Mr. Witness to write this on a piece of paper.
@THE WITNESS:
Very well.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if you are about to mention two persons, please use numbers.  If you are about to write more than one name, please call it No. 1 and No. 2.  If there is only one name you don't have to use the numbers.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Registrar, can you show the document to the Bench and to the Prosecution?  Could this be admitted as Defence exhibit, Mr. President, Your Honours?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
D21 so admitted, under seal.
$Exhibit No. D. 21 admitted, under seal)
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, you have written two names on this piece of paper.  The first name that you wrote, does that belong to the sister of the owner of the house that we were referring to as hiding place No.2?  
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the second person whose name you have written down doing in that hiding place? 
@A.
That person was living with the family, but at that point in time, the person was hiding and was remaining in his or her hiding place. 
@MR. BESNIER:
This person you have mentioned as No. 2, was that person hiding in the same hiding place as yourself or somewhere else? 
@A.
We were not hiding in the same hiding place; we were not side by side, but we were within the same compound. 
@MR. BESNIER:
For how long did you remain at this hiding place, if you can recall? 
@A.
I think that I stayed there for a month or for a month and a half.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you know, Mr. Witness, that this house that you were hiding in belonged to a person who was having a high position and that he was Hutu?
@A.
Yes, I knew that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did that not make you feel afraid? 
@A.
No, I wasn't afraid.  And I was saying to myself that nothing could ever happen to me.  He couldn't do anything to me. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you believe that he couldn't do anything to you? 
@A.
It is because this person had very good relationships with my parents; they were friends, so I understood therefrom (sic) that he couldn't do me any harm. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Isn't it correct, Mr. Witness, that during the genocide some friends turned against their friends and against people who were close to them, that people even killed their friends? 
@A.
That is indeed true, that did happen but I didn't think that could happen to me, and I didn't think it could happen to me because these people welcomed me. 
@MR. BESNIER:
During your stay at hiding place No. 2, was that house ever searched? 
@A.
The house was searched.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know by whom? 
@A.
It was people whom I wasn't able to know.  I didn't know their names; there were people who were moving around and they were scattered over the hill, I wasn't able to see them, I didn't even -- I didn't know them.  I heard them shouting and making a lot of noise. 
@MR. BESNIER:
How is it that these people did not find  you, they did not discover you? 
@A.
These people were unable to see me because I was hiding, it is quite simple. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let's now go back a little.  Do you know how your father was killed. 
@A.
I was not a witness of his death.  I was only told about the circumstances that led to his death. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And what were you told about those circumstances? 
@A.
I was told that he was arrested, that he was taken away and that he was killed.  I was told, "Your father was killed", that is all.  I was told, "Your father was killed". 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know of any eyewitnesses to your father's death? 
@A.
I came to know one person, Karara, who was quite close to the place.  I think that he saw the people who took my father away, maybe he would be aware of the circumstances that brought about his execution or his death, but I am unable to tell you anything. 
@MR. BESNIER:
In this Chamber, we know of two Kararas.  Now the Karara you are referring to, would that be the former bourgmestre?
@A.
No.
@MR. BESNIER:
That is quite adequate.  Do you have any information about the place where your father was killed?  Was it within the same cellule, the one in which is located hiding place No. 2? 
@A.
Yes, it was in that cellule that he was killed. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you have had any information on the identity of those who killed your father? 
@A.
I was able to know the persons who were in the group of attackers, especially Everiste Baphakurera.  Baphakurera is spelt B-A-P-H-A-K-U-R-E-R-A, Baphakurera.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether someone by the name Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to that cellule that we have been referring to between the beginning of April 1994 and the end of June 1994? 
@A.
He came to Gasharu cellule at the very beginning of June, the first days of June he came to Gasharu. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you an eyewitness to his visit? 
@A.
I did not see him; I heard people talk about it. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Who told you?  Is it one of the -- if it is one of the persons whose name you have written on a piece of paper, you can say so.  If it is another person, then you can give us his name directly? 
@A.
He is the first name on the paper who gave me the information. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And this person who gave you the information, did he tell you what Emmanuel Ndindabahizi might have done or said during that visit? 
@A.
That person told us that Ndindabahizi told him that, "There are children hiding here.  Can I ask them to come out before the end of the war"?  And he said, "Wait".  But after his departure, we came out but we stayed within the compound, we did not go out. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Let's take it one at a time.  Witness, do you have any reason to think that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi knew that you were hiding there and knew where you were hiding? 
@A.
Yes, he knew because that person mentioned it to him and Ndindabahizi asked for explanations. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have reason to believe that Mr. Ndindabahizi approved the fact that you were hiding in that hiding place? 
@A.
Yes, I believe he accepted it because I didn't have any problem later on, not even after his departure. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have reason to believe that you were hiding in this second hiding place, hiding place No. 2, with the agreement of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, he had accepted it.  If he did not, we would have come out of our hiding place. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you know, to your knowledge, or based on discussion you had with other people, if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to this cellule on other occasions in April or May 1994? 
@A.
No, after June he did not come back. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A question was before, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether he was there before June in 1994? 
@THE WITNESS:
No.  No, he did not come. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
When were you able to leave your hiding place? 
@A.
It was around the 4th or 5th of July that I was able to come and wander about outside.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you able to walk around outside the house, but you were not able to -- did you come out directly from your hiding place and went outside? 
@A.
On the dates that I gave earlier in July, I wasn't going too far.  I was not -- I could walk about within the premises but on the dates that I gave, I would walk about even outside the compound. 
@MR. BESNIER:
When you were in this house, you said you were in a hiding place, what was this hiding place? 
@A.
I began by hiding inside the house.  It was after his departure that we came out and went into the house, and at the beginning of the month of July around the 4th or 5th, we were able to come out of the compound because the war was over and we were able to walk about outside. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I wanted to know what was the hiding place in the house, for example, when people came to search, were you in the house or did you have a corner, a particular place where you could hide? 
@A.
No, I was not in the house.  I was not in the room, I was in the house.  But if I say it, people might be able to know.  I could put it on a piece of paper, Counsel, if you so wish. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, were you inside the house or outside the house, just tell us that first?
@THE WITNESS:
I was hiding outside the building not inside the building but within the compound. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now you want to give us further particulars by writing the exact place on a piece of paper; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I want to do. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now have that document translated from Kinyarwanda.  Could we have that from the booth, English and French, please.  
While that is being done, Mr. Witness, when was your father killed, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
My father was killed downhill from the bar which is located near the Nyabahanga river.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When, can you tell us the month? 
@THE WITNESS:
He was killed during the last few days of the month of April. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any questions while this document is being translated? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you know when Tatiane Mukatabana died? 
@A.
She died on the same day. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know who killed her? 
@A.
I was not an eyewitness to her killing but I heard it was one Rukundakuvuga who killed her. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And your father, who killed him? I have already put this question to you, but can you repeat the answer? 
@A.
It was Everiste Baphakurera. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  Now let's come back to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Do you know or did you hear what Emmanuel Ndindabahizi did or say during his stay in the cellule that we referred to? 
@A.
From what I was told when he got to Gitaga, he asked the people who decimated members of his family.  Some people ran, but from that day, nobody died and the attackers no longer searched houses of people. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it not be possible, Witness, that on the contrary, Mr. Ndindabahizi went to that cellule to incite people to kill? 
@A.
No, that is not possible; that was not his purpose for coming there, otherwise he would have come to that cellule much earlier than that date. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it not be possible that he came to the cellule earlier without you knowing? 
@A.
That is not possible.  If he had come to that cellule he wouldn't have left before -- without saying hello to his sister and his sister would have been aware. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Witness, let's come back to the owner of a hiding place No.2 that we referred to.  Does that person have any blood relations with your father? 
@A.
Yes, there is family relationship between that person and my father. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And what is the nature of this relationship? 
@A.
Counsel, but if I answer your question, it would disclose my identity. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to write the nature of the relationship between your father and the owner of the house on the paper?  We do not want you to mention the name of the owner of that house, but if that can reassure you, write the nature of the relationship between that person and your father on the paper.
@A.
I will write it.

@MR. BESNIER:
I have three more questions for you, Mr. Witness.  Witness, did the investigators of the Prosecutor contact you after the genocide to find out from you the conditions under which your father died?
@A.
Yes, they contacted me.
@MR. BESNIER:
And did you tell them the same thing as what you said before this court?
@A.
Yes, that is what I told them.
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you ever been called as a Prosecution witness in any trial in Rwanda?
@A.
Yes, on one occasion I was called to testify against someone.
@MR. BESNIER:
And that occasion you are referring to, did it have anything to do with the killing of your father?
@A.
Yes.  Questions were put to us on the killing of our father, and on that occasion we went to Kibuye.
@MR. BESNIER:
In that case in Rwanda, the case you are referring to, did the name of Ndindabahizi come up?
@A.
No, the name of Ndindabahizi was not mentioned during that trial.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, you are a Tutsi, aren't you?
@A.
Yes, I am.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi here present is accused of having very important share of the responsibility in the killing of your father?  Are you aware of this?
@A.
That is not true.  I cannot come to testify in favour of somebody who killed my father.  It is obvious -- it's not possible that anyone would testify in favour of the person who murdered his father.  It's not possible.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it not be possible, Witness, that the Accused did this without your knowledge by inciting other people to do this without you knowing?
@A.
I would have known in any event, because Ndindabahizi has good relations with people and I would have known anyhow.
@MR. BESNIER:
Look me in the eyes, Witness, are you sure that Ndindabahizi had no hand in the killing of your father?  Have you conducted your investigations, and you can say with a clear conscience that you know Ndindabahizi had no hand in the killing of your father?
@A.
Yes, absolutely.  What I have said is the truth, Ndindabahizi played no role whatsoever in the death of my father.  He did not take part in the killing of my father because he was not present.

Hello, Mr. Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon, Prosecutor.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What do you do for a living now, Mr. Witness?  Tell me whether you work or you are a student, that sort of thing?
@A.
I do handwork here and there as a mason.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And are you currently married?
@A.
I am married.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How old were you in l994?
@A.
I was 12 years old.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you manage to complete your education?
@A.
I finished six-year primary school but one term after it.  That is after only one term of six-year primary school.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony that both your parents were killed in l994, is that not the case, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was your education funded from the year l994, the year you finished?
@A.
In Rwanda, the genocide survivors didn't pay fees for education.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But did you currently live on your own or did you live with someone else from 1994 until you got married?  How did you sustain yourself?
@A.
I still lived at the house where I survived.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you lived at house location No. 2, from the age of 12, in 1994 until the present time, is that not correct, Mr. Witness?
@A.
At present I live at my parent's but I do have my own house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I thought your parents died?  Can you help me with that, which parents do you live with?
@A.
I repaired the house that belonged to my parents and it is in that renovated house that I now live.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And as a 12- year old, where did you, after your parents were killed, up until you were able to renovate the house, that's what I want to know?
@A.
It was later on that I repaired the house.  We were given corrugated sheets and I found doors that I stored and I moved into that house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct but in l994 before you were old enough to find the corrugated sheets and move into the house, was it not the case that you continued to live in house No. 2, and, if so, tell us when you left the house?
@A.
I stayed at the house in which I survived, but my name was listed among people whose houses had been destroyed.  And before I repaired my parent's house, I continued to live in hiding place No. 2, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I want to know when you ceased to live at house No. 2, one year, six months ago, two months ago?  Help me to answer that, please?
@A.
It was in March 2001 that I left house No. 2 to move into my house.  It was at the time that I was to get married.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, that's what I thought, and whilst you lived in house No. 2, you lived there with the person whose name is on Defence Exhibit 20-- let me recall it, 21.  Is that not the case?  The two people you listed on Defence Exhibit 21, you lived in the same house with them, did you not?
@A.
Yes, that is correct, I still lived with those two people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many wives did your father have, Mr. Witness?  Just give me the number.  One, two, three, four, five?
@A.
My father had two spouses.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And how many siblings did you have in total, Mr. Witness?
@A.
We had a sister, three boys with the first wife.  We were four boys and one girl.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So four boys and one girl from the first wife, is that your testimony or in total, children your father had?
@A.
Yes, we were four boys.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now where is your sister today?
@A.
Are you referring to my sister that is still alive?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct.  Where is she?
@A.
My sister got married but she is still in our area, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So is it your testimony that she is in your area at the present time as we speak or is she elsewhere?
@A.
Yes, sir, she lives in our area.  They left the house of the husband to come and repair the parent's house where they now live.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall how old your sister was in l994, Mr. Witness?
@A.
The one who died, who came just after me, indeed she came just after me but I can't remember her age.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your father had one first wife.  Now from that marriage, is it the case that there were one sister and four boys you included, is that the result of the first marriage?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now that sister of the first marriage is she still alive or is she not still alive.
@THE WITNESS:
She died, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now this sister who is now married, living in our (sic) area, did she come from the second wife then, is that the situation?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, she is my half sister.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There were children, which other children were born from that other second marriage?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir there were two boys.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, Mr. Witness, you testified that you at some stage sought refugee at the location you described as house No. 1.  Now why isn't that mentioned in your statement?
@A.
I did not mention that house because I didn't stay there for a long time.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And why would you have to stay there at all, if you continued to stay at the house where you survived until very recently?  Why did you bother going to the first house at all?  It's not in your statement.
@A.
I did not talk about the first hiding place because I didn't stay there for a long time.  I only mentioned the hiding place where I stayed for a longer period of time, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The information in your statement is a little bit more intriguing, Mr. Witness, because in your statement, you state clearly that you have no specific information to give about the owner of house No. 1.  Don't you?  You actually speak about the owner of house No. 1 and you conclude your testimony in that regard by stating that you have nothing specific to tell us about him, is that not the case?
@A.
I do not have explanations to give concerning house No. 1; indeed, because when the situation got complicated I was no longer in that house.  All I can say is, those who occupied that house accompanied me to house No. 2, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it not the case, Mr. Witness, that the reason why you brought up staying in house No. 1 is because you know that that's where Tatiana stayed and you want us to believe that you know about Tatiana and what happened to her, is that not true, Mr. Witness?
@A.
No sir, that is not the reason.  As a matter of fact, it was not at that house that she was killed.  She was taken out of the house to be killed.  So, that couldn't have been the reason to prevent me from talking about that house.  No. 1, Tatiana was not killed in that house, she was taken out of that house to be killed outside, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You are extremely well informed, Mr. Witness, for a man who spent three months hiding under sorghum leaves in a location out of reach from house No. 1.  How do you know this?  Has anyone told you about the evidence in the Prosecution's case by any chance, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Nobody talked to me about it, sir, rather, as a matter of fact, nobody told me about the evidence that the Prosecutor's witness is to give or has given here in this court.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Apart from your father and the lady you mentioned staying at house No. 1, how many Tutsis to your knowledge, were killed in your cellule during the genocide?
@A.
The other Tutsis that died in our cellule were, as far as I am concerned, they were quite many because our cellule was in the majority, inhabited by Tutsi.  I cannot tell you all their names.  I can only tell you a few names, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's indeed very correct.  And, therefore, you must be particularly grateful to be alive, Mr. Witness, is that not the case?
@A.
Yes, sir, I thank God for being still alive.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Apart from thanking God, Mr. Witness, and being grateful to God, is it not also that you are also particularly grateful to the owner of house No. 2 and his relatives for saving your life, yes or no?
@A.
Yes, I am grateful to those people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No further questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@MR. BESNIER:
No further questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the sources of the information about your father's death come from Mr. Augustin Karara; is that so?
@THE WITNESS:
No, sir.  It was not Karara that told me about the death of my father.  It was the person that I mentioned in the piece of paper, that person gave me the information, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now that person -- from where did that person on the piece of paper get his or her information?
@THE WITNESS:
That person heard people shouting out and said:  "Well, the person has been found, the fellow has been found", and when that person heard people shouting out like that he came and told me, "Look, your father has been found".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to indicate any name or names of the persons that witnessed the death of your father and then informed the person on the piece of paper who then told you?
@THE WITNESS:
Regarding the persons that informed me, the person whose name I mentioned on the piece of paper, that I do not know.  That person on the piece of paper told me that he heard people shouting out the words that I have just repeated here before you, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the person on the piece of paper did not inform you who actually witnessed the killing of your father. Is that so?
@THE WITNESS:
That is true.  That person only heard people shouting out.  That person did not witness the killing of my father, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony has now come to an end.  We would like to thank you for having come a long way to Arusha to give a testimony and wish you a very safe journey home.  And please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.

I am worried about justice and we shall simply go to particulars that is addressed -- certain particulars and immediately go on to open session, Mr. President.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness, could you remind us and tell us how you learnt about the death of President Juvernal Habyarimana?
@A.
I learnt about it over the radio, Counsel.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you remember approximately at which date that was, Witness?
@A.
I do not remember the date, Counsel.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you remember the  -- what are the events -- what happened security wise during the day following the death of the president, what happened as far as security was concerned?
@A.
Now in the day following the death of the president, in our area people started killing cows, destroying houses, burning down houses and killing people.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you mean that looting erupted and massacres as well of people?
@A.
Yes, the massacre of the Tutsi.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now more precisely, who were the victims of such crimes?  You are saying that those that belonged to which ethnic group?
@A.
The Hutu were killing the Tutsi, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now to kill the Hutu - rather, to kill the Tutsi, one went to seek them in the houses or in the countryside, which is which?
@A.
First of all, the houses were destroyed and people ran away to hide in the bush.  It is there that they were found or sometimes they were found in neighbour's houses.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
My questions may rather be brutal compared to the compassion that you may need.  What were the arms used to kill the Tutsi, madam?  What sort of weapons were used?
@A.
They used machetes, clubs and even daggers.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you tell us as far as the Gasharu commune was concerned, where did the killers come from?
@A.
The killers came from the Kayengi sector among others, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The killer came from Kanyegi, were there killer that came from any other areas?
@A.
They came from all the areas.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you tell us as far as you were concerned, face to face with those killings since you are Tutsi, could you tell us what you did to avoid being killed?
@A.
I hid myself in the bush initially and then late a neighbour of mine hid me in his house or her house until the end of the war.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You hid in the bush alone or with members of your family?
@A.
Initially I was with my mother and my younger brother and then later when my mother was killed, I stayed with my younger brother, and then much later my younger brother was killed and one week after that, I met the assailants that took me to the Gitaka centre.  A neighbour called ... paid money
to the assailants for them to spare my life.  So that since day I went to that neighbour's house where I stayed.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, let us go over this chronology again, ma'am.  It is correct to say initially you hid in the bush with your mother; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And your younger brother?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And then very quickly, initially your mother was found, caught and killed?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Your younger brother and yourself were able to escape?
@A.
We stayed together in that hiding place.  And one week after that, my younger brother was arrested.  He was taken to the Gitaka centre.  He was thrown into a latrine -- into a cell that Karara was going to pull him out of the latrine.   And for that matter it was the same people that pulled him out of the latrine and killed him.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you mean that because they feared that Karara would save your younger brother they withdraw him from the latrine in which they had thrown him and then killed him?
@A.
Yes, they were afraid that Karara, who was a friend of the family, may save my younger brother.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, when was your mother killed, in which month?
@THE WITNESS:
April, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was she killed in the first half or the second half of April?
@THE WITNESS:
In the middle of the month of April.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now this incident with your brother, did that also happen in April?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was in April; there was one week between the two events.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So your brother and yourself were taken to the Gitaka village centre -- I'm trying to reconstitute the events  -- this is after you were flushed out of your hiding place, then comes in what you just told us about regarding how your brother was killed.  He was removed from the latrine and then killed, and you -- well, what happened to you, Madam Witness?
@A.
They arrested my brother but I was able to escape from them.  But later on I said to myself that it would be better for me to go and look for him.  And on my way I met a group of assailants who also took me to Gitaka centre.  And it was at that point in time that Karara gave money to the leader of the attackers.  They released me, and they said they were going to come back for me the following day to kill me but they didn't do so. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What happened to your father, Madam Witness, during this period of time?
@A.
During this period of time when I reached this neighbour's house, Karara's home, my father came there and I was able to see him.  And about two days later I learned that he too was killed.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
If I were to recount the event, would I be faithful to your retelling of the story that the death of your mother is placed in the first half of the month of April or even -- 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Who is the witness; who is testifying here, the witness or counsel?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I presume --  I think that when the witness answered my question she didn't really say the first half, so even if you are trying to recapitulate you must do it accurately.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So there were the death of three persons, Mr. President, the death of her mother, her brother and her father.  All I'm trying to do is place these events, which I believe all took place in the month of April, and I wanted some specifics in terms of chronology.  Even if that is disturbing the Prosecutor, we need to establish what the chronology of events is. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, can you please specify to me regarding these three events, the death of your mother, the death of your brother and the death of your father, I want you to tell us about them chronologically speaking?
@A.
There was space of one week between the three killings.  First of all my mother was killed, then my brother and finally my father; and between one event and the next there was a week.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
A moment ago --
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can I ask the following question, Mr. President, Your Honours?
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The death of your mother, you placed it a moment ago in the middle of April.  So, where would you place the death of your younger brother, would that be the third week of April, and the death of your father the last week of April; would that be correct, Madam Witness?
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You did not witness your father's death, so how were you --
@A.
It is true, I was not an eyewitness of my father's death.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
How were you then informed, and by whom, of your father's death?  How were you informed?
@A.
I was at Karara's house and it was Karara who told me that my father was dead.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did Karara -- well, without going into detail, did he tell you how your father was killed?
@A.
He told me that my father had been arrested and that he had been clubbed to death.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
From what Karara said or through investigations that you yourself may have made, do you know who killed your father?
@A.
Yes, I know that my father was killed by Évariste Bapfukurera.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And where was he killed?
@A.
He was killed at the Gitaka centre.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Does that mean that he was found at the Gitaka centre and killed there or was he brought there to be killed?
@A.
He was found in the bush where he was hiding and he was taken to the Gitaka centre, and that is where he was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this Karara, what was his position in society?
@THE WITNESS:
Karara was a farmer and at the same time he was a trader.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And throughout these events of April, May 1994 did you lose any other members of your family, Madam Witness?
@A.
Yes, I lost other members of my family, in particular my paternal uncles.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, do you know the Accused, Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
The last time I saw him I was very young; I'm not sure I would be able to recognise him today.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you see him during the events of any 1994?
@A.
I heard it said that he had come.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you be a bit more specific, Madam Witness?  You heard it said that he came when, Madam Witness, when did he come?
@A.
He came in the beginning of the month of June; that is what I was told.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Would I be correct in saying that this was more than one death -- one month or at least one month between the death of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) and the arrival of Ndindabahizi at Gitaka?
@A.
Yes, he came after my father's death.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We do now have to delete the reference to the name.  So the reference to the name of the person killed will be deleted from the Court video system and it will be placed under seal in the transcripts.  Please be careful.
Yes, please proceed.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, you were told about the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the beginning of June, 1994.  Were you also told about Mr. Ndindabahizi's reaction to what had happened, to what was happening and the questions that he asked?
@A.
I was told that he came and that when he reached the Gitaka centre he was saddened to learn that people had been killed, and he had asked why people were killing others.  He was shown a man known as Gatete and he ordered that the man be arrested, but that man was able to escape.  At that point in time there was another man called Karara, and Mr. Ndindabahizi arrested this Mr. Karara and took him away for him to be imprisoned.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Am I correct in saying that Mr. Ndindabahizi was angry when he learned of the deaths committed against Tutsis?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Am I correct in saying that he had tried to bring about the arrest of those who had killed Tutsis?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this Karara that was arrested, is this the same Karara that you referred to previously in your statement or a different one?
@THE WITNESS:
It was the same, one and the same, Karara.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, in your written statement you said the following to the investigators, and I am quoting:  "It is absurd to state that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi can have any kind of responsibility whatsoever in the crimes committed in our region."
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you confirm that what you said about Emmanuel Ndindabahizi being accused of such crimes would be absurd?
@A.
For me they are lies.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You also state that you yourself and members of your family, your parents and some of your brothers and sisters, were victims of the genocide.  And you said that you've heard mention made of that, yet you say Ndindabahizi was innocent of the crimes or the allegations made against him.
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
After the war a certain number of investigations were carried out; was Ndindabahizi -- was Ndindabahizi's name ever mentioned regarding the genocide?
@A.
I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel; can you repeat it for me, please?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I withdraw that question.  
Madam Witness, your family -- you are from a farming family.  What are the traditional tools agricultural tools used by Hutu and Tutsi farmers, traditionally?
@A.
Rwandan cultivators use hoes and machetes to tow the land.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
One last question, Madam Witness; do you think it is reasonable to say that in April, May, 1994 a Tutsi woman could go on foot, even in hiding, from Gitesi to Kibirizi?
@A.
That was not possible.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Is it reasonable or possible for a Tutsi woman to make purchases at a market place during this period of time in 1994 and particularly in Kibirizi?
@A.
That was not possible.

@A.
Good afternoon, Counsel.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know why Tutsis were being sought in Rwanda in 1994?
@A.
Tutsis were being sought because of their ethnicity.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you carry an identity card in 1994, Madam Witness?
@A.
I didn't have one.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how Tutsis were identified in 1994 apart from the use of identity cards?
@A.
For those who had identity cards, they were checked, but for those who didn't, they could be identified because they were known.  It was known that this person or this child was a Tutsi; that was the only way of identifying anyone.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Could Tutsis also be identified by their facial attributes and features in 1994, as far as you know?
@A.
When you reached a region which was not your own and if you didn't have an identity card on which it was said that you were Hutu, you could be killed because of your physical features.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would you describe yourself, Madam Witness, as having typical Tutsi features?
@A.
All people look alike.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is that a yes or a no to my -- answer to my question, Madam Witness?
@A.
I told you that all people look alike; there is very little difference between individuals, so one cannot say that one person is Hutu and another is Tutsi on the basis only of physical traits.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, you were 17-years old in 1994, were you not?
@A.

And since the genocide, would I be correct in saying that you have moved on with your life and gone on to do other things, including getting married?
@A.
Yes.

Would I also be correct in saying that following the death of your parents, the unfortunate death of your parents in 1994, certain individuals assumed responsibility for your upkeep; could I be correct in saying that?

@A.
I used to take refuge in his house and sometimes he would take me to his trading place, where he conducted his trading activities, and come back.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was he able to do that without risking your life, Madam Witness?
@A.
We used to move during the night.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The trading centre was open at night, Madam Witness?
@A.
We would go through the bush along the road and then we would get to the centre.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And whilst you were at this centre, did you only operate your business at night or did you do it in daytime?
@A.
You mean, for me to hide at the centre? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't know what you were doing at the centre.  You help me with that.  What were you doing there?
@A.
He used to take me there and keep me in a house.  In fact, it was a trick to hide me and people did not suspect that I could be hiding there.  So he would keep me in a house, and when people heard that I was in that house at the centre, he would take me away from there to his house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you criss-crossed between  ...'s house and the centre throughout the months of April, May of and June?
@A.
Yes, that is what we did.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Why did Mr. ...  go out of his way to protect you at this time and have to ferry you from his house to the centre?  Why did he go out of his way to do that?

They lived very well and had no problem between them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Why then was it, Madam Witness, in your opinion, that Ndabukiye and Karara were not able to protect your father?  Why were they not able to protect him in 1994?
@A.
I'm unable to explain to you how people changed during that period. What I know is that Karara did his best and ... ... ... . 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, we didn't hear.  There was a rectification from there.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Madam Witness, could you repeat your answer, please.  We're having some problems in getting your answer across.
@A.
...  hid me.  And I cannot tell you what Ndabukiye was thinking; I can only say that he changed during that period.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What do you mean by stating that Ndabukiye changed during that period?  Can you help us with that, please?
@A.
Ndabukiye did not give refuge to anybody, and even my brother who took refuge in his house, he chased him out subsequently, and my brother had to go and live with a women that I referred to earlier.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That being the case, do you know whether Ndabukiye had any hand in your father's death?
@A.
I wouldn't know.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You describe him as a changed man who chased your younger brother out of your house at some stage.  Would it have been possible, would it have been possible for him, Madam Witness, for him to have a hand in your father's death, in your opinion?
@A.
You know, during the war, any person who gave refuge to a Tutsi person was afraid of either being killed or being looted.  Probably that was why my brother was chased away, because he probably thought that if my brother was discovered he would lose his property.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The location where your half-brother eventually ended up, why was he not chased out of that location, do you know?
@A.
I don't know, but I believe these were people who had pity of him and were very kind people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You must consider yourself extremely lucky to be alive after the events of 1994, Madam Witness.
@A.
Yes, indeed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You must feel particularly grateful to the men and women who went out of their way to save your life; is that not the case?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.  I'm grateful to these people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When you eventually got married to your husband, did somebody give you away, as is traditionally the case in Africa?  Did you have representatives from your family who gave you away, stood in place for your parents?
@A.
It was my maternal uncle who survived the genocide.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you ever know who killed your mother in 1994?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you also find out who killed your younger brother in 1994?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Have you been able to testify in the trials of any of these people in Rwanda?
@A.
No.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you intend to do so at a future stage, Madam Witness?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What are you going to base that testimony on, if and when you do so?  Are you going to tell that court that you were an eyewitness to those killings, or are you going to tell that court that you were told that they were involved in their death?  What do you intend to do?
@A.
I'll tell the court that I got information regarding the circumstances of their death.  I will not say that I was an eyewitness.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how many Tutsis were killed in Gasharu cellule in 1994, Madam Witness?
@A.
There are very many, and I wouldn't know of the exact figure.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And are you able to tell us how you came to be a witness for the Defence in this case?  Did anybody ask you to come to Arusha and, if so, who and when?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know who asked you to come here?  Do you want to write it down or do you want to tell me?
@A.
The person who asked me?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes. 
@A.
The person who contacted us is called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  And I -- would I be correct in saying that that person that you've just mentioned is the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?  Just yes or no, don't expand any further.
@A.
Are you referring to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I am.  Just confirm whether I would be right in saying --
@A.
It's (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  It's the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) the Accused person in this case, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for being so kind. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, if I could enter this piece of paper as Prosecution Exhibit -- it would be two exhibits.  Actually, we could do it in one.  We have one name on one side which belongs to her husband, and we have the name of the lady with whom she lived until she got married, and that person's relationship to the Accused on one side. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe we could make two copies, and on the one have OTP Exhibit 31.  Will that settle the dispute?  That is the relationship?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's the name of the lady with whom she lived until she got married.  And also on that page is that person's relationship to the Accused.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And then on the other sheet would be the name of the witness's husband.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and that would be No. 32, and both under seal.
$Exhibit Nos. P. 31 and P. 32 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe the last interchange should also be under seal, between you and the witness.  
So, court register video system, if you will delete that last reference when it comes to the link between the person who asked the witness to testify and the relationship to the Accused.  
Any re-examination? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Just one question, Mr. President.      
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, your conviction of the conduct of Mr. Ndindabahizi during the genocide, Prosecutor is trying to link that to the fact that the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) of Ndindabahizi gave you shelter.  Will this conviction not, rather, flow from the totality of the information that you were able to gather on the conduct of Mr. Ndindabahizi, on information that you got, research that you conducted, which enabled you to assert that we're all victims of this genocide?  We're in a better position to know the perpetrators, and I can assure that you Mr. Ndindabahizi is not one of them.  Is this conviction this, and not a way of saying thank you, as it is being inferred?
@A.
It is not because somebody gave me shelter, who is related to him.  I'm saying this because when he came he was very shocked by the killing of the people, and he was very angry.  And they showed him one person who had killed a lot of people and he asked that person to be arrested, but that person fled.  But subsequently he had Karara arrested, had him detain.  But for me, this is evidence that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi did not have any responsibility in the genocide.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You came to testify -- did you come to testify to tell the truth or to show your gratitude?
@A.
I came here to tell the truth about the event that I experienced and events that I heard about. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Again, the reference to the person who lived in the house must be placed under seal and struck from the video system. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
We seek a short clarification from you, Madam Witness.  ... had sheltered you; is that right?  Is this the same ... who was accused of killing, and later on arrested by the Accused?
@THE WITNESS:
It is the same person who was detained.  But later on he got to know that they were false accusations against ... and he had been released.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You said that your husband was a Hutu; is that right?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Is he in any way related to the Accused?
@THE WITNESS:
No, no blood relation.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Are you related to the Accused?  If so, could you please write it down for us, your relationship with him.
@THE WITNESS:
They were related, but it's a distant relation.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Who was related?  You and the Accused?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  It is said that my (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
@JUDGE KHAN:
You mean to say that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I suppose we have to place that under seal as well.  So that will be done and struck from the record. 
Madam Witness, who told you who killed your father?
@THE WITNESS:
It was Karara.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How did he know?
@THE WITNESS:
It was Karara who had him buried.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Karara present during the killing of your father?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know if he was present or not.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is your source for saying that Évariste Bapfakurera was one of your father's killers?
@THE WITNESS:
It's because he pleaded guilty in the Rwandan courts, and he accepted that he committed this crime.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that when he found out that he was one of the killers, when you heard about his conviction?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was when he confessed that I got to know.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
^Before then, you did not know?
@THE WITNESS:
I did not know.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When did he confess?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know, but I was told that he confessed his guilt.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
^Before the normal Rwandan courts or some other mechanism?
@THE WITNESS:
I heard he admitted that he killed my father.  That is what I know.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know whether he confessed before the courts, or have you only heard that he has admitted it? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was before judges.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When were you told about this?
@THE WITNESS:
His testimony is even available.  This was a while ago, and I can therefore not remember the year nor the month.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you talking about two years ago, four years ago, six years ago? 
@THE WITNESS:
You mean, since I got this information, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, that's the question, exactly.
@THE WITNESS:
I think it must have been eight or nine months ago since I got this information.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you heard Judge Khan ask you about Mr. ... and she asked you whether ... was the same person, on the one hand the person who sheltered you, and on the other hand the man whom Mr. Ndindabahizi sought or ordered arrested.  Did you say that he was the same person? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was the same person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why would this person on the one hand be a Tutsi-saver and on the other hand be ordered arrested by Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@THE WITNESS:
These were persons who spoke to Ndindabahizi and Ndindabahizi caused his arrest, had him detained.  But it was when he got to know later on that these were false accusations against ..., 
who just spent one day in prison, he had him released.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But why did Ndindabahizi order this person arrested?
@THE WITNESS:
Ndindabahizi was told that ... was involved in the killings.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The killings of whom? 
@THE WITNESS:
Of Tutsis.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When did he order his arrest? 
@THE WITNESS:
The same day he arrived.  When he arrived on that same day, he had him arrested, and took him away for detention.  And a day later he was released.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this all happened in June '94?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Madam Witness.  Your testimony --
@THE WITNESS:
I would like to thank you too, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony has come to an end.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much, and do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you. 
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$Witness excused) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This will bring us to the end of the day also.  
And tomorrow, Defence, we start with DL? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, in fact, Mr. President, I'm in a position to give some information to the Court on the proceedings.  We currently have 13 witnesses here in Arusha.  We have called four.  Things are moving very fast and that's very good.  Out of the 13 witnesses, we have seen and prepared eight.  The Defence team has not yet met the remaining five.  Other witnesses should be arriving at the end of the week, and the expert can come here only from the 17th of November.  If tomorrow we are able to hear four witnesses, we would have heard all the witnesses that we've prepare, and we would need a day or two to meet the remaining witnesses.  Therefore, I think that if we are able to hear four witnesses tomorrow, to adjourn for a day or two, or a day and a half, to enable us to meet other witnesses so that before the end of the week we could hear other witnesses.  Today, I can say that we'll be able to hear ten witnesses in the course of the week.  It is possible that we would need a day of Thursday, Wednesday or Thursday, to be able to prepare the witnesses that we intend to hear on Friday.  Will this be agreeable to the Court?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if you do not have more witnesses, there is no choice.  But as I indicated previously, this is exactly the situation that the Court would wish to prefer -- to avoid.  Now, but what we note now is that we have four witnesses for tomorrow, and that is very well and good, and then let's see how it proceeds from then.  But I'm a bit worried about next week.  How many witnesses do you have for next week? 
@MR. BESNIER:
The week after, it would depend on how many witnesses we are able to call this week.  We are going to call Witnesses 9, 14, 15, 16, and 17, plus possibly some witnesses who are already here that we have not yet heard.  But here I would not like to make any pronouncements on that.  In any event, 
Mr. President, we have sufficient witnesses for next week.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So that's where we are now.  Thank you very much for that clarification.  And, tomorrow, could you just indicate the order for the four witnesses, tomorrow.  Will you do that, please, the ones you have already had occasion to interview, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Tomorrow we would hear Witnesses DL, DU, DV and DB.  In other words, we are respecting the order as set out in the list.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That's very helpful.  Thank you very much, indeed.  
So the Court is adjourned until tomorrow at 8:30.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  There was a slight delay because of some practical problems, but I understand that they have been sorted out. 
This is the opening of the Defence case.  Is there anything the Chamber should be apprised of?  I see that there are some documents in front of us.  Do you want to introduce them, Maître Besnier? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have transmitted to the Chamber a bound document which is the list of witnesses as well as their identifications -- with their identification forms and their written statements.  You'll also find in this bundle of documents a list of exhibits that we intend to put in to support the Accused's defence of alibi.  It also includes a copy of the statement of the expert witness that we intend to call at the end of our case. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now, you have here on page 2 of this document -- I can see a priority list of 1 to 20.  Is that the order in which you intend to call these witnesses? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  That is the order in which we intend to call the witnesses.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We will start with Witness DJ?

Yes, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  If there is nothing else to be said from either side, could we then call Witness DJ, please? 
Do you intend to make an opening statement, Mr. Besnier, before we call Witness DJ? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  I think I can make the opening statement before the witnesses are called.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Please go ahead. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, in April, May and June 1994, Rwanda was inhabited by demons.  This sentence is not from survivors or from history books; it was said at 25th October, last 25th October, by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi when I visited him at the detention centre.  In April, May and June 1994, death lurked in the hills of Kibuye.  Yet all the Hutus did not become demons, even if all the Tutsis were potential victims.  Several Hutus themselves fell under the true barbarism, others did the best they could under the circumstances to save lives, to preserve their dignity or simply to protect their family. 
It is one of the tasks of the Defence before this Court to demonstrate that the Accused was one of those who went through hell without losing their dignity, those who faced up to their responsibilities, these civil servants who remained at their posts to ensure the survival of the state, without their work, meaning their support for killings, without their signature at the bottom of an administrative document, meaning their signing up to a crime. 
Defence is not obligated to supply evidence; in law, it should simply draw the attention of the Judges to the doubts which attend the demonstration of the Prosecutor, and we believe that at this very stage, the charges brought against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi are not solid and true.  But in the case at bar, the Defence will go beyond refuting the evidence of the Prosecutor. 
We on this side of the courtroom are not afraid to face up to the facts.  And let's keep to the facts.  It is a judicially -- judicially proven truth, since the judgement of this Tribunal on 21st May 1999, in the Kayishema case, that tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed in the Kibuye préfecture.  It is a fact, judicially proven, that a great number of them were collectively killed at the Gatwaro stadium on the 18th April 1994. It is also a fact, judicially proven, that several survivors took refuge in the Bisesero region and were massively exterminated, particularly on the 13th and 14th May 1994. 
The suspects of these killings were sought and arrested by the Rwandan authorities as well as the Prosecutor of the ICTR.  Some were sentenced.  The judicial records of these proceedings cover several thousands of pages, witnesses were heard for hundreds of hours, and in the ICTR, five judgments have been rendered, covering more than 800 detailed information on the Kibuye killings.  But is it not strange that the name of Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, never appeared in these proceedings, not in Rwanda and not in the ICTR? 
In the case that I referred to, more than 100 Prosecution witnesses were called, and they testified against a number of people, outside the Accused, but never this man.  Dozens of businessmen, bourgmestres, low-level civil servants, were accused and names were revealed, their roles were specified in the case of this event, and never was the name of the Minister of Finance mentioned. 
Is it not strange that while -- that according to the Prosecutor, his presence alone will amount to incitement to kill?  Is it not also -- does this not cast doubt on the fact that -- is there not doubt in the fact that this man was accused only seven years after the events, whereas he was regularly in contact, and for several years, with the investigators of the Prosecutor?  Is it not curious to see the Prosecutor, a few weeks before the trial, divest Ndindabahizi of his political position and to retain against him the simple crime of individual responsibility?  Is it not surprising that observers, experts, historians, specialists of genocide and human rights, never mentioned the name of Ndindabahizi, never write his name, whereas they do not -- they always mention individuals whose functions were less important than his?  Even Madam Alison Des Forges, who did not honestly answer the only question I put to her, never wrote the name of the Accused, never once, not even once, in her book, which is an authority,  "Leave None to Tell the Story." 
Are these not objective elements of doubt, even before we start examining the evidence of the Prosecutor, which we are going to be doing at another stage? 
In Rwanda, on the crime sites, names -- which the names are familiar to you -- Gasharu, Gitaka, Gitwa -- nobody accuses Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Preliminary reports on the massacres perpetrated in Kibuye, the first of which was published in 1996 by the Rwandan minister of higher education, does not mention his name anywhere, whereas dozens of suspects are mentioned.  On the hills, nobody does not take serious these charges brought against him, and I do not think that the witnesses or the Prosecutor themselves believe in that.  You don't have to limit yourselves to my assertions.  The witnesses, our witnesses, in the days ahead are going to be called before you. 
The first batch of them are mainly Tutsis, genocide survivors.  Their names or their parents' names are known to you.  They are sons and daughters of persons who have been assassinated and who Prosecution witnesses have already made mention to.  You will then be able to finally put faces to the victims.  Before you, and before the Accused, these people, whose families sometimes have been killed, will tell you what they think about the charges brought against Ndindabahizi. 
Other witnesses are well-placed to know the truth.  They themselves are the killers.  Most of them have pleaded guilty. 
I pray the Court to allow me to bring this evidence before you, because sometimes the recounting of these facts are difficult, but it is a necessary state to finding the truth. 
In April, May, June 1994, death was in the hills of Kibuye, and I did not see the face of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi there. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Besnier.  I have two questions for you in light of your opening statement.  The first question relates to the matter that none of the witnesses in previous cases have referred to Mr. Ndindabahizi.  That sentence, does that refer to the finding in the five judgments which you referred to, namely, the Kibuye judgements, or does that statement refer to their testimony also in the transcripts?  That's one question. 
And the second question was your reference to Alison Des Forges.  There you said that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi's name does not figure in her book.  Her answer was that it didn't figure in the registry, in the registry of the book, in the index, but that she wanted to reserve her position because there may be mistakes in the index.  So your statement, does that imply that you have checked the book itself and that you have not found any reference to Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  On the first issue, we have carefully examined judgements which have been rendered in the case of Kibuye and we realise that Ndindabahizi's name never appeared in these judgments.  We then looked at the transcripts, and witness statements.  I'm not asserting that we have absolutely checked all the transcripts of the testimony of witnesses.  We have gone through some of them and I believe that should account for about half of the testimony, and I'm sure the name of Ndindabahizi does not appear therein. 
Regarding the second question, Mr. President, we have also carefully examined the totality of 
Madam Alison Des Forges's book and not only the index, and I can assure you that the name of Ndindabahizi does not appear therein, not even when the expert is talking about the formation of the interim government. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Then I suppose this is the right moment to call the first witness.  Registry, could you please call Defence Witness DJ. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Your Honour, so far as the judgement (sic) is concerned, there is something concerning Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence that I should like to mention.  As far as that witness is concerned, she will talk about things that occurred in a small cellule of the Kibuye préfecture.  It's a cellule where she always lived in, and she lives there still, and it's a location of crimes described in the indictment.  Now, the person we are referring to could be easily identified.  That person is one of the survivors, and there are not many survivors from that préfecture -- from that cellule, but I do remember that the Prosecutor, on the basis of these very same circumstances, had applied for a sitting in camera, which was granted.  I shall therefore question the witness concerning the location at which the witness was, and probably these questions may reveal the witness's identity, so that I will be compelled to apply for a sitting in camera for this particular witness as compared to the others.  We shall try to limit ourselves in time to ensure that the sitting in camera is done properly, but I would not be able to assure you that we will exhaust all the questions in this sitting in camera, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, your application for the closed session under Rule 79, does it apply to the entire testimony of the witness, because of the particular nature of the evidence, or are you only saying that you want to start in closed session? 
@MR. BESNIER:
I shall try for as much as possible to limit the closed session.  I shall try to finish with the closed session and go on to more general questions, but I'm not quite sure this will be possible, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problems, Prosecution? 
Could you indicate approximately for how long we would have to close this session so that the public could come back again at a certain time?  Approximately? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, 45 minutes, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that indication.  
Well, I must say then that we have to close this session in pursuance of Rule 79, but you have heard the indication of Mr. Besnier, and we will open as far as this will be possible in the interests of the witness.  So Registry, make sure that the public gallery is being closed.  Thank you very much.

Who informed you of the existence of a roadblock in Gasharu cellule?
@A.
It was **********; in other words --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has mentioned the relationship between himself.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please remember that we are in a closed session, so you never, for instance, mention names of your close relatives.  Now, please proceed.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
From your observation, Mr. Witness, what did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi do or say during his visit to that cellule?
@A.
When he came into the cellule he made the killings to be stopped.  He asked the members of the population why they were killing people.  He even arrested one person, one man, and put him in detention.  And this person was put into detention because it had been said that that person had killed people; Ndindabahizi had been informed of that.  And from that day onward no one else was killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you, yourself, remember the date on which you left your hiding place?
@A.
I was hiding in two different places.  I left the first hiding place in the beginning of June after Ndindabahizi's departure from the cellule, and I left the second hiding place on the 4th of July.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the cellule you were living in, were there any other Tutsi survivors?
@A.
Yes, there are.
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you had discussions as genocide survivors regarding the events that took place in Rwanda in 1994?
@A.
Yes, we speak a lot about these events.
@MR. BESNIER:
From the end of the war did you ever hear the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi mixed with killings, or did you ever hear his name being mentioned as being a perpetrator of whatever crimes during the genocide?
@A.
No.  Sometimes on the radio one hears that he is in prison, but we are saying that these allegations are false.  His name has never been involved with any responsibility whatsoever for crimes committed during the genocide.

@MR. BESNIER:
And your father was indeed killed during the genocide, was he not?
@A.
Yes, he was.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are there any reasons why you would wish to be testifying on behalf of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and not necessarily have anything to do with the respect for the truth?
@A.
Could you please repeat your question, Counsel?
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you have any personal reasons for defending Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, despite the fact that you are a Tutsi and that you were nonetheless a genocide survivor?
@A.
Yes, I do have reasons, and the reason is that I am defending him because if he hadn't come to the cellule all the Tutsis who survived would not have remained alive.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.

Mr. President, Your Honours, I have no further questions.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi visited Gasharu cellule in the month of June 1994 and not before then in 1994?
@A.
Actually, Ndindabahizi visited the cellule in the beginning of June.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, that's what I thought you said.  How come is it then that the Tutsis alive owed their good fortune to him?  The last thing you said a few minutes ago was that he -- his intervention saved the lives of Tutsi.  Now, at the beginning of June, how many Tutsi who were alive were walking the streets of Gasharu?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
After Ndindabahizi's departure, there were Tutsis who were still alive in Gasharu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, certainly.  And I'm sure those Tutsis were walking around, walking through roadblocks, were they not, Mr. Witness?
@A.
No.  As for moving around, around roadblock (sic), nobody would go there, but in July all Tutsis could come out of their houses.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  And that's thanks to Mr. Ndindabahizi, is it not, as far as you are concerned?
@A.
Yes, with regard to our cellule that is indeed my statement.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Mr. Witness, how old were you in 1994, in April 1994?
@A.
I think I was 22 years old.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you were certainly aware that Tutsis were being sought following the president's death in April 1994, are you not?
@A.
Could you please repeat your question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Will do.  Were you aware, Mr. Witness, that Tutsis were sought following the death of the president in Rwanda in 1994?  Were you aware of this fact?
@A.
Yes, I knew.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know why Tutsis were being sought at this time, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Could you please repeat that question for me?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you have any idea, Mr. Witness, why those Tutsis were being sought in 1994?
@A.
Tutsis were being pursued because there was a government which hated Tutsi, but all the government members were not harbouring the same hatred for Tutsi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was Ndindabahizi a member of that government, by any chance?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was he a member of that government from April 1994 until July 1994, to your knowledge?
@A.
Yes, he was part of that government.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you have any discussion with him between April and July 1994 as to how he felt about Tutsis?
@A.
No, I didn't converse with him on that subject.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So how are you able to tell us that he was not against Tutsis?
@A.
Can you please repeat the question for me, because I think there is background noise which is prohibiting me from hearing you properly?  I am please requesting you to repeat your question for me.  I didn't quite understand you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you hear me now?
@MR. BESNIER:
We do indeed hear background noise which is very disturbing.  We cannot really hear the Prosecutor's questions.  Can the technician please come to our aid?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have that sorted out?  There was a little dash of noise also in the English for a moment.
@THE WITNESS:

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry.  Now, is everything more quiet now?  If we all hear, let's proceed.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, Mr. Witness, did you speak to Mr. Ndindabahizi between April and July 1994 about his feelings for Tutsis?
@A.
As for any discussion whatsoever regarding ethnic groups, I do not believe that Ndindabahizi said at any moment whatsoever when he was sharing a glass with other people that he was against any such group or other.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You haven't answered my question.  I will ask you that question again: did you speak with Mr. Ndindabahizi about his feelings for Tutsis between April and July 1994; a simple yes or no?
@A.
I did not discuss that matter with him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you, yourself, a member of the cabinet of the government of Rwanda between April and July 1994?
@A.
I cannot clearly understand your question.  Can you repeat it?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you work for the government, yourself, between April and July 1994?
@A.
No, I was not a leader.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you attend any cabinet meetings between April and July 1994, Mr. Witness?
@A.
No.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You described that government that was in power between April and July 1994 as a government that hated Tutsi and that not everybody in that government hated Tutsi.  How are you able to come to that conclusion?
@A.
No.  What you are saying is not true.  I am not the one who said that.  I said that government existed, and I added that not all members of that government had evil intentions towards the Tutsis.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Wasn't it your testimony in this courtroom only two minutes ago that that government hated Tutsis; yes or no?
@A.
Up until this minute that I'm speaking to you, I am confirming that not all members of that government hated Tutsis.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you were able to come to that conclusion because you, yourself, in fact, were a member of that government, were you not?  You sat down through their meetings, deliberated with them, therefore, you are able to come to that conclusion, Mr. Witness.  Is that not your testimony?
@A.
Relying on what Ndindabahizi said when he came into our cellule, I'm able to assert that all members of the then government were not against the Tutsi because when he came into the cellule he asked them to stop the killings.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You have only come here to tell us a pack of lies this morning, have you not, Mr. Witness?  You were not at that meeting were you?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which meeting?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The meeting he has just referred to.  He referred to the meeting, himself, and he knows the meeting he is talking about.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we in June now?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no idea.  I am about to find out, Your Honour, if he would answer my question in due course.
@THE WITNESS:
I have not lied.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  Now, you said that, based on what he said when he came to Gasharu, you came to the conclusion that he was not against Tutsi.  Is that not what you mean?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
All right.  So there was only one meeting, according to you.  Your testimony is that you only saw him once there.  Is that not your testimony; you only came there once in June, in the beginning of June 1994?
@A.
Yes, that is my testimony.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good.
@A.
And he organised a meeting to stop the killings, but not to encourage them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  And you attended that meeting from your position in **************************, several metres away, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Those who attended that meeting can testify to it, but I did not attend that meeting because I was in hiding.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, if you did not attend the meeting, how can you testify as to what was said at the meeting?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
Let me try to explain to you: those who attended the meeting -- among those who attended the meeting there was a brother of Ndindabahizi, *****************************************what was said at the meeting and when he was telling me this, Ndindabahizi was with him.  Ndindabahizi *********  ******* and then -- and said that from that day on no one was to kill the Tutsi.  And it was his sister who was telling me what Ndindabahizi told her.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I understand that, Mr. Witness.  So why isn't that brother of his sitting in the box where you are now, telling us about what he heard his brother saying?  Why are we having to rely on your evidence?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
I don't seem to understand you.  Can you repeat your question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You said that you based your information on what you were told by Ndindabahizi's brother after the meeting.  Do you understand me thus far?
@A.
Yes, I understand.  Ndindabahizi himself *************************************************************that no one should kill the Tutsi, once again, and that, "I do not want people to continue killing the Tutsi".  My impression -- I did not understand the last part of your question.  If you want to repeat that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you understood every question put to you by my learned colleague for the Defence, did you not?
@A.
Yes, I understand your questions, but I just want you to repeat this last one.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, so that you can think about the answer in your head before you speak it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is the question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm still waiting for an answer to my question.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I want the answer -- I want your question again, Mr. Phillips, please.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, were you, or were you not, at the meeting that Ndindabahizi addressed in June 1994?
@A.
I was not at that meeting and the reason for which I did not attend that meeting was that I was in hiding.  I also told you that the brother of Ndindabahizi attended that meeting and that in the company of Ndindabahizi ****************************************.  Ndindabahizi spoke to the sister, telling her that from that moment on no one was going to kill Tutsi anymore.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yeah, right.  And this was in June 1994, was it not?  Just yes or no would do.
@A.
That is correct; at the beginning of June.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is your testimony that all the Tutsi who survived in Gasharu thereafter owed their survival to this man, Mr. Ndindabahizi, is it not, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, that is my testimony.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good.  Now, how many witnesses for the Defence have you met or do you know personally, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I did not understand your question.  Are you talking about Defence witnesses, and for which Defence?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is only one Defence in this courtroom, and you know it, Mr. Witness.  How many Defence witnesses do you know?
@A.
I believe I met seven of them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's a substantial amount of witnesses.  Do you know how many witnesses are in this case, in total?
@A.
I cannot know the number of witnesses.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that there are indeed seven witnesses from the location where you hail from in this Defence case; there are actually seven of you from that location?  I don't want to mention the location, but I am trusting that you understand what I'm talking about; the cellule.
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that you had a hand in inviting those seven persons, or six persons including yourself, to be witnesses in this case?
@A.
No, I'm not the one who looked for these witnesses.  However, let me give you this explanation: in the search for the witnesses that you are referring to, I saw some white people come who were investigating into the Ndindabahizi case.  They asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi.  I said yes.  I told them how I knew him and they asked me if there were other people who could say the same thing that I was saying and I said, yes, there were people in my cellule who would be able to say the same thing.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you know if any of those seven persons that come from your cellule have any prior relationship with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, relationship either by blood or by marriage?  Do you have any idea if any of those seven individuals had a relationship with him?
@A.
*********************************************************************************people have the relationship with Ndindabahizi.  Now regarding the others, out of the seven, they don't have any relationship with Ndindabahizi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's your evidence, Mr. Witness, isn't it?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now let's go to your location during the events of 1994, April 1994.  It's your testimony, Mr. Witness, that you were **************************.  Is that not so?
@A.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And is it also your testimony, Mr. Witness, that you remained at that location until sometime in June 1994?
@A.
I remained in that house.  In fact, I told you that, first, I was hiding in the ceiling, and when the situation became worse I came out and I was hidden under sorghum stems in the compound, and I only came out of this hiding place when Ndindabahizi reassured the people, and then I went back to the house and I only came out of that house in July, more specifically 4th July, and that was when I started moving about in the neighbourhood.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Now, do you remember where Cyprien Karegeya was killed, according to your information?
@A.
He apparently was killed in the centre of Gitaka, according to the information I got.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And, roughly, how far away was that location from where you were located, in distance now?  Don't mention names, just the distance.
@A.
Approximately one kilometre from the centre to where I was; the distance was about one kilometre.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you are one kilometre away from the alleged crime scene, hiding in a ceiling or under sorghum grass or whatever you call it, and you, to the best of your knowledge, believed that everything that you were told about the death of Karegeya was true and reliable enough for you to repeat it here.  Do you think so?
@A.
That is true and I'm ready to swear on that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let's talk about Mukantabana.  Do you know where she was killed?
@A.
I also learnt that he was allegedly killed at the Gitaka centre.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Again, a kilometre away from where you were located, was it not?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, in your statement you describe that you were an eyewitness to Higiro's death, Simon.  Do you recall saying that in your statement, or was that a mistake?
@A.
Let me give you an explanation.  I told you that I saw -- I saw, myself, Simon when the killers were taking him away.  They passed ***********************************.  He was being led to his death.  I see him pass, but I did not say that I witnessed his killing, his execution.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Were you expecting this procession to pass by where you were, or was this just an accident, you seeing this procession go past?
@A.
It was just incidental that I saw the killers led Simon by.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you saw this whilst you were covered with dry grass or whilst you were in the ceiling?  In which location were you at this time?
@A.
Let me explain to you: when Simon was being led to his death, they had not yet started killing the Tutsis.  In fact, it was the day he was led to his death that they started killing the Tutsis and it was from ****************that I saw Simon passing by with the killers.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  But you still haven't told me where *************************you were.  Were you in the ceiling at the time, or standing at the window, or covered by grass?
@A.
Let me continue explaining to you.  And I'm saying that I saw him pass by together with the killers, and the day he was being led to his death, the Tutsis were not yet threatened.  It was from that day that they started killing the Tutsi.  It is to tell you that all the Tutsis were not hiding at that time.  I was, therefore, (By order of the Court, these words have been struck from the record and filed under seal) when the killers passed by with Simon.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was Simon a Tutsi or a Hutu?
@A.
Simon was a Tutsi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So why was he being led to his death if Tutsis were not being sought at that time?
@A.
I told you that it was on that day that the killing of Tutsis started.  This was about three days after the death of Habyarimana.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The reference to the house, this precise location where the witness observed this, will be deleted both from the transcripts, where it will be placed unseal, and from the court video system.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that the information you gave us as to those who were responsible for Karegeya's death and that of Mukantabana were things that were told to you, the people who were responsible for their death?  You didn't see that; it's just things that were told to you, was it not?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Also, you were not present when Ndindabahizi visited Gasharu cellule and, again, his visit was reported to you, was it not?
@A.
I told you that I was in the cellule and it is in that cellule *****************is located.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct.  Sorry; you were not at the meeting that he held with other people from the cellule.  That's what I meant.  Is that correct?
@A.
It is correct.  I did not attend the meeting.  But I told you that it was not a meeting to incite killings; it was, rather, intended to stop the killings.  That is one point that you need to understand.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I certainly, do, Mr. Witness.  Now, how much of the evidence that was adduced in the Prosecution's case were you aware of before you became a witness for the Defence?
@A.
I don't clearly understand your question.  Can you please repeat it?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How much of the evidence of Prosecution witnesses had you become aware of before you travelled to Arusha; in other words, the evidence against Ndindabahizi, how much of it were you aware of before you came here to Arusha?
@A.
I have no idea.  I don't know about that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When my learned friend for the Defence asked you to mention those Tutsis who had been victims of the attacks in Gasharu cellule, was it then a coincidence that you mentioned only the names of victims that have been mentioned already before this Court?  What do you say about that, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Your question is very long.  Can you reformulate it more concisely?  Your question is too long.  Is there no way of shortening that question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There certainly is.  Now, when the lawyer for Ndindabahizi asked you about the names of the victims, people who had been killed in Gasharu cellule, you only mentioned the names of Karegeya, Mukantabana and other people who had already been mentioned in this case.  How did you know that those were the names to mention?  Is it a coincidence that you just happened to mention the same names?
@A.
If I mentioned the names of these people, it's because these were people I knew and whose names I remember.  You will understand that this happened nine years ago and that -- it would be difficult for me to recall the names of other victims.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When you were asked to mention the names of those who were responsible for their death, is it also a coincidence that you only mentioned names of assailants who had been mentioned already in this case, or are these just the names that you remembered from your hiding place at the time? 
@A.
If I mentioned names of other people mentioned, this will not mean that these were names of attackers; there were many attackers and it would not be easy to mention all their names. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You were not an eyewitness to any of the attacks, how come then that you were able to recollect the names of not only the victims but indeed the assailants, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
That is due to the fact that when we are in our various cellules, we talk.  We talk about names of persons that killed other people during the events and names of victims for the purpose of reassuring ourselves as to what -- as to whether what we say about the responsibilities of such and such a leader is true or not, because some of the attackers are now in prison or at the time were in prison.  So we try to refresh our memories as to what we say about the attackers, and some of the attackers are in prison and they are said to be guilty. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Have you testified against any of the attackers that you mentioned in this courtroom this morning?  Have you ever been to any of their trials and testified against them for the bad things they did at Gasharu; if so, which ones and when? 
@A.
Personally, I was a prosecutor's witness for ********************* but that trial had not yet started; the other two Accused pleaded guilty.

Yes, sir, that is correct. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How did you go about being a Prosecution witness when you just told us that you were not an eyewitness to any of these activities?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
I do not get the question clearly.  Could you kindly repeat?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How can you be a witness against *********** at his trial, if you were not an eyewitness to any of the crimes that he committed?

@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a few questions for you, Mr. Witness.  
What was the relationship -- was there any relationship between the Accused and Karegeya, the father of the ****************?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, there was a relationship, a relative. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
How were they related?
@THE WITNESS:
They were cousins, madam.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And to what ethnic group did he belong, Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was Tutsi, madam.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
But he was a cousin of the Accused?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have another question.  You stated that you had two hiding places, in the ceiling and in the garden, and that you left one, the first one in June after Accused's visit and the second in July, is that what you said?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam, on the 4th of July.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  And when did Accused *********? 
@THE WITNESS:
I didn't understand that question clearly.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Did he come at the beginning, middle or end of June, to your place? 
@THE WITNESS:
He came at the beginning of June. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And, so that brings me to my next question.  If he stopped the killings as you allege, why did you remain in hiding until the beginning of July? 
@THE WITNESS:
After his departure, I left my first hiding place and I went to the house, and nobody came into the house to look for anybody after that.  He had already made the statement and after his departure, we couldn't have been absolutely sure that we were safe.  We could not therefore go out, but what is certain is that after his departure, nobody went around seeking people out in houses any more. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And initially, you stated that you hid in the ceiling, then you left and went out in the garden.  Now, you are adding that you returned to the house in the ceiling again, or generally in the house.
@THE WITNESS:
Well, let me explain.  I didn't go hiding in the ceiling; I was in the house.  I could move around the house but I did not go out of the house.  I went out of the house and remained in the compound.  I remained in the compound.  I never went outside the compound, and after that, I no longer hid in the ceiling as was the case before. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:

@THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why did you mention his name, what was his significance? 
@THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I talked about him because I knew him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What happened to him? 
@THE WITNESS:
He was also killed during the war, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, did you mention any other names of persons that were killed?  And now we will not talk about Karegeya.  We will not talk about Tatiane, and we will not talk about Simone Higiro.  Did you mention any other persons that were killed when you were asked about victims earlier today? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I gave other names. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat those names, please?  Would you repeat those names, please, in case there was a lack of clarity?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya.  Mr. President, do you want other names that I did not mention?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No, only the names that you mentioned in view of the examination so far.  So you have now mentioned Karegira, Nkurunzira.  Did you mention everyone else today?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya, Mutemberezi, Nkurunziza, Karegira and Habimana, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So what was Habimana?
@THE WITNESS:
Do you want to know his ethnic group, sir? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Habimana?
@THE WITNESS:
Habimana was one of our neighbours and he was Tutsi, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Nkurunziza?
@THE WITNESS:
Nkurunziza was also a neighbour, a Tutsi, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you mention the name Mutemberezi?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I talked about Mutemberezi.

Who was he?
@THE WITNESS:
He was also a Tutsi.

Thank you very much.  
Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for having come to Arusha and testify.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you kindly not to discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.  
We may well now have the lunch break.  
The next witness then, Defence pseudonym is?
@MR. BESNIER:
The next witness will be DH, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You said DH, didn't you?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I am not sure that we have received the DH documentation so far.  We have some intimation from another witness including DU, but we were -- we will then need DH. I have DG and DU.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the document we submitted to the Tribunal, isn't it in that stapled document?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course, it is in the main document, like all your other documents, we have it in the main document.  But since your technique so far has been in addition to this binded folder also to provide us with a separate document for exhibiting purposes.  I just draw your attention to that kind of documentation concerning the next witness, we have not received.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I understand.  We tried to situate that the witnesses for this morning, their documents be submitted to you.  That is what we tried to do.  And for this afternoon, the document will also be sent to you before the beginning of the afternoon. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is quite understandable.  So why I am raising this is that in front of us, we have DU and another one which does --  and these two do not form part of this morning's session, and that is why we just draw your attention to the fact that we got, of course, the two documents for this morning session, but we did not -- but in addition, we got something which could appear to be for this afternoon session.  But now, we know that it is DH which is the next one and that is the one we need at 2:30.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  Mr. President, what happened was, there was a mistake on the part of witness protection or probably it's on my part.  Witness DU was confused with DJ.  The letter was not clear, this is why there was this confusion error and I should like to apologise for it. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The matter is simply to avoid confusion, but we will resume at 2:30.  
So the Court is adjourned until 230. 
$Court recessed from 1255H to 1434H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
And, Mr. Witness, we are now in an open session, and that implies that you have to be a bit careful when you respond to questions.  So please do not reveal your identity when questions are being posed which may imply particulars relating to your identity.  Do you have a document in front of you? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your signature at the bottom of the document?

Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I have to request a motion under Rule 79(D) because we are going to have to question the witness closely on his identity.  So we are requesting for a closed session for the next ten minutes of our session this afternoon, by your leave.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are simply asking for about ten minutes. 
Any problems with that, Prosecution?  No.
And we have to grant that motion, but the public will note then that in about ten minutes we will revert to the open session.  And the purpose of this closed session is simply to protect the identity of this witness.  Thank you very much.

Now, Mr. Witness, who took you away from hiding place No. 1? 
@A.
My father. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did he take you to that place, specifically? 
@A.
He was a family friend. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And you stated that you remained there for two weeks in that hiding place?

Yes, that is correct.

There was Mukantabana and her daughter.

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You stated that you remained for two weeks in your hiding places No. 1, why did you have to leave it?
@A.
It is because people had just discovered that hiding place. 
@MR. BESNIER:
After hiding at hiding place No. 1, did you go immediately to hiding place No. 2?
@A.
Yes, that is where I went. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did someone accompany you there or did you go there alone? 
@A.
I left together with the members of that family who accompanied me there.
@MR. BESNIER:
The Tatiane we referred to, did she also accompany you to hiding place No. 2?
@A.
No, I left her in the first hiding place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know the ***************?
@A.
Yes, I knew the man. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Had you known the person for a long time? 
@A.

Was he living in that house in 1994? 
@A.
No, ************* 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did that person go frequently to that house or to the cellule in which that house was located?

He would come there about twice a year.

@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, you have written two names on this piece of paper.  The first name that you wrote, does that belong to *******************?  
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the second person whose name you have written down doing in that hiding place? 
@A.
That person was living with the family, but at that point in time, the person was hiding and was remaining in his or her hiding place. 
@MR. BESNIER:
This person you have mentioned as No. 2, was that person hiding in the same hiding place as yourself or somewhere else? 
@A.
We were not hiding in the same hiding place; we were not side by side, but we were within the same compound. 
@MR. BESNIER:
For how long did you remain at this hiding place, if you can recall? 
@A.
I think that I stayed there for a month or for a month and a half.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you know, Mr. Witness, that this house that you were hiding in belonged to a person who was having a high position and that he was Hutu?
@A.
Yes, I knew that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did that not make you feel afraid? 
@A.
No, I wasn't afraid.  And I was saying to myself that nothing could ever happen to me.  He couldn't do anything to me. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you believe that he couldn't do anything to you? 
@A.
It is because this person had very good relationships with my parents; they were friends, so I understood therefrom (sic) that he couldn't do me any harm. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Isn't it correct, Mr. Witness, that during the genocide some friends turned against their friends and against people who were close to them, that people even killed their friends? 
@A.
That is indeed true, that did happen but I didn't think that could happen to me, and I didn't think it could happen to me because these people welcomed me. 
@MR. BESNIER:
During your stay at hiding place No. 2, was that house ever searched? 
@A.
The house was searched.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know by whom? 
@A.
It was people whom I wasn't able to know.  I didn't know their names; there were people who were moving around and they were scattered over the hill, I wasn't able to see them, I didn't even -- I didn't know them.  I heard them shouting and making a lot of noise. 
@MR. BESNIER:
How is it that these people did not find  you, they did not discover you? 
@A.
These people were unable to see me because I was hiding, it is quite simple. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let's now go back a little.  Do you know how your father was killed. 
@A.
I was not a witness of his death.  I was only told about the circumstances that led to his death. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And what were you told about those circumstances? 
@A.
I was told that he was arrested, that he was taken away and that he was killed.  I was told, "Your father was killed", that is all.  I was told, "Your father was killed". 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know of any eyewitnesses to your father's death? 
@A.
I came to know one person, Karara, who was quite close to the place.  I think that he saw the people who took my father away, maybe he would be aware of the circumstances that brought about his execution or his death, but I am unable to tell you anything. 
@MR. BESNIER:
In this Chamber, we know of two Kararas.  Now the Karara you are referring to, would that be the former bourgmestre?
@A.
No.
@MR. BESNIER:
That is quite adequate.  Do you have any information about the place where your father was killed?  Was it within the same cellule, the one in which is located hiding place No. 2? 
@A.
Yes, it was in that cellule that he was killed. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you have had any information on the identity of those who killed your father? 
@A.
I was able to know the persons who were in the group of attackers, especially Everiste Baphakurera.  Baphakurera is spelt B-A-P-H-A-K-U-R-E-R-A, Baphakurera.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether someone by the name Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to that cellule that we have been referring to between the beginning of April 1994 and the end of June 1994? 
@A.
He came to Gasharu cellule at the very beginning of June, the first days of June he came to Gasharu. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you an eyewitness to his visit? 
@A.
I did not see him; I heard people talk about it. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Who told you?  Is it one of the -- if it is one of the persons whose name you have written on a piece of paper, you can say so.  If it is another person, then you can give us his name directly? 
@A.
He is the first name on the paper who gave me the information. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And this person who gave you the information, did he tell you what Emmanuel Ndindabahizi might have done or said during that visit? 
@A.
That person told us that Ndindabahizi told him that, "There are children hiding here.  Can I ask them to come out before the end of the war"?  And he said, "Wait".  But after his departure, we came out but we stayed within the compound, we did not go out. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Let's take it one at a time.  Witness, do you have any reason to think that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi knew that you were hiding there and knew where you were hiding? 
@A.
Yes, he knew because that person mentioned it to him and Ndindabahizi asked for explanations. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have reason to believe that Mr. Ndindabahizi approved the fact that you were hiding in that hiding place? 
@A.
Yes, I believe he accepted it because I didn't have any problem later on, not even after his departure. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have reason to believe that you were hiding in this second hiding place, hiding place No. 2, with the agreement of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, he had accepted it.  If he did not, we would have come out of our hiding place. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you know, to your knowledge, or based on discussion you had with other people, if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to this cellule on other occasions in April or May 1994? 
@A.
No, after June he did not come back. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A question was before, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether he was there before June in 1994? 
@THE WITNESS:
No.  No, he did not come. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
When were you able to leave your hiding place? 
@A.
It was around the 4th or 5th of July that I was able to come and wander about outside.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you able to walk around outside the house, but you were not able to -- did you come out directly from your hiding place and went outside? 
@A.
On the dates that I gave earlier in July, I wasn't going too far.  I was not -- I could walk about within the premises but on the dates that I gave, I would walk about even outside the compound. 
@MR. BESNIER:
When you were in this house, you said you were in a hiding place, what was this hiding place? 
@A.
I began by hiding inside the house.  It was after his departure that we came out and went into the house, and at the beginning of the month of July around the 4th or 5th, we were able to come out of the compound because the war was over and we were able to walk about outside. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I wanted to know what was the hiding place in the house, for example, when people came to search, were you in the house or did you have a corner, a particular place where you could hide? 
@A.
No, I was not in the house.  I was not in the room, I was in the house.  But if I say it, people might be able to know.  I could put it on a piece of paper, Counsel, if you so wish. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, were you inside the house or outside the house, just tell us that first?
@THE WITNESS:
I was hiding outside the building not inside the building but within the compound. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now you want to give us further particulars by writing the exact place on a piece of paper; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I want to do.

I was not an eyewitness to her killing but I heard it was one Rukundakuvuga who killed her. 
@MR. BESNIER:

@A.
It was Everiste Baphakurera. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  Now let's come back to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Do you know or did you hear what Emmanuel Ndindabahizi did or say during his stay in the cellule that we referred to? 
@A.
From what I was told when he got to Gitaga, he asked the people who decimated members of his family.  Some people ran, but from that day, nobody died and the attackers no longer searched houses of people. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it not be possible, Witness, that on the contrary, Mr. Ndindabahizi went to that cellule to incite people to kill? 
@A.
No, that is not possible; that was not his purpose for coming there, otherwise he would have come to that cellule much earlier than that date. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would it not be possible that he came to the cellule earlier without you knowing? 
@A.
That is not possible.  If he had come to that cellule he wouldn't have left before -- without saying hello to his sister and his sister would have been aware. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Witness, let's come back to the owner of a hiding place No.2 that we referred to.  Does that person have any blood relations with your father? 
@A.
Yes, there is family relationship between that person and my father. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And what is the nature of this relationship? 
@A.
Counsel, but if I answer your question, it would disclose my identity. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to write the nature of the relationship between your father and the owner of the house on the paper?  We do not want you to mention the name of the owner of that house, but if that can reassure you, write the nature of the relationship between that person and your father on the paper.

Mr. Witness, you lived at house location No. 2, from the age of 12, in 1994 until the present time, is that not correct, Mr. Witness?
@A.
At present I live at my parent's but I do have my own house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I thought your parents died?  Can you help me with that, which parents do you live with?
@A.
I ************** and it is in that ************** that I now live.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And as a 12- year old, where did you, after your parents were killed, up until you were able to  ****************, that's what I want to know?
@A.
It was later on *************.  We were given corrugated sheets and I found doors that I stored and I moved into that house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct but in l994 before you were old enough to find the corrugated sheets and move into the house, was it not the case that you continued to live in house No. 2, and, if so, tell us when you left the house?
@A.
I stayed at the house in which I survived, but my name was listed among people whose houses had been destroyed.  And before ******************************, I continued to live in hiding place No. 2, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I want to know when you ceased to live at house No. 2, one year, six months ago, two months ago?  Help me to answer that, please?
@A.
It was in March 2001 that I left house No. 2 to move into my house.  It was at the time that I was to get married.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, that's what I thought, and whilst you lived in house No. 2, you lived there with the person whose name is on Defence Exhibit 20-- let me recall it, 21.  Is that not the case?  The two people you listed on Defence Exhibit 21, you lived in the same house with them, did you not?
@A.
Yes, that is correct, I still lived with those two people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many wives did your father have, Mr. Witness?  Just give me the number.  One, two, three, four, five?
@A.
My father had *******************
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And how many siblings did you have in total, Mr. Witness?
@A.
We had a *****************.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So ************, is that your testimony or in total, children your father had?
@A.
Yes, we were *******.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now where is your sister today?
@A.
Are you referring to my sister that is still alive?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct.  Where is she?
@A.
My sister got married but she is still in our area, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So is it your testimony that she is in your area at the present time as we speak or is she elsewhere?
@A.
Yes, sir, she lives in our area.  They left the house of the ****************************** house where they now live.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall how old your sister was in l994, Mr. Witness?
@A.
The one who died, who came just after me, indeed she came just after me but I can't remember her age.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your father ****************.  Now from that marriage, is it the case that there were one ******************************************?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now that ************ is she still alive or is she not still alive.
@THE WITNESS:
She died, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now this sister who is now married, living in our (sic) area, did she come from *************** then, is that the situation?
@THE WITNESS:

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, Mr. Witness, you testified that you at some stage sought refugee at the location you described as house No. 1.  Now why isn't that mentioned in your statement?
@A.
I did not mention that house because I didn't stay there for a long time.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And why would you have to stay there at all, if you continued to stay at the house where you survived until very recently?  Why did you bother going to the first house at all?  It's not in your statement.
@A.
I did not talk about the first hiding place because I didn't stay there for a long time.  I only mentioned the hiding place where I stayed for a longer period of time, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The information in your statement is a little bit more intriguing, Mr. Witness, because in your statement, you state clearly that you have no specific information to give about the owner of house No. 1.  Don't you?  You actually speak about the owner of house No. 1 and you conclude your testimony in that regard by stating that you have nothing specific to tell us about him, is that not the case?
@A.
I do not have explanations to give concerning house No. 1; indeed, because when the situation got complicated I was no longer in that house.  All I can say is, those who occupied that house accompanied me to house No. 2, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it not the case, Mr. Witness, that the reason why you brought up staying in house No. 1 is because you know that that's where Tatiana stayed and you want us to believe that you know about Tatiana and what happened to her, is that not true, Mr. Witness?
@A.
No sir, that is not the reason.  As a matter of fact, it was not at that house that she was killed.  She was taken out of the house to be killed.  So, that couldn't have been the reason to prevent me from talking about that house.  No. 1, Tatiana was not killed in that house, she was taken out of that house to be killed outside, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You are extremely well informed, Mr. Witness, for a man who spent three months hiding under sorghum leaves in a location out of reach from house No. 1.  How do you know this?  Has anyone told you about the evidence in the Prosecution's case by any chance, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Nobody talked to me about it, sir, rather, as a matter of fact, nobody told me about the evidence that the Prosecutor's witness is to give or has given here in this court.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Apart from ************** and the lady you mentioned staying at house No. 1, how many Tutsis to your knowledge, were killed in your cellule during the genocide?
@A.
The other Tutsis that died in our cellule were, as far as I am concerned, they were quite many because our cellule was in the majority, inhabited by Tutsi.  I cannot tell you all their names.  I can only tell you a few names, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's indeed very correct.  And, therefore, you must be particularly grateful to be alive, Mr. Witness, is that not the case?
@A.
Yes, sir, I thank God for being still alive.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Apart from thanking God, Mr. Witness, and being grateful to God, is it not also that you are also particularly grateful ******************* for saving your life, yes or no?
@A.
Yes, I am grateful to those people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No further questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-direct? 
@MR. BESNIER:
No further questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the sources of the information about **************** come from Mr. Augustin Karara; is that so?
@THE WITNESS:
No, sir.  It was not Karara that told me about the *************.  It was the person that I mentioned in the piece of paper, that person gave me the information, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now that person -- from where did that person on the piece of paper get his or her information?
@THE WITNESS:
That person heard people shouting out and said:  "Well, the person has been found, the fellow has been found", and when that person heard people shouting out like that he came and told me, "Look, ************* has been found".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to indicate any name or names of the persons that witnessed the  **************** and then informed the person on the piece of paper who then told you?
@THE WITNESS:
Regarding the persons that informed me, the person whose name I mentioned on the piece of paper, that I do not know.  That person on the piece of paper told me that he heard people shouting out the words that I have just repeated here before you, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the person on the piece of paper did not inform you who actually witnessed the killing of *****  *******. Is that so?
@THE WITNESS:
That is true.  That person only heard people shouting out.  That person did not witness the killing of *************, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony has now come to an end.  We would like to thank you for having come a long way to Arusha to give a testimony and wish you a very safe journey home.  And please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.
@THE WITNESS:
I thank you, sir.

The Defence would like to make the same application as just before.  We would like a closed session for ten minutes, lest we make the witness easily identifiable.  I am worried about justice and we shall simply go to particulars that is addressed -- certain particulars and immediately go on to open session, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to grant that application but we know that it will only be for ten minutes, and then we are back in open session again.

$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness, could you remind us and tell us how you learnt about the death of President Juvernal Habyarimana?
@A.
I learnt about it over the radio, Counsel.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you remember approximately at which date that was, Witness?
@A.
I do not remember the date, Counsel.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you remember the  -- what are the events -- what happened security wise during the day following the death of the president, what happened as far as security was concerned?
@A.
Now in the day following the death of the president, in our area people started killing cows, destroying houses, burning down houses and killing people.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you mean that looting erupted and massacres as well of people?
@A.
Yes, the massacre of the Tutsi.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now more precisely, who were the victims of such crimes?  You are saying that those that belonged to which ethnic group?
@A.
The Hutu were killing the Tutsi, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now to kill the Hutu - rather, to kill the Tutsi, one went to seek them in the houses or in the countryside, which is which?
@A.
First of all, the houses were destroyed and people ran away to hide in the bush.  It is there that they were found or sometimes they were found in neighbour's houses.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
My questions may rather be brutal compared to the compassion that you may need.  What were the arms used to kill the Tutsi, madam?  What sort of weapons were used?
@A.
They used machetes, clubs and even daggers.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you tell us as far as the Gasharu commune was concerned, where did the killers come from?
@A.
The killers came from the Kayengi sector among others, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The killer came from Kanyegi, were there killer that came from any other areas?
@A.
They came from all the areas.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you tell us as far as you were concerned, face to face with those killings since you are Tutsi, could you tell us what you did to avoid being killed?
@A.
I hid myself in the bush initially and then late a neighbour of mine hid me in his house or her house until the end of the war.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You hid in the bush alone or with members of your family?
@A.
Initially I was with my mother and my younger brother and then later when my mother was killed, I stayed with my younger brother, and then much later my younger brother was killed and one week after that, I met the assailants that took me to the Gitaka centre.  A neighbour called**********paid money to the assailants for them to spare my life.  So that since day I went to that neighbour's house where I stayed.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, let us go over this chronology again, ma'am.  It is correct to say initially you hid in the bush with your mother; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And your younger brother?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And then very quickly, initially your mother was found, caught and killed?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Your younger brother and yourself were able to escape?
@A.
We stayed together in that hiding place.  And one week after that, my younger brother was arrested.  He was taken to the Gitaka centre.  He was ***************** -- into a cell that *********** was going to pull him ******************.   And for that matter it was the same people that pulled him ****************and killed him.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you mean that because they feared that ******** would save your younger brother they withdraw him ****** in which they had thrown him and then killed him?
@A.
Yes, they were afraid that ******, who was a friend of the family, may save my younger brother.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, when was your mother killed, in which month?
@THE WITNESS:
April, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was she killed in the first half or the second half of April?
@THE WITNESS:
In the middle of the month of April.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now this incident with your brother, did that also happen in April?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was in April; there was one week between the two events.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So your brother and yourself were taken to the Gitaka village centre -- I'm trying to reconstitute the events  -- this is after you were flushed out of your hiding place, then comes in what you just told us about regarding how your brother was killed.  He was removed *************** and then killed, and you -- well, what happened to you, Madam Witness?
@A.
They arrested my brother but I was able to escape from them.  But later on I said to myself that it would be better for me to go and look for him.  And on my way I met a group of assailants who also took me to Gitaka centre.  And it was at that point in time that*********** gave money to the leader of the attackers.  They released me, and they said they were going to come back for me the following day to kill me but they didn't do so. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What happened to your father, Madam Witness, during this period of time?
@A.
During this period of time when I reached this neighbour's house, *********'s home, my father came there and I was able to see him.  And about two days later I learned that he too was killed.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
If I were to recount the event, would I be faithful to your retelling of the story that the death of your mother is placed in the first half of the month of April or even -- 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Who is the witness; who is testifying here, the witness or counsel?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I presume --  I think that when the witness answered my question she didn't really say the first half, so even if you are trying to recapitulate you must do it accurately.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So there were the death of three persons, Mr. President, the death of her mother, her brother and her father.  All I'm trying to do is place these events, which I believe all took place in the month of April, and I wanted some specifics in terms of chronology.  Even if that is disturbing the Prosecutor, we need to establish what the chronology of events is. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, can you please specify to me regarding these three events, the death of your mother, the death of your brother and the death of your father, I want you to tell us about them chronologically speaking?
@A.
There was space of one week between the three killings.  First of all my mother was killed, then my brother and finally my father; and between one event and the next there was a week.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
A moment ago --
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can I ask the following question, Mr. President, Your Honours?
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The death of your mother, you placed it a moment ago in the middle of April.  So, where would you place the death of your younger brother, would that be the third week of April, and the death of your father the last week of April; would that be correct, Madam Witness?
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You did not witness your father's death, so how were you --
@A.
It is true, I was not an eyewitness of my father's death.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
How were you then informed, and by whom, of your father's death?  How were you informed?
@A.
I was at *******'s house and it was ******* who told me that my father was dead.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did ***** -- well, without going into detail, did he tell you how your father was killed?
@A.
He told me that my father had been arrested and that he had been clubbed to death.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
From what ******** said or through investigations that you yourself may have made, do you know who killed your father?
@A.
Yes, I know that my father was killed by Évariste Bapfukurera.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And where was he killed?
@A.
He was killed at the Gitaka centre.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Does that mean that he was found at the Gitaka centre and killed there or was he brought there to be killed?
@A.
He was found in the bush where he was hiding and he was taken to the Gitaka centre, and that is where he was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this *********, what was his position in society?
@THE WITNESS:
********* was a farmer and at the same time he was a trader.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
And throughout these events of April, May 1994 did you lose any other members of your family, Madam Witness?
@A.
Yes, I lost other members of my family, in particular my paternal uncles.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, do you know the Accused, Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
The last time I saw him I was very young; I'm not sure I would be able to recognise him today.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you see him during the events of any 1994?
@A.
I heard it said that he had come.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you be a bit more specific, Madam Witness?  You heard it said that he came when, Madam Witness, when did he come?
@A.
He came in the beginning of the month of June; that is what I was told.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Would I be correct in saying that this was more than one death -- one month or at least one month between the death of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) and the arrival of Ndindabahizi at Gitaka?
@A.
Yes, he came after my father's death.

$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, you were told about the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the beginning of June, 1994.  Were you also told about Mr. Ndindabahizi's reaction to what had happened, to what was happening and the questions that he asked?
@A.
I was told that he came and that when he reached the Gitaka centre he was saddened to learn that people had been killed, and he had asked why people were killing others.  He was shown a man known as Gatete and he ordered that the man be arrested, but that man was able to escape.  At that point in time there was another man called Karara, and Mr. Ndindabahizi arrested this Mr. Karara and took him away for him to be imprisoned.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Am I correct in saying that Mr. Ndindabahizi was angry when he learned of the deaths committed against Tutsis?

$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, in your written statement you said the following to the investigators, and I am quoting:  "It is absurd to state that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi can have any kind of responsibility whatsoever in the crimes committed in our region."
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you confirm that what you said about Emmanuel Ndindabahizi being accused of such crimes would be absurd?
@A.
For me they are lies.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You also state that you yourself and members of your family, your parents and some of your brothers and sisters, were victims of the genocide.  And you said that you've heard mention made of that, yet you say Ndindabahizi was innocent of the crimes or the allegations made against him.
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
After the war a certain number of investigations were carried out; was Ndindabahizi -- was Ndindabahizi's name ever mentioned regarding the genocide?
@A.
I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel; can you repeat it for me, please?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I withdraw that question.  
Madam Witness, your family -- you are from a farming family.  What are the traditional tools agricultural tools used by Hutu and Tutsi farmers, traditionally?
@A.
Rwandan cultivators use hoes and machetes to tow the land.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
One last question, Madam Witness; do you think it is reasonable to say that in April, May, 1994 a Tutsi woman could go on foot, even in hiding, from Gitesi to Kibirizi?
@A.
That was not possible.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Is it reasonable or possible for a Tutsi woman to make purchases at a market place during this period of time in 1994 and particularly in Kibirizi?
@A.
That was not possible.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon, Counsel.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know why Tutsis were being sought in Rwanda in 1994?
@A.
Tutsis were being sought because of their ethnicity.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you carry an identity card in 1994, Madam Witness?
@A.
I didn't have one.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how Tutsis were identified in 1994 apart from the use of identity cards?
@A.
For those who had identity cards, they were checked, but for those who didn't, they could be identified because they were known.  It was known that this person or this child was a Tutsi; that was the only way of identifying anyone.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Could Tutsis also be identified by their facial attributes and features in 1994, as far as you know?
@A.
When you reached a region which was not your own and if you didn't have an identity card on which it was said that you were Hutu, you could be killed because of your physical features.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would you describe yourself, Madam Witness, as having typical Tutsi features?
@A.
All people look alike.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is that a yes or a no to my -- answer to my question, Madam Witness?
@A.
I told you that all people look alike; there is very little difference between individuals, so one cannot say that one person is Hutu and another is Tutsi on the basis only of physical traits.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, you were 17-years old in 1994, were you not?
@A.
Yes.

And since the genocide, would I be correct in saying that you have moved on with your life and gone on to do other things, including getting married?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that following the death of your parents, the unfortunate death of your parents in 1994, certain individuals assumed responsibility for your upkeep; could I be correct in saying that?
@A.
Yes, there was a neighbour, that neighbour took me in and took care of me until I got married.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, can you tell me who that neighbour is without actually saying it out, if you could write it down or something; or is it somebody we have talked about already?  Can you answer me that way if it is?
@A.
Are you referring to the person who took care of me after my parents died?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

After the war when life was becoming more and more difficult for me, I went to this lady's house, the lady whose name I mentioned, but that was after the war.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Madam Witness, for helping with that little exercise. 
Now, can you tell me whether your husband is Tutsi or Hutu.
@A.
He's Hutu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, when I asked you to write the relationship that you have or had with the first person you wrote, whose name you wrote on the paper, you described that person as your sister.  Is that correct?
@A.
Who are you talking about, Counsel?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you look at me, Madam Witness.  Look at me.  This name you've written here, do you recall telling us that that person is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
@A.
No.  I said (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  You asked me about the relationship between that person and Ndindabahizi.  You asked me the relationship between the two persons, the person on the paper and Ndindabahizi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Pardon me, Madam Witness, yes, that is indeed correct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So then we will delete this as well. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last reference to the link between the Accused and the relationship, but under seal.  Please proceed. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Madam Witness, why do you think that the man you describe as*************, why do you think that person allowed you to stay at his house during the genocide?
@A.
He allowed me to live in his house because he was a neighbour, he was a family friend.  And when he was in a position to shelter me, he did so.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And do you have a relationship with that man's wife?  Is that man's wife something to you?  And just answer me yes or no, initially. 
@A.
Whose wife? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
********.  A relationship with his wife.
@A.
No, no relation.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that whilst you sought refuge at *********'s house you never left the premises to go elsewhere during the genocide; is that correct?
@A.
I used to take refuge in his house and sometimes he would take me to his trading place, where he conducted his trading activities, and come back.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was he able to do that without risking your life, Madam Witness?
@A.
We used to move during the night.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The trading centre was open at night, Madam Witness?
@A.
We would go through the bush along the road and then we would get to the centre.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And whilst you were at this centre, did you only operate your business at night or did you do it in daytime?
@A.
You mean, for me to hide at the centre? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't know what you were doing at the centre.  You help me with that.  What were you doing there?
@A.
He used to take me there and keep me in a house.  In fact, it was a trick to hide me and people did not suspect that I could be hiding there.  So he would keep me in a house, and when people heard that I was in that house at the centre, he would take me away from there to his house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you criss-crossed between ***********'s house and the centre throughout the months of April, May of and June?
@A.
Yes, that is what we did.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Why did Mr. ******** go out of his way to protect you at this time and have to ferry you from his house to the centre?  Why did he go out of his way to do that?
@A.
He knew I was being sought, and if he didn't do that I would be killed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He was also good friends with your father, was he not?
@A.
They were friends.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you also know a man by the name *****************?
@A.
I knew him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He was also a family friend, was he not?
@A.
Yes, he was also a family friend.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that prior to April 1994 your father had lived side by side with ********* and ********* without any problems?
@A.
They lived very well and had no problem between them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Why then was it, Madam Witness, in your opinion, that ******* and ******* were not able to protect your father?  Why were they not able to protect him in 1994?
@A.
I'm unable to explain to you how people changed during that period. What I know is that ******** did his best and gave me refuge. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, we didn't hear.  There was a rectification from there.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Madam Witness, could you repeat your answer, please.  We're having some problems in getting your answer across.
@A.
******* hid me.  And I cannot tell you what ******** was thinking; I can only say that he changed during that period.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What do you mean by stating that Ndabukiye changed during that period?  Can you help us with that, please?
@A.
************ did not give refuge to anybody, and even my brother who took refuge in his house, he chased him out subsequently, and my brother had to go and live with a women that I referred to earlier.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That being the case, do you know whether *****had any hand in your father's death?
@A.
I wouldn't know.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You describe him as a changed man who chased your younger brother out of your house at some stage.  Would it have been possible, would it have been possible for him, Madam Witness, for him to have a hand in your father's death, in your opinion?
@A.
You know, during the war, any person who gave refuge to a Tutsi person was afraid of either being killed or being looted.  Probably that was why my brother was chased away, because he probably thought that if my brother was discovered he would lose his property.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The location where your  ********** eventually ended up, why was he not chased out of that location, do you know?
@A.
I don't know, but I believe these were people who had pity of him and were very kind people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You must consider yourself extremely lucky to be alive after the events of 1994, Madam Witness.
@A.
Yes, indeed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You must feel particularly grateful to the men and women who went out of their way to save your life; is that not the case?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.  I'm grateful to these people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
When you eventually got married to your husband, did somebody give you away, as is traditionally the case in Africa?  Did you have representatives from your family who gave you away, stood in place for your parents?
@A.
It was my maternal uncle who survived the genocide.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you ever know who killed your mother in 1994?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you also find out who killed your younger brother in 1994?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Have you been able to testify in the trials of any of these people in Rwanda?
@A.
No.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you intend to do so at a future stage, Madam Witness?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What are you going to base that testimony on, if and when you do so?  Are you going to tell that court that you were an eyewitness to those killings, or are you going to tell that court that you were told that they were involved in their death?  What do you intend to do?
@A.
I'll tell the court that I got information regarding the circumstances of their death.  I will not say that I was an eyewitness.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know how many Tutsis were killed in Gasharu cellule in 1994, Madam Witness?
@A.
There are very many, and I wouldn't know of the exact figure.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And are you able to tell us how you came to be a witness for the Defence in this case?  Did anybody ask you to come to Arusha and, if so, who and when?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know who asked you to come here?  Do you want to write it down or do you want to tell me?
@A.
The person who asked me?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes. 
@A.
The person who contacted us is called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  And I -- would I be correct in saying that that person that you've just mentioned is the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?  Just yes or no, don't expand any further.
@A.
Are you referring to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I am.  Just confirm whether I would be right in saying --
@A.
It's (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  It's the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) the Accused person in this case, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for being so kind. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, if I could enter this piece of paper as Prosecution Exhibit -- it would be two exhibits.  Actually, we could do it in one.  We have one name on one side which belongs to her husband, and we have the ****************************************************************, and that person's relationship to the Accused on one side. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe we could make two copies, and on the one have OTP Exhibit 31.  Will that settle the dispute?  That is the relationship?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's the *******************************************************.  And also on that page is that person's relationship to the Accused.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And then on the other sheet would be the name of the witness's husband.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and that would be No. 32, and both under seal.
$Exhibit Nos. P. 31 and P. 32 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe the last interchange should also be under seal, between you and the witness.  
So, court register video system, if you will delete that last reference when it comes to the link between the person who asked the witness to testify and the relationship to the Accused.  
Any re-examination? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Just one question, Mr. President.      
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam Witness, your conviction of the conduct of Mr. Ndindabahizi during the genocide, Prosecutor is trying to link that to the fact that the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) of Ndindabahizi  ********************.  Will this conviction not, rather, flow from the totality of the information that you were able to gather on the conduct of Mr. Ndindabahizi, on information that you got, research that you conducted, which enabled you to assert that we're all victims of this genocide?  We're in a better position to know the perpetrators, and I can assure that you Mr. Ndindabahizi is not one of them.  Is this conviction this, and not a way of saying thank you, as it is being inferred?
@A.
It is not because ***************, who is related to him.  I'm saying this because when he came he was very shocked by the killing of the people, and he was very angry.  And they showed him one person who had killed a lot of people and he asked that person to be arrested, but that person fled.  But subsequently he had Karara arrested, had him detain.  But for me, this is evidence that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi did not have any responsibility in the genocide.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You came to testify -- did you come to testify to tell the truth or to show your gratitude?
@A.
I came here to tell the truth about the event that I experienced and events that I heard about. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Again, the reference to the person who lived in the house must be placed under seal and struck from the video system. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
We seek a short clarification from you, Madam Witness.  ******* had sheltered you; is that right?  Is this the same ******************************?
@THE WITNESS:
It is the same person who was detained.  But later on he got to know that they were false accusations against ******** and he had been released.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You said that your husband was a Hutu; is that right?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Is he in any way related to the Accused?
@THE WITNESS:
No, no blood relation.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Are you related to the Accused?  If so, could you please write it down for us, your relationship with him.
@THE WITNESS:
They were related, but it's a distant relation.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Who *******************?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  It is said that  (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
@JUDGE KHAN:
You mean to say that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I suppose we have to place that under seal as well.  So that will be done and struck from the record. 
Madam Witness, who told you who killed your father?
@THE WITNESS:
It was *********.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How did he know?
@THE WITNESS:
It was ******** who had him buried.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was  ******************** present during the killing of your father?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know if he was present or not.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What is your source for saying that Évariste Bapfakurera was one of your father's killers?
@THE WITNESS:
It's because he pleaded guilty in the Rwandan courts, and he accepted that he committed this crime.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that when he found out that he was one of the killers, when you heard about his conviction?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was when he confessed that I got to know.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
^Before then, you did not know?
@THE WITNESS:
I did not know.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When did he confess?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know, but I was told that he confessed his guilt.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
^Before the normal Rwandan courts or some other mechanism?
@THE WITNESS:
I heard he admitted that he killed my father.  That is what I know.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know whether he confessed before the courts, or have you only heard that he has admitted it? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was before judges.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When were you told about this?
@THE WITNESS:
His testimony is even available.  This was a while ago, and I can therefore not remember the year nor the month.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you talking about two years ago, four years ago, six years ago? 
@THE WITNESS:
You mean, since I got this information, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, that's the question, exactly.
@THE WITNESS:
I think it must have been eight or nine months ago since I got this information.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you heard Judge Khan ask you about Mr.  ************* and she asked you whether ******* was the same person, on the one hand the person who sheltered you, and on the other hand the man whom Mr. *******************.  Did you say that he was the same person? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was the same person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why would this person on the one hand be a Tutsi-saver and on the other hand be ordered ***************?
@THE WITNESS:
These were persons who spoke to Ndindabahizi and ****************************************************  ************  But it was when he got to know later on that these were ***********************************, who just **********
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But why did Ndindabahizi **************?
@THE WITNESS:

@THE WITNESS:
Of Tutsis.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When did he ***? 
@THE WITNESS:
The same day he arrived.  When he arrived on that same day, he*********************************** him away for ***************************.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And this all happened in June '94?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Madam Witness.  Your testimony --
@THE WITNESS:
I would like to thank you too, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony has come to an end.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much, and do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you. 
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
$Witness excused) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This will bring us to the end of the day also.  
And tomorrow, Defence, we start with DL? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, in fact, Mr. President, I'm in a position to give some information to the Court on the proceedings.  We currently have 13 witnesses here in Arusha.  We have called four.  Things are moving very fast and that's very good.  Out of the 13 witnesses, we have seen and prepared eight.  The Defence team has not yet met the remaining five.  Other witnesses should be arriving at the end of the week, and the expert can come here only from the 17th of November.  If tomorrow we are able to hear four witnesses, we would have heard all the witnesses that we've prepare, and we would need a day or two to meet the remaining witnesses.  Therefore, I think that if we are able to hear four witnesses tomorrow, to adjourn for a day or two, or a day and a half, to enable us to meet other witnesses so that before the end of the week we could hear other witnesses.  Today, I can say that we'll be able to hear ten witnesses in the course of the week.  It is possible that we would need a day of Thursday, Wednesday or Thursday, to be able to prepare the witnesses that we intend to hear on Friday.  Will this be agreeable to the Court?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if you do not have more witnesses, there is no choice.  But as I indicated previously, this is exactly the situation that the Court would wish to prefer -- to avoid.  Now, but what we note now is that we have four witnesses for tomorrow, and that is very well and good, and then let's see how it proceeds from then.  But I'm a bit worried about next week.  How many witnesses do you have for next week? 
@MR. BESNIER:
The week after, it would depend on how many witnesses we are able to call this week.  We are going to call Witnesses 9, 14, 15, 16, and 17, plus possibly some witnesses who are already here that we have not yet heard.  But here I would not like to make any pronouncements on that.  In any event, 
Mr. President, we have sufficient witnesses for next week.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So that's where we are now.  Thank you very much for that clarification.  And, tomorrow, could you just indicate the order for the four witnesses, tomorrow.  Will you do that, please, the ones you have already had occasion to interview, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Tomorrow we would hear Witnesses DL, DU, DV and DB.  In other words, we are respecting the order as set out in the list.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That's very helpful.  Thank you very much, indeed.  
So the Court is adjourned until tomorrow at 8:30.  
(Court adjourned at 1706H)

Were you still a member of the cellule's committee in 1994?
@A.
No, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let us focus on April 1994 now, if we may.  How did you learn about the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
I heard about it over the radio the day following the death of the president.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you remember the date on which you learned about the death of the president?
@A.
It was perhaps the 5th of April.  I believe it was the 5th of April -- the 7th of April.
@MR. BESNIER:
To which ethnic group do you belong, Witness?
@A.
I am Hutu, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, in the days following the death of President Habyarimana, how would you describe the situation in your cellule so far as security was concerned?
@A.
The security situation was not good because of the war that had erupted covering the whole country.
@MR. BESNIER:
When you say that the situation was not good, could you explain what you mean by that?
@A.
There were killings, massacres, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was being killed during the massacres? 
@A.
It was the Tutsi that were being killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, who killed the Tutsi?
@A.
They were being killed by the Hutu.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was it that all the Hutu killed all the Tutsi?
@A.
No, sir.  No, sir, not all the Hutu took part in the massacre.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, in the cellule in which you were, was there a roadblock?
@A.
Yes, there was a roadblock in our cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
And could you tell us where the location of the roadblock was, without identifying yourself, of course, Witness?
@A.
The roadblock was erected in the middle -- the centre of Gasharu, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who erected that roadblock?
@A.
It was one Mbonyubwe, and another one called Somayire.  Both were from Kayenzi, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
$Microphone not activated)

The family names, could you spell them?
@A.
Mbonyubwe is spelt -- the other name was Somayire.   Mbonyubwe is spelt, M-B-O-N-Y-U-B-W-E.  Minani is spelt M-I-N-A-N-I; and Somayire is spelt S-O-M-A-Y-I-R-E.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So these were three persons that erected the roadblock, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
I am referring to two persons, sir.  Minani, Somayire -- Somayire is the first name; Somayire Minani.

And do you know the first name of Mr. Mbonyubwe?
@THE WITNESS:
He was not a Christian; he had not been baptised.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
And are you saying that these persons were from outside the commune in which you lived, that is, they were not original inhabitants? 
@A.
They came from a neighbouring secteur, but they were from the same commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Now, why did they erect that roadblock; why did they set it up?
@A.
They erected the roadblock in order to be able to control the population.  When people went by, they asked them to pay a fee; it was a manner of stealing.
@MR. BESNIER:
Couldn't the population defend itself against these people; couldn't it repel these people?
@A.
Those thieves were very powerful, sir.  And among the population, there were honest people that didn't want to put up a fight against thieves.  They say to themselves, "I cannot dare confront them because they might attack me in my own house".  This was the type of situation that was prevalent at the same -- at that period in terms of security. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, people were killed at that roadblock; is that correct?
@A.
Personally, I didn't see anybody being killed at the roadblock.
@MR. BESNIER:
You said earlier on that Tutsi were killed in your area.  Where were the Tutsi killed, precisely?
@A.
They were killed in that cellule, but not at the roadblock.
@MR. BESNIER:
At which location, at which site, precisely?
@A.
Now, if I gave the names of persons that were killed, wouldn't that be preferable?
@MR. BESNIER:
I want to know the precise location at which those people were killed.
@A.
There were persons that were killed at Gitaka, but not near the roadblock at all.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was it very far from the roadblock?
@A.
Yes, sir.  It was at around 25 metres from the roadblock, that is, 25 to 30 metres.
@MR. BESNIER:
The persons you referred to earlier on, Mbonyubwe and Minani Somayire, were those same people that killed -- that were killing the Tutsi?
@A.
No, sir.  They did not kill anybody.  They just made do with stealing, except they killed people elsewhere, but on that site they did not kill anybody at that site.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now let us focus on the people who killed -- who were killing the Tutsi.  Who were these people; could you say?
@A.
Yes, I could do that.  There was a team that was headed by Rukundakuvuga, Alphonse, who was from Kayenzi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it necessary for us to have it spelt, Mr. President?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a name that we have heard before.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Rukundakuvuga and the people with him were they natives of your own cellule or were they from another cellule?
@A.
They were from a neighbouring secteur, that is the Kayenzi secteur.  All those people were from the neighbouring secteur of Kayenzi.  We weren't many and we didn't have strength.
@MR. BESNIER:
So, if I get you correctly, there were two distinct events; on the one hand, a group of thieves that were at the roadblock, and on the other hand, there was a group killing the Tutsis; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, the killers, the Tutsi killers, where were they located or stationed?
@A.
They came in from their secteur and came into our cellule and spent the day chasing people, and when they caught somebody they killed that person.  This is what they did.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, you yourself, could you tell me about your activities during the genocide?
@A.
I tried to hide some people, but since I wasn't strong enough, those people were chased away and some of those people died.  I do not know where they were killed, but personally I was able to save one child.  This was one of the things I did.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, during the genocide in 1994, did you travel out of your cellule?
@A.
With the exception of one day when the minister came to our cellule -- he's a native of that cellule -- when he came he realised that members of his family had been killed.  He realised that his cousins had been killed and he got enraged, and he thought that perhaps I was one of the killers of his cousins.  He wanted to arrest one of the murderers who fled, and he said, "I will arrest you.  I will arrest you because I am not sure of your behaviour.  I will take you back to the commune so that you explain what happened, because you were there." 
He took me to the commune and when we got to the communal office I spent a night in the communal cell, but I didn't have any problems.  It was a matter of making investigations to ensure whether or not I was one of the murderers.  And when he realised that I didn't participate in the killings, and that, rather, I tried to save a child from his own family, because it was the child of his cousin, I was released the next day.  In the morning I went back home. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, we shall come back to that episode later.  
You have talked about a minister.  What's the name of the minister?  Which minister was that?
@A.
That was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before that?
@A.
Yes, I used to know him.  I knew him because he was a native of our secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
For how long a period did you know him?
@A.
I knew him since his wedding.  When he got married, I was living at the centre and I used to see him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi living in Gasharu in 1994?
@A.
No, he used to live in Kigali at that time.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he come to Gasharu frequently?
@A.
No, sir, he came about once a year; he didn't come often.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know, since you lived in that area, do you know whether Ndindabahizi ever had functions in the Kibuye préfecture?
@A.
No, sir, not to my knowledge, no.  When I knew him he used to work in Kigali, and since his wedding he had been working in Kigali, he had never worked in Kibuye.
@MR. BESNIER:
So, you are saying that Mr. Ndindabahizi came to your cellule during the genocide.  At what precise date was that?
@A.
I do not remember the date, but it was at the beginning of the month of June when the interim government had moved away from Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying the beginning of the month of June; is that correct?  Very well.
@A.
Yes, it was in June.  It was either the 30th --
@MR. BESNIER:
The 31st, you are saying, I heard you saying the 31st; and was it May or June?
@A.
I am talking about the end of the month of May.  I do not remember the precise date.  I cannot give you a precise date, but it was around the end of the month of May or at the beginning of June.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I do understand that.  
Now, before that day, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in your cellule?
@A.
That was the only time that he came to our cellule, that is, after the eruption of the war.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, when he came on that day, did you see him arrive?
@A.
I am telling you that -- I was just saying that he took me to Kibuye.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but do you know how he got there in terms of means of transport?
@A.
He came on a vehicle.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you remember the type of vehicle?  Could you give us the make of the vehicle, or can you describe it?
@A.
It was a minibus.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were there other persons accompanying Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
He was with a soldier that drove him.  He was his driver and he was also in the company of two children and one other person.
@MR. BESNIER:
Two children, you say, Witness?
@A.
Yes, sir.  Those are the people I was able to see.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know who those children were?
@A.
Perhaps they were his own children.  I saw that there were small bags in the vehicle, and perhaps they were running away.  Perhaps they were his children or his friend's children, but I had the impression that he had some special relations with those children.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Ndindabahizi alight from his vehicle; did he come out of his vehicle?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what did he do when he came out of the vehicle?
@A.
He came down from the vehicle and went to visit his sister, and then we went together to Kibuye, so that you went foot by foot. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, we will proceed gradually.  Where was the sister living?
@A.
In Gisharu, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Please refrain from calling the names of those locations. 
@A.
It was his sister that lived in the family house.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, kindly listen to my questions properly, and please be careful not to identify yourself in answering my questions.  
Now, the question is the house in which the Accused's sister lived, was it far away from the place that the Accused parked his vehicle?
@A.
Yes, there was some distance because the road didn't go up to the house.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the distance you are talking about here, Witness?
@A.
It will take about 15 minutes on foot from the centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Did you accompany Ndindabahizi when he went up to visit the sister?
@A.
No.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Did he then come back, and did you see him?
@A.
Yes.
@A.
I believe he stayed with the sister for about an hour; I believe it was an hour.  I went to church and when I came back from church he was coming back from the sister's.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  What did he say or do when he came back and when you saw him again?
@A.
When he came back he said, "Who gave you the orders to kill people?  Who killed Tutsi?  Where are the members -- where are my relatives who live here?"
@A.
He was talking to Equinico (phonetic) who is also called Gatete, because members of the population had just told him that this was the man who killed the people, and this person fled immediately.
@MR. BESNIER:
Had the people gathered at that time?
@A.
It was a Sunday and most people were coming back from church.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we didn't get the beginning of Counsel's question.
@THE WITNESS:
No, it was on the road when people were coming back from church.  They go through that centre to get to other secteurs such as Kayenzi and our own secteur, so this was -- people necessarily had to go through here when they are coming from church. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This person called Gatete, what was his other name you said?
@THE WITNESS:
Augustin. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Let me take you to a little before Gatete.  Ndindabahizi went back to the home where he visited a sister, and then he meets a number of people; were you yourself present?
@A.
Yes, I was there.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you said Ndindabahizi asked who -- asked about who killed his relatives?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Had his -- had his relatives been, in fact, killed?
@A.
Yes, they had been killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to mention names of relatives of Ndindabahizi who were killed during the war?
@A.
I know Karegeya, Cyprien, who was his cousin.
@MR. BESNIER:
How was Cyprien Karegeya killed?
@A.
He gave me the piece of land on which I built my house.  There were many people involved in the attack, but I was able to identify the person who was leading the attackers, and his name is 
Évareste Bapfakurera; he was leading the attack.
@MR. BESNIER:
When to your recollection was Cyprien Karegeya killed?
@A.
It was during the month of April; however, I have no specific recollection of the dates. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you an eyewitness to this killing; did you see this killing yourself?
@A.
No.  When they took him away there was a good person who came and told me that, "Your boss has been arrested. He's been taken to the Buye secteur."  There was a young girl that I was hiding, and when they took him they said, "These same people will come for the girl and kill her along -- together with Cyprien."  I could not defend her.  I run, took the girl and hid her elsewhere, and when they came to my house to look for her, they could not find her because I had taken her elsewhere.  That was the only person that I could save.  But today she is a married woman, and I believe she was before Your Honours yesterday in this courtroom. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you go a bit slower with this part of the evidence, Defence Counsel?  It went too fast.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you want us to come back?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could follow the witness step by step in relation to this episode.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, let's backtrack to the killing of Karegeya.  You said you were not an eyewitness; is that correct?
@A.
It is true, I was not an eyewitness, but I saw him being taken away by the leader of the attackers whose name is Évareste Bapfakurera. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Where was Cyprien Karegeya when he was taken away by Bapfakurera?
@A.
Évareste arrested him in the Buye secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you present when Évareste -- when Évareste identified Karegeya and arrested him?
@A.
No, but I saw Évareste take Karegeya away, and I believe he is the one responsible for his death, because he took him away to be killed.  Évareste, who is the leader of the attackers, is still alive and I believe he should be held responsible, together with his accomplices who should all be held responsible for the killing of Mr. Karegeya. 
@MR. BESNIER:
You say that Évareste took Karegeya away; where did they take him?
@A.
They killed him at the Gitaka centre.  It is a bit uphill in Nyakabungo. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Bapfakurera alone on this occasion or were there others?
@A.
He was leading a massive attack.  There were many, but I was careful enough to be able to identify who the leader of the attackers was, so that later on I could give explanations with regard to the death of my boss.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why do you refer to Karegeya as your boss?
@A.
I say that because he is giving me a lot of things.  I did say that he gave me the piece of land on which I built my house.
@MR. BESNIER:
In summary, if I understood you well, would it be correct to say that you did not witness the arrest of Karegeya, that you also did not witness his killing, and that you only witnessed that episode during which Karageya was being taken away?
@A.
Yes, you are right.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did you witness that episode, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
During the month of April.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you be more precise?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I have no specific date.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
First or second half of April?
@MR. WITNESS:
It was in the middle of the month of April.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, what did you do next?  What did you witness in relation to the killing of Karageya?
@A.
What I managed to see is that when I heard about his death, they showed me where his body was lying, and I myself organised his burial.  I called the people around and we buried him; we buried him decently.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you bury him?
@A.
I asked Atami Siborami (phonetic), who is a trader at Rubengera, he has a house in Gitaka.  He gave me a piece of land where we could bury him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I believe this episode is quite clear.  
Now, you made reference to a young girl that you gave -- that you were hiding?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
For how long did you hide this young girl?
@A.
Since the death of her father and her mother, I told her that, "Since your parents are dead, let us accept that we die together; instead of spending all the time running around in the bush and hiding come and stay with me and, God willing, our lives will be saved."  Fortunately, God was on our side, and I was able to hide her.  We survived, and today she has two children. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the relationship between this young girl that you were hiding and Cyprien Karageya, if any?
@A.
She was the daughter of Karageya.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, I believe that is very clear.
Now, regarding Tutsis, were there a lot of Tutsis in your cellule?
@A.
Yes, there were.
@MR. BESNIER:
What would be the proportion?  Were there more Tutsis than Hutus or more Hutus than Tutsis? 
@A.
There were more Tutsis than Hutus.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, let's go back to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's visit to the cellule.  We got to the stage where he was talking to the people and asking questions regarding the death of some of his relatives.  Do you recall that?
@A.
Yes, I do, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
What did he say or do after these questions?
@A.
He did nothing else.  He got angry and told me, "You have to give some explanations and say how these people died, because they were your neighbours."  We could see that he was very angry.  You cannot get to a place, realise that your relatives had been killed and not get angry, and you say that the person who was present should explain the death of these people.  So he was furious, but we understand his fury.  You yourself would have had the same reaction if your relatives were exterminated.  When you go to the site where they were exterminated, I believe you would have reacted in the same manner.  
Subsequently, he conducted an investigation and realised that I was not involved in the death of his relatives, and that's how come I was released. 
@MR. BESNIER:
But why did he arrest you in particular?
@A.
It was because I was living there.  Most of the other people were just passing by; they were passers-by, and the other person had just fled.  He had been told that the killer was there, but that he had fled.  And, besides, this murderer lived in another secteur.  I was the only person who lived in that place, and I was the only person who could explain the death of his relatives.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we only heard "barrier" out of that question from Counsel. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You said there was a murderer who was present; who was this murderer?
@A.
I am talking about Augustin Turukinkintu Gatete (phonetic).
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We only heard Gatete from Counsel's question. 
@THE WITNESS:
No, Gatete fled; he fled. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Ndindabahizi was -- Karara's name was -- Ndindabahizi was told that Karara is innocent and this is Gatete.  Gatete fled.  He fled towards his secteur; they were not able to get him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It has happened on a few occasions now, Mr. Besnier, that because the French translation comes quicker than the English, that the English booth is not able to hear your question, and then we lack the context of the answer.  So, please, remember the pause. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I shall do that, Your Honour.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
So, Witness, we are at a stage, if I understood you clearly, the people have told Mr. Ndindabahizi -- they have pointed out to Mr. Ndindabahizi, a certain Gatete; is that correct?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What did Ndindabahizi do in relation to this Gatete?
@A.
Gatete fled; Ndindabahizi was not able to get him.  He was not able to arrest him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Before Gatete fled, did Ndindabahizi attempt to arrest him?
@A.
They went -- many people were greeting Ndindabahizi because many people hadn't seen him for a long time.  Those who knew were saying, "This is the person who killed the wives of the Hutus."  When Gatete heard this, he fled immediately. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Ndindabahizi chase him?
@A.
There were many houses around; he could not get him.  There were a lot of houses around.  It was impossible to give him a chase and arrest him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who had Gatete killed, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
He led attacks in his secteur.  He killed a lot of people.  I could, for example, talk about my nephews, eight of my nephews that he killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And Mr. Ndindabahizi first arrested you and you were released after --
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, the following day I was released.  In fact, if I was arrested, it was to enable him to conduct his investigations for him to know if I knew how his relatives were killed.  And I explained to him that I was able to save a child and that if we had the means -- if he had the means, he could take this child with him so that she's not killed.  And when he heard that, indeed, I was hiding the child, and when he heard that the child was still alive, the following day I believe he ordered that I be released.  A policeman came to tell me that I could go to him.  I believe he was able to conduct his investigations.  He found out that I was hiding the child, and so he sent a policeman to release me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did Mr. Gatete play any role in killing relatives of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@THE WITNESS:
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This episode with Mr. Gatete, when did that take place compared to the day when you were accused of having been involved?
@THE WITNESS:
No.  Soon after the death of President Habyarimana, Gatete started killing people.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But now Defence Counsel is, I understand, questioning you about when Mr. Ndindabahizi was seeking Mr. Gatete; is that correct, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
Gatete fled. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did Mr. Ndindabahizi try to get Mr. Gatete?
@THE WITNESS:
I believe that if Gatete had stayed there, Ndindabahizi would have arrested him.  He asked about the whereabouts of Gatete; nobody knew where he had gone.  He was somebody who was not used to that neighbourhood, but I believe that if Gatete had stayed Ndindabahizi would have arrested him. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, why Mr. Ndindabahizi wanted to arrest Gatete when he was not involved in the killing of his relative, Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
You know a minister has authority over the entire territory; no one can prevent him from doing what he wants to do.  He was somebody who was defending the entire population.  He is like a father to the entire population.
@JUDGE KAHN:
Did he want to arrest the entire killers, all the killers?
@THE WITNESS:
If he was able to find them, he would have arrested them --
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@THE WITNESS:
-- because what they did was shocking.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness. You are talking about two different episodes.  In the first one, Mr. Ndindabahizi arrests you, in the second one; he is trying to arrest Gatete.  Did these two events take place the same day?
@A.
Yes, the same day.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Did he, first of all, try to arrest Gatete, or he first arrested you?
@A.
The people came to greet him.  Gatete did not know the minister and the minister did not know Gatete.  But the minister asked, "Who ordered you to kill other people?  Are you not ashamed to kill?"  He told me, "I know you.  You were a neighbour to my relatives, and you are going to explain to me how he was killed -- how they were killed."  And people said, "This person is innocent.  This is the guilty one; he is the one who killed the people.  Gatete, Augustin, he is the one who killed a lot of people."  When he heard that, when Gatete heard that, he fled immediately.  He did not hail from that cellule.  He went to his native Kayenzi secteur, and we did not see him again.
@MR. BESNIER:
And then, why did Mr. Ndindabahizi turn against you?
@A.
It was so that I can explain the death or the circumstances of the death of his cousins, because I was their neighbours.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the lapse of time between the flight of Gatete and your arrest?
@A.
The minister wanted to go home, and this happened around 14 hours; it was a Sunday, after church services, and he left at 14 hours. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there a lot of -- a long time, a lot of minutes between the sudden flight of Gatete and your arrest?
@A.
No, I was there.  I was talking to Ndindabahizi, and Gatete left.  So I was arrested immediately after his flight.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you go, together with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
He took me to the commune office.
@MR. BESNIER:
To what place in particular?
@A.
The commune office of Gitesi commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was that a prison?  What room did he take you to in particular?
@A.
Yes, he took me to the jailhouse of the communal office.
@MR. BESNIER:
For how long did you remain in that jail?
@A.
I spent a night there, and the following day I went back home.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who released you?
@A.
A policeman.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you, Mr. Witness.  I think that's quite clear.  Let's now move on to another subject.
Since you were living in that cellule, can you tell us whether persons of authority came to supervise or coordinate the killings of the Tutsi?
@A.
No, there were none; no person of authority came.  The only authority, and only once by the way, was the former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, he came at the beginning of the war.  He came in order to have people flee, and his vehicle left with some people.  When he went further away, he found that there was a lot of insecurity and that made him not come back.  In fact, he had come as a saviour.  He had wanted to have these people to flee towards Kibuye, but when he got to Kibuye, he found that the security situation was bad, and for this reason he never came back. 
@MR. BESNIER:
When you speak of a former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, can you mention his name for us?
@A.
It was Mr. Augustin Karara. 
@MR. BESNIER:
No, I do apologise.  
Would you by chance have gone to the home of this bourgmestre, this former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune?
@A.
No.  No one as big as myself could move around.  If I had done so, I would have --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Mr. President, could Counsel state that again.  The interpretation had not been completed in the other booth so I missed the beginning of his question.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
My previous question is that -- did you -- my previous question was, did you ever go to that former bourgmestre's home in order to give him a message?
@A.
No.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you quite certain about never having -- one moment, please, Mr. Witness, I haven't quite finished with my question.  
Are you quite sure that you never left your cellule between the beginning of the events of the genocide and the end of those events, except when you went to the Gitesi commune office?
@A.
It was only on that day that I moved about.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the cellule where you were, Mr. Witness, can you please tell us whether Tutsi refugees were hiding nearby?
@A.
I didn't see any.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were Tutsi refugees able to hide near you without -- near the house where you were without being identified by the killers or flushed out by the killers?
@A.
There was no hiding place.  There was no hiding place close by where I lived.   Had there been, I would have told you that it would have been possible for those Tutsis to hide there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Wouldn't it have been a good idea for the Tutsis to hide in the bushes near the roadblock so that they could see what was happening?
@A.
No.  The roadblock was on the road and we were above the road, and there were no bushes where those people could hide, and my house was about two metres away from the road.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  In your written statement you spoke of one Gatwa, spelt G-A-T-W-A, who helped you to bury Karageya.  Could you please tell us who this Gatwa was?
@A.
He was a trader at that centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was he married?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
To which ethnic group did his wife belong?
@A.
She was Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did she survive?
@A.
No, she was killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was she killed before or after Ndindabahizi's visit?
@A.
It was before Mr. Ndindabahizi's visit.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the cellule to which we are referring, do you know whether Europeans constructed a building before the war?
@A.
Yes, the Swiss had built a building there in -- around 1978, and there were people who were studying at Nyabahanga who came there to take courses. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was that building still having activities taking place in it during the war?
@A.
No.  No, that building was very old.  There were no activities taking place therein.  The activities in that building stopped around 1980-1982.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did that building have a kitchen?
@A.
There was a kitchen next to the building.
@MR. BESNIER:
If you were to concentrate on the roadblock, can you tell us how far the kitchen, would have been?
@A.
I would say about 150 metres, between 120 and 150 metres.
@MR. BESNIER:
If you were now able to put yourself inside that kitchen would you be able to see what was happening at the roadblock?
@A.
No.  And that's because the kitchen is in a corner, and even when one is at the marketplace, one cannot see neither the house nor the kitchen.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can one hear words being spoken at the roadblock if one is in the kitchen?
@A.
No.  It's far away; you cannot hear people speaking at the roadblock.  If you cannot see the building itself, you wouldn't be able to hear people who are discussing at that place. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.

Mr. President, Your Honours, I have concluded with my examination-in-chief of this Witness.

I lived in that cellule when I was very young.  In 1971 -- I began my trading activities in that cellule after 1971, but it was in 1984 that I married while I was still living in that cellule. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
So, by 1994, how long had you been staying in that cellule?
@A.
I had just spent 10 years there, and I am telling you 10 years of marriage in that cellule, because even before I got married I was living in that cellule.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  You testified that Mr. Cyprien Karageya is the person who gave you a piece of land; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did he give you freely or did you buy it from him?
@A.
He gave me that piece of land free of charge.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, following the death of the president, you -- you have told this Tribunal that the security situation was not good in that cellule; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that's correct. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, during that period you were the con -- you were the responsable of that cellule; is that correct?
@A.
No, I was not the responsable de cellule.

$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, at what time in the course of your life were you a responsable of a cellule?
@A.
I was never a responsable of that cellule.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So when your counsel -- when the Defence show in some documents that you were formally a responsable, they are not reflecting the truth of your position -- as regards your position; is that correct?
@A.
I was a member of the cellule committee, but I was never a responsable of any cellule, so you need to make a distinction between a member of a cellule committee and a responsable of a cellule.
@MR. KAPAYA:
My question was: If somebody showed that you were formally a responsable, they couldn't possibly be telling the truth?
@A.
Yes, on the document mentioned that I was responsable de cellule, that wouldn't be correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, as a member of the cellule, the committee of the cellule, it was part of their responsibilities to oversee security matters in the cellule; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, but during the period in question, I was not a member of the cellule.   Elections had been organised before the war, and I was no longer a member of the cellule committee.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us who was the responsable for the cellule in which you were living in April '94?
@A.
It was Simeon Sengimana.  Sengimana is spelt S-E-N-G-E -- G-I, I am sorry, G-I-M-A-N-A, Sengimana.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, when - following the death of the president when the war broke out, did the responsable organise -- take any defensive measures against the attacks in the cellule?
@A.
No, he was killed.
@MR. KAPAYA:
As for the rest of the population, did you hold any -- did you conduct any night patrols because of the 
-- because of the war in April?
@A.
No, we couldn't organise night patrols because there were thieves who came from more or less everywhere.  Neighbours were trying to come together in order to protect the houses in their neighbourhood, but we didn't have any night patrols.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Who was responsible for organising the neighbours to come together to repel the attacks from -- the external attacks?
@A.
No, there was no one really responsible as such.  People could decide to remain by the house of one neighbour, maybe numbering five, and the next morning they would probably decide to go and spend the time next to someone else's house.  This is because we didn't have enough means to ensure our protection.  It's more by the grace of God that people were able to survive and protect their property.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, in the -- the violence that erupted following the death of the president, who -- can you tell us who was attacking whom, Mr. Witness?
@A.
It's the Tutsis who were being attacked.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And why were the Tutsis being attacked?
@A.
It's because it is the Tutsis who were being pursued.  They were the ones who were being sought.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us the reason why they were being sought?
@A.
How do you want me to know that?  Violence took place everywhere in the country.  Sometimes you were told it's the Tutsis who were the target of the attacks, but I cannot tell you that it was for this or that reason.  It was just bad chance which was -- it was just a curse which was playing in -- against the Tutsi.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So it's your testimony that it was because of the curse that the Hutu were seeking for the Tutsi?
@A.
No, they were the attackers who were attacking the Tutsis.  I would rather say that it was the Hutus who were cursed because they were unjustly attacking the Tutsis.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, did some Tutsis seek refuge at Kirambo church?  Are you aware of that, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, there were Tutsis who took refuge in that church, but when the bourgmestre came to fetch them in order to take them to Kibuye, all he did was to take some of them.  But when he went back, he realised that there wasn't any security, and he was unable to move the rest, the remaining Tutsis. Given that situation, the Tutsis dispersed.  Some tried to go to Kibuye on foot, others were killed, but there were some who managed to reach Kibuye on foot.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, how did the bourgmestre know that there were some people seeking refuge in Kirambo?  Could you help us with that, please?
@A.
There was a telephone line in that place.  The bourgmestre was called by phone.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, did you also go to Kirambo, to Kirambo church at any time during the course of the war?
@A.
No, I didn't go there that day.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness was it -- is it not true that the roadblock was part of the security measures that was taken by the cellule leadership to protect itself against the attacks?
@A.
No, roadblocks were erected in order to limit banditry.  And when you approached a roadblock, you were asked to show your identity documents, and people tried to find out who you were.  But let me tell you that the Tutsis were afraid.  They couldn't go near anywhere where there were roadblocks.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, the roadblock was hardly  ... ...  from your business centre; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And at what point in time exactly was it erected in April?
@A.
It was at the end of the massacres when the Hutus began to attack their, their Tutsi countrymen by taking their property.  I will tell you that it was around the 20th that the roadblock was erected, and it was only up for about two weeks.
@MR. KAPAYA:

Now, because of the roadblock was quite close to your business enterprise, you could see who the people were manning that roadblock, couldn't you?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, can you tell us who those people were?
@A.
There was one Mbonyubwe, which is spelt M-B-O-N-Y-U-B-W-E, and the other was known as Minani, Somayire.  Minani is spelt M-I-N-A-N-I.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, was Joël Ndabukiye not one of people who were manning that roadblock?
@A.
No, Joël didn't go to that roadblock.  Rather, Ndabukiye -- or rather, Minani and Ndabukiye's brother, whose house was just next to the roadblock?
@MR. KAPAYA:
How about Emmanuel, the son?  Do you know Emmanuel, the son of Mr. Ndabukiye?
@A.
Yes, I know him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was he one of the people who were manning that roadblock?
@A.
No, it was, rather, his uncle who was at the roadblock with one Somayire Minani, who lived in Kayenzi, but the house belonged to Ndabukiye.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, do you know that Joël Ndabukiye is in prison now?
@A.
Yes, I know that he is detained at the Gisovu prison.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And are you aware that he is detained because of his activities at that particular roadblock in 1994?
@A.
No, I don't know why he is in detention.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And that he has made a confession to some of the activities that he undertook at that particular roadblock?  Are you aware of that, Mr. Witness?
@A.
No, I don't know about that.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, with --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What were the other names you referred to, Mr. Witness, concerning those manning the roadblock?  We have, of course, Mbonyubwe and Somayire, but then you came up with a few others.  Could you repeat those names, please?
@THE WITNESS: 
I mentioned Minani. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that the only one that you mentioned in addition to these two?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, sir.  Those were the only names I mentioned. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, we have Mbonyubwe and Minani Somayire.  These are two names.  But didn't you, responding to a question from Mr. Kapaya, mention some other names in connection with the roadblock, or did you not?  I have heard, for instance, you say his uncle was there, his uncle was there?
@THE WITNESS: 
I only mentioned Mbonyubwe, who was not baptised.  It was only Minani that had another name or first name, that is, Sumiyarire.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to avoid confusion, you remember you were asked whether Emmanuel, son of Joël, was at the roadblock, and you said no.  Isn't that correct?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I said he wasn't there.  I didn't see him at the roadblock.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, did you then continue saying that his uncle was there?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, that was his uncle, because Mbonyubwe is the young brother of Joël.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Do you know one Rukundakuvuga, and tell us whether or not he was at that roadblock?
@A.
I know Rukundakuvuga.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, did you or did you not see him at the roadblock?
@A.
He came by the roadblock during the time he was participating in the attacks, and it was the time he was leading the attacks, so that he passed by the roadblocks with the attackers as the leader of the attackers' group.
@MR. KAPAYA:
My question is, Mr. Witness, is whether this individual participated in the manning of the roadblock?  Did he or did he not, according to you?
@A.
No, sir.

Do you know Sendiragora?
@A.
Yes, I know Sendiragora very well.

Sorry.  What is the relationship between him and Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I don't know the relationship between him and Ndindabahizi, sir.
@MR. KAPAYA:
You don't know the relationship between the two or -- are you saying that you do not know the relationship between the two or there is no relationship between the two?
@A.
I don't know where Sendiragora is from to be able to tell you what type of relationship there may be, but I do know the sister who takes care of his property.
@MR. KAPAYA:
We'll come to the sister later on.  I was asking about Sendiragora first.  Now, could you tell us whether or not these --
@A.
I know Sendiragora; I do not know the relationship between himself and Ndindabahizi.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us whether he participated in the manning of the roadblock at Gitaka?
@A.
I don't know whether he collaborated with the people that were manning the roadblock, but the people I saw quite often were the two that I mentioned to you.  Those are the two people that were there all time throughout the day at the roadblock.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, do you know a person by Tatiane Nyiramaritete?
@A.
Yes, I know that person.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us what she did for a living?
@A.
He was a teacher - rather, she was a teacher.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, during the course -- during the genocide, did she seek refuge at Joël Ndabukiye's?
@A.
I didn't monitor the events to determine whether he went to his (sic) house, but I saw the attackers who led him (sic) and who had just led him (sic) out of Pascal Ruhara's, and it was through Rukundakuvuga who was leading the attackers.  I saw these people pass by.  I saw Rukundakuvuga in the group that was leading that person away, but I was not able to identify all the people that were in the group of attackers.  It was only Rukundakuvuga that I was able to identify because it was during the daytime.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, did that lady at any time in April or May seek refuge at the residence of Joël Ndabukiye, yes or no?
@A.
No, I don't know whether she sought refuge at Ndabukiye's.  I saw the attackers lead him (sic) out of Pascal's house.  Pascal's house had been looted.  His chairs were taken away, and it was Rukundakuvuga who led the attackers that led that person away.  I don't know whether he was at Joël Ndabukiye's at one time or the other.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who was Pascal, Mr. Witness?  Why did you refer to Pascal now?
@THE WITNESS: 
This Pascal Ruhara and it was at his house that Tatiane had kept some furniture.  And the attack led by Rukundakuvuga was led to loot the furniture that she had kept at Ruhara's.  Now, when I saw the attackers pass by, the attackers were carrying the furniture.

And when was this?
@THE WITNESS: 
That was the month of April.

At the beginning of the war activities ceased so that I was unable to carry on with my activities, but before that I had a restaurant, and at a given time I had a shop, a small shop.  At the beginning of the war, people could come and borrow goods without paying, and I decided to stop my activities up to the end of the war.

Is it your testimony that in April-May you were not operating your business?
@A.
No, sir.

I explained to her who the leader of the attackers was because I did see him, but I couldn't tell whether it was that person that killed the father or whether it was another attacker, but I told her who the leader of the attackers was that took his father -- her father away.

@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, three things, Mr. President.  Firstly, this document was not disclosed to the Defence.  Secondly, it is in Kinyarwanda, and we don't understand it.  And three, there is only one word in French in this document -- one sentence.  This sentence is, "Minutes of the hearing of the suspect," whereas earlier on, the Prosecutor asked witness whether he was heard by the judicial police as a witness.  
Now, the witness different from the Accused.  I think that the question was not properly put to the witness, and if we are to come back to this issue, we should ask witness whether he was heard in the past as an accused.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
If I could get that document back.  Which paragraph are you referring to the French document, please?  Just before you give it to me, which paragraph of that document do we find this reference to the French information, please?

I have to address the Court on this.  I don't see what the cause for alarm is.  My learned friend has asked questions of this witness extensively and seeks to impeach his credibility with a document.  Now, whether it's in Kinyarwanda, French or English, in my respectfully submission is completely, you know, not so relevant in this instance.  We have given the Kinyarwanda booth two copies of this document, and what my learned friend proposes to do is to have them read the content of this document into the record.

@THE WITNESS: 
It was just after the end of the war.  After the end of the war people came and went to the courthouse, and you were summoned because of your property, and you were told that you were guilty of having murdered somebody and you were imprisoned.  And when you were imprisoned you stayed imprisoned, whereas the real killers were free and they were all known.  Nothing was done to them. Investigations were carried out, and when you were proven to be innocent, you were released.  
You talked to me about an IPJ, a Rwandan IPJ.  I did not understand that you meant the IPJ of the commune.  But that was what happened:  People wrongly accused you whereas the people who were really guilty were around.

In this interview, the persons you give as responsible for the killings in that cellule are different from the ones you have described in this Tribunal today, correct?
@A.
I have already spoken about Rukundakuvuga, but I did not see the other persons kill anybody, but I saw them in a group of attackers.  I saw them loot.  And besides, they were not from our cellule.
@MR. KAPAYA:
In '98, you were asked about the people or the person who killed Karegeya.  You said you did not know, whereas today you are telling us it was Bapfakurera or something in this group, correct?
@A.
Yes, now I have conducted my investigations and I know who killed him. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
But the circumstances under which you described the arrest of Karegeya in your testimony today is very different from the circumstances you described to the IPJ in Kibuye; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, at that time I hadn't conducted any investigations and I did not know the circumstances of his death.  I needed to conduct investigations and do some analysis.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, you didn't have to conduct any investigations because you told us here that you saw Bapfakurera and his company taking Karegeya to his death, so there is no question -- the question of you conducting investigations does not arise?
@A.
I did not know the name of this person.  I just knew him by sight, and he was somebody who comes from a neighbouring secteur.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, this person whom you described in this Tribunal as having taken part in the killing of Karegeya, have you had any contact with him, Bapfakurera?
@A.
No, we are not neighbours.  I have no contact with him.  He is in -- he lives in a different secteur from mine.  I got to know his name because he's a cobbler, a shoemaker.  I just knew him by sight, but I did not know his name, but later on I got to know his name.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you know whether he has made a confession before the Rwandan courts and do you know whether or not he mentions, as a witness, you in that confession?
@A.
I do not know this.  He is in prison.  I do not know what happened to him, but people know that he is the one who committed this crime.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Are you aware that -- whether he has made any confession that he killed Karegeya?  To your knowledge, has he confessed the killing of Karegeya?
@A.
I am not aware.  He is in prison.  He is in prison in Gisovu, and I have no contact with him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And you are not a witness to any of this man's confessions before the IPJ or in Gisovu?
@A.
The IPJ was in Kibuye.
@MR. KAPAYA:
In your statement dated 6 August 2003 you made before the Defence investigators, you state on 
page 2 -- on the third page, the English translation, last page, on the top you say, "I learned about Karegeya's death, but I was not an eye-witness.  I learnt that he had been killed by a group led by Bapfakurera, currently in Gisovu prison."
Now, what is the basis of your -- of this statement?  After all, you said, "Besides, he pleaded guilty".  That's what you say.  Now, what is the basis of this information? 
@A.
No, I don't know if he pleaded guilty.  What I know is that he is in prison in Gisovu and that he is the perpetrator of that crime.  I knew he was the leader of the attackers, but prior to that I did not know his name.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, you told the Defence investigators that Bapfakurera pleaded guilty, did you not?
@A.
No.  I told him that he was in prison.  Maybe they know that he pleaded guilty.  I wouldn't know.  How am I supposed to know?
@MR. KAPAYA:
So they fabricated, your statement; is that correct?
@A.
They got it wrong, but I know that he is in prison in Gisovu.  That's one thing I know.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, can you describe to this Tribunal how the Defence investigators took this statement from you? Can you tell us, please?
@A.
He asked me questions and I answered them.  I gave them explanations in relation to the questions that they asked me.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And then you signed that statement.  And then they read it over to you, they read the statement over and you signed it?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay.  Now, let's turn to the visit by -- the alleged visit by Mr. Ndindabahizi in your place.  When do you place that visit?  When did Mr. Ndindabahizi come to Gishaka -- to your place of --
@A.
He came at the beginning of June.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What makes you think that it was in June and not in July or May?
@A.
No, it was not in May.  When he came, a few days later we were in July.  That's why I'm saying it was in June.  Maybe it was towards the end of May.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, how did the people -- how did people know that Ndindabahizi had come to that area?
@A.
It was a Sunday, and to go to his house you have to go through the centre.  So people coming from church went through the centre and they were able to see him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, when you say that people said you were responsible for the killings in that cellule, did the people raise up their hands and point you out, or how did Ndindabahizi get that kind of information?
@A.
This was when people were appropriating other people's property.  In those days people said, "You have killed somebody."  And even if later on the person who is supposed to be the victim is seen alive, they have already taken your property and you have already been accused.  So there were people who were killed even though they were innocent.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Let me tell you, Mr. Witness, what the problem Mr. Ndindabahizi found with you was that you were protecting Tutsis in your residence.  What do you say to that?
@A.
No, that was not the reason.  It was, rather, because when he came, he found no member of his family who had survived.
@MR. KAPAYA:
You were reputed to be protecting Tutsi, and that is Mr. Ndindabahizi ordered your arrest?
@A.
He was investigating, and he thought I participated in the killing of his cousins.  And if indeed I were guilty, I would not have been a free man, and I would not have lived in that place and -- I would not have lived in that place together with those who had lived there for years.
@MR. KAPAYA:
You were also accused of stealing his land that is why he arrested you, his land and cows?
@A.
No.  If I wanted to appropriate his land, I would have started by killing his child who was with me.  How could I have appropriated his land when his child was still alive?
@MR. KAPAYA:
And that is why when you went to Kibuye, you had rested there overnight and came back?
@A.
Yes, because he realised that I was innocent.  People can lie, but he examined the situation closely and realised that I was innocent.  Even children knew how their cows were looted, who looted and under what circumstances.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, you testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi came from the cellule in which you are residence, correct?  And that he aware that in April and May, the war was raging on in his cellule of origin, correct?
@A.
Yes, at the beginning of the month of May the war had ended; there were no more killings.  When he came, there were no more killings.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Why do you think Ndindabahizi would wait for two months to come to his cellule of origin when he knew that he had Tutsis relatives and Tutsis were being killed in Rwanda?  Why taking two months and not just a week or so if you are late?
@A.
I think where he was he had friends and the situation was serious.  Maybe he was taking care of his friends.  I don't know what he was doing where he was because I was not there.  I have no way of knowing.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I put to you that Ndindabahizi came to that cellule in April and May and not June, as you allege?
@A.
No, he did not come in April.  He came at the beginning of June, not in April.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, are you aware of the 3rd of May meeting in Kibuye?
@A.
No. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
You never heard that in May, on the 3rd May, the prime minister of the republic of Rwanda visited Kibuye and held a meeting in Kibuye?
@A.
From my place to Kibuye is a long distance.  Kibuye is a town.  Even if it is in the same Gitesi commune, we were on the border with the Mwendo commune.  Our secteur is neighbouring to the Mwendo commune.  So you see that there is a long distance between our locality to the town, and without the means of transportation, there weren't a lot of vehicles to enable us to get to the town.  It was difficult going to town.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Apparently you were the only Rwandan who didn't hear about this meeting at that time.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That objection is sustained.
@MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, that objection is sustained.  Next question.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I don't have another question.  We wish to produce this document as Prosecution exhibit.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this will be P. 33, under seal.  Could I ask the booth to repeat, please, the date of this document?  It was stated in the first line, I think, of the document.  Could you kindly indicate to us again, please?
@MR. KAPAYA:
It is 31st August '98.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, that is what I want the booth to kindly read out again.  Could you do that, please? 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:

@MR. PRESIDENT:

Any re-examination from the Defence? 
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, I have a few questions for you.  You have stated that at the end of May there were no more massacres.  Is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And this is the time you state the Accused came to his native cellule? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was at the beginning of June.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  You have also stated that a minister had a lot of authority over the entire population and he was like a father to them. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And that there were more Tutsis than Hutus in your native area, in the cellule. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And you said when he came he was furious because his relatives had been killed.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Any reaction with regard to other Tutsis who were the majority in the cellule who had been killed before he came?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, he said the following:  "Who ordered you to kill these people?  Who gave you the orders?"
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I also want to ask you a few questions about the roadblock erected to get money.  You stated initially that the roadblock was erected to get money by two people, by the two people you mentioned, and then later on you said it was to check banditry. 
@THE WITNESS:
It was the bandits, the thieves who erected the barriers, the roadblocks. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Was it to check property taken from the Tutsi or Hutu who were being robbed of their property during the war? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, they wanted money.  When they saw somebody who had money who was passing by, and because nobody could protect that person, he was asked to give all his money.  They were strong, they were carrying weapons, clubs, spears, and when you see the club, you have to give your money, because you might die in the process if you don't.  So you will understand that a Tutsi couldn't go through this roadblock; they were hiding. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes.  And that is exactly my next question.  Why were they afraid to go on these roadblocks, to go through them, if they were to check for money? 
@THE WITNESS:
People were passing by and when they got to the roadblock they would take their money, but they were not able to take money from a lot of people because when they realised that that was the purpose of the roadblock, people were going through the bush. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
You also stated that at one point in time you were a member of the cellule committee before the war.  Is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And at the time --
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, because I was a trader, I was no longer a member of that committee because I did not have time for these administrative matters. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  And you lost a number of people, including eight nephews; is that what you said? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Did you report this matter to any authority or even to the Accused when he came to your cellule in May or beginning of June? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is known; there was a trial in the courts of first instance.  My brother-in-law survived and he hid in his father-in-law's house, sometimes he would hide in my house.  He survived.  He remarried and currently has three children. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
How many houses did you have in this cellule?  You had a business house in the centre? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I had my house where I lived, which is not far from the centre, and I also had the shop, and they, too, are separated by a distance of five minutes walk. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And was there a pit by the roadblock at the centre where bodies were thrown? 
@THE WITNESS:
No.  There was no pit.  There was rather a latrine which was behind my house.  There was a pit latrine close to the road, and apart from this latrine there was no other pit.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Were any bodies thrown in this latrine? 
@THE WITNESS:
No. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And did you sell alcohol in your restaurant? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was a shop, and I used to sell food as well. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will come back in a moment to hear the last questions, but there is a meeting starting just now so we have to take the last bit in a few minutes.  That's why we have to stop now, but we will take the last five minutes of your questioning in about 15 minutes.  Thank you.
$Court recessed from 1105H to 1128H)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Witness, we were just about rounding up your testimony, but there are a few questions left from the Judges. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you were the member of the committee of your cellule at the relevant time, is that correct, in April 1994?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I was no longer a member of the cellule committee.
@JUDGE KHAN:
But did you remain as a member of the committee of your cellule?
@THE WITNESS:
No.  Before the war, elections took place, and I wasn't elected because I did not have the time to deal with administrative issues, given my trade, my business.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You said that residents of the neighbouring secteur had erected a roadblock in your cellule, is that correct, that Minani?
@THE WITNESS:
I spoke of a roadblock which was at a place which I could see; that's the one I mentioned.  I couldn't move around to see what was happening elsewhere.
@JUDGE KHAN:
But this roadblock was at your cellule? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did you take any step to restrain those strangers from erecting the roadblock in your cellule of which you remained as a member of the committee?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I told you that I was no longer a member of the cellule committee.  When the war broke out I was no longer a member of the committee for the cellule.
Those people were coming from other secteurs, but they were stronger than we were.  We didn't have any means of defending ourselves; I'm referring to people who lived in the cellule.  The people who came from elsewhere were stronger than us.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.  You said that Karegeya was taken away by a man called Bapfakurera in your presence? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I saw him.  Before I didn't know Bapfakurera's name, but later on I informed myself and I realised that the people -- the person who was taking away Karegeya was called Bapfakurera.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Karegeya was your well-wisher, he was your boss, he had given you the land free of cost.  Did you take any step to save him from that man? 
@THE WITNESS:
I had no powers.  All I could do was to hide his child; she managed to survive.  But the others were stronger than myself; I could do nothing, given the powers they had.
@JUDGE KHAN:
So, you mean to say that you were weaker, that's why you did not stop the assailants, or the killers? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's what I mean.  They were stronger than I.  How can you stop more than a hundred -- twenty attackers who are armed with clubs and spears?  How can you stop them?
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when you were asked by the Prosecution why there was a discrepancy between, on the one hand, the information concerning the Karegeya killing in your statement to investigators and, on the other hand, your information in your '98 interview to the Rwandan prosecutor, you said that you later carried out investigations.  Did I understand you correctly? 
@THE WITNESS:
I was able to obtain information, and that was necessary.  When you see someone leading attackers, you should be interested in knowing who that person is, so that later on you can say who that person was exactly, the person leading the attackers.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when did you proceed to obtain such information? 
@THE WITNESS:
When order was re-established, when the authority began to become operational, before one could meet people who were bragging about having done this or that, so when you heard that you would say to yourself, "There's information which is circulating.  I should collect it and know what really happened".  And that's how I started to carry out my small investigations until I had information which confirmed that the person whom I saw, although I didn't know his name, was indeed the person who was leading the attackers.  So now I had his name, the name of the person whom I had seen, although at the time I saw him I didn't know his name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So when did you start your investigations, approximately; in which year? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was after the war.  It was around August, after the war.  It was at that point in time that one could move about to go where people were meeting.  One could hear people bragging about what they had done.  You could hear them in bars, and this was how I was able to obtain information.  So when this information was gathered and it was confirmed, at that time we were then sure that we had in hand the information we were looking for.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this imply that you started your investigations in August '94? 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, we could hear rumours, but we were not sure that the information was true.  I couldn't rush and provide information which I had not checked out.  So after his death, I started to collect information.  Even though the authorities had not become operational, I started to gather information gradually while awaiting for order to be re-established.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you started gathering information gradually in 1994; is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, you see, after the death of that person I started gradually to collect information, so you would continue to inform yourself in this manner until you receive all the details so that you have the exact information.  That's how I proceeded.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what interests me now, Mr. Witness, is the time, and I have understood you to the effect that you started this exercise in '94; is my comprehension correct, please?  Just yes or no. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, immediately after the death of this person.  But now I know the truth, and now I know that Bapfakurera was, in fact, the person I saw leading the attackers.  People saw him, and they informed me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when did you receive information that this person, this leader, was in fact Mr. Bapfakurera? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was when I came back from the prosecutor's office.  You know, I was called by the inspector of the judicial police.  It's after that that I started to collect information.  Even the IPJ came to carry out information.  He told me, "Now you can go back home, because I know the truth".  At that point in time I myself continued to inform myself and I was able to get to know where the person who had been killed had been taken by Bapfakurera, where Bapfakurera had taken him to kill him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So from '94 to August '98, in spite of investigations, you did not find out the name of the man who took Mr. Karegeya away? 
@THE WITNESS:
He was not someone who was always there.  At a point in time he fled, but people were saying it was him, others were saying it wasn't him, so there were contradictions, accusations and counter-accusations.  He left, and after a moment he came back.  He went to Zaire and he came back home.  It was after his return that I continued to collect information and we were able to get to know that he was the one, and he was arrested and put in prison.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So how did you first hear his name mentioned as the possible leader in this group? 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, it was being said all the time, but these people who were talking about him didn't know whom I had seen.  However, it was when I was able to say that the person who I saw was the cobbler, it's then that they were able to say, "Oh, yes, that person is Bapfakurera", and the members of the population in fact said where he had taken -- he had found Cyprien and where he had taken him to kill him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did you obtain this clarity?  Which year? 
@THE WITNESS:
I knew it, but I didn't know his name.  I knew he was a cobbler; he was someone who was working and would move to markets to go and work.  I knew him, but I didn't know his name.  It was only after he came back from exile that I was able to know that that cobbler was in fact Bapfakurera.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand that, Mr. Witness, and when was that? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, I cannot give you an exact date.  That was a long time ago.  But it was after I came back from the prosecutor's office.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in which year; can you help us with that, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
I think that if you were to look at the report of the interview that we had before the court, you can find the date.  I cannot remember the date myself.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what I want to know from you now is when were you in a position, because of this information concerning the cobbler -- just a moment, just a moment.  Listen to the question, because we are not communicating well now, Mr. Witness.
Now, the question is as follows:  when, which year, were you able, based on the information concerning the cobbler and the fact that the person had returned from another country, to establish that that person was indeed Mr. Bapfakurera?  Which year were you able to establish that? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, actually he hadn't left the country, he had fled to the Nduga area in Gitarama prefecture, and that's where he had fled to.  There were some people who had fled towards Zaire, but given his profession, he continued to work within Rwanda itself.  I was summoned by the IPJ to the prosecutor's office.  After I came back, he himself returned home, and it's at that point in time the IPJ came to our home to carry out investigations.  I suspect the IPJ knew it was him, and he said, "I have done my investigations.  I know you are innocent, and now I know how Cyprien was killed.  You don't have any problem".  So he sent me to fetch witnesses; the witnesses met him and gave him the information.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you in a position to remember the year in which you found out that it was Mr. Bapfakurera who was the leader?  Which year was that? 
@THE WITNESS:
I think that was in 1998.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
If there are no further questions, Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for having come the long way to testify before the Tribunal, and we wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you.

First of all, Mr. President, for some minutes, really only a few minutes, about two -- three or four minutes, I would like to ask the witness questions about her identity, her origins, and she does not wish to be identified.  Consequently, for four to five minutes could we have a closed session so that we could deal with these issues and then immediately thereafter come back to an open session? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that application will then be granted.  Thank you for drawing our attention to the fact that we are talking about five minutes.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Even roughly, approximately?
@A.
No, I don't remember the date at all.  I was tilling for a company, and I got to know that the president had died.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What happened to the population, the people in general in the few days following the president's death?
@A.
There was a war. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you be a bit more specific, Madam Witness?  You say there was a war; were there any killings?  Who was killing and who was being killed?
@A.
It was the Tutsis who were being killed.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And by whom were they being killed?
@A.
It's the Interahamwe who were killing them.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
From where did the Hutu killers come from, the Hutu killers who were killing the Tutsis?
@A.
Initially they came from Kayenzi, and they came killing on their way and they finally reached our secteur. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So that means that largely speaking the people of your secteur saw people coming from outside?

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Does this mean that the people who came to kill in your cellule came from other secteurs?

In your particular situation, Madam Witness, since you were a Tutsi, in order to avoid being killed what exactly did you do?  Did you go to hide, for instance?
@A.
Yes, I went into hiding.

Can you be more specific, Madam Witness?
@A.

Could counsel be reminded to give the interpreters the break we need for switching from one relay to another system.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Where did you go to hide, Madam Witness?
@A.
I went to hide in a bush which was not very far from Nyabahanga river.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And your husband, who was Hutu, did he come to see you to supply you with food and other commodities?
@A.
Yes, he came to supply me.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
But you did not hide in the house, did you?
@A.
No, sir, the houses were being searched.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
How did the Hutu massacre the Tutsi with weapons?
@A.
They had clubs.  They were armed with clubs, with spears, with machetes, and with sharpened sticks.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, your family members of Tutsi origin were also killed?
@A.
The members of my family, did you say, sir?  Yes, sir, they were killed.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you know -- since you've lived in that area all the time, did you know Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, I do.  Yes, for a long time, when he was a bachelor, actually, but it was -- it had been a long time that I hadn't seen him, since the beginning of the war.  It had been a long time since we saw each other last.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, during the war, did you see him?
@A.
No, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, during the war, did your husband tell you that he saw him?
@A.
No, sir, he saw him after the war.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you be more specific?  Your husband told you that he saw Mr. Ndindabahizi during the events or immediately following the events?
@A.
He saw him after the events, that is, around the end of June.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did your husband tell you what Ndindabahizi told him?
@A.
He came and took me to my hiding place and told me that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had said that nobody should no longer kill anybody, so that he took me from my hiding place to the house.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So your husband knew that Ndindabahizi had told the population no longer to kill any Tutsi; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.  He said that nobody should no longer kill and that they had killed enough, and that enough was enough.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, after Ndindabahizi's departure, did your husband come back to tell you that you could safely go back home?
@A.
Yes, sir, and immediately I went back home and, since then, no Hutu ran after any Tutsi.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you take it that Mr. Ndindabahizi contributed to restoring peace in the cellule and in the region?
@A.
Yes, sir, security was restored because one could sleep peacefully.  One no longer feared because one was no longer being chased around.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
That means that after the arrival of Ndindabahizi in your area security for Tutsis disappeared (sic)?
@A.
Yes, there was no insecurity any more.  Insecurity had disappeared for the Tutsi.  The Tutsi were in peace.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi when you were hiding under the Nyabahanga Bridge, did you see him?
@A.
No, sir, I did not see him.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, when your husband told you that he saw Ndindabahizi and that he had contributed in bringing about peace back in the area and that you may cease from hiding, was that a little bit just after he saw Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Well, they met.  They met over there in Gitaka.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, when your husband told you what Ndindabahizi said to him, was it just after having seen him?
@A.
Well, he told me immediately after, indeed.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, last question: If I were to put it to you that that meeting such as reported to you by Ndindabahizi -- if I were to suggest to you that meeting as told you by your husband was rather at the beginning of June rather than at the end of June, would you take it that it would rather be at the beginning of June instead of the end of June?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, this is preposterous.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so this objection is sustained.  You can't ask that question.
@THE WITNESS:
I do not remember any date or month, but I remember that it is -- it was the month of June.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Indeed, it was in June.  Wasn't it at the beginning of June?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has given her answer.
@THE WITNESS:
I do not remember whether it was at the beginning or at the end of that month.  I do not remember clearly.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, please proceed.

I have no more questions, Mr. President.  The answer --

@MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, madam.  You have --
@A.
Good afternoon. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, you have never lived in Gasharu cellule, have you?
@A.
No, sir.
@MR. KAPAYA:
When your husband came from Gasharu cellule he told you that the war was over, right?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And to your knowledge, was it not at the end of June that the war ended?
@A.
I did not understand the question, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When -- Madam Witness, when, in your view -- when, in your view, did the war end? 
@THE WITNESS:
If my memory serves me right, during the month of June.  Apart from the fact that Emmanuel came by, the Tutsi were still being chased, but after his departure, they were not sought after in their houses anymore.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, you were married to a Hutu man, right?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, in April up to mid-May, Tutsi women married to Hutu men were not being sought.  Is that correct?
@A.
They were sought after.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Isn't it a fact that Hutu women married to Tutsi men -- Tutsi women married to Hutu men were being sought after May -- after May '94, May, June?
@A.
You mean women married to Hutu?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Madam Witness.  Tutsi women who were married to Hutu men at the beginning of the war were not targeted for killing.  Are you aware of that, Madam Witness?
@A.
They were hunted down and, indeed, they were the first to be killed.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Madam Witness, what did your husband die of?
@A.
My husband died at around the month of December.  The Interahamwe who were hiding in the bush caught him on the Nyabahanga river banks and killed him.
@MR. KAPAYA:
But your husband was Hutu, madam, why was he killed by Interahamwe?
@A.
He was killed by people who were hiding in the bush.  Those people did not want to come out to show themselves and to accuse him of being somebody that was reporting on them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat the month when your husband was killed, Madam Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
I believe it was in December.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was one year after the end of the war.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the interpreters kindly push their button?  Thank you.  
Now, so would this be December '94 or December '95?
@THE WITNESS:
It was one year after the end of the war.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, I suggest to you that you couldn't have hidden in a sorghum field with a two-month old baby with all that cold and rain.  What do you say to that?
@A.
Well, I was constantly with that child because its mother was at the house and the mother came from time to time to breast-feed.  (Inaudible) the fact that the father of the child was killed.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I suggest to you, Madam Witness, that your husband protected you and the small child in your house during the war.
@A.
I was not in the house because from 7 a.m. they came seeking me out at the house as well as the child and they only went away -- they stayed there till about 5 p.m.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Madam Witness, if you were really hiding in that sorghum field didn't the child betray you -- betray your hiding by crying and that kind of -- that kind of thing?
@A.
The child did not cry.  It was given can liquid to drink, but since the mother knew where I was, sometimes she came to breast-feed.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So it's your testimony, Madam Witness, that you never saw or heard Ndindabahizi speak in April, May or June '94, right?
@A.
No, I didn't hear anybody say that he had come to the area.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And that the information your husband gave you was that Ndindabahizi came after the war was over.
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That's all, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness, of what ethnic group was your granddaughter that you were hiding?
@A.
She was Tutsi.  The father was killed.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
She was Tutsi because the dead father was Tutsi, that is, the father who was killed?
@A.
Yes, the father was Tutsi.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Madam, could you, for as much as possible, tell us what you mean by "the end of the war", "the end of the war".  What do you call "the end of the war"?
@A.
When I talk about the end of the war, I mean that at that time people were no longer being hunted down.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And "the end of the war", where do you place it, immediately after Ndindabahizi came by?
@A.
Yes, I confirm that it was at that time that the war ended because after his departure, nobody was killed anymore.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
That would be all, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for coming the long way to Arusha to testify.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Please, do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.

Mr. President, in order to avoid a closed session, I shall ask the witness to write down on a peace of paper the name of the cellule, secteur and the commune in which he lived in 1994, with the assistance of the Registry, of course.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you jot down on that piece of paper the name of the cellule where you lived in 1994, the name of the secteur, and the name of the commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  I need some assistance from the Registry, Mr. President.  Now that the witness has the document here, we should draw attention to the name on the document, sir.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you see the name of a location in the document you have?
@A.
No, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is this then if it's not a geographical location?
@A.
I'm sorry, I am mistaken.  This is a location indeed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know this location, Witness?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, in the first document that was given to you, you indicated the name of the area in which you lived in 1994; isn't that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, we shall refer to that location so that we will now say that that is document 1.  Is that understood, Witness?  We shall take that document as document 1.
@A.
I did not get you.  Could you explain this?
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, in order not to identify you, we are not going to talk about the cellule where you come from, but we shall refer to it as being the cellule that is mentioned in document 1.
@A.
Very well, now I do understand.
@MR. BESNIER:
So that we would ask you questions also on the second location, and that second location will be designated as Location 2.
@A.
Very well. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the distance between location 1, that is, where you lived in the 1994 -- that is, the distance between Location 1 and Location 2?
@A.
This would be about five or six minutes walk on foot.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, from -- or, rather than going from location 1 and go and see what is happening in location 2, is that possible?
@A.
Yes, it is possible to see from location 1 what is happening in location 2, instead of walking.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us talk about 1994.  Could you tell us how you learnt about the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
Yes, I can tell you.  Upon the death of President Habyarimana, I was living in Kibuye.  I was studying there.  I was in the first year of secondary school.  If my memory serves me right, it was on the 7th of April 1994 when the principal of our school told us that President Habyarimana was dead and that there was no security anymore in the country and that we should go home to our respective parents.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what did you do yourself; did you go back to your parents' house?
@A.
Yes.  On the very same day I went back home.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, in the area where you lived in 1994, what was the security situation after the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
The security situation was not good.  People started killing each other.  One ethnic group killed the other ethnic group, but not all the members of the various ethnic groups were involved in killing, or some did, some did not participate in such massacres.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is your ethnic group, sir?
@A.
I am Hutu.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your native cellule that is Location 1, was there a roadblock?
@A.
There was no roadblock.
@MR. BESNIER:
And in location 2, was there a roadblock?
@A.
Yes, there was a roadblock.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, throughout the period of the genocide, were people killed in your cellule?
@A.
Yes, people were killed in our cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the ethnic group of those people who were killed?
@A.
They were Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, tell us about the killers.  Do you know the ethnic group of the killers?
@A.
The killers were Hutu and Twas.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is it all the Hutu and all the Twa, without any exception, that were involved in killing the Tutsi?
@A.
No, sir.  They were not all involved in the massacres or participated -- they did not all participate in the massacres.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, so far as your cellule was concerned, the Hutu that killed Tutsi, were they born in that cellule or did they come from other areas?
@A.
Well, some were born in the cellule and others came from other cellules.
@MR. BESNIER:
You, yourself, did you see with your own eyes the killing, one time or several times, of Tutsi?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Which killing did you witness and who were the victims?
@A.
For example, I witnessed the killing of Nyirabagesera, Josephine by a Hutu.  I saw Gatete killing one Mboninma (phonetic).
@MR. BESNIER:
You made reference to one Josephine.  Do you know her personally?
@A.
Yes, I knew her.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you related to her?
@A.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, this Josephine that you refer to, was she married?
@A.
Yes, she was married.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the husband's name?
@A.
Cyprien Karegeya.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who killed Josephine?
@A.
It was Ntirihirika who killed Josephine.  Ntirihirika is spelt N-T-I-R-I-H-I-R-I-K-A.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, could you please repeat her husband's name? 
@THE WITNESS:
Josephine's husband was called Cyprien Karegeya.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
In what circumstances was Josephine killed by this Ntirihirika?
@A.
Ntirihirika found Josephine downhill from our house in a banana plantation, where she was hiding.  The daughter took one direction and Josephine took one direction.  Ntirihirika followed her, caught up with her and killed her with a club.  This is the scene that I witnessed.
@MR. BESNIER:
On which date did this happen?
@A.
I do not recall the date.
@MR. BESNIER:
If you refer to the death of President Habyarimana, are you able to give us an estimate of the date on which she died, for example, X-number of weeks after the death of the president?
@A.
I think it was towards the end of the month of April, the last few days of the month of April.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Cyprien Karegeya survive the genocide?
@A.
He is also dead.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you witness the circumstances under which he died?
@A.
No, I did not witness his death.  I only heard that he died.
@MR. BESNIER:
And according to the information you got, how did he die?
@A.
I heard that he was killed at Gitaka, but it was at the beginning of May that he was killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who told you that Cyprien Karegeya was killed in the month of May?
@A.
It was the people who lived in my -- within my neighbourhood.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you know a man called Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, I know him for having seen him only once.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where and when did you see him this once?
@A.
I saw him at Gitaka.
@MR. BESNIER:
And when was this?
@A.
It was in June.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  You made reference to Location no. 2; do you recall that?  And what were you doing in that location on that day?
@A.
When I saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi I was in a small centre where there are shops and I went to buy a few things.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Did you witness Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's arrival?
@A.
I found him there, but when I got there at the centre, I found him there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you saying that he had already arrived when you got there?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you recall the time when you got to that location?
@A.
I recall that it was Sunday.  People were come back from church and it was in the afternoon.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell us what this person called Emmanuel Ndindabahizi did or said in this 
Location no. 2, and what you witnessed?
@A.
I found him at this centre and he was asking the people who ordered them to kill.  And he told them, "Look, it is the same blood that is flowing in the veins of each one -- each and every one of us".  And at that stage he arrested somebody that he believed to have participated in the killings and took him away for detention.  The people who were present there brought another person that they said was a criminal.  His name was Gatete, and Ndindabahizi asked them to take Gatete.  Gatete fled and they were not able to arrest him.  That is all I know.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, very much.  How did you know that it was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, since you didn't know him before then?
@A.
This is what happened.  It was his native cellule and people were saying that Ndindabahizi had arrived in the cellule and it was those members of the cellule who were saying this.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you observe the vehicle in which he arrived?
@A.
Yes, I saw the vehicle.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know which vehicle this was, the model, the make?
@A.
It was a minibus and I cannot remember the colour.
@MR. BESNIER:
When you arrived was Ndindabahizi already talking to the people?  Had he started or he hadn't started talking to them yet?
@A.
When I arrived there, Ndindabahizi was talking to the people who were there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Therefore, you did not hear everything that he said?
@A.
I only heard what he said when I was present there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Since you were an eyewitness, can you repeat what he said to the Court with as much accuracy as possible?  Try to remember what he said. 
@A.
When I got there, he was asking the people present who ordered them to kill the people.  At that stage, the people tried to give him an explanation, to give him an indication of their situation.  But when I got there he was telling them that, "You should not kill the people.  You know it is the same blood which is flowing in the veins of each and every one of us".
@MR. BESNIER:
What was Ndindabahizi's tone when he was talking to the people?
@A.
He was sad.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let's get to the facts.  Did Ndindabahizi do anything on that day in that locality?
@A.
While I was there, he asked the people the following: "Don't you know people who might have participated in the killings?"  And the people told him there is one Gatete, a terrible criminal.  And he said, "Bring me this Gatete."  And Gatete fled.  I know that Ndindabahizi also arrested another person that he believed participated in the killings and he took this person to detention.  That is what I know.
@MR. BESNIER:
The second person you are referring, the one he took away for detention, what was his occupation in April 1994?
@A.
I know this person had a bar of banana beer.  He was a petty trader at that centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
And that person you are referring to, did he hold any administrative position in the cellule?
@A.
To my knowledge, no.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  For more clarification, I'm going to ask you to write the name of this person on a sheet of paper.
@MR. BESNIER:
With the assistance of the Registry.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you written one or two names here, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
I have put two names on the sheet of paper.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two names are the persons that you -- who are these two persons, please?

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You have written the name of one person on the sheet of paper, is that it?
@A.
This is what I did: I wrote that Ndindabahizi arrested this person, took him to detention.  If you so wish, I can write the name of only the person you are interested in.
@MR. BESNIER:
No, it's okay.  We are going to request the Kinyarwanda interpreters to translate what you've written on the sheet of paper so everyone can understand.  That's going to be very brief. 
@MR. BESNIER:
If the interpreters can avoid translating the name itself.
@THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
On a sheet of paper is the written the following: "He arrested" -- then the name of the person -- "and took him to detention".
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, now I see it's very clear. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see, yourself, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi take this person into detention?
@A.
Yes, I was an eyewitness to this event.
@MR. BESNIER:
And how do you know that he was taking him into detention?  They might very well have being going on -- to walk around?
@A.
No, Ndindabahizi spoke to this person and the told him that he was taking him into detention.  He told him, "You have killed people, where did you put them?"  He arrested him, took him into detention.  And that happened in front of all of us in broad daylight.
@MR. BESNIER:
And this person you are talking about, did he try to defend himself or resist arrest?
@A.
No, he did not resist.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had already come to the region before that visit?
@A.
I did not hear anyone talk about his possible visit to the region.  It was only on that day that people said he had arrived.
@MR. BESNIER:
To your recollection, did this visit of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi take place before or after the death of Josephine?
@A.
Ndindabahizi came after the death of Josephine.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell the Court on which date the person who was arrested was detained by Ndindabahizi, and then came back after his detention?
@A.
The person was arrested on Sunday.  I cannot recall the date, and on Monday, I saw the person who was arrested.  And I'm talking about the Monday immediately following that Sunday, which means the person spent just one day in the cell.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I still have a few questions.  May I continue? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Approximately how many questions?  So that we know.
@MR. BESNIER:
Maybe ten minutes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is this problem again of someone waiting for a meeting at one o'clock.  For that reason I think we have to stop now and resume at 2:30.

Mr. Witness, we left off at an incident where you had seen Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi visit a specific place.  Do you recall? 
@A.
Maybe you could recount the episode, because I've forgotten it.
@MR. BESNIER:
We had concluded with that episode.  I want to begin another one.  I wanted to know whether you knew if there was a roadblock in the cellule we referred to, which is not the one where your home is situated but it's the cellule in which you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in 1994. 
@A.
There was a roadblock there, yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know who had erected that roadblock? 
@A.
I do not know. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know who was manning the roadblock, that roadblock?

I would see people there as I passed by.  There would be people there as I passed by, but I wouldn't know who was responsible for it, for manning it.

Do you know whether people were killed at that roadblock? 
@A.
No, I don't know anyone who was killed there. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know whether the Tutsis of the area were killed after Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's visit to the area? 
@A.
When Ndindabahizi came many people had been killed, and no one was being killed any more. 
@MR. BESNIER:
According to you, is there any link between Ndindabahizi's visit to the area and the stoppage of the killings? 
@A.
Could you please repeat your question? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Between Ndindabahizi's visit and the stoppage of the killings, do you believe there is any link between the two? 
@A.
I think there is a link, because Ndindabahizi had said that if there were survivors, they should not be killed.  People should not be killed, and that whoever had participated in the killings should be prosecuted, so I do believe there is a link. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now I want to put to you some very personal questions on your personal -- your family relationships. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, here I believe I have no other choice but to request for a closed session, but I'm not quite sure how much time I'll need for these questions to the witness regarding his family.  It wouldn't last very long.  I think five minutes maximum, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's granted, then, and the public has noticed the estimate.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Good afternoon, Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon, Counsel.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness, where were you living in April?  Where were you living in April 1994?
@A.
I was living in Kibuye, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And where was your family living prior to the events of 1994?
@A.
My family lived in Rubengera town.
Q:	During the events in 1994, you settled in Kibuye for how long?
@A.
I continued to work for about two months, and then I stopped working.  I began to rest.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What was your profession, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I was a driver.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you be a bit more specific, Mr. Witness?  What do you mean by driver?
@A.
I was ...  ... driver.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you remember the date of the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
I do not remember.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
But you recall the events that followed that event, do you not?
@A.
After his death, there was a war.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were you a witness to any of the massacres?
@A.
I was not a witness of the massacres, but I was transporting people wounded.  I did not witness any of the killings that were going on.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
During your professional activities, did you ever get to be confronted by any particular difficulties in your work?
@A.
Yes, I did encounter difficulties.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you tell us what they were, please?
@A.
At a given point in time, I was sent somewhere in Rubengera to go and buy diesel.  I was alone.  And when I came back, I was with a medical assistant, and that medical assistant was taken and killed.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So there you are, you went to Rubengera.
@A.
I had been sent there.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You went to fetch fuel for your vehicle, and on this occasion you met someone.  Whom did you meet, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Who are you talking about?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You said a moment ago that you were going to buy fuel in Rubengera and that you left alone and that you came back with a medical assistant from the hospital.  Can you please be a little bit more clear about the identity of that person, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Do you want me to speak about that assistant?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, please.
@A.
He was a medical assistant known as Nors.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you please spell that name for us, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Nors is spelt N-O-R-S.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you please inform us, please, initially you went to Rubengera, and, if I understood you correctly, you went to fetch fuel, and then you came back with Nors?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, what happened on your way back between Rubengera and the Kibuye hospital?  When you were on your way back, what happened?
@A.
When we were on our way -- when I reached Rubengera I found Nors on the road and he asked me where I was going.  I told him that I had come to buy diesel.  He told me that he was on sick leave, but that he wanted to go back with me because his sick leave had expired.  And so I agreed.  When he went to his house to fetch his bag, and when I had bought the fuel, I found him again at the same place with his bag.  He got on the vehicle and we left together.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you left Rubengera for Kibuye with Nors, who had with him his bag.  Now, did you encounter any difficulties on that trip, the trip between Rubengera and Kibuye?
@A.
Yes, we encountered difficulties on our way back.  When we reached a roadblock, which was at Kayenzi, when the people manning the roadblock realised that there was this white person in the vehicle, they told me to come down.  They asked him where he came from, where he was going, and what his profession was.  And he answered their questions.  They threatened him, but I defended him.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Something which is not quite clear, you said this white man.  Do you mean that Nors was not -- what nationality -- or to what ethnic group did Mr. Nors come from?  What country was he from?
@A.
I do not know what his country of origin was.  He was born in Rwanda by a white father and a Rwandese mother.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
In other words, he was a half-caste, was he?
@A.
Yes, he was a half-caste.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Let's come back to the Kayenzi roadblock.  So on your way from Rubengera to Kibuye you reached the roadblock, and you say that after having been stopped, he was then -- after being arrested, he was, in fact, released?
@A.
Yes, he was released.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you then encounter other difficulties?
@A.
We encountered other difficulties, but they were not as serious as those that we had at Kayenzi.  When I reached the Kibuye roundabout --
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Please go ahead, Mr. Witness.  When you reached the Kibuye roundabout, what happened?
@A.
We found gendarmes there who also asked me to stop.  They asked me about the person who was on board my vehicle.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.  So, you finally got to the hospital together with Mr. Nors?
@A.
No.  The gendarmes stopped us, and they asked me who my passenger was.  I said he was a medical assistant at the Kibuye hospital.  We remained there for sometime, and the superior officer of the gendarmes came and ordered the others to let us go.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you were finally able to reach the Kibuye hospital, were you?  And what happened there at the Kibuye hospital when you got there?
@A.
Nors explained to the doctors what had happened to him on the way and he told him that he had come to tell him that he had gone beyond his sick leave by three days and that he had come to say so himself -- he had come to tell him himself.  He had come to explain himself, so he that wouldn't have been accused of having abandoned his post.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
In the days that followed did you come to accompany Mr. Nors back to his home in Rubengera?
@A.
Yes.  Nors explained to the doctor all the problems that he had on the way and the doctor told him, "You haven't quite recovered.  You shouldn't have come back."  
And Nors said, "But I can't go back home.  I don't have any means of transport.  What am I going to do?"  The doctor allowed him to extend his sick leave so that he can recover fully.  So the doctor said, "You wait.  When you find a vehicle which can take you back you can leave.  For the time being we have a lot of difficulties.  We have a lot of people who are unwell."
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Was it you who took Nors back to his home in Rubengera?
@A.
Yes.  It was myself who took him back.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you recall the date on which you took Nors back because he was now having extended sick leave which he was going to enjoy in Rubengera?
@A.
It was the 25th of May -- 26th of May, rather.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You were taking Nors back to his home on the 26th of May in the vehicle -- I beg your pardon?
@A.
We were also in the company of the wife of a doctor known as Leonard.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, who -- what enabled you to be so specific about the date on which you took back Nors to his home, together with the doctor's wife, so that Nors can continue with his extended sick leave in Rubengera comfortably?
@A.
I remember that date very well, because I was able to read that date on my log-book.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could the Bench and the Prosecution refer to the document attached to the witness document, the witness statement?  I believe the registry has distributed that document, which I have here.  
By your leave, could the registry collect this document?  Please show this document first to the witness and then to the Bench.  
Actually these documents are already in your possession, Mr. President, Your Honours, and the Prosecution also, but in case this is still needed I am giving them out again.  
Please make sure the witness has a copy.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we think we can be of some assistance to the Trial Chamber.  We are quite happy to stipulate to this document, the date, and whatever is contained therein.  There's no -- we look to save time and we have no problems with the document and the attachments.  We stipulate to it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Now, but it was good for the Chamber to receive this document because we only have it in the typewritten version in front of us, but now we have it in the handwritten version, which was good.  So thank you very much.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Does the witness have the same document, Mr. Registry?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document.  No, I have the logbook, yes.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, on that log-book, Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that's what enables you to confirm that that trip, during which you took Nors back, indeed, took place on the 26th of May?  Yes, it's date says 26th May and the speedometer at departure read 31,424.  The name of the driver is placed there.  I believe we should not mention this as interpreters in the booth.  Then there are other details included in that trip, including the reading of the speedometer at the end of the trip.  Yes?
@A.
Yes, it took place on the 26th of May 1994, and it is mentioned that the purpose of that trip was to take Nors back to Rubengera.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you please, Mr. Witness, speak to us about that trip of the 26th of May 1994 during which you took Mr. Nors back from the Kibuye hospital to Rubengera?
@A.
Yes, I can talk to you about that trip.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I didn't hear the answer.  Let me repeat my question, Mr. Witness.  On the 26th of May 1994 you had the assignment of taking Mr. Nors back to his home, together with the wife of one doctor.  Now, this is confirmed by the log-book which you gave a copy -- of which you gave a copy to us and a copy which I also gave to the Bench.  Can you please tell us about the circumstances surrounding this trip of the 26th of May?  My question is quite simple.  What happened on this 26th of May between the Kibuye hospital and Rubengera, your destination?
@A.
The doctor told me to take Nors back, and the doctor's wife.  And we reached the Kayenzi roadblock, and the people who were at the roadblock took Nors.  The first time I had defended him and I was able to get him back, but when I was doing the return trip they refused to accept what I was saying.  They insisted that I had told them lies, that he was a Belgian, and they took him.  They were saying that he was a Belgian who was an accomplice of the Inkotanyi Tutsis.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So, they took Mr. Nors out of the vehicle -- no.  Did they take him out of the vehicle by force, is that what you're saying, Mr. Witness?
@A.
They did not physically force him out of the vehicle, but they ordered him to get out of the vehicle and had he not obeyed, they obviously would have forced him, but he came out of the vehicle himself.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did he take his belongings?  Did he take his bag with him?
@A.
Yes, they took his bag.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What about his personal effects?
@A.
He had nothing else, apart from his bag.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And you -- he didn't have a watch?
@A.
He was wearing a watch.  They took his spectacles.  They took his shirt and his trousers.  He remained practically naked.  He was only in his underclothing.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So did they take his watch?
@A.
Yes, they took his watch and his glasses, his spectacles, as well as his trousers and his sandals -- his shoes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What did they tell you, Mr. Witness?  What did these people tell you?
@A.
They removed the tree trunk and the stones which were used to block the road and told me to continue.  And when I did not leave they told me that I had to leave.  So I left with the vehicle.  I went a certain distance and I stopped.  They then said, "Oh, he's stopping again."  And they said, "Arrest him also."
So when I saw them coming towards me -- but I remained there for some time, because I was telling myself that they were going to have pity on the man.  And when I saw an attacker come towards me armed with a club I immediately entered the vehicle.  He struck me with the club on my back.  I started the vehicle.  After a certain distance I stopped.  The lady said, "But they're going to kill you, because they are not stopping from telling you to continue (sic).  So I drove slowly and I stopped at the place -- I stopped close by a eucalyptus tree, and I was able to see them as they were coming from the bush where they had just killed the person.  They were content.  They were happy as if they had done something good, whereas they had just killed someone.  And after that I left.  So that is what happened.  That is how this person was taken away from me.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Defence, this is, of course, a dramatic event.  But we have not heard about the killing of Nors previously in this case, have we?  Has that been a subject matter from a previous witness, the killing of Nors?
And it is only our recollection which is not satisfactory.  Is it a previous witness saying that?
Mr. Ndindabahizi was involved in one way or another as regards the killing of Nors, directly?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I may intervene on this matter.  The witness -- Witness CGC, a Prosecution witness indeed testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi allegedly distributed machetes at a roadblock the witness is referring to now, and that immediately after that act, a half-caste was killed at that same roadblock.   The killing, or the murder of that half-caste was therefore allegedly the direct consequence of the presence of Mr. Ndindabahizi at the roadblock, as testified to by the witness, CGC, and so we are trying to corroborate the testimony of this witness and what has been said by the previous witness.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I beg your pardon, contradict, is the term used by Defence counsel.  Apologies from the interpreter.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what confused us up here, I think, is that we are not absolutely certain that the name which is now being mentioned is the same as the name we wrote previously, but now I realise this is the same episode.
Thank you very much.  Yes, please proceed.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.  	I will repeat what you have just said, Mr. Witness.
So, you stopped your vehicle; you got down from the vehicle, is that right?  You made a few steps backwards to see what was happening and it was at that point in time that you saw the attackers come back.  Did you meet them or did you see them coming back?
@A.
Yes, I saw them coming back, alone without Nors.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you concluded that Nors was dead, because you saw him taken from the vehicle, taken away into the bush and then the assailants, the attackers, came back from the same bush without that same person, Nors?
@A.
Yes, he wasn't with them any longer.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Was it the first time that this event is being testified to before a legal authority?
@A.
No, it is not the first time; I already explained this to the office of the prosecutor in Kibuye.  I have been asked questions about this matter before.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q. I have with me -- but it is in Kinyarwanda -- this document was not submitted in time, and this is the letter of denunciation by -- by that person.  It is in Kinyarwanda.  (By order of the Court this the name has been extracted and filed under seal) I do agree that this letter is being tendered a bit late in the day.  If there is no objection, I would like to have it tendered and accepted as a document in this case.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you approach the Defence bench, please?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
My learned friend next to me has just informed me that I mentioned the name of the witness, and can that lapsus be corrected, please, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It will be deleted and placed under seal in the transcripts.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Does the booth have a copy of this document?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently so, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, do you have a document in front of you, Mr. Witness, a handwritten document?  Just answer yes or no.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have this document in front of me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, do you want this translated and read into the record, Defence?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
That would be great, Mr. President, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So then we will follow the same procedure as earlier today, when the Prosecution tendered a similar document.  But be ware then, that you do not read names indicating the identity of the witness.  
Yes, please, go ahead.  So this is a letter dated the 28th of September 1995.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Mr. So-and-so, son of so-and-so, and so-and-so, Mabanza commune, 20th of September 1995.  Subject:  Explanations on the murder of Nors -- Joseph Nors.  I, the undersigned, was a victim of violence on the 25th of May l994.  And on the 26th of May 1994, at the Kayenzi roadblock, I was assaulted by Gaspari Bamuriki, who was in charge of that roadblock, and it was that person that I was able to recognise.  There were other persons there whose names I did not know, but I did seek some information concerning their names.  They were Bigirimana, Rwibasira, François, Ndigabo, Niyigemana, Capitoro, Simeon, Komeza," and there is another name that is not legible.  "They were many, such that there must be other names that I didn't mention, and probably the person in charge of the roadblock could supply, that is," Mr. Bamuriki, Gaspari, who was in charge of that group, actually.  "They got him out of the vehicle, they took his bag and took off his shoes, his watch, his spectacles, and searched him.  Following that" -- this is illegible.  The next sentence is illegible.
"Subsequently, I saw them bring out clubs to strike me, and I went away and stopped a little bit further down, and I came back on foot and when I got to the place where they were standing, they saw me; they were coming from the bush and they were armed with clubs, swords, spears and sticks and hoes.  The person who killed him, his name could be given to you by the person responsible for the roadblock, because he was responsible for his death and he knows the reasons why that person was killed." Nota bene: " Their excuse was, his identity card on which it was said that he had naturalised and there were two stamps to it.  Ndikuyeze, as far as he was concerned, on the 25th of May, l994, accused him of being a Belgian whereas he had been a refugee for a long time.  He said that he had been a refugee for a long time, and that he was an accomplice to the Belgian criminals.  This was what I was able to see.  When they took him, I was in the company of a lady called Gahongajire, Gratio."  
Signature, and end of translation, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I believe the interpreter has only read seven names -- I see seven names.  At any rate the document is tendered to be included in the material for this trial.
$Exhibit No. P. 33 admitted, under seal) 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be Defence Exhibit No. 33 under seal, and the seventh name was not read because it was illegible.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The seventh name, we will see about it.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, following those events, Witness, did you see in the written statement, and in the letter that we have just read, that you carried out your own investigation?  Could you shade light on the inquiries that you carried out that enabled you, for example, to establish the letter of the 25th May, and to tell the Defence investigators what you have told them, including what you told them in June 2003 -- in October, rather, in October 2003 -- in August, in August?  That was the 6th of August 2003.
@A.
Now, I started my investigation, and when I started, there were some people I knew among the attackers, others I did not know, but I inquired about the others whose names that I didn't know.  So I supplied all the names of the attackers that I knew -- I already knew, even those that I had not known before hand.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you remember them?  Can you repeat the names to the Court, if we are given leave?
@A.
Yes, I can repeat the names.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you do so?
@A.
Bigirimana; one, Rwibasira; two, Ndigabo; three, Ligena; four, Simeon; five -- I do not know his other name.  Komeza; six, and Bamuriki; seven, there was also Ndikuyeze, who was in the first group, on the first occasion, that is, but the second time around when they took Nors away, I didn't see him.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, it was first the date of the 26th of April, it is on the log book, your log book; you are certain about the date on that basis at which Nors was killed?
@A.
I have no doubt about the date because after his murder I took note of that in a personal notebook that I do not have with me here, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You know that -- do you know Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I do not know him, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you know that there is a charge against him of incitement to kill Tutsi?
@A.
I heard about it when questions were being put to me, but in my region, in my area I did not hear talk about that.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
It is said that Mr. Ndindabahizi instigated the killing of Tutsi by distributing machetes.  Did you hear about that accusation, and did you take that into account?
@A.
I did not hear about that accusation, sir.  If his name was mentioned, in view of the fact that I did not know him, I would have remembered his name in the investigations I carried out, when I tried to establish the identity of the killers of Mr. Nors.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So that, Witness, could it be said that during your own investigations you were convinced of the innocence of Mr. Ndindabahizi concerning the death of Mr. Nors?
@A.
He played no role whatsoever in that murder, because when I carried out my investigations nobody talked about him in connection with what happened at the roadblock.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, in the trip you made from Kibuye to Rubengera, when on the 26th April you were taking Nors back home, did you come across any other roadblocks, that is, on the 26th of April?
@A.
No, sir.  That was the only roadblock that I came across on my trip.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you not come across other roadblocks in that area?
@A.
Perhaps I came across a group of persons that were on the road, but they hadn't erected a roadblock,  so that there was no roadblock.  I would say that there were a group of bandits.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
But Ndindabahizi, it is said that Ndindabahizi was at the roadblock on the 26th of May, before your arrival; is that correct?
@A.
I don't know.  I don't know, and I did not hear anything about him in connection with that roadblock.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So the only roadblock you came across when you left Kibuye towards Rubegera was at Gaseke where Nors was murdered?
@A.
I did explain that I saw a group of people armed with sticks and clubs.  They didn't ask me to stop.   The only roadblock that I noted was that particular roadblock where I was stopped and where the persons in my company were addressed.  That was the roadblock.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
No more questions, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
Approximately how long is the cross-examination?

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon, Counsel.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct, Mr. Witness, that your statement of 28th September 1995, Defence Exhibit No. 33, formed -- the information in your statement of 28th September 1995 formed the basis of the information contained in your statement of 6th August 2003?  Would that be a fair assumption?
@A.
I did not get the question.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You'd given a statement in 1995, in Rwanda, had you not?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And based on the information in your statement in 1995, you gave another statement to the Defence team on the 6th of August 2003; is that not the case?
@A.
It would appear -- unless I look at the first statement, it would seem so.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We can safely assume, because we have both statements before us, that in your statement of 1995 you made no specific reference to Mr. Ndindabahizi.  That is correct, isn't it?
@A.
That is correct, I made no mention of his name.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And why was it the case then, Mr. Witness, that you felt the need to carry out investigations as you described in your 2003 statement, having been and eyewitness pretty much to the attack on the 26th of May?  What necessitated for the investigations; you were there, were you not?
@A.
I carried out investigations because I did not know all the persons that were there at that roadblock, and it was not they that were to give me information. They had no information for me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Precisely.  In your 1995 statement you knew the identity of all those who had participated in the attack the year before, did you not?
@A.
No, I was not able to identify all of them, I was only able to identify those that were at the roadblock.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And having carried out your investigations in 2003, you are now convinced that Mr. Ndindabahizi had no responsibility whatsoever for anything that took place at that roadblock; is that not correct, sir?
@A.
That is correct.  If he had any responsibilities at all, his name would have appeared.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.
@A.
I would have mentioned the name on my list.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, let's go to your logbook.  Who had the responsibility of completing the entries in this logbook?  Did you do it yourself or did somebody else do it for you?
@A.
It was the doctor that filled this logbook.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The same doctor that filled the logbook all the time, is it?
@A.
In his absence there were other people that would fill the logbook.  There were other people that filled the logbook.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the information that is contained in the logbook is derived from where: the mileage, the destination, the date, how is that information derived?
@A.
When one was on a mission the logbook was filled accordingly.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, and how is the information derived; who tells them the mileage before the mission and the mileage afterwards?  Do you do it or does somebody else do it for you?
@A.
The meter was read and the figures taken, and at the next mission the figures were also taken down, and it was from these figures that the logbook was filled.  And once -- I mean, if we were not able to put in the figures, it was the responsibility of the doctor to put them in himself.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How far is Kibuye from Rubengera in terms of kilometres?
@A.
I think it's about 18 kilometres.  It was 20 kilometres before the road was macadamised.  I believe that at present it would be 18 kilometres.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your logbook the trip from Kibuye to Rubengera is indicated as having taken 52 kilometres.  Are you really sure that you ended your journey at Rubengera or somewhere else, sir?
@A.
When you came back before the end of the mission, you were sent elsewhere.  And when you came back only was the mileage noted.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But you had been attacked on this day, so presumably you went straight back to base after the attack, didn't you, sir?
@A.
No, I did not.  I did not go back to base directly.  I took the doctor's wife to Rubengera.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you have the original of this logbook?  Do you have the original, where this copy --
@A.
I gave the -- I had been given the logbook, and I used the sheet of paper on which the mission was spelt out.  I've got the logbook, as such as kept by the office.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So the original logbook from which this came is in your office; is that your testimony as at today?
@A.
Yes, that logbook is right there at the office.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you have a copy of this logbook, this page of this document on your table now?
@A.
I do not have that piece of paper.  I was given one, but it was taken away.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you very quickly look at the left-hand column on that paper where the dates are entered, very quickly?  Do you see from the 21st down to the 25th?  Look at those dates; do you see that, sir?  Do you see that -- do you see anything wrong with the dates there, the order of those dates?  Is there anything wrong with it?
@A.
Yes, there is something rather funny here; I see it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Tell me, what do you see as funny there?  You tell me. 
@A.
Yes, sir.  Instead of the 25th, he wrote the 24th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And then he wrote the 25th, he wrote the 26th, and then wrote the 25th again after that; didn't he?  Is that not the case, sir?
@A.
He made the mistake, I did not, and he moreover did the same thing -- the same thing with the driver who replaced me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The only problem, sir -- you keep looking at that paper -- the only problem, sir, is you can see the typeface on the dates 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, 25th again, is slightly different from every other typeface on that paper; the handwriting is bolder.  Can you see that; slightly different?  Look at the rest of the page and everything that is written on that document and compare it to the darkness of those dates, sir.
@A.
It was Mr. Leonart that inserted the date 26th, and it was the doctor -- now, so far as the 24th is concerned, that is the handwriting of the accountant.  It was the accountant that went on up to the 25th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your explanation is that the difference in the handwriting and the typeface is because this was completed by two different people?  Leonart completed the dates and somebody else, the accountant, completed the name of the driver and the destination; is it?  Two separate people filled in this document, sir.
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, no further questions.
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very quickly on this one.  Now, regarding the trip from Kibuye to Rubengera during which you took back Mr. Nors back home and the wife of Mr. Leonart, you have 26th of May for two reasons; the first reason was that it was Dr Leonart, as I think you just said --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
This is ridiculous.  My learned friend is not the witness, and he has to stop this.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What are the two reasons -- the two reasons why, apart from -- as far as you can remember, you still keep the dates of the 26th of May in 1994?  What are the two reasons, apart from what you remember, that justify your jotting in the 26th of May 1994?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you maintain that this last incident took place on the 26th of May, 26th of May?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am saying that it was on the 26th of May.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Apart from your own personal conviction and your recollection, what else is there that allows you to come here and reassert it today?
@A.
That's because I took notes when Nors was taken away from me.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So that you yourself took personal notes and noted the 26th of May; is that correct?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got a question, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, I am trying to crosscheck here.  I say that it was on the 26th of May that I took Nors to Rubengera and that he spent the night at Kibuye on the 25th of May.  He did not spend the night at Kibuye.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Well, those were your personal notes.  Now, your second note, whose handwriting is it that is the person that filled the logbook and inserted on the 26th of May for the trip to take Nors to Rubengera?  Who jotted down those figures?  I am referring now to the logbook, sir.
@A.
Well, it would appear to me that the 26th of May is my own handwriting.  As far as the comment is concerned, that is the handwriting of Dr Leonart.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
No further questions, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Gaseke roadblock, where is that?  Is there a roadblock called the Gaseke roadblock?
@THE WITNESS:
It is the same roadblock as Kayenzi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when you carried out your investigations to find out who these persons at the roadblock actually were, did you ask during your investigations where they got their weapons from?
@THE WITNESS:
They brought their weapons from their respective homes.  They had used machetes and used clubs.  They did not have any new weapons.
$Pages 91 to 93 by Judith Baverstock)
1715H
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
How do you know that? 
@THE WITNESS: 
That they had the weapons or what?  They, they had the weapons.  They were holding the weapons.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You just told me that the weapons they had came from their homes; is that correct?
@THE WITNESS: 
That is correct, because those weapons were used, they were not new.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The weapons to kill Nors came from the assailants' homes; is that your testimony?
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes, sir, from their homes, because they did not have new weapons.  I didn't see any new weapons.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, how do you know that these weapons came from their homes and had not recently been provided by someone?  Is there anything in your investigation that can tell us anything about that issue?
@THE WITNESS: 
When Nors was taken away from me, when they took Nors away from me, they had those weapons.  It was during the day, not during the night.  It was during the day; I could see them.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
If there is nothing else, this implies that we have heard your entire testimony.  We would wish to thank you very much for having come the long away to Arusha.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you kindly not to discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
@THE WITNESS: 
Thank you very much, also.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be accompanied, please.
$Witness excused)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this log book, what is the status of this document now?  Anyone wishing to tender it?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
We would love to, Your Honour.  I thought they had done so.  I was just going to ask.  If they are not going to do it, I will do it. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, sir.  It is a document in the case, but this document is in the case.  I thought you were talking about his personal notes, his own personal notes.  But this, this is very well tendered in.  It is part of the material for this case.  Are we talking about the same piece of paper?  Yes, it has been tendered in as an exhibit.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Received from the Defence in connection with Witness DB is Exhibit 32, which is the particulars, that's 32.  Then followed Defence Exhibit 33 -- isn't that true, registry? -- concerning this handwritten document, and these are the two so far.  Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, we agree.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So after these two you also want to exhibit this one, I assume?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, that is the log book of the vehicle.  It must be tendered, we believe.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are making that request, aren't you?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, it is so admitted. 
$Exhibit No. D. 34 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Defence -- that was Defence Exhibit 34.  Defence, that brings us to witness eight on your list.  So thank you to both parties for having completed four witnesses during each of these days, which makes four.  But then you drew our attention yesterday to a possible need to prepare the next five witnesses.   Now, where are you now, please?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  We have five witnesses here in Arusha, five witnesses which we have not been able to prepare.  Certainly we would have been able to prepare them if we had come here earlier to Arusha, but let me draw your attention to the fact that the Defence session has not allowed us to come here before the 24th of October, which is regrettable.  Even those who could have come to Arusha with their own means, I could not have imposed that on the whole team, and so we have not been able to prepare these five witnesses.  
This is my proposal, Mr. President, that we adjourn until Thursday afternoon.  If this is agreeable to the Chamber, we could have a session on Thursday afternoon and Friday.  So we will have only tomorrow and the morning of Thursday to prepare the said witnesses, and I believe in one afternoon and one day we will be able to advance and move on with the five witnesses remaining.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And, yes.  Now, when you say the afternoon on Thursday, maybe we do not have to start as late as 2:30.  Could we push it a little bit forward, a little bit early in the day, say to 1:00, 1:30?  And then we could sit from, say, 1:30 to 5:00, or what is your schedule there? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, 1:30 seems to be quite agreeable.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is it fine with everyone?  All right, 1:30 on Thursday, then.  
And thank you for making the point, because that was one of my questions yesterday, why this had not been done last week, and now I understand why the Defence were not in a position to do that.  So that was useful information, thank you.  
All right, this brings us to the end of Tuesday, and we will then meet again on Thursday in the afternoon as just agreed.  Thank you very much.
Court is adjourned.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Good afternoon, Witness.  Could you hear me?
@A.
Good afternoon, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, I should like to know where you used to live in 1994; where was your home in 1994?
@A.
I lived in the Gatoki secteur, the Rutsiro commune and Rulindo cellule, and the Kibuye préfecture.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Now, tell us where your home was just before you came here to Arusha.
@A.
I lived in the Ruhengeri préfecture, more precisely at the *************, Counsel. 
@MR. BESNIER:
When were you arrested?
@A.
I was arrested in 1995; 1995, Counsel. 
@MR. BESNIER:
For what reasons were you arrested?
@A.
I was arrested for murder. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you plead guilty or not guilty, Witness?
@A.
I pleaded guilty, sir, and that was even before the prosecutor's office went after me. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you sentenced?
@A.
Yes, I was sentenced for life. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you make an appeal against that sentence?
@A.
No, sir, I did not lodge an appeal, because the law on procedure so far as guilty plea is concerned does not allow that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Witness, there are several categories of crimes concerning genocide before the Rwandan jurisdiction.
@A.
Yes, there are various categories of crimes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
How many are there?
@A.
There are four different categories of crimes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Which is the most serious category of the crime within the framework that is most serious?
@A.
It was -- it is the first category, sir.  There is also the second category, the third category and the fourth category.  This is the sequence of the various categories. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And could you tell us in which category you were placed?
@A.
I was classified in category 1, but since I pleaded guilty, I was reclassified in the second category, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you take part in the Tutsi genocide in 1994?
@A.
Yes, sir, I did take part at -- in that genocide. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you personally commit murder?
@A.
Yes, sir, I killed some people. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you tell us the ethnic group of the victims?
@A.
My victims were known during that period as Tutsi, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you tell us why you yourself had to kill Tutsi?  For what reason did you kill Tutsi?
@A.
The reason for which I took part in the massacres, I am not really in a position to explain them to you as such, but I believe that all of that was due to the death of the president of the republic.  People committed various criminal acts, and I am one of those that took part in the commission of such criminal acts. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what was the role of the Rwandan authorities when the massacres started?
@A.
So far as the role of the leaders in Rwanda was concerned, all the leaders that were involved in the massacres, some of the authorities advocated massacre and others did not, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
In your cellule, that is where you were, did certain authorities call for massacres?
@A.
In the cellule in which I lived, there was a person that was murdered, only one person, sir, about whom I was informed.  If not, I was not a neighbour to the other victims, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you tell us how and when the killing started after the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
I took part in massacres in various locations.  I took part in massacres that started at the Rutsiro commune on the 11th, on the 11th of April 1994. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were many people killed at Rutsiro commune on the 11th of April 1994?
@A.
Yes, many people were killed.  If I look at the number of victims that fell at the communal office of Rutsiro, but also in other areas of the commune, people were killed, a lot of people. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, regarding those people that were killed in Rutsiro, who asked you to kill them?
@A.
Well, we got to the Rutsiro communal office on the 11th, and at that time people had already killed the priest of the Murunda parish.  The authorities arrested those criminals on around the 9th, it was around the 9th that the priest was killed.  We got there on the 11th to see who killed the priest, and when we arrived we found some gendarmes on the spot.  They had come to protect the Rutsiro communal office.  It was those gendarmes that handed over the first person to us; that was the police inspector of Rutsiro commune, and we killed him.  It was thus that the massacre started, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, later on did the gendarmes also take part in the massacres on your side?
@A.
As far as the gendarmes were concerned, they handed over the police inspector of the Rutsiro commune and asked us to kill all those people that were in the house housing various art objects.  So that in doing so we were assisted by the members of the communal police, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, before the massacres, were there people that assisted you that told you to go out and kill and where to go?  Were there such people around you?
@A.
No, sir.  All of that started off with the death of the president. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you take part in the Tutsi attack or the attack of the Tutsis in the Kibuye church -- the attack against the Tutsis in the Kibuye church?
@A.
I was there, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
When was that?
@A.
That took place on the 17th at around 11 o'clock. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you take part in the Gatwaro stadium attack of the Tutsis -- against the Tutsis?
@A.
I was also there, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And when did that take place, Witness?
@A.
That took place on the 18th at around 1500 hours.  That was 1994. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you take part in the attack against the Tutsi in a location called Fayer?
@A.
No, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know that area called Fayer?
@A.
Yes, sir, I know that location very well. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know whether there was a roadblock in Fayer?
@A.
No, sir.  The roadblock was a little bit before Fayer.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was your answer now, Mr. Witness?  Say that again, please.  Just repeat your answer, please. 
@THE WITNESS:
Did you want me to repeat the answer concerning the location called Fayer or just what I have just said, sir? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I would like you to repeat the information you just gave about the roadblock in Fayer, please. 
@THE WITNESS:
There was no roadblock at the location called Fayer.  The roadblock was a little bit before that, in the Gaseke area in Kayenzi.  That was where the roadblock was mounted, sir. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Whilst you were on this assault, did you go home every evening or did you spend the night at another place?
@A.
We did not go home.  We had accommodation at the Ruganda school, and this was at Kibuye. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, did you take part in the attack against the Tutsi at Gitwa?
@A.
Yes, sir, I took part in the Gitwa massacre; yes, sir, I did.  I did play a role because I killed two people. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Where is the commune in which Gitwa is, Witness?
@A.
Gitwa is in the Gitesi commune, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
When we talk about Gitwa, does it mean a hill, a river or a geographical location?  What is Gitwa, precisely?
@A.
I believe that it is a hill that is called Gitwa. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Is that hill near Karongi?
@A.
Yes, that hill was on mount -- or is on Mount Karongi, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
And at what date did you go to Gitwa, Witness?
@A.
As far as Gitwa is concerned, in view of the fact that several days ago we had killed the refugees at the church and of course those that were at the stadium, but I did not know that I was going to be compelled to do it again.  In response to questions concerning that location, I believe it was the 22nd, that is, one week after the church and the stadium massacres. 
@MR. BESNIER:
How did you go to Gitwa?  Did you go to Gitwa -- what sort of transportation did you use to go to Gitwa?
@A.
There were no vehicles; we couldn't get any vehicles because we were so many.  Those people that had access to vehicles were our leaders, for example, the military, some of them.  There were also the vehicles belonging to certain businessmen, or, for example, if a bourgmestre had a vehicle.  Some of the vehicles would carry personalities who came round to see what happened during the massacres.  But so far as we were concerned, we went around on foot.

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
And where did you go from to reach Gitwa?
@A.
When we went to Gitwa we left from the round table, that is, the Kibuye round table, the turntable, where many people had assembled, then we went to Ruganda and then to the turntable once we left for Gitwa.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what is the distance from the turntable, the round table, up to the Gitwa hill?
@A.
I believe that it would take one hour to cover that distance.  This is just an estimate on my part.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you go to Gitwa together with other people?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
How many people, approximately, went with you to Gitwa?
@A.
We were many.  Perhaps I can tell you about the people who were just around me during our trip, but we were quite a lot of people.
@MR. BESNIER:
Would you say that you were about 10, or about a 100, about 1,000, according to what you remember?
@A.
At the roundabout, if I were to make an estimate, I believe that we left -- we were about 1,000 people leaving that turntable.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you accompanied by authorities during that trip?
@A.
Yes, sir.  Just certain authorities escorted us.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you specify the authorities?  I do not want you to call names.  Perhaps you can tell us what functions those authorities exercised?
@A.
As far as their functions are concerned, I couldn't be of any help.  But I do remember one person that represented the Kibuye hospital, the counseiller of the city of Kibuye, and one military.  Those were the people that escorted us, because we had come from very far and those people escorted us to help us avoid problems.  There were other people whose functions I do not remember, I do not know, but I perhaps may remember some of their names.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were other authorities awaiting you at your point of arrival?
@A.
Yes.  We found the counseiller of Kagabiro secteur, we found him at Gitwa, that is, before we launched the attack against the victims.  We also found the bourgmestre and his advisor there.  That was the Gishyita bourgmestre and the counseiller also for Gishyita.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were there other authorities that met you following your arrival?
@A.
No, sir.  Upon our arrival, we waited for everybody to be gathered before we launched the attack.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you armed?
@A.
I had a machete and a club.
@MR. BESNIER:
What about the other people who accompanied you, were they also armed?
@A.
Yes.  They were carrying different types of weapons.  Some people were carrying guns, others were carrying machetes and clubs.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was carrying guns?
@A.
It was the soldiers of the time whose names I didn't know, but maybe I could give you the names of one of -- two of those soldiers.  The bourgmestre who was present was also carrying a gun, and he was the one who led us on the Gitwa attack in order to help us carry out our task.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who gave you the machetes that you were using?
@A.
We brought machetes with us from our various homes.  We had them before the attack.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  We are still dealing with the Gitwa attack.  For how long did it last, and did it last several days?
@A.
If I were to look at the date on which I arrived in Kibuye, namely around the 15th or 16th, people continued going to Gitwa up until the end of the massacres.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but for how long did the attack itself last?  I know that there are some people who have said that the attack on Gitwa lasted several days.
@A.
Let me speak to you of two days on which I went to Gitwa.  I went, for instance, today, then I went back and then the next day I went again.  It was during that time that we killed people.  This is because in the initial days we were not adequately prepared.  The soldiers told us to go back to where we came from because they were going to look for material, and it was the next day that we went back and killed the victims.
@MR. BESNIER:
To summarise, will one then be correct in saying that the attack lasted two days but that the attack was more intense on the second day?
@A.
Let's say four or five days, you know, but it was on the last day that we killed the victims.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  But you --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you go home at the end of each day, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Those who live around Kibuye would go back to their homes and we would find them again the next morning.  As for us who came from far away, we went back to where we were living in Ruganda, and the following morning we would meet again in order to go to launch the attack.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you consider this one attack and not five attacks? 
@THE WITNESS:
After killing the victims of Kibuye on the 18th, we remained for some days drinking beer and eating meat, and that means that we resumed the attacks about a week later.  So I would say that we launched the attack on Gitwa one week after the attacks on Kibuye town.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Merci.

@MR. BESNIER:
Were you yourself present on the day of the main attack on Gitwa hill?
@A.
Yes, I was present when the Gitwa victims were killed, in other words, the last day of the large-scale attack.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you go back to that place where the large-scale attack took place the following day?
@A.
No.  We remained in town.
@MR. BESNIER:
The day following the large-scale attack, to your knowledge, were there any new -- was there any new fighting on Gitwa hill?
@A.
I wouldn't be able to know.  But since there was no one else to kill, why should there have been any fighting?  We had killed everybody.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you present on Gitwa the day before the large-scale attack?
@A.
I got there, for instance, today, the soldiers told us that we were not able to face the victims because there was a gendarme who had been killed in that location.  So they told us, "Go back, we are going to collect other materials".  So we came back to the place the next day and we killed the victims.
@MR. BESNIER:
The day of the large-scale attack, at what time did the fighting begin?
@A.
The fighting began at about 10:00.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who launched the signal for the attack to begin?
@A.
It was the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune who launched the Gitwa attacks.
@MR. BESNIER:
At what time did the attack end?
@A.
Since I wasn't wearing a watch, I dare say the fighting stopped at 1400H or 1500H hours, 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Can you tell us -- Mr. Witness, tell us the circumstances of that attack.  How was it gone about and what exactly happened on that hill that day?
@A.
When we reached the hill, we first of all waited for everybody to reach the area and we started by introducing ourselves to one another.  People who came from Gitesi commune, and those who had come from Kayove commune, as well as those from Ramba commune, those who came from Gishyita commune, those from Rutsiro commune, we started off by introducing each -- one another.  And the leaders of the various groups introduced themselves to one another before the attack was launched.  At the end of those formalities, the soldiers had already surrounded the victims to avoid the possibility of anyone escaping.  And the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune fired a shot and the soldiers also fired at the same time -- fired shots at the same time.  
Now, if someone tried to leave the group of victims, we would kill them.  And this is how we killed the victims.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were there any survivors?
@A.
I participated in the attacks and I left after the fighting.  I don't think that there was any survivor left.
@MR. BESNIER:
To the best of your recollection, Mr. Witness, can you once again give us an estimate of the date of that large-scale attack?
@A.
This is an estimate because I participated and I was asked questions about this.  When I was questioned I said that it was between the 22nd and the 23rd, but it would seem to me that I was mistaken.  It was one week after the attack which we launched on the stadium.  Maybe the attack took place on the 25th or the 27th; it's between those two dates.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you please remember -- remind us on what date the attack on the stadium took place?
@A.
I was not yet drunk during the attack on the stadium.  It was on the 11th, around the 11th, at about 
3 p.m.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you saying that the attack at Gatwaro stadium took place on the 11th of April, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, the attack on the stadium, the Gatwaro stadium, took place on the 18th, but the attack which took place on the 11th is the one which took place at Rutsiro.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Mr. Witness, do you know one Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and did you know him before the events you've just referred to?
@A.
Around 1991 or 1992, I went to Kibuye in the company of the ************************ in order to visit his child who was sick at the Kibuye hospital.  And once we got to the Kibuye roundabout, a vehicle came down and the **************pointed out to me one man and told me that he was working in the cabinet of the prime minister.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was that the first time you were seeing the man?
@A.
It was my first time to see the man, and I wasn't really interested in knowing him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see that man again afterwards?
@A.
I never saw that man again subsequently, but I was asked questions about him when the prison director wanted to take me to show me a job which I was to do because I had pleaded guilty.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you have not seen this man from 1991/'92 till date? 
@THE WITNESS:
I was shown that man during that period of time.  I was told that he was one of the persons of authority and that he was working in the prime minister's office, but I never saw him again after that.
@JUDGE KHAN:
So it means that you have seen him only once in 1991, '92.  Is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
I saw him only once, but questions were put to me about him at the prosecutor's office.  At least twice I was asked questions about him and I remembered him.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Whether in 1991, '92, his name was disclosed to you? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was told that his name was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, who was working in the office of the prime minister.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Witness, in your written statement, which you gave to the Defence investigator on the 14th of August 2003, you said, "With regard to Ndindabahizi, I know him very well".  How could you say that you knew him very well?
@A.
I said that I knew him very well because when -- he was shown to me at the roundabout.  Later on I was asked questions about him at the prosecutor's office.  I was asked whether I had collaborated with him or whether I had seen him during the killings.  And, once again, the ************************* *********** asked me questions about him and he asked me to receive 50 dollars in order to accuse Ndindabahizi.  It was on that occasion that I remembered him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you please describe the person that you saw in 1991, 1990 (sic), and how is it that you recall that he was named -- his name was Ndindabahizi?
@A.
When he was pointed out to me, I couldn't observe him for a long time.  He was a short man, a man of short stature and his head seemed somewhat large, but I wasn't able to observe him minutely -- in minute detail.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi or were you told that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present during the Gitwa attack?
@A.
That large-scale attack which I spoke of, during that attack we killed people, but I never heard any mention made of that man's name.  And we would introduce one another.  This very important man would have given us something had he been there.

@MR. BESNIER:
Did you ever hear mention made of the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Gitwa that day before the attack, the large-scale attack on Gitwa?
@A.
No.  Me, as a man who is speaking the truth and who was the first to plead guilty amongst the detainees in Kibuye -- the others were unable to speak the truth -- I, myself, know that I never saw this man, nor did I hear his name, and at the prison there were Gacaca-type meetings.  During these Gacaca meetings at the prison, his name was never mentioned.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you just say that this very important man would have given us something had he'd been there; did you say that?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I said that because I was wearing military uniform, although I was a civilian.  Had I been able to see him at that location, there would have been a reception organised for us so he would have gone down to the town with us.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are talking about the event at Gitwa hill, are we not, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
I understand.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, what would he have given you, that important man? 
@THE WITNESS:
For example, for those of us who came from far, he would not have let us go given the fact that we had to help him do his dirty job.  He would have given us some money. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Every important man that visited the spot would give you some money? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  For example, the day Gishyita commune bourgmestre gave us 20,000 Rwandan francs in Kibuye and a conseiller of the secteur, in his company, gave us 15 Rwandan francs as a way of congratulating us for coming from afar to help him.  During that period, the préfet who helped us to go from Rutsiro to Kibuye, used to give us beer to drink.  He used to send us the beer. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, you stated that he would have given you some money given that you had done an important job for him.  Who are you referring to?
@THE WITNESS:
I was referring, for example, to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi because he wouldn't have left without giving us anything because we wanted some assistance for our own subsistence while we were there.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Witness, in summary, you are saying that if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi would have been there, he would have given you money; is that correct?
@A.
He would not have left without giving anything because that had been the case with all of those who were collaborating with us.
@MR. BESNIER:
But, did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi come or not?
@A.
I did not see him during that period; neither did I hear his name, Ndindabahizi, during that period when we were killing people at Gitwa.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  At Gitwa more specifically, can you tell us where the vehicles of the officials who came were normally parked?
@A.
There's a place on the road very close by where they used to park the vehicles, and would go from there to surround the hill.
@MR. BESNIER:
The vehicles which were parked, were they parked together or were they spread around the hill?
@A.
Those vehicles were parked in the same place.
@MR. BESNIER:
From your position before the attacks, could you see the vehicles arrive?
@A.
The vehicles who come up to this spot, stop and park.  We leave them to launch our attacks.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Ndindabahizi come in a vehicle?  Not on the day of the attack, but the day before at Gitwa?
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness --
@THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't know because those of us who live in town were aware of each vehicle that passed by, and we were in a position to know if this or that other person had come by.
@MR. BESNIER:
The first portion of the witness's answer appears contradictory to the second portion.  Would that be an interpretation problem because he says he cannot confirm.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you just repeat your question, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, the day before the large-scale attack, did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi come in a vehicle to the Gitwa hill?
@A.
I never saw him on the Gitwa hill.  Neither, did I hear anyone talk about one Ndindabahizi arriving at that place.  We were present, and I'm not lying.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, did any official, apart from Ndindabahizi, did any official arrive on the day of the attack or the previous day to distribute machetes to the attackers?
@A.
I did not see anybody come in a vehicle to distribute machetes.  What I do know, and that is the truth, is that we had our machetes before.  The military vehicles which came from Kibuye to Gitwa, and on board of which -- which was carrying some people, those other people had their own weapons to come and attack.  Nobody came without his own weapon to participate in the attack.  Everybody was already armed.  We were carrying our weapons which we used in Rutsiro, and people who came from other regions had their own weapons.  I know that we did not receive any weapons at that place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Since there were thousands of you, would it not have been possible that some of you lost their machetes, or forgot to bring them and that it would have been necessary to supply them with new machetes?
@A.
I was present and I participated in these attacks, and I'm not lying.  I cannot lie since we killed so many people.  Each one of us had his own weapon and he -- those who did not have weapons could not have left their homes without weapons.  Those who did not have weapons, remained at home.  And those who came, had their own weapons.  When we were leaving the roundabout and going to the place where we had to attack, we carried our own weapons.  That's all I can tell you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Let's move on to another question.  Would it not have been possible, to your knowledge, that the Tutsis in charge of watching over the attackers, had some weapons?
@A.
I was present and I'm a criminal.  I do not believe that anyone could come within three or four metres of me.  No one could get close to us.  That appears impossible to me.  They were far from us.  They got close to us when we shot at them, when they had no choice.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Witness.  Following the Gitwa attack, where did you go?
@A.
We went to Bisesero.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what did you do at Bisesero?
@A.
There were many Tutsis at Bisesero, it was incredible, and they were killed by many attackers who came from various regions of the country.  It is difficult to explain, but that is how it happened and we need to -- we have to explain to you because we participated in these attacks.  There were many, and we -- and the attackers were also many.
@MR. BESNIER:
And to conclude, were the Tutsis of Bisesero exterminated?
@A.
The Tutsi of Bisesero died because there were heavy weapons which were used.  We, the civilians who were using machetes and clubs, could not face them.  We could not face up to them if the soldiers from various other regions did not come to help us.
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you ever seen Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Bisesero, or did you ever hear people say that he was present?
@A.
No.  At Bisesero, there were a lot of people that came from Gisenyi, Nyamyumba, Kayove, from Bugarama, from various regions, but at the end of the attack, we meet at the roundabout and discuss.  People spread around and we discussed what we have just done, and I did not hear anyone mention this name at this place, but we heard other names mentioned even if there were a lot of people.
@MR. BESNIER:
During the genocide, did you ever go to a place called Gaseke or Kayenzi?
@A.
Yes, we went to Gaseke.  I went through -- I passed through Gaseke coming from Kibuye and we found a roadblock there.  I was in that place.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you witness any crime at that roadblock?
@A.
When I got there, they had killed a white man at a roadblock.
@MR. BESNIER:
And do you recall the approximate date of this crime?
@A.
No.  It would be a lie if I should give you a date, but I think it was the end of May.  I did not know then that I was going to be questioned on these facts.  When we were committing those crimes, we thought there was going to be -- there were not going to be any consequences.  If I knew there were going to be consequences, I would not have participated in those crimes, so I did not take note of the date.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you, yourself, kill this white man that you are referring to?
@A.
No, I did not kill him, but I was with those who killed him.  I cannot say that I did not kill him because I was part of the gang that did the killing, so it means that I participated.  All of us could not have killed him, and there were some in the group who dealt in the blow that kill him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell the Court who killed him, and how he killed him?
@A.
We got there on our way from Kibuye and we found people at a roadblock.  They told us that you people from Rutsiro should stay here since you have helped -- "Stay here, there's a vehicle which has stopped and in the vehicle there's a Belgian, a white man that we have to kill, so stay here and help us."  So, we stayed there waiting the arrival of the white man.  We were told he was in Kibuye.  We waited and the white man arrived in the afternoon aboard the vehicle, and what was planned took place.  What you were expected to do, was done.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who hit this white man?  Who dealt in the blow?
@A.
It was a young man called Shofo who hit him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
$No interpretation)
@A.
I don't know how that name is written.  I only heard people mention the name.
@MR. BESNIER:
This white man, was he a Tutsi, because why was he killed?
@A.
When he was still in Kibuye and when we were at the roadblock and were told that there was a white man who was in Kibuye who had to be killed, we asked those men at the roadblock; including one Kapitolo.  Kapitolo was a bus driver.  His bus goes through Gisiza and will go all the way to Gisenyi, so we ask him whether it was necessary for this man to die.  He said, "Yes, he has to die."  They asked us to help them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why was it necessary to kill that man?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I don't know why he had to be killed.  Kapitolo told us that he had been asked, that somebody called Nkubito asked him to do that.  I don't know Nkubito, but he told us that this person had to die, he had to be killed, and he was saying that he was one of those people who killed Habyarimana.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know if somebody from your group took money from this man before -- after he was killed?
@A.
Before we kill him, we remove his clothes and he had a bag.  It's Kapitolo who took his money from him and gave us 5,000 francs.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to spell Kapitolo?
@A.
No.
@MR. BESNIER:
I hear people mention the name, but I don't know how it is written.

@A.
About three hours.

What did you come to do at that roadblock?
@A.
I was coming from Kibuye where we were lodging.
@MR. BESNIER:
And where were you going?
@A.
I was going home.  It was on my way home.
@MR. BESNIER:
I might understand that your presence at that roadblock was by chance, that you were just on your way.
@A.
I got there, but the fact of killing this man was not different from the other crimes that I committed.  The other crimes I committed were many more.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell us who was at this roadblock, who was manning the roadblock?
@A.
There was somebody at this roadblock and I found him in prison.  He wanted to avoid me, but I asked him if he did not remember me, and he told me he did not remember me, that he never saw me.  I told him that "Well, I met you at the Gaseke roadblock."  He answered me that we should not talk about such things just because a white man had been killed at a roadblock and that I could be held responsible for the killing of that man.  His name is Gaspard Bavuriki.  He's currently at Gisovu and he was at the Gaseke roadblock. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you ever told the name of the white man that you killed, or that the band you were a member of killed -- the gang you were a member of killed?

His name was Nors.

@A.
They didn't say so.  How could they have said so, unless, of course, they had gone through that roadblock, they would have said so, but they didn't mention Ndindabahizi's name throughout the time I was there at the roadblock.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you, Witness.  Now, let us move on to another issue.  The investigators of this Tribunal, the investigators of the Prosecutor, did they come to visit you in prison to ask you to testify against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
During the trial of Préfet Kayishema, I was in Kibuye, and the prison guard came to see me inside the prison and took me to the Prosecutor's office.  When we arrived at the Prosecutor's office he told me these two white men are looking for people that are aware of what Ndindabahizi was doing.  He explained that he was going to take me away to explain what I knew about Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and about the crimes that we had committed together.  He said that I was going to be paid 50 dollars.  This is all that I know.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who told you that you would be paid?  Was it the guard or the investigators?
@A.
The prison guard told me that if I gave good explanations they were going to give me 50 dollars, but the two white persons were with a judicial police inspector from Kibuye who was translating into Kinyarwanda.  The IPJ talked to the white people, and the white man answered and he explained to me what they had said in Kinyarwanda, but I was not able to do that.  We didn't agree, so that I had to go back to prison.  So that the prison guard, upon saying that, told me that I would never ever have permission to go out even to draw some water from the well, because if I go out I would be killed, so that I never went out of prison.  I stayed inside the prison.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you refuse to testify against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I committed a lot of crimes.  I accepted to be punished for that.  I cannot protect anybody that has committed said crimes.  I couldn't protect Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Had he committed such crimes I would have accused him.  I was sentenced, and had he committed the same crimes, I would expect that he would be sentenced accordingly.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Witness, without telling us the name of the prison guard, can you tell us if you remember his name?  But do not mention  the name.
@A.
Yes, I do remember his name.

JUDGE KHAN:
Excuse me, before Prosecution start cross-examination, I have a legal query to ask: whether keeping in view his character, he being a convict and a criminal, his statement before this Tribunal is worth credit?  This is for you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Madam The Judge, can I make three points?  
One is this person came to testify in all sincerity.  
Two.  Nothing in the RP on the statutes of the Tribunal makes a distinction between detainees and others so -- a detained witnesses and non-detained witness.  
Three.  I believe, of course, it is up to the Tribunal to determine.  As far as I'm concerned, this man recognised his crimes, he pleaded guilty, and that would mitigate in favour of his credibility. 
Finally, the Prosecutor himself introduced in his evidence a detained witness himself.

Mr. Witness, did you, in 1994, participate in the destruction of property belonging to Tutsis?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You have also testified that you participated in the mass killing of Tutsis during the genocide in Rwanda, have you not, sir?
@A.
That is true.  I will not hide that fact.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that the killings that you talk about in your testimony were being carried out throughout Rwanda, as a country, and not only in Kibuye at that time.  Is that not the case?
@A.
Well, what I can say is that at the site of the massacres I found a lot of attackers that came from various other parts of other countries -- various other parts of the country.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My question was:  Would I be correct in saying that whilst the attacks were going on against Tutsi in Kibuye they were also going on against Tutsis in these other communes in Rwanda?  Is that not so, at the same time?
@A.
I can talk about the events in which I committed massacres.  I couldn't talk about what happened in the other communes, because I was not there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it, therefore, your testimony, Mr. Witness, that as far as you're concerned, the killings of Tutsis only occurred in Kibuye secteur, or are you aware of it happening elsewhere?  Nothing to do with your participation, just your knowledge.
@A.
I believe there were massacres elsewhere, because it was being talked about over the radio.  It was not only in Kibuye where I was.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, let me talk to you about the events in 1994 and your participation.  The Tutsis that you killed, did you have some personal grudge against them, personally?
@A.
I had no problems with those Tutsi.  I killed them, and that saddened me quite a lot, and that is why I confessed the crimes of which I asked for pardon but which I accepted to testify, so that even those I had gotten to know, know the seriousness of said crimes, so that said crimes never be repeated any more.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Before you started your vocation of killing Tutsis, what did you do for a living, sir?
@A.
I was a farmer, sir.  But I have gone to school as a mason, and when I had no contracts in the construction business, I farmed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that in your vocation as a farmer, you often kept implements to farm your land, like hoes and machetes and stuff like that?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified a minute ago that you were saddened by the death of the Tutsis that you killed.  Would I be correct in saying that you were saddened after the genocide and not during the time you were killing these Tutsis?  Is that a fair assumption to make?
@A.
That is correct.  I was saddened afterwards, when I thought about the people I had killed, with whom I had no problems whatsoever, the problems concerning land tenure or any other problems.  That is why I wanted to testify, because there are many people who do not want to speak out.  I believe that all should be brought out to light so that never again should that occur, so that people will denounce these crimes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that you were not arrested by soldiers or communal policemen during the genocide but, rather, it is your testimony that those gendarmes were implicated in the killings?  Is that not so?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is also your testimony, sir, that the communal policemen and some authorities, important people, were also complicit in the genocide; is it not, sir?
@A.
That is correct, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also not be correct in saying, sir, that it is also your testimony that influential personalities, local authorities, offered rewards to people like yourself who had taken part in those killings, during the genocide?  Would I be correct in saying so, sir?
@A.
Yes, sir, you are correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that such rewards took the form of money and alcohol?  Is that correct?
@A.
It was money.  As far as alcohol was concerned, when one has money, one can easily buy alcohol.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you would have been very surprised, would you not, sir, if any of these influential local authorities did not pay you or reward you and your colleagues in reward for your hard work; would you not, sir?
@A.
That would not have surprised me to a great extent.  If those authorities told us that the crimes were reprehensible, we would have stopped.  But they encouraged us.  They said that this was good, so people continued to die.  They should have prevented us from doing that, because what we were doing was not good, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I couldn't agree more, Mr. Witness.  Let's talk about your activities, then, at Kibuye stadium.  
Mr. Witness, do you recall how many people you killed, personally, at Kibuye stadium on the 18th of April 1994?
@A.
A lot of firearms were used at the Kibuye stadium.  The killers were more numerous than the victims.  I was responsible for the death of all those people, because I was with the killers.  You can't pinpoint those who are responsible for the stadium massacres, as there were many of them, and one wonders who they are.  They couldn't be found, they aren't in prison.  It is a mystery.  People were killed in my presence, even if I didn't deal any blow or if I did not strike anybody.  Had anybody approached me, I would have killed that somebody, because that is what I was there for.  We were just like these, but a person, I did not kill anybody.  But I am responsible for the death of those people, because I was with the killers.  But nobody approached me to the extent that I was in a position to kill them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, you then, sir, before that, before you went to the stadium, you had also been involved in the massacre at the Home St. Jean Catholic Church, had you not, sir, what they call the Kibuye church?
@A.
You often talk of the Home, the St. Jean Home.  I didn't go there, but it was true I was at the church.  And during the massacre at the church, I was present.  I saw the massacre.  I was assisting.  I was like a supervisor.  I wore a military uniform.  I was a chief, and looted material was given to me, but I didn't kill anybody at the church.  But I considered myself as responsible,  one of those that were responsible.  I was there.  So I considered myself as one of those who was responsible, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And before you took part in the massacres in Kibuye town, would I not be correct in saying that you had been involved in massacres at Rutsiro commune?
@A.
Not only at Rutsiro.  There's another place called Gitwe, another place that's called Nyamakumbe; all that is in the Mabanza commune.  There were many victims, there were also many killers in those locations.  I forgot to mention that particular location, actually.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct, Mr. Witness, Mabanza is very close to Rutsiro, is it not, sir?
@A.
From Rutsiro to Mabanza to Gitwe, where the massacre took place, there is a distance that could be covered in two hours, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Two hours by foot, is it not, sir?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified earlier, sir, in relation to the arms that were used in these massacres, that you used or utilised the arms that you already had in existence.  Did you not say that, sir?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Could you help me with this, sir?  How many hacks -- how many hacks, Mr. Witness, do you need to strike a human being with before you kill them, finally?
@A.
I did not use an axe (sic).  I had a club and a machete.  But I believe that, for a club, one blow would be enough to kill somebody, according to what I know about the power of such a weapon.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And in your involvement in killings, as you moved from Rutsiro commune to Mabanza commune to Kibuye town, how many of such clubs and machetes did you utilise, sir, personally?  Just the one?
@A.
I had three machetes in my possession at home.  My wife also had a machete.  There was one machete I used for my work, and another machete that was in the house that was used by the children.  So that I used only one machete and one club.  I did not use any other weapons.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, is it your testimony, sir, that throughout the genocide, you had one favourite machete that you carried about and one club and you never replaced that machete?  Is that your testimony, sir?
@A.
Yes, that is what I meant.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many hours in one day did you spend sharpening that machete, sir?
@A.
I'm sorry, I'm one of those that have decided to speak the truth.  I had sharpened my machete when I was in Rutsiro because I didn't need to do so otherwise.  Had I wanted to kill somebody, I would have used my club, so that I didn't sharpen it since I left Rutsiro.  But one had to have one club and one machete to show that one was working.  Even if one hadn't killed anybody, one had to carry these weapons.  There were many people who were more zealous and wanted to kill more people, and I believe that all those people are now dead.  They are no longer alive.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You played a very leading role amongst the attackers in your group, did you not, sir?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In fact, is it not true, sir, that there were some 69 attackers in your little group of attackers, and you were their leader, sir?
@A.
Do you mean my co-accused?  Yes, I was the leader of a group of accused, but that doesn't mean that I committed more crimes than the others, but they decided that I was their leader.  I was the one who was the boss.  I was the one who was to show them how to speak out with the truth.  That is why I believe they chose me as their leader.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you also teach them how to kill Tutsis, sir?
@A.
No, sir.  It was after the genocide that I taught those people how to speak the truth, because we were so saddened about the events that had taken place.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified, sir, that you were also involved in attacks in a place called Gitwe.  Do you recall saying that, sir?
@A.
That is correct, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that you have testified earlier today that you had travelled from Kibuye to Gitwe town, sir?
@A.
Yes, that's true.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that you testified earlier that you travelled on foot from Kibuye to Gitwe?
@A.
Yes, that's true.  That's just what I said, exactly what I said.

@MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many times did you make that trip, sir, from Kibuye town where the circle is to Gitwa, in  April l994, sir?
@A.
I took part in two trips, but more particularly I remember the last leg of the trip in which we committed unnameable crimes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And what time of the day would you set out from Kibuye town, and what time of the day would you reach your destination at Gitwa?
@A.
I don't know how to tell you at what time we left Kibuye, but we would leave Kibuye in the morning and we would begin the killings at about l0:00, after all the attackers were in place.  In other words, if we were adequate in number in order to begin the attacks.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So roughly how many minutes, hours, or seconds did it take you to travel from Kibuye town to Gitwa, in your estimation, sir?
@A.
It's a one hour's walk, and we couldn't leave earlier in the morning, for instance at 5 o'clock.  We would wait for daylight, and you can understand that Gitwa wasn't very far away from Kibuye.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So it would take you about an hour to walk from Kibuye town to Gitwa, and an hour from Gitwa back to Kibuye, each day, sir?
@A.
Yes, if my estimates are good that would be about it, because we were walking quite fast.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, do you know that the distance between Kibuye town and Gitwa Hill is 10.5 kilometres?  Has anybody ever represented that to you, sir?
@A.
I don't know.  I have never worn a watch for me to be able to make that calculation or to measure that distance in kilometres, but I do know that we who had come from Rutsiro we were good at walking.  We left Rutsiro and we reached Kibuye on foot.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Just to draw Your Honours' attention to Prosecutor Exhibit 2, serial number LIMA 0019871, which gives the distance between Kibuye town and Gitwa Hill.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
Q. Very well, Mr. Witness, let's continue.  During your stay at Kibuye, sir, you testified that you were accommodated at the Ruganda School, did you not say so, sir?
@A.
Yes, that's right.
@MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
Now, who had facilitated this accommodation for you in Kibuye town, sir?
@A.
When we reached the Kibuye roundabout, we sent a delegation to meet the préfet.  The préfet told us that there were houses almost everywhere, and he pointed out the classrooms of Ruganda School.  So we went to Ruganda School with the authorisation -- with the permission of the préfet.
@MR. ADEGOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, Your Honours, did you -- oh.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that it was the préfet that you consulted in this manner and not the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, is that what you say, sir?
@A.
Yes, that is my testimony.  As for the Gitesi bourgmestre, we went to see him later on in order to inform him that we were at the school and also to ask him to give us something.  And he said that, "When you decided to come I didn't ask you to come to Kibuye.  I asked you -- I didn't ask you to do anything.  It's the people who made you come here who are going to deal with you."
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that you had easier access as a farmer, in 1994, to the préfet and not to the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune.?  It was easier to talk to the préfet, was it not, sir?
@A.
I wasn't afraid of the bourgmestre either, because during that time I was powerful.  I can explain to you how powerful I was.  The bourgmestre thought -- could have thought that I was a soldier because I was wearing a soldier's uniform.  The only thing which didn't identify me as a soldier is that on my beret there was no insignia, otherwise, I looked like a solider, to such an extent that even you, yourself, wouldn't have thought that I wasn't a soldier.
Now, as for the fact that I should have first of all seen the bourgmestre before seeing the préfet, I met the préfet in Rutsiro on the 11th after the attacks against the Rutsiro victims.  I wasn't obliged to consult the bourgmestre, I went directly to the préfet.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.   Is it also your testimony, sir, that you participated in the attack on Gitwa Hill with the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune and not the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, is that not so -- is that not your testimony, sir?
@A.
Yes, that was indeed my testimony.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you explain to me why the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune would have been more interested in exterminating Tutsis on Gitwa hill, and not the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune in whose commune he is located?  Could you help me with that, sir, in your opinion?
@A.
I am going to give you an explanation, and please understand this explanation as I give it to you, unless you have another explanation.  But what I am telling you is the truth.  The Gishyita bourgmestre was in the company of his conseiller who was often with him during that period of time, and when we found him at Kibuye, he found us where he was lodging, and he was in the company of his conseiller.  This was before we attacked the victims at the stadium.  These two people first of all passed by where we were lodged.  Now, as for the Gitwa attack, when we arrived the vehicles were already parked, and whilst the various positions were being determined for the attackers to take, when we concluded the attack we went back.  When we reached the town, the bourgmestre gave us money, and he told us, "You have come from very far, you are living here in Ruganda, but who is looking after you?"  It's at that point in time that I came forward with my group and the bourgmestre gave us money and the conseiller did like wise.
Those were the circumstances under which I collaborated with that bourgmestre who was armed with a gun at that time.
Furthermore, the conseiller who was with him told us whilst we were at Gitwa that one Sindikubwabo wouldn't want that a block from the wall remains in place.  He wanted us to completely destroy the house and exterminate all the members of the family.  This is what we heard from the bourgmestre, and this information is true.  I don't know what you can deduce from the bourgmestre that you are referring to.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, where was the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune when you participated in the attack at the Kibuye stadium and the church in Kibuye, was he with you?
@A.
I decided to speak the truth, and now that I am here before the judges I must tell you the truth.  It is true that my case has been closed, but the tribunal and the prosecution office in Rwanda has invited me to testify.  I am telling you the truth.  During the killings at the church, if you were at the Kibuye roundabout, you would see the hill.  Now, to tell you the truth about the events that took place during he massacres, I cannot tell you that the bourgmestre was in such and such a place, but I know that you have good investigators and you are well able to analyse the sequence of events.  We killed the people at the church whilst the bourgmestre was holding his cheek at the office, looking at the people.  From the bureau communal you can see the church opposite, and when we came back from the church, we would see the bourgmestre always there, his hand on the cheek.
At the bureau communal, one of the policemen shot at us.  The person who was shot was taken to the hospital by us.  We left the person at the hospital.  We had wanted to demolish the communal office, but the Gitesi commune bourgmestre tried to reconcile us with the person who had shot at us.  I don't know whether he was a soldier or policeman, and the bourgmestre managed to reconcile us.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must kindly listen carefully to the questions, and I am sure you noted that the question was rather brief, and your answer could also have been brief.  Now, you are entering into details that are not necessary.  So, you have given your answer now about the bourgmestre, and from now on please be brief.
Next question.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q. Isn't it the case - you need to have your microphone on, Mr. Witness, thank you.  Isn't it the case, 
Mr. Witness, that you and the former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune were detained in Kibuye prison prior to your sentence and prior to your being moved to your current location; is that not true, sir?
@A.
Yes, that is correct, I was detained together with the bourgmestre before I was sentenced, but I was separated from him and I was taken to**************** where I am right now.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it also true, Mr. Witness -- and I just want a yes or no answer, that prior to your transfer to your current location, you were also detained with the younger brother of the Accused in this case at Kibuye prison.  Is that not correct, sir?
@A.
I don't know him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know a man by the name Seyeze Ezekias?
@A.
No.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we have the spelling, please. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
S-E-Y-E-Z-E, Ezekias.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, is it your testimony that whilst you participated in an attack at Gitwa, you killed only two people?
@A.
Yes, I killed two people, because even if had I killed ten, I would have to admit to that because I have confessed with the heart.  It is my heart which dictated my confession.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And did you also confess to killings at Bisesero, sir?  Were you involved in the killings at Bisesero?
@A.
Yes, because I killed one person at Bisesero.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, let's go to the roadblock at Gaseke.  Do you recall us talking about that earlier on, sir?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How many people were manning that roadblock, sir?
@A.
According to the people that I found at the roadblock, there were about eight.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you knew all their names, sir?
@A.
No, I recognised one driver, and I also recognised somoene else when I was at the Kibuye prison, we were together.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And are you able to tell us who drove the car that the half-caste man was riding in?
@A.
It was an elderly person who was driving that vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And did he remain inside in the vehicle whilst the attack on the half-caste was going on, sir?
@A.
We wanted to intimidate him, he moved away a little bit, but he was in his vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the attack on the half-caste man, did that happen inside the vehicle, sir?
@A.
No.  He came out of the vehicle, and that was about l0 metres away.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness did not conclude the answer.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you finish your answer, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
It was about l0 metres from the roadblock where the person was killed, a little bit further away from the roadblock -- about l0 metres away.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So can you help me with this; you were at the roadblock when this car arrived, were you, sir?
@A.
Yes, when the vehicle reached the roadblock I was on the spot.  The vehicle was coming from Kibuye.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And after it arrived at the spot what then happened?  Did you get the half-caste man out of the vehicle, or you entered the vehicle?
@A.
I am not the one who went into the vehicle.  There were more aggressive people who were closer to the vehicle.  In the vehicle there were three individuals.  It was Capitoro who brought him out of the vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And in your -- as part of your trial in Rwanda, would I be correct in saying that you actually confessed to this incident as well, sir?
@A.
During my trial in Rwanda, I was asked what I had done in Rutsiro commune.  I was also asked questions on the events of Mabaza.  We limited ourselves o Ruhengere.  Now, as for other events,
I am waiting to speak about them when I have questions put to me about them, and there are documents about them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it the case that you also or -- can you confirm to us whether or not the events you described to us in Kibuye were also the subject of your trial in Rwanda?  The stadium and the church, you confess to those as well, sir?
@A.
The president of the tribunal asked me the following:  "These events took place.  Were you not present at these various locations?"  And I answered that I had been present at those locations, and that I was ready to explain what had happened at those locations.  I, in my capacity as the one who had decided to speak the truth.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Apart from Bigilimana, do you recall the names of anyone else who was at the roadblock at Gaseke, sir?
@A.
Regarding the one -- the people who were at the Gaseke roadblock in Kayenzi, I was interested in knowing the name of the person who had taken that man from the vehicle, and how that person was killed.  I also recognised the person whom I found in prison, who was trying to hide away in order not to confess to what he had done.  So these are those three persons that I identified, including myself.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the name you gave in court as Gaspari Bamuriki, would I be correct in saying that that name is not mentioned in your statement, sir?
@A.
No, you wouldn't have said the truth in what you have just said, because when we are referring to the events, if you mention the name of someone in your statement and people who are in detention with you hear about this, you run risks.  We were only speaking about people when it was the right moments to do so.  If I was pleading guilty, I shouldn't have hidden the names of the people who were with me.  If questions were put to me about people with whom I was with, I gave their names without any problem.
You see, the security situation is quite complicated in Rwanda.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that you simply have made all these stories up.  You were nowhere near either Kibuye town or Gitwa or even that roadblock.  You were nowhere near.  Isn't that not true, sir? You have made it up, all of it.
@A.
As someone who is speaking the truth, I am wondering, rather, where you are getting what you are saying.  What is your source of your information, for you to say that I am inventing things about things which could incriminate me?  What interest would I have in confessing these crimes which are so incriminating?  Why say I have killed all these people?  In what interest?  But please, let us know, who is this -- what is this investigation which is revealing this information to you?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, is it not the case that you have already been tried and sentenced to life and the situation cannot get any worse, as far as you are concerned?  You have nothing to lose, sir.  Is that not true sir?  You are already serving a life term, are you not, sir?
@A.
I have nothing to say about my sentence, and this is because it was right for me to be given that sentence given the crimes that I committed, and only God will be able to forgive me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am going to have your file before the prosecutor and the court in Rwanda handed to you, 
Mr. Witness, including your own handwritten confession, and I want you to look at those documents very carefully and tell me if you recognise them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you help me with this, please?  Can you give this to my learned friend for the Defence first?  
Your Honours will have it with you, and so will my learned friend in a second.  Two documents; for all my sins, I couldn't have these documents translated into English, but I managed to have them done in French for my learned friend's convenience, and I have been made to understand what they contain.  
One document has -- well both documents have a covering sheet in French and then the original is what you see in bold, in Kinyarwanda, which is the Kinyarwanda document, and the French translation.  We expect to get an English translation some time after the proceedings.
Let me take Your Honours and the Court through the document so you can follow me as I read.  The front document which is common to both bundles is self-explanatory.  It's simply a covering letter transmitting the dossier to the court.  Pages 1 to 5, this is the indictment of this Accused person in a joint trial with some 69 other people who are listed from page 1 to page 5.
So it is this person, there is a little summary on him there, we had it translated.  And then, 69 other names who are his accomplices.  That is page 1 to 5 of the indictment.
Turning to page six of the French translation, sir, we then have the indictment itself, and the allegations against the Accused person, and the 69 co-conspirators, and that is from page 6 to page 9.  That is the end of that document as far as the French translation is concerned.
Page l0, the document starting - that runs from page l0 to page 15, is an interview between this Accused person and an officer of the tribunal of the first instance in Kibuye, an interview which took place on the 24th of January 2000.  You will find that document from page l0 to page 15.
Finally, on page 16 and 17 of the French translation, you will find another document dated 20th January 1999, which, in fact, is a translation and typing of a handwritten letter from this Accused person personally, to the prosecutor of the republic, the Kibuye prosecution's office - it's on two pages, page 16 and 17, and in words that are the accused person's confession.

1600H
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The last document, Your Honours, in the French bundle is the document transmitting the confession itself to the court, to the court of first instance -- sorry, I'll repeat that:  It's the document transmitting the confession from the investigating officials to the prosecutor's office.  It is like a covering document for the confession, and it refers to not only the confession itself, but to the interview with this accused person.  Those are extracts.  The French documents are simply extracts from the Rwandan, the Kinyarwandan document, which is more robust, and that's why I have given Your Honours both documents.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, we have spoken at length this afternoon about your activities in and around Kibuye, have we not, sir?
@A.
Yes, we have. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would it surprise you, sir, if I represent to you that none, none, absolutely none of the events which you have testified about in either your witness statement of the 14th of August 2003 or before this honourable Trial Chamber this afternoon is contained in your entire file before the court of first instance in Kibuye?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
@A.
As far as I am concerned, I will ask you if you have the first page of my confession of 28th February, and I will request you to show me the document that I presented to the Office of the Prosecutor on the 4th of March.  If you tell me what is contained in these two documents, then I can answer your question. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, this is pretty much your entire criminal file as it affects you, sir; is it not?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't have the judgement, have we?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We don't actually have the judgement, Your Honour, but we're trying to get that.  This is the indictment; I am more interested in the indictment.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's the indictment and the confession. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And confession; I am more interested in that.  
I want to have my colleagues in the French booth read the document on page 16 of the French bundle in for the record.  This is the handwritten confession from this accused person, and I will be grateful if they can read it for the benefit of the Judges on the panel who do not speak French and perhaps the witness, to refresh his memory.  Grateful, Your Honour. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have one or two issues to raise before the translation.  This document has just been disclosed to me, and I think it is becoming a habit for the Prosecutor to not give us a number -- the adequate time to verify the authenticity of the document.  The second point is that the witness has just said that this document is incomplete and that there were other documents, other confessions who -- which will complete this document.  I would therefore request the Court to accept this document with a lot of caution, first of all, regarding its authenticity and, secondly, regarding its completeness.  
I see that the document has 447 pages, and here we have only about 20 pages.  It's -- I believe that this is a document which has been divided into pieces.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My learned friend --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment.  
Did you just mention about 400 pages, Mr. Besnier?  Are you then referring to the original in Kinyarwanda or the translation?
@MR. BESNIER:
The document in Kinyarwanda has a list of transcripts, exhibits, pages, which begin with page C00 under chapter 7 titled in French, "An inventory of the case", and a listing continues all the way to C447.  The least would have been to give the Court the full document. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That can be arranged. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, let's look at the French version.  First, these numbers; where do you find the numbers, in the French version? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, if I can be of assistance to the Court.  I generated the document so I know the history of this document more than he does.  
Now, the Kinyarwanda document is the original version.  We have over 400 or 500 pages downstairs.  Now, there are 69 people charged in the indictment, in fact, 70 plus the accused, rather, the witness who sits there; therefore, there are witness statements not only for him but for 69 other people, and we have the entire dossier downstairs.  If my learned friend wants me to photocopy it, I will send it to him.  It's not a problem, it's right there.  So he is correct, it does refer to 400 pages, and I have them downstairs; if he wants them, he can have them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are offering, maybe not to copy this because to copy this will be a large volume, but you are offering inspection?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He can even have it copied, if he wants.  I have no problem with that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's that.  
And we have noted your comment concerning the need for caution here, Mr. Besnier; we have noted that issue.  And we are also aware that you have been provided with this, as I understand it, just before this came up, so we note this.  
Now, do you -- having glanced through this in French from page 16 here, and you may well have had time to do that also, on the Defence side.  Have you done that, Defence?  It seems to me that it is correct, that there is no reference to at least the Gitwa episode in the document.  So, what I am asking is really whether there is a need to start reading and translating this document in view of the fact that we will be receiving an English version afterwards, if some elements are not disputed between the parties. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't want necessarily to have any of the documents read into the record.  I am quite happy to enter it as an exhibit for Your Honours whilst deliberating to come to that conclusion.  It's of no consequence to me now that I have established Gitwa.  I have read it, and I can assure Your Honours that none of the areas mentioned in this trial or in this trial or in this - in the evidence of this witness is contained in those documents.  Your Honours may or may not agree whilst deliberating.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, where is Nyamagamba (phonetic)?
@THE WITNESS:
Nyamagamba hill, is in Mabanza, and that hill is also referred to as the Gitwa of Mabanza commune.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, is the Nyamagamba hill called "Gitwa of Mabanza commune" which is mentioned in your interview on page 10 of the French version, is that the same Gitwa hill that we have talked about during your testimony today or a different Gitwa hill?
@THE WITNESS:
No, the Gitwa hill which you see in the document is the one I mentioned in relation to the Rutsiro events, but there's another hill called Gitwa in the Gitesi commune, and it's for the Gitwa one that I am before you today. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are explaining events concerning a different Gitwa hill than the one also called Nyamagamba in the Mabanza commune; isn't that so?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you said that this document is not complete, and you referred the Prosecutor to a particular document he should read and you gave a date there.  Now, which date was that? 
@THE WITNESS:
Regarding the dates, I wrote a letter to the Prosecutor's Office regarding the events in Rutsiro, a letter dated the 28th February 1998.  I also did not hear about the letter dated 4th March '98 which I sent to the Office of the Prosecutor.  Where will these documents be, because these documents have always been in my case file?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This document of the 28th of February 1998 referred to events in Rutsiro; is that correct?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this document of the 4th of March '98 to which region is reference made there?
@THE WITNESS:
That letter referred to events that occurred in Gitwa of Kibuye, and Kayenzi.  It is in that document that one can find those two localities. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, is it then your testimony, Mr. Witness, that it is correct, as stated by the Prosecutor, that in the documents presently in front of us, we will not see anything about the events in Gitwa, but on the other hand, if we find the document of 4th March '98, therewith we will find the events about which you have testified today?  Is that your testimony?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Yes, because regarding the proceedings in Rwanda, when you recount events the way they happened, you are killed in prison.  It's one Bagaraza (phonetic) who was killing people in the Kibuye prison.  You can summarise things, you are called to make your statement, and then you complete; in fact, we make our statements in secret.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Phillips, you have explained that, of course, you selected portions that were relevant to this witness and not the other 69, that's clear.  Do you, in your 400-pages bundle, have any documents concerning this 4th of March '98 document? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, you can rest assured that if I did, I would have produced it in Court.  I don't believe there is any such evidence, and I'm going to put that to the witness.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that I have just placed before testimony, a substantial part of your indictment without the supporting material that contains the witness?  Are we agreed on that?  This is the indictment.
@A.
Yes, I can see that and I have accepted that, I have admitted that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now that is the indictment that your trial that resulted in your conviction and sentence to life imprisonment was based; is it not, sir?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So what has your confession or whatever you might call it of 4th March 1998 got to do with it?  It is one thing to confess, it's one thing for the confession to be accepted.  Is it not, sir?
@A.
The letter dated 4th March 1998 refers to the date when we went to Kibuye stadium, the date on which we did the killings in the church.  It also makes reference to the Gaseke-Kayenzi roadblock and events of Gitwa and Bisesero.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You pleaded guilty before the court of first instance; did you not, sir?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And your name is mentioned in that regard on page 8 of the French translation that you were one of those in this group that actually pleaded guilty; is that not correct, sir?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
To my mind, you can only plead guilty to a set of facts, you plead guilty to facts, do you not, sir?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, this indictment contains a set of facts upon which your guilty plea was accepted.   Does it not, sir? 
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions, Your Honour.  Yes, enter this document as Prosecution Exhibit 35 with the help of the Registry, A and B, 35, A for the Kinyarwandan which is operational and B for the French, and perhaps C for the English.  And whatever other documents my learned friend wants to enter can come after that, all four hundred pages he can have.  I am grateful for your attention. 
$Exhibit No. P. 35A, P. 35B and P. 35C admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, the Court will receive these documents as exhibits, but we note the possibility that there may be incompleteness.  Whether that is the case we will find out later after having received all the evidence in place.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Can I -- can I add a caveat?  There would not be any incompleteness as far as the document which the Prosecutor seeks to enter in evidence.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, no one has accused anyone of selective exhibiting here.  Let that be absolutely clear.  The situation is very simple.  The situation is that you have said convincingly that when it comes to the 400 pages, this is what we have.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yeah.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now what the witness is saying is that the 400 pages are actually not complete, there are other documents out there.  You are disputing that and you may be right --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am not, Your Honour -- I am sorry I have to straighten the record, I am not disputing that.  What the witness is talking about is completely separate from what I am talking about.  I am talking about witness statements like dossier in the French system that contains the evidence of witnesses that testify against this witness and 69 others. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:  
That is what I have left out. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Uhu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
I have not left out any confessional statements.  So it's different from what he is talking about.  I have left out witness statements, the supporting material that supports this as identified in the Kinyarwanda version.  For the purposes of our proceedings, I did not want to bring 500 documents here.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence understand this.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honour, I am grateful.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It is obvious. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful.  I am grateful.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
So he is talking about a confessional statement of 4th of March 1998 and I don't have it.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, we know.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And I believe it exists.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Exactly and that is -- that is why I am saying you are disputing that, you are disputing that the 4th of March document exists and that was my remark.  
So now this is clear.  Whether it exists or not, we may find out later.
The cross-examination is finished, you have noted the exhibit number, Registry, A and B and possibly C for the English.  Thank you very much.
Any re-examination?
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, the Defence has no problem with the documents that have just been entered as exhibit by the Prosecutor.  The witness's answers fully satisfy me, particularly regarding the existence of additional documents, and I have no further cross-examination.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, I have a few questions for you.  The first one is -- relates to the Gitwa hill incident in Kibuye.  You stated that you arrived there after vehicles were already parked.  Did I quote you correctly? 
@THE WITNESS: 
That is correct.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Whose -- sorry.   Whose vehicles were they, who were they carrying, what were they carrying and from which direction did they come from? 
@THE WITNESS: 
They are vehicles that came from Kibuye with soldiers about.  There are others which came from  Kabuye commune.  
There were also vehicles that we found there, and the one I was able to identify is the one belonging to the bourgmestre and his conseiller.  Those were the vehicles that I found there. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
You also stated that you had to carry a weapon to show that you were working.  Who is the person or who were the people for whom you were working? 
@THE WITNESS: 
As you have heard and as you know, during the difficult times, we were told to chase out the enemy and to work for people who were not targeted by this chasing, that is people belonging to my group.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Is that all?  Okay.  Who -- how long did you --
@THE WITNESS: 
If you have another question to ask me, you can do so.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Whom did you see at the roadblock at Gaseke?
@THE WITNESS: 
Not a lot of time at that roadblock because after killing the white man, we went back to Kibuye.  We were aware that we could not arrive at our destination, it was too late.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
What do you mean by a lot of time?  Was it an hour, a day, a few minutes, or --
@THE WITNESS: 
We spent about three hours.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  I want to go back to the Gitwa hill in Kibuye incident or incidents.  You stated that the attacks would not begin until all the attackers were in place.  And what I am interested in is to find out from how many directions was this hill attacked and did all the attackers came from in your group?
@THE WITNESS: 
The hill is fairly large, but since it is not my locality, and since I came running after the enemy who is being chased, I came from the Kibuye direction, I came from Kibuye going to the direction of Gitwa, and on our way back we went around the hill.  We went around the hill and we got close to Gisenyi in the direction of Kibuye.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Were you the only attackers - - I mean the people of your group? 
@THE WITNESS: 
A lot of people participated in the attack, we will not be able to determine the various localities from which the people came from, they came from Kibuye, Gitesi and so on.  There were a lot of people.  But after the attack those who came from the same locality would go back along the same route.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And, finally, Mr. Witness, you stated the victims at Gitwa were far from, but you also stated that you killed two people at that hill.  Did you I get you correctly?
@THE WITNESS: 
That is correct.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
How then did you approach the victims whom you killed? 
@THE WITNESS: 
You mean regarding the people that I killed or those who killed like me?
They shot at the victims and then we got close to them.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.  
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, could you tell us what made you change all night to be a -- person to speak the truth and nothing but the truth? 
@THE WITNESS: 
I didn't change anything in what I did.  I have said everything I did.  I have answered the questions that were put to me, because deep within myself I was convinced that I had acted the bad way and that I should tell that to my friends and to all other people.
@JUDGE KHAN:
We just want to know what made you to make the confession.  What are the reasons for your confession before the Rwandan court?  And why did you choose to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth before this Chamber, before this Tribunal? 
@THE WITNESS: 
What brought me to speak the truth is that I looked at the conditions, the very deplorable conditions in which we killed the victims who were innocent.  They were innocent.  That is why on the 20th of July 1995, I went to the Rutsire, to the Rutsiro communal office to confess about what happened in that commune.  I did not know that I would get to Kibuye to see how things because it was very difficult for me at Kibuye after having made a confession.  And once I was at Kibuye, my heart, my 
self-consciousness told me that I had acted badly.  I even talked to my co-accused and asked them why they were not ready to confess and in reply, they told me that they had acted negatively and that they were not ready to confess their acts and that would be against the law.  I decided to confess because we had acted badly.  I cannot run away from it, and to date I am still ready to stand up to say so.   I have no fears as far as that is concerned.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, this letter of the 4th March '98, to whom was it addressed? 
@THE WITNESS: 
I sent it to the office of the prosecutor of the republic at Kibuye, sir.  I was told that the documents concerning the Kibuye events had been lost so that I had to compile the same documents containing my confessions, and I returned the copy, and at Ruhengeri, I also did the same thing, I confessed as to what had happened in Kibuye.  I returned a copy as well.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So this letter of 4th of March '98 was sent to the office of the prosecutor at Kibuye.  Was it a confession, yes or no?
@THE WITNESS: 
I told them when I confessed the acts in Kibuye and the time, at which I made my confession, I asked that the documents be sought from within the letter.  I did not at the time plead guilty.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
The letter of 4th March '98, did that letter in itself contain the descriptions of what happened in, for instance, Gitwa?
@THE WITNESS: 
That letter narrates the manner in which got to Kibuye and attacked the stadium and the church, Bisesero, as far as what we did at the Gaseke roadblock.  After having enumerated, I told them after having enumerated those facts.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that letter in itself contains the relevant facts concerning these events, your behaviour.  Is that what you are telling us; isn't it?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, had you confessed those, confessed to those events previously or was this the first time you did it?
@THE WITNESS: 
I had already made those confessions at the beginning when I got to Kibuye.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
When did you first make those confessions about these particular events?
@THE WITNESS:
The first time I made those confessions was on the 18th of November 1995 when I arrived at Kibuye.  I made those confessions at the prosecutor's office.  And when I went into prison, I told them that I had committed those crimes, and on the 28th February 1998 I made public confessions so as not to hide anything.  
And then later on I wrote another letter to the attorney-general's office, the prosecutor's office, because I did not only want to talk about what happened in Rutsiro, I also wanted to talk about what happened in Kibuye.  And it was the 4th of March 1998 that I wrote a letter to the prosecutor's office narrating those facts.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So in other words the letter of 18th November '95 contains the same events more or less as the letter of 4th of March '98; isn't that so?
$Pages 34 to 40 by Petrus Chijarira)
1640H
@THE WITNESS:
That is quite possible.  It's possible that the contents of the document be the same, because I usually do not change what I could sign in a document signed by myself.  Of course, we were afraid to a certain extent, because when we gave detailed explanations we had to do with the consequences -- we had to suffer the consequences.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the first time you confessed to the prosecutor in Kibuye about the events in Kibuye, then, was on 18th November '95; that's what we have established now.  Do you agree? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is quite possible, sir.  I did not hide any of the crimes.  I was ready to speak about them because no other one was ready to do so.  Everybody forbore from talking about them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why would the indictment, which came later, after '95, not contain those events?  Why would the indictment not contain the Kibuye events?  Can you help us with that? 
@THE WITNESS:
I was not accused of crimes committed at Kibuye.  I was accused of crimes committed in Rutsiro, not Kibuye.  It was said that killers came from Rutsiro and committed crimes at Kibuye, and I was the first one to confess that.  It was at that time that I had courage enough to talk about it, when I saw that nobody else wanted to talk about it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Now, how many attackers were there at Gitwa hill in total? 
@THE WITNESS:
I couldn't count them; there were so many.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Previously you referred to more or less than 1,000.  Now, at Gitwa hill, were there more or less than 1,000, or was the  figure different? 
@THE WITNESS:
The attackers that came along with me from Kibuye town were a thousand, but those that came from other areas were many, many.  Upon our arrival, I would  be aware that we were about 15,000 attackers.  This is an approximation because the attackers were many. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How many times were you in Bisesero attacking? 
@THE WITNESS:
I took part in only one attack in Bisesero, but, of course, there were other attacks in which I did not take part.  We were at Kibuye, and we spent time drinking beer and eating meat.  There was a lot to drink and to eat.  But the most -- the biggest attack that brought together people from various communes, I took part in that attack in Bisesero.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When was that attack in Bisesero in which you participated? 
@THE WITNESS:
It was following the Gitwa attack.  I did say that I could not tell the precise date thereof in view of the fact that I was not anticipating responding to questions on that issue. 
That attack was the last attack at that location where there were many refugees.  That was around the end of April.  But in May, there were other attacks.  The whites came to stop the massacres at Kibuye.  Even when they arrived, there were attacks being launched.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness --
@THE WITNESS:
I am referring to French people. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So please only answer the questions, will you?  So in other words, the answer is, "I was in Bisesero on one occasion towards the end of April."  That's the answer, isn't it? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct, yes: once, in May.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In May?  Did you say in May, now? 
@THE WITNESS:
During that period.  I did not really pay attention to the dates, but I was there during the attack when there were many attackers. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So in other words, your only participation in Bisesero was towards the end of April or in May; you are not certain about the month.  Is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
I am not sure about the date.  All I know is that I was committing crimes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you tell us what month it was, April or May, or are you uncertain?  That is the question, please. 
@THE WITNESS:
I know most of the dates of the Kibuye massacres, that is the date before the Gitwa attack.  Because after that, we spent the days that came after drinking.  It was only later on when questions were being put to me that I started thinking.  But I know that in April and May, we went on committing crimes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You were at the roadblock when the half-castes arrived with the car, yes or no? 
@THE WITNESS:
When I arrived at the roadblock, it was said that the white man had gone through and that his return -- they were waiting for his return. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So did you arrive before the white man arrived or after the white man arrived at the roadblock during the killing episode? 
@THE WITNESS:
When I arrived, the white man had gone through; he was already at Kibuye.  And when I arrived there, I was told that the white man had left but that he was to be awaited, and that there may be combat and that I should wait for the white man.  But upon my arrival, he had already gone through to Kibuye.  Upon his return he  found me at the roadblock, and I was with the others.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is what is interesting now.  So my question to you is the following:  For how long had you been at the roadblock when the white man returned and was then killed?  For how long before his arrival? 
@THE WITNESS:
I would say around three hours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for having come the long way and giving testimony before the Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you not to discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you.

Can you tell us exactly how this incident occurred? 
@A.
Yes, I can do so. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, counsel is not waiting for the microphone to be switched back, and we are missing his questions.
@THE WITNESS:
I was at home and I was going to Gitaka, and when I reached Gisiza.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There is the pause which causes the problem now.  So will you please, Defence counsel, observe this pause, because it's not only the translation, but it's also the fact that the booth has to push the button so that we will hear the floor inside the room again, and all this takes a few seconds.  And if you don't wait, we can't hear your voice.  Yes.

Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do, Mr. Witness.  Will you please start telling us how it happened? 
@THE WITNESS:
I left my home and I was going to Gitaka. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And what happened then?  Did you see anyone?  Did you see Mr. Karegeya, Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
I reached Gisiza.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Who did you meet when you got there?  Please, can you try and be sequential. 
@A.
I reached Gisiza and I met a group of men escorting Karegeya.  The men had found him in a sorghum field where he was hiding.  There was Ahingereje, Ruganamanzi, those were the most important members of that group.   We went down together, and we reached Gitaka.  And they made him sit in front of Karara's house.  Ndagijimana struck him with a club between his shoulders, and the others said, "It's not a good idea to kill him in front of someone else's house.  Let's take him behind the houses."  They did that, and I followed them.
When I got there, they made him sit down on the ground and Misago and another man, Bisagara, struck him with clubs to the head, and he died.  After that, we left him there and we went back up. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, let's go back to this instance again.  You met the group of attackers who had just flushed him out of his hiding place, you say. 
@A.
Yes.  They had flushed him out of a sorghum field.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you please repeat the names of the attackers or assailants who had flushed him out of the sorghum field?
@A.
I remember Rwasibo, Ahingereje.  Rwasibo was the leader.  He seemed to me to be the most important individual in the group.  He seemed to me to be the leader.  And then there was Ruganamanzi as well. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You also mentioned -- well, now, can you spell Rwasibo for us?
@A.
I do not know how to write.  I can write in capital letters; maybe I might know how to write Rwasibo.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we agree for the record that it is spelt R-W-A-S-I-B-O?  And shall we also agree that the other name was R-U-G-A-N-A-M-A-N-Z-I? 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Actually, these names, Ruganamanzi, the name is in the written statement, as well as Rwasibo, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, yes, that's why I am so clever with these names.  I'm only trying to assist the court reporters.  So then the next name is A-H-I-N-G-E-R-E-J-E, and Misago is easy, M-I-S-A-G-O.  So now we have done our job there, and we can proceed. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So you then met attackers who had flushed him out, and he is taken in front of a house, he is made to sit down?
@A.
In front of Mr. Karara's house in Gitaka.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And there one Ndagijimana struck him first?
@A.
Yes.  He was the one who struck the first blow by his club while he was sitting in front of Karara's house. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And then you said they took him further away to kill him off completely and that there were two people who struck him then.  Now, were you present, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Yes, I was there.  I went to go and watch. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And then?
@A.
Yes, I was present. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And who are the people who took him a little bit further away into a field in order to kill him?
@A.
The whole group was there.  They made him go down, but when they reached the place it was Rusagara and Misago who struck him, who killed him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Rusagara, Mr. Witness? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Rusagara. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And the name Misago is already in the written statement, and we believe that Rusagara is written as it is pronounced.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, what was the motive of the crime?  Why was this person killed, Mr. Witness?
@A.
At that time when a Tutsi was stopped, he was killed.  I myself don't know why he was killed.  It was during the time of the killings everywhere in the country. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I'm going to repeat the question:  who was the leader of this group, of this gang?
@A.
It was Rwasibo.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did this group or Rwasibo himself receive any instructions from anyone?
@A.
No one gave any instructions to these people.  They were acting of their own free will, and it is in order for them to loot. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were there any other armed groups who were pursuing Tutsis or seeking them out?
@A.
The other people who were seeking out the Tutsis were natives of my cellule.  There was an attack aimed at seeking out the Tutsis. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were these gangs pursuing people with the same objective, in other words, for them to be able to loot and kill?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What makes you affirm that the attack on Karegeya took place without any instructions being issued by anyone?
@A.
I'm saying that because if there had been orders from somewhere, there would have been a prior meeting and I would have been aware of that meeting. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I knew him. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you know him before the events of 1994?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Had you known him for a long time?
@A.
Yes, I had known him for a long time. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Since you were young?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
And is it true that you were living in secteurs that were neighbouring one another?
@A.
Our secteurs were contiguous.  My secteur was his secteur's neighbour, so it was impossible for me not to know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you ever see him, Mr. Witness, before '94? 
@THE WITNESS:
In 1994 I saw him towards the end of June.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you ever see him before the events starting in April 94? 
@THE WITNESS:
The killings had stopped and no one was killing anyone else.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
My question is:  did you ever see Mr. Ndindabahizi before April 94? 
@THE WITNESS:
When I saw Ndindabahizi, it was towards the end of June in 1994.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that the first time you ever saw him, or have you seen him before '94, in any of the years preceding '94?
@THE WITNESS:
I would see him before 1994 from time to time; sometimes I would see him, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How many times have you seen him before '94? 
@THE WITNESS:
I remember having seen him twice.

@MR. MARÇAIS:
You knew him before the events of 1994.  Now let's speak about the event of 1994.  When, during the events of 1994, did you see him?
@A.
I saw him towards the end of June.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Can you tell the Court under what circumstances you saw him at the end of June 1994?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
$Not interpreted)
@A.
I was at Gitaka during that period of time.  We were in the house drinking beer and those who were at the door said Ndindabahizi had arrived.  Many people went out to go and see him, including myself.  When I got there, he was surround by these people.  He was asking the group of people, "Who killed these people around here?"  And he went on to say, "Who gave you the orders to kill people?"  And the people kept quite.  So he called out Karara, he greeted him and put to him that question.  "You live here.  Who killed your neighbours?"  Karara kept quite; he didn't have anything to say.  So the question was repeated, "Who killed Karegeya?  You see that his house had been destroyed".  Karara kept quite.  Someone came out of the bar and said in a low voice that there was one Gatete who had killed people.  Gatete was called and when Gatete arrived, Ndindabahizi asked him, "Is it really you who exterminated the people here?"  Now, when Gatete heard this, he went backwards and ran away.  So Ndindabahizi took Karara and said, "Since you haven't said who it is who has killed these people, since you are their neighbour and you see that my cattle have been looted, I'm going to arrest you."  And he immediately took him away.  Up until today Ndindabahizi has not come back.  That was towards the beginning of July, at the time when people who started to flee.  And from that time on Ndindabahizi has never come back to our area.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
How are you so sure that Ndindabahizi did not come to Gasharu before June 1994?
@A.
I can assert that because I am a neighbour of his family.  When he came, people would speak about it and say he - "Ndindabahizi has arrived".  Furthermore, he had given gifts as a cow to his family and people were happy.  So I would be able to know because I am a neighbour to his family.  
In the neighbouring secteur there were his uncles and his cousins, so it wasn't for me to be unaware of his arrival in the area.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Are you sure that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi did not come to Gasharu before Cyprien Karegeya death?
@A.
He didn't come there.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
How are you so sure, Mr. Witness?
@A.
I'm stating that because that is where I was born.  Each time he came, we would be aware of his arrival.  The members of his family would go to greet him and he would pass close by my home.  Therefore, I couldn't be unaware.  People would rush to go and greet him, and he would pass by my home.  That is the only proof or evidence that I can give.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, how many times did he come when you used to see him? 
@THE WITNESS:
^Before the war he came to our home to give a cow as a gift to his uncle, and then again he gave another cow as a gift to his older brother.  I know this because I participated in these events, these festivities.  But for the rest of the time, he would be in Kigali.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What became of Rwasibo, Mr. Witness?
@A.
You are referring to Rwasibo?  Rwasibo was at the head of the attack by the group which killed Karegeya.  Furthermore, we do not live in the same cellule.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Do you know where Rwasibo is today?
@A.
I do not know where he is now.  He was never arrested.  He was reported missing since the time when people fled.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
How many times did Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi come to Gasharu between April and June 1994?
@A.
I saw him only once, towards the end of June.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What enables you to recall that period of time or that date?
@A.
I have evidence on that.  What enables me to say that it was the end of June is that a few days later it was the beginning of July and people began to flee.  This was a few days after his arrival, let's say a lapse of time which was not more than one week.  That is what I'm basing my memory on.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Was it also the end of the major disturbances that had occurred in the region?
@A.
The killings had already stopped because the French had come and they had put an end to the killings and they were taking the Tutsis to a safe place.  I don't know where that safe place was, but there were no longer any killings.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
After Ndindabahizi's visit, had the killings already stopped or did they stop upon his arrival?
@A.
The killings had stopped earlier because the killings had come to an end in the middle of May.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, this would be the end of my examination.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We will hear the cross-examination tomorrow morning.  
Now let us assume that Mr. Phillips or Mr. Kapaya will use not more than, say, 45 minutes; what is the timetable, then for the remaining three witnesses? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, after the cross-examination by the Prosecutor, we will have done with Witness DM and we will have for the Tribunal Witness DO and Witness DR, who we will be able to hear tomorrow.  As for Witness DM, if the Chamber so wishes, please look at the name which corresponds with Witness DM, this is No. 14, he may take some time, and I don't believe we'll be able to hear him tomorrow.  I was thinking more of Monday for that witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That seems sensible.  Now, so, Monday is probably No. 14 then.  How do you envisage 15 onwards? 
@MR. BESNIER:
We were waiting and I think they have arrived while we were sitting this afternoon.  We are waiting for 15, 16, 17 -- those are the witness numbers.  Witness No. 18, for unfortunately professional reasons, will not be able to be here before the 13th of November as this has already been indicated to the Chamber.  The witness -- expert witness Bernand Lugan should come to Arusha on the 17th of Arusha (sic).  This makes it possible that we will have the hearing of witnesses 17; we will have one week during which we will not be able to hear witnesses.  I think -- for the Chamber to organise itself I think the Chamber needs to be informed of this fact now.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very helpful.  Now, we can come back to this tomorrow, but we appreciate to be notified about this now.  
Now, there is also maybe a possibility, and that's something the Defence might consider, whether No. 20 could -- may be the last of the real factual witnesses or almost the last, and thereby we could fill the gap maybe.  You can discuss that with your client.  You can discuss that within the team.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we just had an observation.  We just wondered if there was any pressing reason why we couldn't cross-examine this witness today.  We only intend to be ten minutes with him.  Unless Your Honour has a pressing engagement, I'm quite happy to finish him today and then you can ask judges' questions tomorrow.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
Unfortunately, we have to take the ten minutes tomorrow.  Thank you, very much.

@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the essence of your testimony before this Court yesterday was that the subject of your guilty plea was the killing of Karegeya, amongst other things.  Is that not correct, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that you testified that you witnessed and participated in the attack on Karegeya in 1994?  I can't recall the month now, but just accept whether it's 1994 or not. 
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified yesterday that your guilty plea involved you stating that a man by the name Ndagijimana struck Karegeya in your presence with a club.  Is that not so, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, have you been tried by the courts in Rwanda? 
@A.
I have not yet been tried.  I'm going to be tried before the Gacaca courts.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And your plea of guilty was made under which provisions?  Was that under the Gacaca as well? 
@A.
No, it was in the prosecutor's office. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall when you made that guilty plea, sir? 
@A.
I wrote a letter to the prosecutor's office on the 13th December 1998.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And thereafter were you, at some stage, interviewed by the prosecutor's office in relation to your confession, sir? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that in that report to the prosecutor, you outlined that you had participated in the attack on Karegeya?

Your Honours would find on your desks a document in Kinyarwanda with a translation in French and a translation in English.  So there are three -- or two documents, because the French might be stapled to the Kinyarwanda, but the English is obviously separate.  Some of you might have three, some might have two, but you all have the same documents.  So do my learned friends.

It states that your confession date was the 16th of November, 2002, and that you were arrested on the 9th of July, 1998.  Is that correct, sir? 
@A.
That is a second document.  I pleaded guilty the first time and the document was misplaced, and I had to make a second document because they couldn't find the first one.  They couldn't find the first document, so it became necessary for me to repeat my confession, and a second document was put together.  So what you are saying is true, this document concerns me.

Yes, yes. 
@A.
Sebarame, spelled S-E-V-A-R-A-M-E (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two such names, Mr. Mwirinde and Mr. Sebarame.   Did you mention any other observers of this crime?
@THE WITNESS:
I mentioned Karara and Mwirinde, Mwirinde, Gitan (phonetic).  Mwirinde is spelt M-W-I-R-I-N-D-E.  I also mentioned Nsengimana.  Nsengimana is spelled N-S-E-N-G-I-M-A-N-A.  I also mentioned Sebarame.  These are the people I remember being present at the time, sir.

In your confession statement to the prosecutor, in the last section, which is a statement from you entitled "Commission of the Offence," you state at length the activities that you were involved in, the date, and the location of your activities at the time, do you not?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If the registry can assist in showing him what I'm talking about. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I did talk about the commission of the offence, but I did not give any dates because I couldn't remember those dates. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You say as follows:  "I the undersigned," I skip your name, "confess that we were in Nyarusange," the secteur indicated there, with the district, "province, Kibuye, in April 1994, in the company of Bagaruka and other co-perpetrators named above, and we killed a certain Sekaraga," in brackets "illegible," because the translators can't read it.
You then describe how you had killed him.  You forced him to go to his house, committed suicide by hanging on a rope which someone had given you, and you state there that he preferred to die in that manner for fear of being killed brutally.
Now, you then talk about the killing of Uwimana.  You describe who you did it with and who asked you to do it.  You describe the killing of Habiyambere.  You describe how you did it.  The child of Alfred, you also tell us how you did it.  You talk about a cow that you ate, and the roof of a house that you removed.  Absolutely no mention of the things you've talked about in this courtroom between yesterday and today, is there, Mr. Witness?  Yes or no. 
@A.
But you didn't ask me questions on these things.  It is true that I ate the cow and that I took off the roof and that I killed those people, but you never asked me questions on these, questions on these issues.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I've noted your answer, thank you.
Now, are you -- at the location that you're currently detained at, would I be correct in saying that a man called Seyeze, Ezikias, is also detained with you?  S-E-Y-E-Z-E.
@A.
That is correct, Seyeze is at the same prison as myself.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And does this man Seyeze have any relationship with the Accused in this case? 
@A.
That is his younger brother. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it true, Mr. Witness, that the man Seyeze is the one responsible for having you come all the way to Arusha to testify in this matter, together with the others that are to come?  Is that not correct, sir? 
@A.
People came to investigate.  They came to question me at the prison, and I gave them answers.  But those persons also talked to Seyeze, but I do not know what they said to each other because they came in turns to talk to those people. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  Why are you willing to accept responsibility for something you did not do, sir? 
@A.
I said that I played a part in the commission of that offence because I accompanied them when they went to kill those people.  But I was also one of the attackers because I had a club.  I accompanied the group of killers.  We got to Gitaka, and I stayed at the place where those persons were killed.  This was why I decided to recognise the crime because I feared that I might be told later that I was also responsible because I was in the company of the killers.  This is why I accepted to make that testimony and to confess that I had some responsibility in the commission of that crime. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was -- were you particularly forthright and forthcoming with the prosecutor in Kibuye?  Did he believe your confession and accept it, sir? 
@A.
I told them the truth, and they accepted that I told them the truth, and such a person -- a person whose confession is accepted by the prosecutor's office is given a document that authenticates the fact that his confessions have been accepted by the prosecution's office.  I do have such a document with me. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indeed, isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that the prosecutor made a notation on your confession where he stated that in his opinion, you did not explain the role of each co-perpetrator in the crimes that you seem to have confessed to?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The registry can hand me the Kinyarwanda; I will show him where it is.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Have you seen that, sir, in Kinyarwanda document on the bottom of that page, his comments?  Yes or no? 
@A.
Yes, I can see that notation.  Usually when someone makes confessions to the prosecutor's office, sometimes additional questions are put to him.  I knew that I had other questions to respond to our Gacaca.  Well, I was being told to summarise because they didn't have enough paper, but when I go to Gacaca's jurisdiction, I shall explain everything.
And I should like to add something else, if I may.  I want to explain that what I said is the truth.  If you allow me, I will explain to you why I am insisting about having said the truth. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Witness, I honestly -- I honestly am not interested in your explanation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you want to say about that, Mr. Witness?  You can elaborate briefly on it. 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, in a word or two, I believe that the prosecutor's office accepted that I have spoken the truth, and they gave me a document to that effect. 
Now, we, the accused, have pleaded guilty, we are very few in the prison.  We decided to look for more evidence to submit to the prosecutor's office.  We held a meeting, a meeting of people that had pleaded guilty.  People had come from all areas of the commune.  We went outside the prison, we held a meeting, and we elected a leader, a leader that represented all the accused of all the communes, and we called him the préfet.  So the préfet appointed one person per commune, and we called him bourgmestre, the bourgmestre.  And in the commune we appointed councillors for each secteur, and each councillor appointed people per cellule, a leader for each cellule, and those people appointed police officers.  Now, this is the structure of those that have pleaded guilty, and we held a meeting.
Now, the secteurs came together and appointed people for each cell or cellule.  Now, that was to ensure that all the accused who pleaded guilty were present in the meetings.  We established a list of all the people killed in every cellule.  That we did, and after that we spelt out the names of the killers of those people so that we were sure that nobody would say that he did not participate in such or such a killing, because we were there.  So that if anybody wanted to lie, we will put the truth into his fruit (sic) and tell him that he was lying, since we committed the crime together.  So that is the situation, because you cannot lie in such a situation. 
If the prosecutor has more questions, I am ready to answer questions because I have pleaded guilty.  There are details that I did not mention.  Perhaps they could be asked.  I'm sure that even Gacaca will have other questions to respond to. 
This is what I wanted to say.  We were telling the truth.  We did not want to lie any more.  So, this is all I wanted to say. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no doubt that your explanation has been terribly helpful to the Court.
Now, let's go back to the issues at hand.  Is it not the case, Mr. Witness, that you and your co-detainees in Gisovu prison, and other prisons in and around Rwanda, have formed a solidarity, a Hutu solidarity; and the object, is it not the case, of that solidarity, Mr. Witness, is to absolve your Hutu brothers who are now in custody before this Tribunal of their crimes?  That's what the essence of what you've just told us, isn't it? 
You now have a préfet amongst yourselves, you have your own bourgmestres, a government in prison, so to speak, and you have all come together, formulated your evidence with a view to assisting those leaders in 1994 of their crimes.  That's exactly what you're doing here, is it not, sir?  Yes or no.
@A.
No, sir.  I have something to say about what you've just said.  I pleaded guilty.  I spoke the truth.  I believe that I cannot speak about the co-perpetrators.  If I confessed, I cannot begin to absolve anybody that participated in the criminal activities that we are talking about. 
As far as the government that you're referring to is concerned, this is not a government.  We, rather, tried to establish the truth, and we succeeded in convincing many people to plead guilty.  And indeed, before that, it was very difficult for the prosecution to know what really happened. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You did not operate in Gasharu cellule in 1994, Mr. Witness; is that not the case?  You were nowhere near that area, yes or no?
@A.
I arrived at Gasharu on the day Karegeya died. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You haven't answered my question.  You, you did not operate your criminal acts, by your own admission, in Gasharu cellule, did you?  Yes or no. 
@A.
This is what I pled.  I was not able to protect the victim; moreover, I was still with the killers that killed that person, but I did not assist them.  If not, I did not play any other role in Gasharu, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's precisely what I thought you might do, turn around and diminish your role.  But yesterday, it was different:  You were present enough to know who did what.  Today, your role is somewhat diminished, isn't it? 
@A.
No, sir, I'm not diminishing my role.  If you ask me questions, I will respond, but -- and I will not leave anything aside.  I explained the roles of one and all; I'm prepared to repeat it.  I said Ndagijimana, Ndagijimana struck him with a club.  It was Ahingereje, Ruganamanzi and Rwasibo who flushed him out.  Those were the foremost people responsible.
Now, the one that struck him, that was also Misago and Rusagara that also participated in killing him, and I told you I was there.  So what did I hide from you? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You learned all those things from your criminal colleagues in prison, did you not, sir, during your discussions with bourgmestres and préfets in Gisovu prison?  That's where you learned all this information. 
@A.
No, sir.  The bourgmestres in the prison, do not -- they do not counsel the accused; rather, they tell you to say the truth on what you have done.  Now, those people were appointed to convince the detainees to speak the truth about the acts they have carried out.  Now, the bourgmestre or the préfet cannot advise you not to speak the truth; rather, he would put questions to you to convince you to speak the truth about what you've done, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What position does Augustin Karara, the former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, hold in that prison cabinet?  Help me with that. 
@A.
No post, sir, did he have. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What about Rukundakuvuga? 
@A.
Rukundakuvuga was an ordinary citizen.  He had a post -- he has a post in the Gacaca structure. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So if Rukundakuvuga, an ordinary citizen, has a post in the Gacaca structure, how then does a former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune hold no post?  You're not being truthful here, Mr. Witness, are you? 
@A.
I don't know the type of post he occupies, but I know that he is responsible for something at the Gacaca structure.  I've just spent eight months in Gisovu so that I do not know everything that happened.  I said I came at the time the Gacaca structure was set up, and when I arrived I realised that he had a role in that structure, and my secteur is different from his.  He didn't even ask me questions about what I did because he did not know what I did.  I live in a secteur --

Is that not the case?  Why didn't you mention Rukundakuvuga in your -- as part of your co-perpetrators in your confession, sir?
@A.
I did not work with Rukundakuvuga.  I did not.  In his confessions, he didn't talk about me, and I did not talk about him in my confession.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Precisely.  Precisely, Mr. Witness.  You didn't work with Rukundakuvuga because if you did, then you would have mentioned Karegeya in your confession.  Is that not the case, sir?

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Re-examination, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, at this juncture I should like to make an observation.  This document was only disclosed to us after the beginning of this hearing.  I believe that it is regrettable.  We are not here in a theatre where we have coup d'état and surprises.  We are here to be serious. 
The parties should disclose the material they have, and the Prosecutor should be told that when he has important material, he should disclose the material to his learned friends on the Defence.  This is the observation I wanted to make, Mr. President. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The observation is noted, Your Honour, but this is an adversarial proceeding, and the whole point of the exercise is to impeach the credibility of the witness.  His witness should be forthcoming in telling him the truth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Besnier, we have noted your remark, and we have also taken into account that this is the second time this happened; you made a similar remark yesterday.  The Chamber has discussed the matter.
Now, the Prosecutor is, as indicated by Mr. Phillips, under no legal obligation to disclose in advance documents of this character.  It is also important, of course, also stressed by the Prosecutor, that in adversarial proceedings, the party be given the possibility, cross-examining the witness, to impeach the credibility -- I don't take a position whether this was actually done in the present case, but now I'm at the general level -- to impeach the credibility by submitting documents which have not previously been made known to the witness.  So the Prosecutor is right in that respect.
On the other hand, we all think that the Defence remark is legitimate in the sense that once the witness is in the witness box, there is no longer any contact between the witness and any of the lawyers, any of the teams, either on the Prosecution or the Defence side; and for that reason, the element of surprise and the possibility to impeach the witness would not be reduced if the Prosecution were to provide the Defence with documents the Prosecution intends to rely upon when the cross-examining is starting or even once the witness has entered the witness box and therefore is incommunicado for the Defence.  So, that would reduce the element of surprise for the Defence without reducing the possibility of the Prosecution to impeach the credibility, and we think that is a practice that should be followed in this case as it has been followed in previous cases.  So if that could kindly be observed from now on. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have an observation to make.  It's an observation that centres on the inequality or equality of arms.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The Defence, during the Prosecution's case, adopted the same practice.  The same courtesy was not afforded to the Prosecution.  It is, for want of a better word, unfair and prejudicial to the Prosecution to be asked to submit documents of their own witnesses. 
They are calling the witnesses, not my witness.  They should be making the disclosure to me because they know, they ought to know the evidence and the documents.  We were not afforded the same privilege.  They sprang up with documents; I never objected because that is the essence of an adversarial system. 
The issue you make about the witness being in the box would not be helpful.  Learned counsel, with all due respect, would only tailor his examination to suit the evidence there.  The whole purpose of it -- and in any jurisdiction in the whole world, it is a noted fact that it is not a disclosure obligation of the party impeaching the witness to disclose the evidence beforehand.  It is absolutely unfair.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Now, we are well aware, coming from many jurisdictions in the world, of what is the practice in the world, so we do not need to be reminded about that.
I also take your point, Mr. Phillips, that when it comes to a document which may affect the way in which the examination-in-chief may be conducted, then certainly you will not be doing that until your cross-examination starts.  So that's absolutely -- I totally agree with you there. 
So in other words, when I made the remark about the moment he -- you may, of course, be able to wait with showing documents to the Defence if that could influence the examination-in-chief of the Defence.  That point is taken.  But the remainder of the remark remains; that is, namely, that we have now in Trial Chamber I, for at least two years, observed the practice I just outlined, and it's a matter of courtesy.  It's not a binding rule.  It's not a clear-cut rule, but it facilitates the proceedings in the courtroom.
Now, coming, then, to the point of the equality between the parties, I can't -- are there any documents or episodes in particular you want to recall?  You will remember -- I don't recall you having made any objections previously in that connection, but that is, as you say, because you accept the adversarial principle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Of course, of course.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It happened several times, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
With the same sort of documents from the prosecutor's office.  There was one that was the subject of a motion that I filed, which I haven't received a decision on.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that or which decision?  I thought we were absolutely up to --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The decision on the misconduct of Defence counsel.  It was based on a similar practice.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But what I'm saying now is not particularly dramatic or difficult, it's only a matter of courtesy between the parties.
Now, there were no questions -- do you have anything to add, Mr. Besnier? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have no difficulty with the ruling.  I understand the grounds and I accept it, but I have one question still in my mind.  If we have in our possession after this session documents which enable us to challenge the documents produced by the Prosecutor, will we be authorised to produce such documents in the interests of justice? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will make an application to have it admitted, and then we will deal with it in concreto, case-by-case basis based on the situation.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that yesterday you testified to the effect that you were guilty for three murders which you yourself committed? 
@A.
That is true, but there were some of my co-perpetrators whom I did not mention because there were many.  But it is true that I committed these crimes, and I confessed to them.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that with regard to other crimes, you testified yesterday that you had played the role of an eyewitness, and that your guilty role was attributed to you mainly because of your passiveness?
@A.
No one has even accused me of these crimes.  I voluntarily provided this information concerning the crimes so that the legal authorities are aware. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Am I correct in saying that for the murder of Cyprien Karegeya you are described as an eyewitness, as a passive witness of the murder, and that you are not yourself accused of having struck any blow?
@A.
I do accept my responsibility in that crime because people saw me pass by.  I was in the group of attackers.  I was armed with a club, and for those who saw me, I was a criminal amongst others.  And that is why I am counting myself amongst the attackers who killed Karegeya.  And people who were seeing me on the scene -- at the scene of the crime could not say that I was not part of the criminals involved, and that is why I voluntarily gave information regarding that crime so that one is aware of exactly what happened. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
With regard to the murder of Cyprien Karegeya, are there any documents in the possession of the Rwandan courts containing confessions given by you, giving an account of the events?
@A.
Yes, such a document exists.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You will see that this document is attached to your confession, a document which was given to you today. 
@A.
But I think I saw Karegeya's name in the documents which were given to me. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness -- I do not want to ask a leading question, Mr. President -- but the name of Karegeya does not exist in the documents which you were given today.  Does that mean that there were other confessions or other documents bearing the name of Karegeya and which you voluntarily did not wish to submit, so that we have a complete document? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, why is Mr. Karegeya's name not mentioned in the present document, the one in front of us?  Why is that? 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know how they omitted mentioning Karegeya's name.  I mentioned it.  Furthermore, I have in my possession a document which testifies to the fact that I mentioned that name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that, the one you have in your possession? 
@THE WITNESS:
I have a document.  In fact, it's a copy of my confession that I sent to the prosecutor.  The first document which I sent to the prosecutor was lost, and I made a second document.  So I do not understand why the name of Karegeya does not appear in that document, whereas I had spoken about him and I gave the names of persons who had killed him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when you sent that second document to the prosecutor, was that a document containing the names we have in front of us here, but in addition, also Mr. Karegeya's name?  Is that your testimony? 
@THE WITNESS:
I remember that I mentioned Karegeya's name.  I was asking the person who was writing for me, because I don't know how to write, to add Karegeya's name.  So I don't understand how come he didn't mention Karegeya's name, but I'm positive that in the document I have, that name exists. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But when you provided this second round of information, did you then give these names, plus Mr. Karegeya's name?
@THE WITNESS:
I asked the person who was writing for me to also note down Karegeya's name, but I didn't take care to find out whether he'd actually written Karegeya's name.  Maybe he forgot to mention Karegeya's name, but I had asked him to do so.  I'm positive that I asked him to add Karegeya's name. 
There were two documents.  First of all, there was a document in which my confession appeared, and then there was a document in which I was testifying on persons who killed Karegeya in my presence.  Therefore, I did not omit to add Karegeya's name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you also mentioned these other names in that connection on that occasion; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The problem of documents which are disclosed at the last minute is that we are unable to verify their completeness.

@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Mr. Witness, was your confession read to you, the one which is before us?
@THE WITNESS:
No, it wasn't read to me.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
And how much time did you spend at Gitaka roadblock.
@THE WITNESS:
I was not at the Gitaka roadblock.  That roadblock was erected in the Gitesi secteur, whereas, I was in Buyea secteur.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
And where was Karegeya killed?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was killed in Gitaka behind the buildings.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Which buildings?
@THE WITNESS:
It was behind the row of buildings which was somewhat below.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Was one of those buildings Gitanen Karara, the trader's house?
@THE WITNESS:
No.  The first building belonged to Myera and the second to Sebarame.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have not understood you very well.  Where was the Gitaka roadblock, according to you?
@THE WITNESS:
When I arrived in Gitaka in 1994 I saw the roadblock.  It was erected between Karara's house and that belonging to Ndabukiye.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
But that is not where Karegeya was killed?
@THE WITNESS:
We had already passed the roadblock and it was behind the buildings, a little bit further away from the roadblock that Karegeya was killed.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
So you never spent any time at this roadblock, then?
@THE WITNESS:
No.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
You mentioned in your evidence yesterday that after the arrival of the accused in Gitaka, a few days later people began to flee, and you say this was at the end of May or beginning of June.  Is that what you said?
@THE WITNESS:
I said that I saw Ndindabahizi at the end of June and people began to flee at the beginning of July, the first week of July.  I think that's what I explained yesterday, and that's how the events occurred.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
The war was over, wasn't it?  So why were people --
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  People were leaving the country.  Ordinary citizens were no longer being killed.  There was rather a war between the soldiers.  The disturbances amongst the population had come to an end and there was only the soldiers that were in confrontation during this time.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Then you also stated -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that the Accused could not have killed Karegeya because there was no prior meeting.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
My question then is, were there prior meetings in respect of the victims whom you killed or others who were killed?
@THE WITNESS:
No, there were no meetings.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Thank you, that's all. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, were you provided with a copy of the confession statement made before the Rwandan Court?

@THE WITNESS:
I have a copy but the other was sent to the Prosecutor's Office.  I'm keeping a copy with me in the prison.

@THE WITNESS:
I had told them to write down his name and I believe his name is there.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did you read that name?  Did you know that name was there?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know how to read.  I'm sure his name is there, because I asked that the name be mentioned, so I don't know how it couldn't be written down.  I cannot read what was written by hand.  When I'm given a document I keep it.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You are unable to read even your own language?
@THE WITNESS:
When it's a typed document I can read it and that's the case if it's in capital letters, but if it's written by hand I am unable to read.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Your confession was recorded in handwriting?
@THE WITNESS:
Someone was taking down notes for me.  I was asking someone to take notes for me, and the confession was taken down by hand.
@JUDGE KHAN:
The copy provided to you, is it a handwritten or a typed copy?
@THE WITNESS:
I kept a copy but the other one was sent to the Prosecutor.  Nobody gave me a copy.  In other words, no one sent us a typewritten copy of what we had said.  I kept the handwritten version.
@JUDGE KHAN:
That handwritten version was provided by the Court, by the Rwandan Court?
@THE WITNESS:
No, no, it's prisoners, it's my fellow-prisoners who wrote for me, and then a copy of that document was sent to the Prosecutor's Office.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, who was the leader of the group that killed Mr. Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
I saw Rwasibo, who was conducting himself like a leader.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You formed part of that group, did you, but he was the leader or you were not sure of him?
@THE WITNESS:
I can consider myself as an observer.  I was not with them in the beginning.  We met along the way, and I joined the group.  We did not discuss the plan together.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you -- but you were present when the person was killed.  What was the distance between you and the spot where he was killed, physically?
@THE WITNESS:
It's a distance that I can cover, if I walk at a fast pace, in five minutes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you five minutes away from the spot where this person was killed?  Were you five minutes walking distance away?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I was very close to these persons, about ten metres from these people.  I was a bit uphill in relation to where they were.  I was not further than ten metres away.  And I could see a person and whatever he was doing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if Rwasibo was the leader, why is Rwasibo not mentioned in this document with persons present during killing?  In other words, the document containing perpetrators and observers, why is his name not mentioned in that document which was shown to you just a few moments ago?
@THE WITNESS:
Rwasibo was often mentioned.  How did you know him, Mr. President?  I'm sure it's because his name is in a document that you have.  How then do you explain his presence in the document?  I mentioned him in all the documents.  I could not have covered up his name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, did you mention his name when you made your explanation to the Prosecutors and when you confessed to your crimes?  Did you mention Rwasibo's name?
@THE WITNESS:
At that time I did not mention Rwasibo simply because I was talking about myself.  When I gave my testimony perhaps I should have mentioned him in my testimony, but with regard to my confession, the confession is about what I did personally.  But the testimony about -- that arose in the second part and his name is mentioned therein.  I think there's a portion of my testimony which you did not receive.  There were two parts, my confession and then my testimony.  It is possible to see it in one portion of the document and not in the other.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in the testimony before this Court you mentioned Rwasibo.  I'm putting to you that there is no mention of Rwasibo in the document we were just provided with.  What is your comment to that, please?
@THE WITNESS:
I'm saying that in my statement, when I had my statement written, I asked that his name be mentioned.  I don't know why they did not write it down.  I believe those who recorded my statement did not write it.  Sometimes you ask somebody -- you tell somebody something and you ask him to put it in writing and it's possible for that person to forget certain things and to include certain things, that is normal, that is human.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Mwirinde?
@THE WITNESS:
You asked me a question regarding residents of Gitaka, people who were present and who could have seen what happened, and you asked me the names of other persons who were present, people who were observing and who were not killers, and I mentioned his name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He was a Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he present during the event?
@THE WITNESS:
Mwirinde was there the day Karegeya was killed and we found him there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Mwirinde observing this event, the killing of this person?
@THE WITNESS:
He was present.  When Karegeya was taken away he was in front of his door, but he did not go to the site where he was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:  
Who was Sebarame, was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He was a Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he also observe the killing of Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
Sebarame saw him, he came and stood about five metres away from me and observed what was going on, and if you asked him the question as to who struck Karegeya, he will tell you because he was present and he saw everything.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Nsengimana, was he Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was Nsengimana's first name?
@THE WITNESS:
Nasone (phonetic).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he have any nickname?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know his nickname.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
He was present during the killing, was he?
@THE WITNESS:
We left him a bit uphill.  He was standing there, but I do not believe that he was present among those that I saw at the killing site.  I think he was on the road close to the houses.  I don't think he left that place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then Sebarame, was he Hutu or Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:  
Was he also present?
@THE WITNESS:
He was standing about five metres from me and he saw everything.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in your statement we just received here there is no mention of Mwirinde, Nsengimana, and Nsabimana.
@THE WITNESS:
I added this name when you asked me the name of the persons who were present.  We did not have enough sheets of paper such that we couldn't put all the names.  We had to reduce the names and to write as little as possible.  So we mentioned only some names.  They asked us questions on events which we experienced which we witnessed, which we saw.  We gave the essential parts.  We could not have given all the names.  I have given this name before you just because you asked me a question regarding those who were present and who witnessed the killing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know anyone called Joel Ntabwakule (phonetic)?
@THE WITNESS:
It's, rather, Joel Ndabukiye, I know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.  He's detained in the Gisovu prison.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he present during the killing of Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
He was not present. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why is he detained?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I don't know the reasons for which he is detained.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know anyone named Emmanuel Ndabukiye?
@THE WITNESS:
Did you say Emmanuel Ndabukiye?  I don't know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the distance, Mr. Witness, between Tabeya and the place where the killing took place?
@THE WITNESS:
Where the killing took place is called Tabeya but before then it was in the Gitesi commune, and for now, when they are asking their questions about where the killing took place, we used to say in the Gitesi communal, but now that place is called Tabeya.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the place where Karegeya was killed is in Tabeya?
@THE WITNESS:
Now it has become Tabeya, it used to be Gitesi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Mr. Witness, we have concluded your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be escorted. Yes, you have anything to add, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
I have a question, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead.
@THE WITNESS:
I have a question.  I have seen Ndindabahizi in this courtroom.  Can't you allow me to say hello to him?  We haven't seen for a long time.  That is my only request.  Thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a request which is now noted and if there is a wish on the part of the Defence to follow-up that request, then it can simply be done by communication through the witness protection unit.  Your testimony has come to an end, provided that there is no objection by the Prosecution, and there is none.  So that is something that will be followed up administratively and we will see how that develops.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.

@MR. BESNIER:
Good morning, Witness.
@A.
Good morning, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, are you able to tell the Court where you lived in 1994?
@A.
I lived in the Nyagahenga cellule in the Kahenge secteur and Kibuye préfecture, in the Gitesi commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  And before you came to Arusha, Witness, where were you living?  Just before you came to Arusha where were you living?
@A.
The same place I've just mentioned.  But before coming here I was a detainee in a Gisovu prison.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  You are a detainee in the Gisovu prison.
@A.
Yes, in the Gisovu prison.
@MR. BESNIER:
And do you recall the dates on which you were arrested to be taken to the Gisovu prison?
@A.
30th November 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
What are the charges against you?
@A.
I'm accused of genocide.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you plead guilty to those crimes?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
And have you been sentenced for this crime?
@A.
No.  My case is still before the Prosecutor.  It's not yet been brought to the judges.
@MR. BESNIER:
You admitted having been arrested for genocide.  Did you participate in attacks against civilian Tutsis?
@A.
Yes, I have a big share of responsibilities.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell the Court, taking as a reference point the death of President Habyarimana, if you remember that, tell the Court when the attacks against the Tutsis started.
@A.
In our region it was after four days that we started the killings.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did the killings start?  Who gave the signal?
@A.
We were very nervous.  I did not see any authority, but there were attacks and there were attackers from Mabanza, from Rutsiro, and they told us that, "You have not done anything to date."  And I think that is how we started.
@MR. BESNIER:
You admit having committed crimes against Tutsis.  In which secteur did you perpetrate these crimes?
@A.
In three separate secteurs, Gitesi secteur, in Kayenzi, as well as the Ruragwe secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you recall having gone to a cellule called Gasharu during the genocide?
@A.
Yes, very often.  We virtually lived in this cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you going to Gasharu every day?
@A.
We didn't go to Gasharu every day, but we used to go there -- we go through the cellule when we were going for attacks, and then we came back to this cellule to have a drink.
@MR. BESNIER:
And yet the Gasharu cellule is not the cellule in which you have your house.  So why do you go there so often?
@A.
It's a cellule which is neighbouring to our own.  There's a river dividing the two and every day we used to meet in the Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there a trading centre in Gasharu?
@A.
Yes, there was a small trading centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what is the name of that trading centre?
@A.
It's the Gitaka trading centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
During the events that we are discussing, are you able to tell me if there was a roadblock at Gitaka?
@A.
There was.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was manning this roadblock?
@A.
There was a young man called Sumayire Minani and another one called Nbonyubwe.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can witness or the Kinyarwanda interpreters, are you able to spell this name for the Court?
@THE INTERPRETER:
Minani, M-I-N-A-N-I.  Sumayire is S-U-M-A-Y-I-R-E.  Nbonyubwe N-B-O-N-Y-U-B-W-E.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let's come back to this roadblock.  Do you know if Tutsis were killed on this roadblock?
@A.
No Tutsi was killed at this roadblock.  People were brought from neighbouring hills.  Some were killed behind the house and others in other places, but nobody was stopped and killed at the roadblock; to my knowledge.
@MR. BESNIER:
To your knowledge, did it ever happen that Tutsis were killed within the vicinity of that roadblock?
@A.
It is in the commercial centre that the roadblock was located, and I know people who were killed close to that centre, and I myself played a role in their killing.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying that people were killed.  Who was killed during the genocide in that cellule?
@A.
There were many.  There was, for example, Nyiranye; a child called Gatemeri; there's Kayoni.  There's a child of Rwabyuma, and the little children, two of them of Nzajyinduga; and a woman named Tatiana and her two children; another one called Nyankiko, and others.  There's a woman and her child, the woman was called Mukankubito, there was another man called Karegeya who was killed very close to that centre.

@A.
Yes, it is Thacianne Mukantabana, M-U-K-A-N-T-A-B-A-N-A.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, all those names you have mentioned, did you know them beforehand?
@A.
Yes, I knew them very well.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you on good terms with them before the events?
@A.
I had no problems with them.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We heard only, April 1994, we didn't hear the beginning of counsel's question.
@THE WITNESS:
We were surprised -- we were taken by surprise by the events.  Immediately after the death of the president, we were very nervous, very exited, and we were afraid at the beginning.  We were afraid.  We lived harmoniously on the hill, we used to work together, and we were ensuring our own -- our security together, but later when houses -- when they started burning houses in Mabanza, the events went all the way to Ruragwe and people came by saying, "Well, you have not done anything," that is when we started killing, and one person -- you attack a person you knew and you kill him.  It is a matter of shame and we are very sad about that.  I am very saddened by the crimes that I have committed and I know it will create problems for the courts, and that is why I decided to confess my guilt.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You killed Tutsis, but were you not afraid that the authorities or the police will arrest you and put you in prison during the events?
@A.
It took time for us to begin killing, but then later on, when we started killing, what could the authorities do against thousands of people?  It was impossible to quieten those people.  That was a major problem to the authorities.  Those were killings never seen before; unspeakable, but I couldn't see how the authorities could arrest those killings, and had they attempted to stop us, probably the situation would have worsened.  Thus, we started killing, it was because we were very nervous.  We had become more like beasts.  This is the only adjective I could use to describe us.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us be more precise about Thacianne Mukantabana that you mentioned.  Do you remember the date on which she was killed, Thacianne Mukantabana?
@A.
I do not remember the date, sir, but I believe that it was in May, at the very beginning of the month of May.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was there when she was killed?
@A.
Let me give you the names of the persons that were with me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you going to give us names, sir?  If so, give us names of the people who were in your group, who could not be witnesses at this time.  We shall come back to that.
@A.
We were at Gitaka, and when we killed her it was on a Monday.  There was a first person, Nsengiyumva -- a gendarme Cyprian Nsengiyumva; there was another Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu; and then there was Ismael Mbarushimana; and I believe that there was also Frouduel  Bakinahe; there was also one Mpitabakana.
@MR. BESNIER:
Still for the Court and the transcripts,  could you be so kind as to spell out those names?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There was Cyprian Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y U-M-V-A; Ismael Mbarushimana,
M-B-A-R-U-S-H-I-M-A-N-A; Mpitabakana, M-P-I-T-A-B-A-K-A-N-A; Frouduel Bakinahe, B-A-K-I-N-A-H-E; there was also Mbarushimana, rather, Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A; Alias Rutomvu, R-U-T-O-M-V-U.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A general remark.  When there is a list of names given by the witness, and the same list is given in a piece of paper, then, I think, the practical way to proceed is to ensure that the court reporter has the same list.  For the time being, it would appear that that list has not been distributed to the court reporters.  But could that be arranged from now on, that when there are lists of names in the document, then that is being submitted to the court reporters, then we do not have to do the spelling. So that is one issue.
The second; once names are being spelt, it is, of course, important to reflect the names and their order as testified to by the witness and not to follow the names in the list if there are differences between the two.  I am just making those two general observations. 
Yes, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I have taken note of that observation, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Witness, let us now hear from you, briefly, but accurately, the manner in which Thacianne Mukantabana was killed?
@A.
I believe it was around 2 p.m., we were at the Gitaka centre.  Cyprian Nsengiyumva, who was a gendarme, and Nsengiyumva, alias Rutomvu, took her to Gitaka -- they found her at Joel Ndabukage's, where she was hiding.  I asked them, "We were looking for that person for a long time, where did you find that person?" And the gendarme told me, "You cannot search for these people, I am a soldier I know how to go about it.  I cannot tell you where I found her."  And the people said, "Well, now we have found her."  And when we were going out to kill her, the gendarme said, "Well, wait a minute, she promised to give me something," so that we went away and got to Nyarubuye at one Pascal's house -- Pascal Rwuhara's house, there were the furniture belonging to that lady.  We took the furniture and got back to Gitaka.  The furniture went to Nyabahiga -- at the gendarme's house.  When we wanted to take it to Nyabahinga's house the soldier said -- when we got to Nyabahinga -- we wanted to go to Nyabahinga, but the soldier refused, the gendarme refused.  So we stayed at Gitaka, and we took her behind the shops.  We didn't go any further, and it was there that we killed her in the company of two of her children and another man who was at Ndabahinga's, he was called Nyugahingu; so that we killed four people on that occasion.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying, firstly -- firstly you found and flushed out Ndabakeke who was at Bukiye's house in hiding?
@A.
I was not one of those that flushed the person out.  She was brought in by Nsengiyumva, Cyprian, who was a gendarme.  With Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu, they were the two that brought her.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you a member of the group that went to take the furniture -- to steal the furniture?
@A.
Yes, I also went to Nyarubuye.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, you went to Nyarubuye to get the furniture.  Were you with Thacianne?
@A.
Yes, she was with us, with her two children.   We went together.
@MR. BESNIER:
And then you took her back to the Gitaka centre; is that correct?
@A.
Absolutely correct.  It was there that we found that Nyankiko, Zachari, that man -- when you get to Gitaka, you go down along rows of shops and just in front of Gatwa's residence, and when you get to a junction, you turn into a street of Rwuberamye's house, that is where the shops were.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, as compared to the roadblock that was at the central of Gitaka, what was the distance at which Thacianne was killed?
@A.
It was the distance of 80 to 90 metres.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who were the persons that struck Thacianne Mukantabana?
@A.
I, personally did.  I struck her several times.
@MR. BESNIER:
With what type of weapon?
@A.
I used a club.  There were four people to be killed, but I also had a sword.  I did not use the sword, since Nyakiko was bringing about problems, I left after having struck her twice.  She was not yet dead, and it was Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu that finished her off whilst I went off to kill the other man who was called  Nyankiko.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who ordered you to kill those people in particular -- especially Thacianne and her family, who gave you instructions to kill those people?
@A.
You mean at that very instant or just before?  In the preceding days, nobody ordered us to do so.  I have told you how it all started, but when we were on the spot the most important person was the gendarme, and it was the gendarme who told us, "Don't take her all they way to Nyabahanga, kill her here."
@MR. BESNIER:
Didn't you say that Thacianne was being sought after, who was looking for her?
@A.
Everybody was looking for her -- everybody.  All the population in that area was looking for her.  In 1985, there was an incident.  There was a teacher called Jaqueline Nyirabakwiza, who was a teacher in primary 5, she had poisoned -- she had poisoned her, and people were saying that it was her that -- it was she that poisoned her, and that is why she was called "Nyiramasitete".  And when the war started, they were saying that she has to be found and killed, and that is when -- why Thacianne was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This episode with Jaqueline, in which year was that, Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
I was in primary 5, I believe it was in 1985.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  Could you tell me whether you knew one Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before the events that we have just discussed, that is before April l994?
@A.
I used to know him.  I had seen him on two occasions.  The first occasion at which I saw him was just before -- just after his wedding.  He had come to visit his family while in our area.  We were there, we watched his vehicle so that the children do not spoil the tyres.  The second time was, I believe, in 1992.  He had come to our area in Gitaka; he held a meeting there, and I believe on that occasion, he gave us berets of his party, PSD.   We were very happy to join the party.  This is how I got to know Ndindabahizi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi once again during the war, that is, between the beginning of April l994 and the end of June 1994?
@A.
I did not see him during that period, but I heard it said that he had come to our area -- he had come to our area in Gitaka, and that he had arrested one Augustin Karara, who had a shop in the centre.  He had arrested him and he had taken him away to imprison him.  On that day, I did not move.  I believe it was on a Sunday, I was at home, and the other attackers came to see me and they said, "The minister is here, he is very serious."  And I asked, "What has happened?"  They told me, "Well, he has just arrested Karara."  And then I told them, "Well, if you continue to move around like this, you may be arrested yourselves."   And we went to a hill, and several moments after that I saw, from one kilometre away, a vehicle pass by Ndabukiye's house.  We therefore went to the centre after that, and people told us that Karara had just been arrested, and they did not know what was going to happen to him.  This is what happened, but I did not personally see him when he came on that day.
@MR. BESNIER:
Didn't you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before Thacianne's death at the Gitaka roadblock that you mentioned?
@A.
No, sir, I didn't see him.  I did not see any other authority as a matter of fact.  I didn't see any préfet or bourgmestre.  I did not see any such authorities.  And, I pleaded guilty, let me state the truth and nothing but the truth, and if I had seen the president I would have said so.  So that if we speak the truth it must be the whole truth and supply the names of all the accomplices.  So that had I seen him, I would have made a testimony against him, and that would have been done a long time ago, and that is the reason why I am saying he did not do anything in our area.  He did not call for massacres to begin.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you know one Cyprian Karegeya?
@A.
I know him very well.  He was a neighbour in the Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he survive the genocide?
@A.
No, he died.  He was killed, and that is a very well-known fact.  He was killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
When was he killed?
@A.
After the murder of Thacianne Mukantabana, that was less than seven days after that murder, it was at that time, I believe, that he was also killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know how he was killed and who killed him?
@A.
I do not know the circumstances under which he died.  Karegeya was one of the people sought after.  He was very much sought after.  I came to Gitaka, at that time Karara just came out of the Jita pub where he was having a drink.  He was very sad, and he said, "My friend has been killed."  I asked him, "Who is killed?  Is it Karegeya?"  He said, "Yes, it is Karegeya."  I said that since he is dead we no longer had to look for him.  He said that he was one of the most important people that actually had been killed.  And I said, 'Who killed him?"  And he said, "It was attackers that came from Buye."
I said, "Didn't you bury him since he was your friend?" He said, "Yes, I did bury him."  I said, "Well, well, that is the end of all of that."  It was thus that I learnt that he was killed by people from Buye.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you were not an eyewitness to that murder?  Yes or no will do.
@A.
You mean Karegeya?  No.  I was not an eyewitness to his murder.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Regarding your testimony here in Arusha, do you believe that you are going to gain anything from it -- from having -- or testifying for Emanuel Ndindabahizi, are you going to gain anything from it?
@A.
You mean interest?  You see, we in Rwanda only want people to plead guilty if they are guilty, and ask for pardon, because there are people who are wrongly accused.  People are said to have played a role whilst one did not see them anywhere.  Those people are falsely accused.  So, you the Judges must seek the correct information to get to the truth.  We are speaking the truth.  We are not protecting anyone.  We never do so.  We speak the truth, the whole truth, because what happened is deplorable, and it's for that reason that if we are to struggle and show the reconciliation of Rwandans, we must speak the truth so that we know where to lay the blame.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Now, try to be brief in your responses.  I have two more questions for you.  In the prison that you are, did you meet people very near Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, who were close to him, and who asked you to testify in his favour?
@A.
You mean people from abroad, or people in the same prison as myself?

@MR. BESNIER:
Now, people in the same prison ask yourself, all the detainees; didn't they ask you to lie in favour of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Nobody, sir.  We are here speaking the truth about crimes that we personally committed.  Nobody close to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi approached me in that respect, and even if they did, I wouldn't accept.  There are many people that were compelled to plead guilty, but I personally can never be coerced into doing anything.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the prisons in which you are, are there Hutu groups that help one another to lie before national or international jurisdictions, and are you not one of the members of those groups?
@A.
I don't know of the existence of such groups.  All I know is that each and every one speaks out his or her own truth as he or her -- she knows it.  If there are any people who are lying, other people will challenge them. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Isn't it correct that among the detainees that confessed some are trying to help or are trying to encourage their friends also to confess; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct, it does happen.  We had meetings like the ones we had in gacaca per secteur, per cellule, and people talked about what happened in the cellules, the crimes that were committed, who committed them.  They gave the names of the accomplices and everything is said.

The front document, which has 61 written at the right-hand corner of it, is the original Kinyarwanda confession, and then there's a French translation.  Again, we were unable to get an English translation to this document in time for this hearing.  That's the document I refer to, and we all have it.

And when you say "in front of his house", who do you refer to, sir?
@A.
Actually, I'm talking about Seyeze's house, in front of Seyeze's house.  That killing took place in front of his house.

Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you understand that to mean that Seyeze is accusing you of being an accomplice in the killing of that person, sir?
@A.
Yes, I can see that, but the problem is to determine whether Kanyoni is a nickname.  The circumstances that he is referring to are the same, but I recall that that person was called Kanyoni and that's why I'm saying that I did not participate in Simeon Higiro's death.  I do not know whom he is referring to, who he is talking about.  I must know whether that person was called Simon Higiro.  The person whom he is referring to and who was killed or who died at Gasharu, I don't know.  I don't know who he was; I killed many people, I wouldn't know his name.  Sometimes the person may have written the nickname without knowing other names, so it's possible that Simon, Simeon -- Simon Higiro and Kanyoni would be one in the same person; it is possible. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful for that, sir.  
Now, can you help me?  Does the man Seyeze, Ezechias, have any relationship with the Accused person in this case, to your knowledge, sir?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And what is that relationship, to your knowledge?
@A.
I don't know what the exact relationship is; maybe they are brothers.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you speculating?  Are you saying you are not sure, or you don't know, sir?
@A.
They have their sister who lives on their land, on their property.  I was going to school and I didn't know everybody, nor the relationships that existed between them, but I know that their family relationship is very close.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, if you -- do you recall the people who were present during the incident of Simon Higiro's death, who you say may be or may not be the same person with the nickname?  Do you recall those who witnessed this crime, sir?

Yes, there were other people with me.  For instance, there was a soldier known as Boniface Mgabo.  There was another person, and it was very early in the morning.  There was a man known as Uwimana; I don't know his first name.  There was Uwimana, yes.

@A.
I have made a confession, but I was not able to know who the witnesses to my crime were.  I was able to give the names of the co-perpetrators, yes, and that was by chance, because the truth will come out as nothing will be able to be hidden.  And since Seyeze was their neighbour, it's obvious that they knew him, and he's the one who is going to help you and I and the Tribunal, to remember the names of those who were present.

Now, prior to the genocide of 1994, Mr. Witness, what was your profession, sir?
@A.
I was a farmer, but before that in 1988 when I was in secondary school, I left secondary school in 1990 and I came to remain at home.  And when the war began I was a farmer.  I had just spent four years in that profession of farmer or cultivator.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, have you confessed your crimes before the courts in Rwanda, sir?

From the 30th of December 1994, the day on which I was arrested, until today, I have confessed to that crime.  I have requested the forgiveness of Rwandans, the international community, as well as the victims and their families. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And would I be correct in saying, sir that you would have confessed to killing at least -- maybe I should ask you, Mr. Witness. How many people have you confessed to killing, sir?
@A.
They are very many, more than 20 people that I killed or in whose deaths I was involved.  But if there was a particular location, I was responsible for having killed six people.  So I myself must confess to having participated in a crime during which these six people died, and I needed to denounce those who participated in the killings, because we formed a single group of evildoers, people who participated in that crime, even if I had only killed two people out of the six.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that Mukantabana and her children or child, as you say, had been hiding in the home of Joël Ndabukiye before her death, sir?
@A.
Yes, that's where she was hiding.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was it that Joel then decided to betray her and subsequently became involved in her death, sir?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
No, Joël didn't participate in the killing of that woman, but as I have already told you, I asked the gendarme to tell me how he had found the woman, and he told me, "You were unable to find her, so I can't reveal to you my secret how I work."  And until today I do not know who told the gendarme that this woman was hiding in Ndabukiye -- Joël Ndabukiye's house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Pardon me, Witness, for that error.  So is it your testimony that Joël Ndabukiye was involved in some killings with you but not in the killing of Thacianne?  Is that your testimony, sir?

All the people who were living in Gasharu, anyone who you would ask questions about me would tell you the truth, and he cannot have been unaware of what happened in his cellule and the crimes that were committed in his cellule, and he must have been a witness because he was there.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did Karara Augustin, to your mind, hold any official position in the local administration in Gasharu during the genocide, sir?
@A.
I think he was a responsable.  If not, he must have been a member of the cellule committee in 1994, during the period of the events.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And what, to your knowledge, very, very briefly, would be the duties of the responsable de cellule or a member of the committee at the time, if you know?
@A.
Those were people who were responsible for solving problems arising between the inhabitants, and when they failed to do so, they referred the problem to the secteur.  Furthermore, they are responsible for the development of the cellule by involving the population in the implementation of development projects. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So if crimes were committed in Gasharu cellule, would it have been the functions of the responsable to report them to the conseiller or would it not?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you then help us with this:  how was it, then, that this person, this responsable, was then aware of your crimes and did not prevent them, sir, or report them?
@A.
It's true that if there are attackers who attack a cellule, the responsable should refer the matter to the higher authorities, but I described to you what we were like.  Some authorities could do nothing against us.  We could even attack them.  Now, without even talking about the responsable, even the conseiller couldn't approach these people who were killing.  They could do nothing, they could say nothing.  For instance, Karara; there were young people who came to destroy houses in Gitaka, and when he tried to stop them they wanted to kill -- to beat him, and I told you that he was my neighbour, so they made him pay a fine of 30 litres of beer.  So people became afraid, and the authorities remained silent in the face of all these crimes because they were afraid. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How then was it, Mr. Witness, that Ndindabahizi was able to order Karara's arrest, as you say, in the month of June?  Can you explain that for me, please, in the light of your --
@A.
What I know is that these young men who were with me during the attacks told me he came, he arrested Karara and put him in jail, and that he put him in jail because he suspected that he killed. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, if, according to you, none of the authorities could stop the killings at the time, how then did the killings stop, or did they go on forever, sir?
@A.
I think that the killings stopped when the soldiers on the front line realised that they had lost the war.  They fled and we members of the population fled.  In fact, we perpetrated these killings in a record time.  We had virtually finished in the month of May.  There were a few survivors, and, to tell you the truth, when we left the country, when we fled the country there was no one else to be killed.  And they told us something which I'll tell you.  When the French came, someone came and told us, "Be careful.  These French have sophisticated equipment which can track down criminals".  So we got afraid and -- we got afraid and we stopped committing the crimes.  There were some survivors who passed in front of us and we left them alone because we thought the French were going to track us down.  And that is how the killings stopped. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it is your testimony that you never saw with your eyes Emmanuel Ndindabahizi throughout the genocide in Kibuye, sir?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your statement dated the 7th of October 2002 to my learned friends for the Defence, you mention six names who you describe as people who had accompanied you -- in other words, accomplices -- during the killings.  Do you recall doing that, sir?
@A.
Yes, I did. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall if you mentioned all six people in your confession statement to the Rwandese authorities, or did you just mention some of them?  Did you mention all of them, as you have done here, in your confession?
@A.
My case file is very voluminous.  Possibly all the names have been mentioned.  If I were with someone in a certain place it is possible that I went with him to commit another crime, but when they were asking us the questions they asked us to list the names that we remember, and they told us that later on if we remembered some other names, we should come and add them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the registry show the witness a copy of his confessional statement in Kinyarwanda, please.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I'm having them hand over to you -- can I see it; yes, correct -- the voluminous document that you have described in Kinyarwandan.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it is the last document I am going to refer to, Your Honour.  It has got his name in front of it and it has got a French translation as well.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you see the document that I have had placed in front of you?
@A.
Yes, I have the document.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recognise it as a copy of your file before the prosecutor in Kibuye?
@A.
Yes, that indeed is my case file. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, Mr. Witness, I want you to -- with the help of the registry, I want you to turn to -- it is all numbered -- if you turn to page 22 of that document, the Kinyarwanda document, and the name under 5 which in the French translation can be found on page 19, No. 5 as well on page 19 of the French.  You see that name there, Kampira Deboura; do you see that?
@A.
Yes, I can see that name. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know that person, sir?
@A.
Yes, I know this person. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You have described her as having witnessed some of the crimes that you committed, have you not, sir?
@A.
Yes.  Regarding Kampira Deboura, she knows the crime I committed against her because I killed her son, I can no longer remember his name. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is indeed correct, sir.  Now, can you turn with me to page 27 of that document, and can the registry assist him; 27 of the handwritten document, and I will try and find it in French.  I think in French it is on page 22 and 23.  The name against No. 20 in that document is the name Nkurunziza Joël, N-K-U-R-U-N-Z-I-Z-A, Joël.  Do you recall that?  Do you see that, sir?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Again you have described this person as being a witness to some of your crimes.  Do you recall saying that, sir?
@A.
Yes, I did. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, on 21 you also describe the spouse of Joël Nkurunziza as being a witness to some of your crimes.  Do you see that, sir?  Just look under Joël's name, and you see the other entry there?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, which crimes or crime did Joël and his spouse witness, sir?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
They witnessed the killing of two children of Nyirahembe and the killing of an old woman whose name I cannot recall.  So, it is the killing of two children of Nyirahembe and an old woman. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Nyirahembe is spelt how for the record, please?
@A.
Nyirahembe is N-Y-I-R-A-H-E-M-B-E.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you in addition refer to an old man or an old woman? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, an old woman who sought refuge in Nyirahembe's house.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you know -- in your confessional statement you describe one of your accomplices by the name Sendiragora Uwimana?
@A.
Yes, I collaborated a lot with this person, and I know him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is on page 16 of the handwritten Kinyarwanda document and on page 13 of the French.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, can you tell me if this man Sendiragora has any relationship with the accused person in this case, and, if so, can you tell me what that relationship is, sir?
@A.
I do not know the relationship between the two.  I don't even know where this person comes from.  I know he is a young boy who was keeping cattle in the area.  I don't know any relationship between him and the Accused in this case. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Mr. Witness --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Registry, that is enough for that document.  Can I have the document back.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether or not the prosecutor in Kibuye accepted your confession?
@A.
I do not have the confirmation.  After I sent my confession, the Prosecutor received them, but then he was transferred.  Following that, I sought to find out what had happened to my case, and lately after people were invited to participate in a meeting to be told about what should be done in the country, I raised the question as to what had happened to my case file.  I was told to refer the query to the prosecutor's office and that my case file was still with them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indeed there is a notation on your confessional file which indicates that the prosecutor has accepted your confession and has categorised the crimes in this confession under the first category.  Does that surprise you, sir?  That is on --
@A.
There is no problem with that.  In my confession -- in my confessions I wanted to bring out the things that we had done.  I have committed a lot of crimes.  That is why I cannot but plead guilty.  I wanted to ask for forgiveness, and I find it necessary -- I find it normal that I'm classified in the -- in category 1.  I have committed a lot of crimes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your killings were operated in units, following your testimony; that's what you say.  Is it possible for someone who was not in your unit of attackers to be involved in a particular area, or how were those units arranged?  How did you operate?
@A.
We could start with our cellule, form a group of ten persons, leave the cellule, and when we get to another cellule we are told, "There's a person hiding in such-and-such a person's house".  In our group we would take a decision to go, and after killing that person we could go to another cellule and that we might meet another group which would tell us that there's another -- "There's somebody hiding in X or Y's house", then we go after this person.  That is how we used to operate. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for answering my questions. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions, Your Honour. 
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have to enter the documents as Prosecution exhibits.  The first one is the first one I used, Seyeze Ezechias, which would be the next exhibit.  Can the registry help me with the numbers, please.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 37, says the registry.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
37A, and B for the French, and when we get the English I would have that as C.  The next one will be Joël Ndabukiye's, which will be P. 38A, B and C.  Then the final one will be the one for this witness, which will be P. 39A, B, and C when we get the English translation.  I am grateful.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I lost you there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

Re-examination? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Just one or two questions, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you recall that the Prosecutor asked you a question on the killing of the child of Rwabyuma?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you admitted having committed that crime?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
The Prosecutor referred to witnesses who witnessed that killing, and as witness you mentioned Mukamana Julien.  Do you remember that?
@A.
Yes, I said so.
@MR. BESNIER:
And then the Prosecutor referred to one Sibomana.  You did say that he lived in the neighbourhood, in the region; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
During the killing of the children was Sibomana present?  Did you see him?
@A.
Since I was with Ndabukiye, Ndabukiye was mentioning the names of these persons.  I am sure that I saw Mukamana Julien, he came from Kirambo to hide in that locality.  But regarding Sibomana and the other name that I saw, it was -- the crime site is close to the house, it is possible that they were there.  And I brought out this child from a banana plantation, everyone could see us, and I see that what these witnesses are saying is -- is true. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, the question is simple; you can give a yes or no answer.  Did you, yourself, see Sibomana at that time?
@A.
During that crime, I did not see him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Does the witness still have the Prosecution exhibit that is the confession, that is the bulky document? 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you now have that document?
@A.
Yes, I do. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Page 1, that indeed is your name on that page?
@A.
Yes.  I can see that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you recall the date on which you made that confession?
@A.
No, I have no clear recollection of that, but I believe it must have been last year.  This document was put together last year.  At the very beginning when I wrote down my confessions, this was in 1994; that I remember.
@MR. BESNIER:
This document that you have in front of you, was it written based on your confessions of 1994?
@A.
In 1994 I was arrested by soldiers.  The genocide survivors pointed me out and said he's -- that I am a criminal.  That is how I was arrested.  I was detained in the Gitarama prison, where I stayed for four years.  When I got to Gisovu I felt it necessary to plead guilty and to make my confessions.  That is when I started drafting my confessions.  I think what is contained in this document reflects what I did, but it was later on, when I did some soul-searching based on the questions that I asked myself, I decided to confess. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Can you please move on to page 8 of that document in Kinyarwanda, that is the figure which is at the top right-hand side of the document.  Are you with me, Witness?
@A.
Yes, I am. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you read out the name against the entry No. 24 on that page?
@A.
Mukantabana, Thacianne. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would that mean that before you came to this courtroom, Witness, that you had confessed to the killing of Mukantabana Thacianne?
@A.
Yes, that is the person that I killed.  He is among one of my -- he is among my first victims. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Do you know Nzaminduga -- Nzajyinduga?
@A.
I know Nzajyinduga.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is there a relationship between the children that we referred to a while ago and Nzajyinduga?
@A.
These are the grandchildren of Nzajyinduga.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know if there is any blood relationship between the children of Nzajyinduga and Ndindabahizi?
@A.
No, she is an old woman, and I wouldn't know of any relationship between her and the Accused. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Witness.  No further questions. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, what did Karara tell you about the killing of Karegeya? 
@THE WITNESS:
As I explained earlier on, soon upon my arrival at Gitaka they was drinking beer in Gitan's beer bar.  When I got there he was sad and told me that "They've killed my friend.  It's over".  The question I asked him was to know who the killers were.  He answered that it was not necessary to answer that question, that he was killed by people who came from Buye.  That is what I know about the death of Karegeya.  He was killed by people who came from Buye. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it your testimony that no Tutsi were killed at the roadblock at Gitaka?
@THE WITNESS:
No Tutsi was killed there.  The people that were killed there came from other hills, and they were going by and they went by and were killed elsewhere.  For example, the woman I talked about did go through there.  She was going to Ruhara's, Pascal Ruhara's, and upon her return she also went through there, that location.  We did not arrest anybody at that roadblock. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
How long were you at this roadblock?
@THE WITNESS:
I was not there for a long time at that roadblock.  I wouldn't say that I was all the time at that roadblock.  People were brought and went through in our presence.  So far as I was concerned, I went through when I was on the way for an attack, and I came back only for a drink. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And you said attackers came from Rubanga, Rutsiro and Ruragwe, and you were told that you had done nothing and that is how the killing started.  Who told -- who were telling you that nothing had been done in order for you to start the killings? 
@THE WITNESS:
Among the people who came there were people who were usually called Abakiga.  We were scared of those people; they had intimidated us.  Some people had taken refuge at Kirambo, and those people, the Abakiga, came to kill them and threaten -- and to retaliate against us if we did not take part in the massacres.  I can't tell you the names of these Abakiga.  They went through and went to Bisesero and elsewhere.  So far as we were concerned, we stayed in our given location. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you went to kill Mukantabana, a schoolteacher; is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You said after giving the two blows you went away.  You left her and you went away to kill other persons.  Why didn't you finish her finally?   
@THE WITNESS:
I did so because that man who was also called or known as Nyankiko wanted to confront the person that had taken Mukantabana, and when I saw that I came to help, and the woman was finished off by other people who were around.

This person, Nyankiko, who was killed after your blows concerning Tatiana, what was his first name?  
We are waiting for the translation of Zacharia.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's Nyankiko, Zacharia.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Rwasibo, do you know that name? 
@THE WITNESS:
I know him.  That was Rwasibo, Augustine.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in any particular killing, to your knowledge? 
@THE WITNESS:
Indeed we worked together in several places.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in the killing of Tatiana? 
@THE WITNESS:
Perhaps he stayed in Gitaka, but among the people that I remember, I can only remember six persons, so that was a sizeable attack.  Now, what I did was that I tried to observe people, I tried to remember people who took part in the attack.  If I knew that he participated in the attack I would have said so.  Perhaps he was in Gitaka but that he didn't come to the location at which we were and at which we killed the people that I talked about.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Rwasibo involved in the killing of Karegeya, to your knowledge? 
@THE WITNESS:
I believe that Rwasibo is from Kayenzi.  People could move from one secteur to the other for attacks.  If somebody mentioned him as having been in Buye, perhaps he was there.  As I said, and as Karara told me, those who killed him came from Buye.  I don't know how he got to Buye, perhaps he was one of the killers.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not know; isn't that the situation, Mr. Witness?  You do not know whether he was involved in the Karegeya event?  That's your explanation, isn't it? 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I could have confirmed it if I were there at the killing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know someone called Emmanuel Ndabakuye -- Emmanuel Ndabakiye? 
@THE WITNESS:
I do not know that name, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you name -- you know the name Joel Ndabukiye but not the name Emmanuel Ndabukuye.  Am I right now? 
@THE WITNESS:
I rather know the name of his son, that is Emmanuel.  I know the one called Ndabukiye, Joel.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You know Joel Ndabukiye.  Have you ever heard of anyone called Emmanuel Ndabukuye -- Ndabukiye.
@THE WITNESS:
No sir.  In our area we only had one Ndabukiye and that was Joel.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which area was that -- no, you don't have to answer that question.  
Now, do you know anyone called Appollinaire Bugisiga? 
@THE WITNESS:
I do know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is that? 
@THE WITNESS:
He was a farmer.  He was a farmer.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in the killing of Tatiana? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, sir, I didn't see him at the place Tatiana was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Mr. Witness, we have -- we have now --
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness, good afternoon.  We are just entering the afternoon.  Good afternoon as we enter the afternoon.  
Could you tell us your commune, your secteur and your native cellule?
@A.
I'm from the Kibuye préfecture, Gitesi commune, and Gitarama secteur, Kigesi cellule.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At this time where do you live?
@A.
I live at the same place that I have just indicated.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
More precisely, do you presently live in Rwanda?
@A.
At present I am in detention at the Gisovu prison, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Which is your ethnic group?
@A.
I am Hutu, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At what date would you place the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
President Habyarimana died on the 6th, but I only learnt about it in the morning of the 7th.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Which month, which year?
@A.
It was the month of April 1994, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What happened in the days following the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
In a very few number of days after the death of President Habyarimana nothing much happened in my area, but at about the 12th, I saw many Tutsi taking refuge in Kibuye from Mabanza.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What did you yourself do in April 1994?
@A.
In April 1994, after the days I have just said, I lost my brother-in-law who used to live in Ruhengeri and I was not able to go to Ruhengeri, but later on I was able to go to Ruhengeri.  And when I came back  I realised that the people that had taken refuge at the stadium had died and those that had taken refuge in the church were also killed.  There were dead bodies almost everywhere.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You went back home after the burial of your brother-in-law.  At what date was that, approximately?
@A.
I do not clearly remember the date, but it was between the 20th and the 25th of April 1994, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you say as from the end of April 1994 and May -- April and May 1994 what you were doing in terms of activities?
@A.
At the end of April and during the month of May, I stayed at home; I did not go anywhere.  But at the end of May, a roadblock was set up in our area and myself, just as anybody else, was asked to take part in the manning of that roadblock until such a time as the French arrived and after they had said that they were going to ensure security.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
When were you arrested, Witness?
@A.
I was arrested on the 9th February 1995; the 9th of February 1995.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Why, to your knowledge, are you still in detention?
@A.
I am presumed to have taken part in the genocide, just as the others that are detained along with me.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you plead guilty?
@A.
I recognised having been at the roadblock I am being accused of having been at the roadblock.  I am also accused of have a grenade in my possession, which I confessed, but I used the opportunity also to testify on the events that took place at that roadblock.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, let us come back to the roadblock.  
To your knowledge, when was that roadblock erected; when was it built?
@A.
I do not clearly remember the date, but I would say that it was at the end of the month of May or at the beginning of the month of June.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you be more precise as to the precise location of that roadblock?  Where was it erected precisely?
@A.
The roadblock was set up in front of the Nyabahanga River bridge.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Who erected that roadblock?
@A.
That roadblock was set up by the conseiller of the Gitarama secteur -- which is my secteur -- Gitarama secteur by the name of Ngerabayeyi, Etienne.  Ngerabayeyi is spelt N-G-I-G-A-B-Y-E-Y-E -- N-G-E-R-A-B-A-Y-E-Y-I.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You were one of the people manning the roadblock, were you?
@A.
That is correct.  I was one of those members of -- one of the groups manning the roadblock.  We were being relayed by another group.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, at the date that roadblock was set up, what was the purpose of the roadblock, to your mind?
@A.
The instructions given us by the conseiller who set up that roadblock were given out when I was there.  He asked the -- those in charge of the Kigesi cellule, that is the person called Pierre Damien Nsegureze (phonetic), to look for people of integrity to man that roadblock for the purpose of intercepting Hutu refugees on their way to Cyangugu and Kibuye in their flight from the RPF soldiers.  So that a camp was created in Nyamuyeve (phonetic) to be able to list the names of the people concerned in order to prevent them from getting into Kibuye.  The other reason of the roadblock was of course to monitor the number of people going through the roadblock in vehicles to see whether they have ID cards, and if by any chance the people at the roadblock had any doubts about their identity of such-and-such a person that was believed to a member of the RPF or to be an Inkotanyi, that person was to be arrested and taken to the competent authority.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What does Inkotanyi mean?
@A.
The Inkotanyi were the RPF soldiers that were fighting against the Rwandan Armed Forces during that period.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
As far as you are concerned, you are a member of one of the groups that worked in turn at that roadblock, manning it?
@A.
Absolutely true, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were you armed?
@A.
At the beginning when we used to man that roadblock, it was Bonaventure, Niyikula who was armed with a gun.  The others were armed with machetes, sticks, clubs, but then later on I was given by Bonaventure Niyikula, I received a grenade.  I asked him for the grenade because I needed it, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
We shall come back to the grenade.  So that the arms, the weapons you had were machetes.  Where did the machetes come from?
@A.
Well, each one brought a machete from home, because in Rwandan culture each person has a machete at home, and women are not authorised to touch their husband's machete, and the child neither.  The children are not authorised to touch the women's machetes.  A young adolescent would first of all buy a hoe and a machete, so that in our culture the machete is a symbol.  It's a cultural symbol.  Each and everyone does have a machete.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The other people in the machete -- in the roadblock, were they armed, and if so, with what types of weapons?
@A.
They had machetes.  They had clubs, big sticks, sir.

Would this be a convenient time to break for the day?

Because then we could continue on Monday at two o'clock in the afternoon.  Since the military trial is scheduled for the morning on Monday, we will then move on to the afternoon shift in the Ndindabahizi, in the afternoon. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Certainly, Mr. President.  Probably this is the right time for me to come up with some information concerning the rest of the proceedings.
I believe we have heard 12 witnesses this week, and next week we could bring in five new witnesses.  But for the week beginning on Monday, the 10th November to the 17th November, we believe that we will not be able to bring in witnesses, Mr. President, the reason being that certain witnesses, for professional reasons, cannot make the trip before the 17th, 17th of November.  These are DD and the expert herself (sic).
You wanted to know yesterday afternoon whether Mr. Ndindabahizi could not appear during the week of the 10th of November before the expert.  We looked into this matter with Mr. Ndindabahizi, and 
Mr. Ndindabahizi believes that he should not testify before the expert.  I believe that we share his opinion, sir.  There are two reasons for that.  The first reason is that it is a matter of pragmaticism (sic).  We focussed a lot on the witnesses to date.  I was not able to meet my client; I spent most of my time with the witnesses.  Next week I will not be able to meet my client, either, because we will be in the courtroom, and we are not authorised to see them during the weekends.
There is also a reason concerning the structure of the proceedings, and as a matter of logic, he will have to look at the whole structure of the trial and he will have to answer some questions from the experts.  And we also believe that the order of appearance of the witnesses be maintained, and we beg that we continue after the 17th of November, after having heard witnesses next week, so that we'll have a week without witnesses, that is, the week running from the 10th of November.  
We should like to apologise for this.  It was difficult for us to know that we would work with such speed.  At the time we contacted the witnesses and the experts we didn't have all the information, and we didn't know the tempo at which this court would be working.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the -- thank you for that explanation.  Now, Witness DD would appear here on the 13th, isn't that so?  David-David, arrival on the 13th? 
@MR. BESNIER:
On the 13th, sir, so that he will be ready to appear from the 17th, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So he's not arriving early on the 13th, is he, because --
@MR. BESNIER:
As a matter of fact, I believe he should be here on the 14th of November.  I should review this with the witness protection section, but I think he will be here on the 14th of November. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Let us simply take note of what you said now and look into this.  There is a matter of planning, not only this trial but also the other trial.  Let's see whether we can sort it out in a way which is practical, and we will come back as soon as possible so that you know what will be the final schedule. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  Have a very nice weekend.
Mr. Witness, you must not now discuss your testimony with anyone.  We will continue with you Monday in the afternoon at two o'clock.
The Court is adjourned.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@A.
Good morning. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you testified yesterday, and indeed it's contained in your statement, that you have pleaded guilty before the authorities in Rwanda.  Is that correct, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the essence of your testimony before this Court yesterday was that the subject of your guilty plea was the **********, amongst other things.  Is that not correct, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that you testified that you witnessed and participated in the attack on ****** in 1994?  I can't recall the month now, but just accept whether it's 1994 or not. 
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified yesterday that your guilty plea involved you stating that a man by the name ************** struck ************** in your presence with a club.  Is that not so, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, have you been tried by the courts in Rwanda? 
@A.
I have not yet been tried.  I'm going to be tried before the Gacaca courts.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And your plea of guilty was made under which provisions?  Was that under the Gacaca as well? 
@A.
No, it was in the prosecutor's office. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall when you made that guilty plea, sir? 
@A.
I wrote a letter to the prosecutor's office on **********.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And thereafter were you, at some stage, interviewed by the prosecutor's office in relation to your confession, sir? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that in that report to the prosecutor, you outlined that you had participated in the attack on***************?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you also outlined, to the best of your recollection, sir, that you had witnessed Karegeya being attacked by Ndagijimana with a club in the presence of you and other people, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that's correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours would find on your desks a document in Kinyarwanda with a translation in French and a translation in English.  So there are three -- or two documents, because the French might be stapled to the Kinyarwanda, but the English is obviously separate.  Some of you might have three, some might have two, but you all have the same documents.  So do my learned friends.
Can I ask the registry to place the Kinyarwanda version in -- before the witness, please.  Just the Kinyarwanda one, because he doesn't read English or French, obviously.  The top one, the handwritten one, thank you.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you see the document that I've had placed in front of you, sir? 
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You can see from the title of that document that it is a copy of your confession and guilty plea and request for forgiveness, a report from the office of the prosecutor.  Do you see that there, sir? 
@A.
Let me just check.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sure. 
@A.
Yes, I've seen it. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It states that your confession date was******, and that you were arrested on********.  Is that correct, sir? 
@A.
That is a second document.  I pleaded guilty the first time and the document was misplaced, and I had to make a second document because they couldn't find the first one.  They couldn't find the first document, so it became necessary for me to repeat my confession, and a second document was put together.  So what you are saying is true, this document concerns me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  And this is the second and most recent confession, is it not, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that document relates to me. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you turn to the first page -- you open the page and turn to the first page, under column 2, it tells us there, sir, does it not, that you confessed to the crime of murder in 1994 in Kibuye préfecture?  Does it not, sir? 
@A.
(No interpretation).
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you then turn with me to the third page there in the Kinyarwanda version --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And for those reading in English, it's the second page; I don't know what it is in French.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we just have on the record the witness's answer in English, please.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He said "yes".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we all heard that he said "m-hmm," but we want a translation on record of the "m-hmm".
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right, very well.

Yes, I see it.

Did you refer to the third page?  I do not read very well, but I cannot see his name on the third page. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indeed, the name in number one is Uwimana, the second name is Sekaraga, the third name is Alfred.
@A.
Yes, I can now see the page you are referring to.

Do you see those names there, sir, all four of them?  Do you see those names?  Do you see ***********'s name there, sir?

I haven't found it yet.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, let's turn to the page that talks about your co-perpetrators, then.  Now, you mention many of the names that you mentioned in your testimony.  ******, do you see his name in that document at number --
@A.
I cannot find his name.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Number one on -- I'm terrible for the photocopying, here.
Mr. Witness, the pages on those documents are not numbered so I can understand the difficulty you have, so I would ask the registry to show you Mr. ******'s name in the document.

I wouldn't, I wouldn't like to waste the Court's time unduly, but I put it to you, Mr. Witness, that that name is not mentioned there as part of the co-perpetrators.

Are you referring to *****************?  I gave that name.  Maybe they forgot to put his name there, but I recall that I gave his name. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indeed.  Who were the witnesses to this crime, Mr. Witness?  Who was present when this crime occurred, sir?  Can you help us with that, very quickly? 
@A.
In Gitaka, there were people living there, of course.  There were people that were there.  Karara, for example, we were in front of his house.  There was another man called Mwirinde who was trading in that centre, but at that time their shops were not open, but those people were in front of their shops.  There was another Nsengimana.  There were many people.  There was also Jotham Sebarame.  I do not remember the other names because it has been a long time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
May we have the last name spelled, please.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Will you spell the last name for us, Nyirahamwe (sic) you said?  Something to that effect. 
@A.
Are you referring to people that were present? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, yes. 
@A.
Sebarame, spelled S-E-V-A-R-A-M-E (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two such names, Mr. Mwirinde and Mr. Sebarame.   Did you mention any other observers of this crime?
@THE WITNESS:
I mentioned Karara and Mwirinde, Mwirinde, Gitan (phonetic).  Mwirinde is spelt M-W-I-R-I-N-D-E.  I also mentioned Nsengimana.  Nsengimana is spelled N-S-E-N-G-I-M-A-N-A.  I also mentioned Sebarame.  These are the people I remember being present at the time, sir.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your confession statement to the prosecutor, in the last section, which is a statement from you entitled "***************," you state at length the activities that you were involved in, the date, and the location of your activities at the time, do you not?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If the registry can assist in showing him what I'm talking about. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I did talk about the commission of the offence, but I did not give any dates because I couldn't remember those dates. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You say as follows:  "I the undersigned," I skip your name, "confess that we were in Nyarusange," the secteur indicated there, with the district, "province, Kibuye, in April 1994, in the company of ******** and other co-perpetrators named above, and we killed a certain ********," in brackets "illegible," because the translators can't read it.
You then describe how you had killed him.  You forced him to go to his house, committed suicide by hanging on a rope which someone had given you, and you state there that he preferred to die in that manner for fear of being killed brutally.
Now, you then talk about the killing of ******.  You describe who you did it with and who asked you to do it.  You describe the killing of **********.  You describe how you did it.  The child of *****, you also tell us how you did it.  You talk about a cow that you ate, and the roof of a house that you removed.  Absolutely no mention of the things you've talked about in this courtroom between yesterday and today, is there, Mr. Witness?  Yes or no. 
@A.
But you didn't ask me questions on these things.  It is true that I ate the cow and that I took off the roof and that I killed those people, but you never asked me questions on these, questions on these issues.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I've noted your answer, thank you.
Now, are you -- at the location that you're currently detained at, would I be correct in saying that a man called *********, is also detained with you?  **************.
@A.
That is correct, ******** is at the same prison as myself.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And does this man **************** 
@A.
That is *****. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it true, Mr. Witness, that the man**********is the one responsible for having you come all the way to Arusha to testify in this matter, together with the others that are to come?  Is that not correct, sir? 
@A.
People came to investigate.  They came to question me at the prison, and I gave them answers.  But those persons also talked to Seyeze, but I do not know what they said to each other because they came in turns to talk to those people. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  Why are you willing to accept responsibility for something you did not do, sir? 
@A.
I said that I played a part in the commission of that offence because I accompanied them when they went to kill those people.  But I was also one of the attackers because I had a club.  I accompanied the group of killers.  We got to Gitaka, and I stayed at the place where those persons were killed.  This was why I decided to recognise the crime because I feared that I might be told later that I was also responsible because I was in the company of the killers.  This is why I accepted to make that testimony and to confess that I had some responsibility in the commission of that crime. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was -- were you particularly forthright and forthcoming with the prosecutor in Kibuye?  Did he believe your confession and accept it, sir? 
@A.
I told them the truth, and they accepted that I told them the truth, and such a person -- a person whose confession is accepted by the prosecutor's office is given a document that authenticates the fact that his confessions have been accepted by the prosecution's office.  I do have such a document with me. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indeed, isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that the prosecutor made a notation on your confession where he stated that in his opinion, you did not explain the role of each co-perpetrator in the crimes that you seem to have confessed to?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The registry can hand me the Kinyarwanda; I will show him where it is.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is that not the notation that's made in that document?  Have you seen it? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, Your Honours, on page 12, it's just below the certification on page 12.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Have you seen that, sir, in Kinyarwanda document on the bottom of that page, his comments?  Yes or no? 
@A.
Yes, I can see that notation.  Usually when someone makes confessions to the prosecutor's office, sometimes additional questions are put to him.  I knew that I had other questions to respond to our Gacaca.  Well, I was being told to summarise because they didn't have enough paper, but when I go to Gacaca's jurisdiction, I shall explain everything.
And I should like to add something else, if I may.  I want to explain that what I said is the truth.  If you allow me, I will explain to you why I am insisting about having said the truth. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Witness, I honestly -- I honestly am not interested in your explanation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you want to say about that, Mr. Witness?  You can elaborate briefly on it. 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, in a word or two, I believe that the prosecutor's office accepted that I have spoken the truth, and they gave me a document to that effect. 
Now, we, the accused, have pleaded guilty, we are very few in the prison.  We decided to look for more evidence to submit to the prosecutor's office.  We held a meeting, a meeting of people that had pleaded guilty.  People had come from all areas of the commune.  We went outside the prison, we held a meeting, and we elected a leader, a leader that represented all the accused of all the communes, and we called him the préfet.  So the préfet appointed one person per commune, and we called him bourgmestre, the bourgmestre.  And in the commune we appointed councillors for each secteur, and each councillor appointed people per cellule, a leader for each cellule, and those people appointed police officers.  Now, this is the structure of those that have pleaded guilty, and we held a meeting.
Now, the secteurs came together and appointed people for each cell or cellule.  Now, that was to ensure that all the accused who pleaded guilty were present in the meetings.  We established a list of all the people killed in every cellule.  That we did, and after that we spelt out the names of the killers of those people so that we were sure that nobody would say that he did not participate in such or such a killing, because we were there.  So that if anybody wanted to lie, we will put the truth into his fruit (sic) and tell him that he was lying, since we committed the crime together.  So that is the situation, because you cannot lie in such a situation. 
If the prosecutor has more questions, I am ready to answer questions because I have pleaded guilty.  There are details that I did not mention.  Perhaps they could be asked.  I'm sure that even Gacaca will have other questions to respond to. 
This is what I wanted to say.  We were telling the truth.  We did not want to lie any more.  So, this is all I wanted to say. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no doubt that your explanation has been terribly helpful to the Court.
Now, let's go back to the issues at hand.  Is it not the case, Mr. Witness, that you and your co-detainees in Gisovu prison, and other prisons in and around Rwanda, have formed a solidarity, a Hutu solidarity; and the object, is it not the case, of that solidarity, Mr. Witness, is to absolve your Hutu brothers who are now in custody before this Tribunal of their crimes?  That's what the essence of what you've just told us, isn't it? 
You now have a préfet amongst yourselves, you have your own bourgmestres, a government in prison, so to speak, and you have all come together, formulated your evidence with a view to assisting those leaders in 1994 of their crimes.  That's exactly what you're doing here, is it not, sir?  Yes or no.
@A.
No, sir.  I have something to say about what you've just said.  I pleaded guilty.  I spoke the truth.  I believe that I cannot speak about the co-perpetrators.  If I confessed, I cannot begin to absolve anybody that participated in the criminal activities that we are talking about. 
As far as the government that you're referring to is concerned, this is not a government.  We, rather, tried to establish the truth, and we succeeded in convincing many people to plead guilty.  And indeed, before that, it was very difficult for the prosecution to know what really happened. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You did not operate in Gasharu cellule in 1994, Mr. Witness; is that not the case?  You were nowhere near that area, yes or no?
@A.
I arrived at Gasharu on the day Karegeya died. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You haven't answered my question.  You, you did not operate your criminal acts, by your own admission, in Gasharu cellule, did you?  Yes or no. 
@A.
This is what I pled.  I was not able to protect the victim; moreover, I was still with the killers that killed that person, but I did not assist them.  If not, I did not play any other role in Gasharu, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's precisely what I thought you might do, turn around and diminish your role.  But yesterday, it was different:  You were present enough to know who did what.  Today, your role is somewhat diminished, isn't it? 
@A.
No, sir, I'm not diminishing my role.  If you ask me questions, I will respond, but -- and I will not leave anything aside.  I explained the roles of one and all; I'm prepared to repeat it.  I said Ndagijimana, Ndagijimana struck him with a club.  It was Ahingereje, Ruganamanzi and Rwasibo who flushed him out.  Those were the foremost people responsible.
Now, the one that struck him, that was also Misago and Rusagara that also participated in killing him, and I told you I was there.  So what did I hide from you? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You learned all those things from your criminal colleagues in prison, did you not, sir, during your discussions with bourgmestres and préfets in Gisovu prison?  That's where you learned all this information. 
@A.
No, sir.  The bourgmestres in the prison, do not -- they do not counsel the accused; rather, they tell you to say the truth on what you have done.  Now, those people were appointed to convince the detainees to speak the truth about the acts they have carried out.  Now, the bourgmestre or the préfet cannot advise you not to speak the truth; rather, he would put questions to you to convince you to speak the truth about what you've done, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What position does Augustin Karara, the former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, hold in that prison cabinet?  Help me with that. 
@A.
No post, sir, did he have. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What about Rukundakuvuga? 
@A.
Rukundakuvuga was an ordinary citizen.  He had a post -- he has a post in the Gacaca structure. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So if Rukundakuvuga, an ordinary citizen, has a post in the Gacaca structure, how then does a former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune hold no post?  You're not being truthful here, Mr. Witness, are you? 
@A.
I don't know the type of post he occupies, but I know that he is responsible for something at the Gacaca structure.  I've just spent eight months in Gisovu so that I do not know everything that happened.  I said I came at the time the Gacaca structure was set up, and when I arrived I realised that he had a role in that structure, and my secteur is different from his.  He didn't even ask me questions about what I did because he did not know what I did.  I live in a secteur --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness gave the name of a secteur.
@THE WITNESS:
-- and he lives in the Kayenzi secteur, sir.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's precisely why you have no -- you can -- you could have no knowledge of the things you testified about yesterday, different secteurs, different locations, different attackers.  Is that not the case?  Why didn't you mention Rukundakuvuga in your -- as part of your co-perpetrators in your confession, sir?
@A.
I did not work with Rukundakuvuga.  I did not.  In his confessions, he didn't talk about me, and I did not talk about him in my confession.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Precisely.  Precisely, Mr. Witness.  You didn't work with Rukundakuvuga because if you did, then you would have mentioned Karegeya in your confession.  Is that not the case, sir? 
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No further questions.

Do you want to tender anything of this, Mr. Phillips?

I'm grateful for that intervention, Your Honour.  I thought I did.  No, I tendered another one yesterday. 
Your Honour, if I just tender it as the next Prosecution exhibit.  I think it's 36 we're on?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 36.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In English, A -- sorry, in Kinyarwanda, A; B and C for French and English, in that order.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Re-examination, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, at this juncture I should like to make an observation.  This document was only disclosed to us after the beginning of this hearing.  I believe that it is regrettable.  We are not here in a theatre where we have coup d'état and surprises.  We are here to be serious. 
The parties should disclose the material they have, and the Prosecutor should be told that when he has important material, he should disclose the material to his learned friends on the Defence.  This is the observation I wanted to make, Mr. President. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The observation is noted, Your Honour, but this is an adversarial proceeding, and the whole point of the exercise is to impeach the credibility of the witness.  His witness should be forthcoming in telling him the truth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Besnier, we have noted your remark, and we have also taken into account that this is the second time this happened; you made a similar remark yesterday.  The Chamber has discussed the matter.
Now, the Prosecutor is, as indicated by Mr. Phillips, under no legal obligation to disclose in advance documents of this character.  It is also important, of course, also stressed by the Prosecutor, that in adversarial proceedings, the party be given the possibility, cross-examining the witness, to impeach the credibility -- I don't take a position whether this was actually done in the present case, but now I'm at the general level -- to impeach the credibility by submitting documents which have not previously been made known to the witness.  So the Prosecutor is right in that respect.
On the other hand, we all think that the Defence remark is legitimate in the sense that once the witness is in the witness box, there is no longer any contact between the witness and any of the lawyers, any of the teams, either on the Prosecution or the Defence side; and for that reason, the element of surprise and the possibility to impeach the witness would not be reduced if the Prosecution were to provide the Defence with documents the Prosecution intends to rely upon when the cross-examining is starting or even once the witness has entered the witness box and therefore is incommunicado for the Defence.  So, that would reduce the element of surprise for the Defence without reducing the possibility of the Prosecution to impeach the credibility, and we think that is a practice that should be followed in this case as it has been followed in previous cases.  So if that could kindly be observed from now on. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have an observation to make.  It's an observation that centres on the inequality or equality of arms.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The Defence, during the Prosecution's case, adopted the same practice.  The same courtesy was not afforded to the Prosecution.  It is, for want of a better word, unfair and prejudicial to the Prosecution to be asked to submit documents of their own witnesses. 
They are calling the witnesses, not my witness.  They should be making the disclosure to me because they know, they ought to know the evidence and the documents.  We were not afforded the same privilege.  They sprang up with documents; I never objected because that is the essence of an adversarial system. 
The issue you make about the witness being in the box would not be helpful.  Learned counsel, with all due respect, would only tailor his examination to suit the evidence there.  The whole purpose of it -- and in any jurisdiction in the whole world, it is a noted fact that it is not a disclosure obligation of the party impeaching the witness to disclose the evidence beforehand.  It is absolutely unfair.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Now, we are well aware, coming from many jurisdictions in the world, of what is the practice in the world, so we do not need to be reminded about that.
I also take your point, Mr. Phillips, that when it comes to a document which may affect the way in which the examination-in-chief may be conducted, then certainly you will not be doing that until your cross-examination starts.  So that's absolutely -- I totally agree with you there. 
So in other words, when I made the remark about the moment he -- you may, of course, be able to wait with showing documents to the Defence if that could influence the examination-in-chief of the Defence.  That point is taken.  But the remainder of the remark remains; that is, namely, that we have now in Trial Chamber I, for at least two years, observed the practice I just outlined, and it's a matter of courtesy.  It's not a binding rule.  It's not a clear-cut rule, but it facilitates the proceedings in the courtroom.
Now, coming, then, to the point of the equality between the parties, I can't -- are there any documents or episodes in particular you want to recall?  You will remember -- I don't recall you having made any objections previously in that connection, but that is, as you say, because you accept the adversarial principle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Of course, of course.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It happened several times, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
With the same sort of documents from the prosecutor's office.  There was one that was the subject of a motion that I filed, which I haven't received a decision on.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that or which decision?  I thought we were absolutely up to --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The decision on the misconduct of Defence counsel.  It was based on a similar practice.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But what I'm saying now is not particularly dramatic or difficult, it's only a matter of courtesy between the parties.
Now, there were no questions -- do you have anything to add, Mr. Besnier? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have no difficulty with the ruling.  I understand the grounds and I accept it, but I have one question still in my mind.  If we have in our possession after this session documents which enable us to challenge the documents produced by the Prosecutor, will we be authorised to produce such documents in the interests of justice? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will make an application to have it admitted, and then we will deal with it in concreto, case-by-case basis based on the situation.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that yesterday you testified to the effect that you were guilty for three murders which you yourself committed? 
@A.
That is true, but there were some of my co-perpetrators whom I did not mention because there were many.  But it is true that I committed these crimes, and I confessed to them.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that with regard to other crimes, you testified yesterday that you had played the role of an eyewitness, and that your guilty role was attributed to you mainly because of your passiveness?
@A.
No one has even accused me of these crimes.  I voluntarily provided this information concerning the crimes so that the legal authorities are aware. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Am I correct in saying that for the murder of ********************* you are described as an eyewitness, as a passive witness of the murder, and that you are not yourself accused of having struck any blow?
@A.
I do accept my responsibility in that crime because people saw me pass by.  I was in the group of attackers.  I was armed with a club, and for those who saw me, I was a criminal amongst others.  And that is why I am counting myself amongst the attackers who killed *********.  And people who were seeing me on the scene -- at the scene of the crime could not say that I was not part of the criminals involved, and that is why I voluntarily gave information regarding that crime so that one is aware of exactly what happened. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
With regard to the murder of *******************, are there any documents in the possession of the Rwandan courts containing confessions given by you, giving an account of the events?
@A.
Yes, such a document exists.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You will see that this document is attached to your confession, a document which was given to you today. 
@A.
But I think I saw *****'s name in the documents which were given to me. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness -- I do not want to ask a leading question, Mr. President -- but the name of *************** does not exist in the documents which you were given today.  Does that mean that there were other confessions or other documents bearing the name of *********** and which you voluntarily did not wish to submit, so that we have a complete document? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, why is Mr. ************'s name not mentioned in the present document, the one in front of us?  Why is that? 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know how they omitted mentioning ***********'s name.  I mentioned it.  Furthermore, I have in my possession a document which testifies to the fact that I mentioned that name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that, the one you have in your possession? 
@THE WITNESS:
I have a document.  In fact, it's a copy of my confession that I sent to the prosecutor.  The first document which I sent to the prosecutor was lost, and I made a second document.  So I do not understand why the name of ************ does not appear in that document, whereas I had spoken about him and I gave the names of persons who had killed him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when you sent that second document to the prosecutor, was that a document containing the names we have in front of us here, but in addition, also Mr. Karegeya's name?  Is that your testimony? 
@THE WITNESS:
I remember that I mentioned Karegeya's name.  I was asking the person who was writing for me, because I don't know how to write, to add Karegeya's name.  So I don't understand how come he didn't mention Karegeya's name, but I'm positive that in the document I have, that name exists. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But when you provided this second round of information, did you then give these names, plus Mr. Karegeya's name?
@THE WITNESS:
I asked the person who was writing for me to also note down Karegeya's name, but I didn't take care to find out whether he'd actually written Karegeya's name.  Maybe he forgot to mention Karegeya's name, but I had asked him to do so.  I'm positive that I asked him to add Karegeya's name. 
There were two documents.  First of all, there was a document in which my confession appeared, and then there was a document in which I was testifying on persons who killed Karegeya in my presence.  Therefore, I did not omit to add Karegeya's name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you also mentioned these other names in that connection on that occasion; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The problem of documents which are disclosed at the last minute is that we are unable to verify their completeness. 
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, in Rwanda, did you have counsel to assist you in your case? 
@A.
No, I don't have counsel.  Actually, my trial has not yet begun. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So your case has not been brought to completion?
@A.
No, because I'm going to appear before the Gacaca courts, and these courts have not yet begun their sittings. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At the appropriate moment, nothing will stop you from mentioning the Karegeya affair and the role which you played therein?
@A.
No.

@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Mr. Witness, was your confession read to you, the one which is before us?
@THE WITNESS:
No, it wasn't read to me.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
And how much time did you spend at Gitaka roadblock.
@THE WITNESS:
I was not at the Gitaka roadblock.  That roadblock was erected in the Gitesi secteur, whereas, I was in Buyea secteur.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
And where was Karegeya killed?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was killed in Gitaka behind the buildings.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Which buildings?
@THE WITNESS:
It was behind the row of buildings which was somewhat below.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Was one of those buildings Gitanen Karara, the trader's house?
@THE WITNESS:
No.  The first building belonged to Myera and the second to Sebarame.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have not understood you very well.  Where was the Gitaka roadblock, according to you?
@THE WITNESS:
When I arrived in Gitaka in 1994 I saw the roadblock.  It was erected between Karara's house and that belonging to Ndabukiye.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
But that is not where Karegeya was killed?
@THE WITNESS:
We had already passed the roadblock and it was behind the buildings, a little bit further away from the roadblock that Karegeya was killed.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
So you never spent any time at this roadblock, then?
@THE WITNESS:
No.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
You mentioned in your evidence yesterday that after the arrival of the accused in Gitaka, a few days later people began to flee, and you say this was at the end of May or beginning of June.  Is that what you said?
@THE WITNESS:
I said that I saw Ndindabahizi at the end of June and people began to flee at the beginning of July, the first week of July.  I think that's what I explained yesterday, and that's how the events occurred.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
The war was over, wasn't it?  So why were people --
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  People were leaving the country.  Ordinary citizens were no longer being killed.  There was rather a war between the soldiers.  The disturbances amongst the population had come to an end and there was only the soldiers that were in confrontation during this time.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Then you also stated -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that the Accused could not have killed Karegeya because there was no prior meeting.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
My question then is, were there prior meetings in respect of the victims whom you killed or others who were killed?
@THE WITNESS:
No, there were no meetings.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Thank you, that's all. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, were you provided with a copy of the confession statement made before the Rwandan Court?
@THE WITNESS:
I made a confession.  I kept a copy and I gave the original to the Prosecutor.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Do you have the original with you?
@THE WITNESS:
I have a copy but the other was sent to the Prosecutor's Office.  I'm keeping a copy with me in the prison.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did you see the name of Karegeya was mentioned in that confession statement?  Did you see the name of Karegeya in the copy provided to you by the Rwandan court?
@THE WITNESS:
I had told them to write down his name and I believe his name is there.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did you read that name?  Did you know that name was there?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know how to read.  I'm sure his name is there, because I asked that the name be mentioned, so I don't know how it couldn't be written down.  I cannot read what was written by hand.  When I'm given a document I keep it.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You are unable to read even your own language?
@THE WITNESS:
When it's a typed document I can read it and that's the case if it's in capital letters, but if it's written by hand I am unable to read.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Your confession was recorded in handwriting?
@THE WITNESS:
Someone was taking down notes for me.  I was asking someone to take notes for me, and the confession was taken down by hand.
@JUDGE KHAN:
The copy provided to you, is it a handwritten or a typed copy?
@THE WITNESS:
I kept a copy but the other one was sent to the Prosecutor.  Nobody gave me a copy.  In other words, no one sent us a typewritten copy of what we had said.  I kept the handwritten version.
@JUDGE KHAN:
That handwritten version was provided by the Court, by the Rwandan Court?
@THE WITNESS:
No, no, it's prisoners, it's my fellow-prisoners who wrote for me, and then a copy of that document was sent to the Prosecutor's Office.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, who was the leader of the group that killed Mr. Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
I saw Rwasibo, who was conducting himself like a leader.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You formed part of that group, did you, but he was the leader or you were not sure of him?
@THE WITNESS:
I can consider myself as an observer.  I was not with them in the beginning.  We met along the way, and I joined the group.  We did not discuss the plan together.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you -- but you were present when the person was killed.  What was the distance between you and the spot where he was killed, physically?
@THE WITNESS:
It's a distance that I can cover, if I walk at a fast pace, in five minutes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you five minutes away from the spot where this person was killed?  Were you five minutes walking distance away?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I was very close to these persons, about ten metres from these people.  I was a bit uphill in relation to where they were.  I was not further than ten metres away.  And I could see a person and whatever he was doing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if Rwasibo was the leader, why is Rwasibo not mentioned in this document with persons present during killing?  In other words, the document containing perpetrators and observers, why is his name not mentioned in that document which was shown to you just a few moments ago?
@THE WITNESS:
Rwasibo was often mentioned.  How did you know him, Mr. President?  I'm sure it's because his name is in a document that you have.  How then do you explain his presence in the document?  I mentioned him in all the documents.  I could not have covered up his name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, did you mention his name when you made your explanation to the Prosecutors and when you confessed to your crimes?  Did you mention Rwasibo's name?
@THE WITNESS:
At that time I did not mention Rwasibo simply because I was talking about myself.  When I gave my testimony perhaps I should have mentioned him in my testimony, but with regard to my confession, the confession is about what I did personally.  But the testimony about -- that arose in the second part and his name is mentioned therein.  I think there's a portion of my testimony which you did not receive.  There were two parts, my confession and then my testimony.  It is possible to see it in one portion of the document and not in the other.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in the testimony before this Court you mentioned Rwasibo.  I'm putting to you that there is no mention of Rwasibo in the document we were just provided with.  What is your comment to that, please?
@THE WITNESS:
I'm saying that in my statement, when I had my statement written, I asked that his name be mentioned.  I don't know why they did not write it down.  I believe those who recorded my statement did not write it.  Sometimes you ask somebody -- you tell somebody something and you ask him to put it in writing and it's possible for that person to forget certain things and to include certain things, that is normal, that is human.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Mwirinde?
@THE WITNESS:
You asked me a question regarding residents of Gitaka, people who were present and who could have seen what happened, and you asked me the names of other persons who were present, people who were observing and who were not killers, and I mentioned his name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He was a Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he present during the event?
@THE WITNESS:
Mwirinde was there the day Karegeya was killed and we found him there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Mwirinde observing this event, the killing of this person?
@THE WITNESS:
He was present.  When Karegeya was taken away he was in front of his door, but he did not go to the site where he was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:  
Who was Sebarame, was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He was a Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he also observe the killing of Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
Sebarame saw him, he came and stood about five metres away from me and observed what was going on, and if you asked him the question as to who struck Karegeya, he will tell you because he was present and he saw everything.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Nsengimana, was he Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was Nsengimana's first name?
@THE WITNESS:
Nasone (phonetic).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he have any nickname?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know his nickname.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
He was present during the killing, was he?
@THE WITNESS:
We left him a bit uphill.  He was standing there, but I do not believe that he was present among those that I saw at the killing site.  I think he was on the road close to the houses.  I don't think he left that place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then Sebarame, was he Hutu or Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:  
Was he also present?
@THE WITNESS:
He was standing about five metres from me and he saw everything.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in your statement we just received here there is no mention of Mwirinde, Nsengimana, and Nsabimana.
@THE WITNESS:
I added this name when you asked me the name of the persons who were present.  We did not have enough sheets of paper such that we couldn't put all the names.  We had to reduce the names and to write as little as possible.  So we mentioned only some names.  They asked us questions on events which we experienced which we witnessed, which we saw.  We gave the essential parts.  We could not have given all the names.  I have given this name before you just because you asked me a question regarding those who were present and who witnessed the killing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know anyone called Joel Ntabwakule (phonetic)?
@THE WITNESS:
It's, rather, Joel Ndabukiye, I know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.  He's detained in the Gisovu prison.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he present during the killing of Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
He was not present. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why is he detained?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I don't know the reasons for which he is detained.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know anyone named Emmanuel Ndabukiye?
@THE WITNESS:
Did you say Emmanuel Ndabukiye?  I don't know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the distance, Mr. Witness, between Tabeya and the place where the killing took place?
@THE WITNESS:
Where the killing took place is called Tabeya but before then it was in the Gitesi commune, and for now, when they are asking their questions about where the killing took place, we used to say in the Gitesi communal, but now that place is called Tabeya.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the place where Karegeya was killed is in Tabeya?
@THE WITNESS:
Now it has become Tabeya, it used to be Gitesi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Mr. Witness, we have concluded your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be escorted. Yes, you have anything to add, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
I have a question, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead.
@THE WITNESS:
I have a question.  I have seen Ndindabahizi in this courtroom.  Can't you allow me to say hello to him?  We haven't seen for a long time.  That is my only request.  Thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a request which is now noted and if there is a wish on the part of the Defence to follow-up that request, then it can simply be done by communication through the witness protection unit.  Your testimony has come to an end, provided that there is no objection by the Prosecution, and there is none.  So that is something that will be followed up administratively and we will see how that develops.

I lived in the ************************************************************ and Kibuye préfecture, in the Gitesi commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  And before you came to Arusha, Witness, where were you living?  Just before you came to Arusha where were you living?

The same place I've just mentioned.  But before coming here I was a detainee in a Gisovu prison.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  You are a detainee in the Gisovu prison.
@A.
Yes, in the Gisovu prison.
@MR. BESNIER:
And do you recall the dates on which you were arrested to be taken to the Gisovu prison?
@A.
30th November 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
What are the charges against you?
@A.
I'm accused of genocide.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you plead guilty to those crimes?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
And have you been sentenced for this crime?
@A.
No.  My case is still before the Prosecutor.  It's not yet been brought to the judges.
@MR. BESNIER:
You admitted having been arrested for genocide.  Did you participate in attacks against civilian Tutsis?
@A.
Yes, I have a big share of responsibilities.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell the Court, taking as a reference point the death of President Habyarimana, if you remember that, tell the Court when the attacks against the Tutsis started.
@A.
In our region it was after four days that we started the killings.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did the killings start?  Who gave the signal?
@A.
We were very nervous.  I did not see any authority, but there were attacks and there were attackers from Mabanza, from Rutsiro, and they told us that, "You have not done anything to date."  And I think that is how we started.
@MR. BESNIER:
You admit having committed crimes against Tutsis.  In which secteur did you perpetrate these crimes?
@A.
In three separate secteurs, Gitesi secteur, in Kayenzi, as well as the Ruragwe secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you recall having gone to a cellule called Gasharu during the genocide?
@A.
Yes, very often.  We virtually lived in this cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you going to Gasharu every day?
@A.
We didn't go to Gasharu every day, but we used to go there -- we go through the cellule when we were going for attacks, and then we came back to this cellule to have a drink.
@MR. BESNIER:
And yet the Gasharu cellule is not the cellule in which you have your house.  So why do you go there so often?
@A.
It's a cellule which is neighbouring to our own.  There's a river dividing the two and every day we used to meet in the Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there a trading centre in Gasharu?
@A.
Yes, there was a small trading centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what is the name of that trading centre?
@A.
It's the Gitaka trading centre.

There was a young man called Sumayire Minani and another one called Nbonyubwe.

Now, let's come back to this roadblock.  Do you know if Tutsis were killed on this roadblock?
@A.
No Tutsi was killed at this roadblock.  People were brought from neighbouring hills.  Some were killed behind the house and others in other places, but nobody was stopped and killed at the roadblock; to my knowledge.
@MR. BESNIER:
To your knowledge, did it ever happen that Tutsis were killed within the vicinity of that roadblock?
@A.
It is in the commercial centre that the roadblock was located, and I know people who were killed close to that centre, and I myself played a role in their killing.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying that people were killed.  Who was killed during the genocide in that cellule?
@A.
There were many.  There was, for example, Nyiranye; a child called Gatemeri; there's Kayoni.  There's a child of Rwabyuma, and the little children, two of them of Nzajyinduga; and a woman named Tatiana and her two children; another one called Nyankiko, and others.  There's a woman and her child, the woman was called Mukankubito, there was another man called Karegeya who was killed very close to that centre.

@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, we are now going to ask you questions on one of the persons -- or, on a few of those names that you have mentioned.  Let's start with the person that you call Thacianne.
@A.
Yes, it is Thacianne Mukantabana, M-U-K-A-N-T-A-B-A-N-A.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, all those names you have mentioned, did you know them beforehand?
@A.
Yes, I knew them very well.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you on good terms with them before the events?
@A.
I had no problems with them.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We heard only, April 1994, we didn't hear the beginning of counsel's question.
@THE WITNESS:
We were surprised -- we were taken by surprise by the events.  Immediately after the death of the president, we were very nervous, very exited, and we were afraid at the beginning.  We were afraid.  We lived harmoniously on the hill, we used to work together, and we were ensuring our own -- our security together, but later when houses -- when they started burning houses in Mabanza, the events went all the way to Ruragwe and people came by saying, "Well, you have not done anything," that is when we started killing, and one person -- you attack a person you knew and you kill him.  It is a matter of shame and we are very sad about that.  I am very saddened by the crimes that I have committed and I know it will create problems for the courts, and that is why I decided to confess my guilt.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You killed Tutsis, but were you not afraid that the authorities or the police will arrest you and put you in prison during the events?
@A.
It took time for us to begin killing, but then later on, when we started killing, what could the authorities do against thousands of people?  It was impossible to quieten those people.  That was a major problem to the authorities.  Those were killings never seen before; unspeakable, but I couldn't see how the authorities could arrest those killings, and had they attempted to stop us, probably the situation would have worsened.  Thus, we started killing, it was because we were very nervous.  We had become more like beasts.  This is the only adjective I could use to describe us.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us be more precise about Thacianne Mukantabana that you mentioned.  Do you remember the date on which she was killed, Thacianne Mukantabana?
@A.
I do not remember the date, sir, but I believe that it was in May, at the very beginning of the month of May.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was there when she was killed?
@A.
Let me give you the names of the persons that were with me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you going to give us names, sir?  If so, give us names of the people who were in your group, who could not be witnesses at this time.  We shall come back to that.
@A.
We were at Gitaka, and when we killed her it was on a Monday.  There was a first person, Nsengiyumva -- a gendarme Cyprian Nsengiyumva; there was another Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu; and then there was Ismael Mbarushimana; and I believe that there was also Frouduel  Bakinahe; there was also one Mpitabakana.
@MR. BESNIER:
Still for the Court and the transcripts,  could you be so kind as to spell out those names?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There was Cyprian Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y U-M-V-A; Ismael Mbarushimana,
M-B-A-R-U-S-H-I-M-A-N-A; Mpitabakana, M-P-I-T-A-B-A-K-A-N-A; Frouduel Bakinahe, B-A-K-I-N-A-H-E; there was also Mbarushimana, rather, Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A; Alias Rutomvu, R-U-T-O-M-V-U.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A general remark.  When there is a list of names given by the witness, and the same list is given in a piece of paper, then, I think, the practical way to proceed is to ensure that the court reporter has the same list.  For the time being, it would appear that that list has not been distributed to the court reporters.  But could that be arranged from now on, that when there are lists of names in the document, then that is being submitted to the court reporters, then we do not have to do the spelling. So that is one issue.
The second; once names are being spelt, it is, of course, important to reflect the names and their order as testified to by the witness and not to follow the names in the list if there are differences between the two.  I am just making those two general observations. 
Yes, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I have taken note of that observation, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Witness, let us now hear from you, briefly, but accurately, the manner in which Thacianne Mukantabana was killed?
@A.
I believe it was around 2 p.m., we were at the Gitaka centre.  Cyprian Nsengiyumva, who was a gendarme, and Nsengiyumva, alias Rutomvu, took her to Gitaka -- they found her at Joel Ndabukage's, where she was hiding.  I asked them, "We were looking for that person for a long time, where did you find that person?" And the gendarme told me, "You cannot search for these people, I am a soldier I know how to go about it.  I cannot tell you where I found her."  And the people said, "Well, now we have found her."  And when we were going out to kill her, the gendarme said, "Well, wait a minute, she promised to give me something," so that we went away and got to Nyarubuye at one Pascal's house -- Pascal Rwuhara's house, there were the furniture belonging to that lady.  We took the furniture and got back to Gitaka.  The furniture went to Nyabahiga -- at the gendarme's house.  When we wanted to take it to Nyabahinga's house the soldier said -- when we got to Nyabahinga -- we wanted to go to Nyabahinga, but the soldier refused, the gendarme refused.  So we stayed at Gitaka, and we took her behind the shops.  We didn't go any further, and it was there that we killed her in the company of two of her children and another man who was at Ndabahinga's, he was called Nyugahingu; so that we killed four people on that occasion.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying, firstly -- firstly you found and flushed out Ndabakeke who was at Bukiye's house in hiding?
@A.
I was not one of those that flushed the person out.  She was brought in by Nsengiyumva, Cyprian, who was a gendarme.  With Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu, they were the two that brought her.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you a member of the group that went to take the furniture -- to steal the furniture?
@A.
Yes, I also went to Nyarubuye.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, you went to Nyarubuye to get the furniture.  Were you with Thacianne?
@A.
Yes, she was with us, with her two children.   We went together.
@MR. BESNIER:
And then you took her back to the Gitaka centre; is that correct?
@A.
Absolutely correct.  It was there that we found that Nyankiko, Zachari, that man -- when you get to Gitaka, you go down along rows of shops and just in front of Gatwa's residence, and when you get to a junction, you turn into a street of Rwuberamye's house, that is where the shops were.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, as compared to the roadblock that was at the central of Gitaka, what was the distance at which Thacianne was killed?
@A.
It was the distance of 80 to 90 metres.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who were the persons that struck Thacianne Mukantabana?
@A.
********************************************************
@MR. BESNIER:
With what type of weapon?
@A.
******************************************************************************************************************, since Nyakiko was bringing about problems, ************************************.  She was not yet dead, and it was Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu that finished her off ************************** other man who was called  Nyankiko.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who ordered ****************************************************************************************, who gave ********************* those people?
@A.
You mean at that very instant or just before?  In the preceding days, nobody ordered us to do so.  I have told you how it all started, but when we were on the spot the most important person was the gendarme, and it was the gendarme who told us, "Don't take her all they way to Nyabahanga, kill her here."
@MR. BESNIER:
Didn't you say that Thacianne was being sought after, who was looking for her?
@A.
Everybody was looking for her -- everybody.  All the population in that area was looking for her.  In 1985, there was an incident.  There was a teacher called Jaqueline Nyirabakwiza, who was a teacher in primary 5, she had poisoned -- she had poisoned her, and people were saying that it was her that -- it was she that poisoned her, and that is why she was called "Nyiramasitete".  And when the war started, they were saying that she has to be found and killed, and that is when -- why Thacianne was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This episode with Jaqueline, in which year was that, Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
I was in ***************, I believe it was in 1985.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  Could you tell me whether you knew one Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before the events that we have just discussed, that is before April l994?
@A.
I used to know him.  I had seen him on two occasions.  The first occasion at which I saw him was just before -- just after his wedding.  He had come to visit his family while in our area.  We were there, we watched his vehicle so that the children do not spoil the tyres.  The second time was, I believe, in 1992.  He had come to our area in Gitaka; he held a meeting there, and I believe on that occasion, he gave us berets of his party, PSD.   We were very happy to join the party.  This is how I got to know Ndindabahizi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi once again during the war, that is, between the beginning of April l994 and the end of June 1994?
@A.
I did not see him during that period, but I heard it said that he had come to our area -- he had come to our area in Gitaka, and that he had arrested one Augustin Karara, who had a shop in the centre.  He had arrested him and he had taken him away to imprison him.  On that day, I did not move.  I believe it was on a Sunday, I was at home, and the other attackers came to see me and they said, "The minister is here, he is very serious."  And I asked, "What has happened?"  They told me, "Well, he has just arrested Karara."  And then I told them, "Well, if you continue to move around like this, you may be arrested yourselves."   And we went to a hill, and several moments after that I saw, from one kilometre away, a vehicle pass by Ndabukiye's house.  We therefore went to the centre after that, and people told us that Karara had just been arrested, and they did not know what was going to happen to him.  This is what happened, but I did not personally see him when he came on that day.
@MR. BESNIER:
Didn't you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before Thacianne's death at the Gitaka roadblock that you mentioned?
@A.
No, sir, I didn't see him.  I did not see any other authority as a matter of fact.  I didn't see any préfet or bourgmestre.  I did not see any such authorities.  And, I pleaded guilty, let me state the truth and nothing but the truth, and if I had seen the president I would have said so.  So that if we speak the truth it must be the whole truth and supply the names of all the accomplices.  So that had I seen him, I would have made a testimony against him, and that would have been done a long time ago, and that is the reason why I am saying he did not do anything in our area.  He did not call for massacres to begin.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you know one Cyprian Karegeya?
@A.
I know him very well.  He was a neighbour in the Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he survive the genocide?
@A.
No, he died.  He was killed, and that is a very well-known fact.  He was killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
When was he killed?
@A.
After the murder of Thacianne Mukantabana, that was less than seven days after that murder, it was at that time, I believe, that he was also killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know how he was killed and who killed him?
@A.
I do not know the circumstances under which he died.  Karegeya was one of the people sought after.  He was very much sought after.  I came to Gitaka, at that time Karara just came out of the Jita pub where he was having a drink.  He was very sad, and he said, "My friend has been killed."  I asked him, "Who is killed?  Is it Karegeya?"  He said, "Yes, it is Karegeya."  I said that since he is dead we no longer had to look for him.  He said that he was one of the most important people that actually had been killed.  And I said, 'Who killed him?"  And he said, "It was attackers that came from Buye."
I said, "Didn't you bury him since he was your friend?" He said, "Yes, I did bury him."  I said, "Well, well, that is the end of all of that."  It was thus that I learnt that he was killed by people from Buye.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you were not an eyewitness to that murder?  Yes or no will do.
@A.
You mean Karegeya?  No.  I was not an eyewitness to his murder.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Regarding your testimony here in Arusha, do you believe that you are going to gain anything from it -- from having -- or testifying for Emanuel Ndindabahizi, are you going to gain anything from it?
@A.
You mean interest?  You see, we in Rwanda only want people to plead guilty if they are guilty, and ask for pardon, because there are people who are wrongly accused.  People are said to have played a role whilst one did not see them anywhere.  Those people are falsely accused.  So, you the Judges must seek the correct information to get to the truth.  We are speaking the truth.  We are not protecting anyone.  We never do so.  We speak the truth, the whole truth, because what happened is deplorable, and it's for that reason that if we are to struggle and show the reconciliation of Rwandans, we must speak the truth so that we know where to lay the blame.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Now, try to be brief in your responses.  I have two more questions for you.  In the prison that you are, did you meet people very near Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, who were close to him, and who asked you to testify in his favour?

You mean people from abroad, or people in the same prison as myself?

Nobody, sir.  We are here speaking the truth about crimes that we personally committed.  Nobody close to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi approached me in that respect, and even if they did, I wouldn't accept.  There are many people that were compelled to plead guilty, but I personally can never be coerced into doing anything.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the prisons in which you are, are there Hutu groups that help one another to lie before national or international jurisdictions, and are you not one of the members of those groups?
@A.
I don't know of the existence of such groups.  All I know is that each and every one speaks out his or her own truth as he or her -- she knows it.  If there are any people who are lying, other people will challenge them. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Isn't it correct that among the detainees that confessed some are trying to help or are trying to encourage their friends also to confess; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct, it does happen.  We had meetings like the ones we had in gacaca per secteur, per cellule, and people talked about what happened in the cellules, the crimes that were committed, who committed them.  They gave the names of the accomplices and everything is said.

Yes, I can see that, but the problem is to determine whether Kanyoni is a nickname.  The circumstances that he is referring to are the same, but I recall that that person was called Kanyoni and that's why I'm saying that I did not participate in Simeon Higiro's death.  I do not know whom he is referring to, who he is talking about.  I must know whether that person was called Simon Higiro.  The person whom he is referring to and who was killed or who died at Gasharu, I don't know.  I don't know who he was; I killed many people, I wouldn't know his name.  Sometimes the person may have written the nickname without knowing other names, so it's possible that Simon, Simeon -- Simon Higiro and Kanyoni would be one in the same person; it is possible.

It is actually the person who confesses to that crime that has pointed out this person's name as a witness to his crime, isn't it?  Ezechias Seyeze, and he says that you are an accomplice; is that not so, sir?  Can you say yes or no?
@A.
I have made a confession, but I was not able to know who the witnesses to my crime were.  I was able to give the names of the co-perpetrators, yes, and that was by chance, because the truth will come out as nothing will be able to be hidden.  And since Seyeze was their neighbour, it's obvious that they knew him, and he's the one who is going to help you and I and the Tribunal, to remember the names of those who were present.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you see that lady there when the crime was committed?  That question can be answered with a yes or a no.  Did you see her yourself?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I didn't see her.
@THE PRESIDENT:
Do you know whether she was there, even if you didn't see her?  That can also be answered with a yes or no.

I do not believe that person was there, no; I don't think so.  And I knew her; I knew her.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that you were involved in the attack on this lady and her child or children, sir?

I am amongst the people who killed them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Had this woman and her child offended you, sir?

@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, prior to the genocide of 1994, Mr. Witness, what was your profession, sir?
@A.
I was a farmer, but before that in 1988 when I was in secondary school, I left secondary school in 1990 and I came to remain at home.  And when the war began I was a farmer.  I had just spent four years in that profession of farmer or cultivator.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And **************, sir, before the genocide of 1994, can you tell me what he did for a living, sir?
@A.
He was ****************.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was Seyeze Ezechias involved in the killings with you at this time, sir?
@A.
**************** of having participated in the crimes concerning Simon Higiro, the one you referred to as Sakanyoni.  *************** accused him, and he confessed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know what profession or job he did, sir, before the genocide, this man Seyeze Ezechias, sir?
@A.
He was a cultivator also, a farmer.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, have you confessed your crimes before the courts in Rwanda, sir?
@A.
From the **************************, the day on which I was arrested, until today, I have confessed to that crime.  I have requested the forgiveness of Rwandans, the international community, as well as the victims and their families. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And would I be correct in saying, sir that you would have confessed to killing at least -- maybe I should ask you, Mr. Witness. How many people have you confessed to killing, sir?
@A.
They are very many, more than 20 people that I killed or in whose deaths I was involved.  But if there was a particular location, I was responsible for having killed six people.  So I myself must confess to having participated in a crime during which these six people died, and I needed to denounce those who participated in the killings, because we formed a single group of evildoers, people who participated in that crime, even if I had only killed two people out of the six.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that Mukantabana and her children or child, as you say, had been hiding in the home of Joël Ndabukiye before her death, sir?
@A.
Yes, that's where she was hiding.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was it that Joel then decided to betray her and subsequently became involved in her death, sir?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
No, Joël didn't participate in the killing of that woman, but as I have already told you, I asked the gendarme to tell me how he had found the woman, and he told me, "You were unable to find her, so I can't reveal to you my secret how I work."  And until today I do not know who told the gendarme that this woman was hiding in Ndabukiye -- Joël Ndabukiye's house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Pardon me, Witness, for that error.  So is it your testimony that Joël Ndabukiye was involved in some ****************** but not in the killing of Thacianne?  Is that your testimony, sir?

I was living with that person together with other people who were living at Gitaka.  And when we brought her, he was a witness, he was looking on.  All the people who were living in Gasharu, anyone who you would ask questions about me would tell you the truth, and he cannot have been unaware of what happened in his cellule and the crimes that were committed in his cellule, and he must have been a witness because he was there.
$Pages 40 to 43 by Petrus Chijarira)

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did Karara Augustin, to your mind, hold any official position in the local administration in Gasharu during the genocide, sir?
@A.
I think he was a responsable.  If not, he must have been a member of the cellule committee in 1994, during the period of the events.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And what, to your knowledge, very, very briefly, would be the duties of the responsable de cellule or a member of the committee at the time, if you know?
@A.
Those were people who were responsible for solving problems arising between the inhabitants, and when they failed to do so, they referred the problem to the secteur.  Furthermore, they are responsible for the development of the cellule by involving the population in the implementation of development projects. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So if crimes were committed in Gasharu cellule, would it have been the functions of the responsable to report them to the conseiller or would it not?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you then help us with this:  how was it, then, that this person, this responsable, was then aware of your crimes and did not prevent them, sir, or report them?
@A.
It's true that if there are attackers who attack a cellule, the responsable should refer the matter to the higher authorities, but I described to you what we were like.  Some authorities could do nothing against us.  We could even attack them.  Now, without even talking about the responsable, even the conseiller couldn't approach these people who were killing.  They could do nothing, they could say nothing.  For instance, Karara; there were young people who came to destroy houses in Gitaka, and when he tried to stop them they wanted to kill -- to beat him, and I told you that he was my neighbour, so they made him pay a fine of 30 litres of beer.  So people became afraid, and the authorities remained silent in the face of all these crimes because they were afraid. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How then was it, Mr. Witness, that Ndindabahizi was able to order Karara's arrest, as you say, in the month of June?  Can you explain that for me, please, in the light of your --
@A.
What I know is that these young men who were with me during the attacks told me he came, he arrested Karara and put him in jail, and that he put him in jail because he suspected that he killed. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, if, according to you, none of the authorities could stop the killings at the time, how then did the killings stop, or did they go on forever, sir?
@A.
I think that the killings stopped when the soldiers on the front line realised that they had lost the war.  They fled and we members of the population fled.  In fact, we perpetrated these killings in a record time.  We had virtually finished in the month of May.  There were a few survivors, and, to tell you the truth, when we left the country, when we fled the country there was no one else to be killed.  And they told us something which I'll tell you.  When the French came, someone came and told us, "Be careful.  These French have sophisticated equipment which can track down criminals".  So we got afraid and -- we got afraid and we stopped committing the crimes.  There were some survivors who passed in front of us and we left them alone because we thought the French were going to track us down.  And that is how the killings stopped. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it is your testimony that you never saw with your eyes Emmanuel Ndindabahizi throughout the genocide in Kibuye, sir?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your statement dated the 7th of October 2002 to my learned friends for the Defence, you mention six names who you describe as people who had accompanied you -- in other words, accomplices -- during the killings.  Do you recall doing that, sir?
@A.
Yes, I did. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall if you mentioned all six people in your confession statement to the Rwandese authorities, or did you just mention some of them?  Did you mention all of them, as you have done here, in your confession?
@A.
My case file is very voluminous.  Possibly all the names have been mentioned.  If I were with someone in a certain place it is possible that I went with him to commit another crime, but when they were asking us the questions they asked us to list the names that we remember, and they told us that later on if we remembered some other names, we should come and add them.

I do not have the confirmation.  After I sent my confession, the Prosecutor received them, but then he was transferred.  Following that, I sought to find out what had happened to my case, and lately after people were invited to participate in a meeting to be told about what should be done in the country, I raised the question as to what had happened to my case file.  I was told to refer the query to the prosecutor's office and that my case file was still with them.

Your killings were operated in units, following your testimony; that's what you say.  Is it possible for someone who was not in your unit of attackers to be involved in a particular area, or how were those units arranged?  How did you operate?
@A.
We could start with our cellule, form a group of ten persons, leave the cellule, and when we get to another cellule we are told, "There's a person hiding in such-and-such a person's house".  In our group we would take a decision to go, and after killing that person we could go to another cellule and that we might meet another group which would tell us that there's another -- "There's somebody hiding in X or Y's house", then we go after this person.  That is how we used to operate.

During the killing of the children was ******** present?  Did you see him?
@A.
Since I was with ************************ was mentioning the names of these persons.  I am sure that I saw **************, he came from Kirambo to hide in that locality.

This document that you have in front of you, was it written based on your confessions of 1994?
@A.
In 1994 I was arrested by soldiers.  The genocide survivors pointed me out and said he's -- that I am a criminal.  That is how I was arrested.  I was detained in the Gitarama prison, where I stayed for****** years.  When I got to Gisovu I felt it necessary to plead guilty and to make my confessions.  That is when I started drafting my confessions.  I think what is contained in this document reflects what I did, but it was later on, when I did some soul-searching based on the questions that I asked myself, I decided to confess.

As I explained earlier on, soon upon my arrival at Gitaka they was drinking beer in Gitan's beer bar.  When I got there he was sad and told me that "They've killed my friend.  It's over".  The question I asked him was to know who the killers were.  He answered that it was not necessary to answer that question, that he was killed by people who came from Buye.  That is what I know about the death of Karegeya.  He was killed by people who came from Buye. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it your testimony that no Tutsi were killed at the roadblock at Gitaka?
@THE WITNESS:
No Tutsi was killed there.  The people that were killed there came from other hills, and they were going by and they went by and were killed elsewhere.  For example, the woman I talked about did go through there.  She was going to Ruhara's, Pascal Ruhara's, and upon her return she also went through there, that location.

I was not there for a long time at that roadblock.  I wouldn't say that I was all the time at that roadblock.  People were brought and went through in our presence.  So far as I was concerned, I went through when I was on the way for an attack, and I came back only for a drink. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And you said attackers came from Rubanga, Rutsiro and Ruragwe, and you were told that you had done nothing and that is how the killing started.  Who told -- who were telling you that nothing had been done in order for you to start the killings? 
@THE WITNESS:
Among the people who came there were people who were usually called Abakiga.  We were scared of those people; they had intimidated us.  Some people had taken refuge at Kirambo, and those people, the Abakiga, came to kill them and threaten -- and to retaliate against us if we did not take part in the massacres.  I can't tell you the names of these Abakiga.  They went through and went to Bisesero and elsewhere.  So far as we were concerned, we stayed in our given location. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you went to kill ******; is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You said after giving the two blows you went away.  You left her and you went away to kill other persons.  Why didn't you finish her finally?   
@THE WITNESS:
I did so because that man who was also called or known as ****** wanted to confront the person that had taken *********, and when I saw that I came to help, and the woman was finished off by other people who were around.

@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This person, ******, who was killed after your blows concerning *****, what was his first name?  
We are waiting for the translation of Zacharia.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's *******.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Rw.0asibo, do you know that name? 
@THE WITNESS:
I know him.  That was Rwasibo, Augustine.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in any particular killing, to your knowledge? 
@THE WITNESS:
Indeed we worked together in several places.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in the killing of *******? 
@THE WITNESS:
Perhaps he stayed in Gitaka, but among the people that I remember, I can only remember six persons, so that was a sizeable attack.  Now, what I did was that I tried to observe people, I tried to remember people who took part in the attack.  If I knew that he participated in the attack I would have said so.  Perhaps he was in Gitaka but that he didn't come to the location at which we were and at which we killed the people that I talked about.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Rwasibo involved in the killing of Karegeya, to your knowledge? 
@THE WITNESS:
I believe that Rwasibo is from Kayenzi.  People could move from one secteur to the other for attacks.  If somebody mentioned him as having been in Buye, perhaps he was there.  As I said, and as Karara told me, those who killed him came from Buye.  I don't know how he got to Buye, perhaps he was one of the killers.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not know; isn't that the situation, Mr. Witness?  You do not know whether he was involved in the Karegeya event?  That's your explanation, isn't it? 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I could have confirmed it if I were there at the killing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know someone called Emmanuel Ndabakuye -- Emmanuel Ndabakiye? 
@THE WITNESS:
I do not know that name, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you name -- you know the name Joel Ndabukiye but not the name Emmanuel Ndabukuye.  Am I right now? 
@THE WITNESS:
I rather know the name of his son, that is Emmanuel.  I know the one called Ndabukiye, Joel.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You know Joel Ndabukiye.  Have you ever heard of anyone called Emmanuel Ndabukuye -- Ndabukiye.
@THE WITNESS:
No sir.  In our area we only had one Ndabukiye and that was Joel.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which area was that -- no, you don't have to answer that question.  
Now, do you know anyone called Appollinaire Bugisiga? 
@THE WITNESS:
I do know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is that? 
@THE WITNESS:
He was a farmer.  He was a farmer.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in the killing of Tatiana? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, sir, I didn't see him at the place Tatiana was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Mr. Witness, we have -- we have now --
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.

You would be referred to as Witness DR in these proceedings.  Do you have a piece of paper in front of you?

$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness, good afternoon.  We are just entering the afternoon.  Good afternoon as we enter the afternoon.  
Could you tell us your commune, your secteur and your native cellule?
@A.
I'm from the Kibuye préfecture, *********.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At this time where do you live?
@A.
I live at the same place that I have just indicated.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
More precisely, do you presently live in Rwanda?
@A.
At present I am in detention at the Gisovu prison, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Which is your ethnic group?
@A.
I am Hutu, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At what date would you place the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
President Habyarimana died on the 6th, but I only learnt about it in the morning of the 7th.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Which month, which year?
@A.
It was the month of April 1994, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What happened in the days following the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
In a very few number of days after the death of President Habyarimana nothing much happened in my area, but at about the 12th, I saw many Tutsi taking refuge in Kibuye from Mabanza.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What did you yourself do in April 1994?
@A.
In April 1994, after the days I have just said, I lost my brother-in-law who used to live in Ruhengeri and I was not able to go to Ruhengeri, but later on I was able to go to Ruhengeri.  And when I came back  I realised that the people that had taken refuge at the stadium had died and those that had taken refuge in the church were also killed.  There were dead bodies almost everywhere.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You went back home after the burial of your brother-in-law.  At what date was that, approximately?
@A.
I do not clearly remember the date, but it was between the 20th and the 25th of April 1994, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you say as from the end of April 1994 and May -- April and May 1994 what you were doing in terms of activities?
@A.
At the end of April and during the month of May, I stayed at home; I did not go anywhere.  But at the end of May, a roadblock was set up in our area and myself, just as anybody else, was asked to take part in the manning of that roadblock until such a time as the French arrived and after they had said that they were going to ensure security.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
When were you arrested, Witness?
@A.
I was arrested on the ***************.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Why, to your knowledge, are you still in detention?
@A.
I am presumed to have taken part in the genocide, just as the others that are detained along with me.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you plead guilty?
@A.
I recognised having been at the roadblock I am being accused of having been at the roadblock.  I am also accused of **********, which I confessed, but I used the opportunity also to testify on the events that took place at that roadblock.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, let us come back to the roadblock.  
To your knowledge, when was that roadblock erected; when was it built?
@A.
I do not clearly remember the date, but I would say that it was at the end of the month of May or at the beginning of the month of June.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you be more precise as to the precise location of that roadblock?  Where was it erected precisely?
@A.
The roadblock was set up in front of the Nyabahanga River bridge.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Who erected that roadblock?
@A.
That roadblock was set up by the conseiller of the Gitarama secteur -- which is my secteur -- Gitarama secteur by the name of Ngerabayeyi, Etienne.  Ngerabayeyi is spelt N-G-I-G-A-B-Y-E-Y-E -- N-G-E-R-A-B-A-Y-E-Y-I.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You were one of the people manning the roadblock, were you?
@A.
That is correct.  I was one of those members of -- one of the groups manning the roadblock.  We were being relayed by another group.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, at the date that roadblock was set up, what was the purpose of the roadblock, to your mind?
@A.
The instructions given us by the conseiller who set up that roadblock were given out when I was there.  He asked the -- those in charge of the Kigesi cellule, that is the person called Pierre Damien Nsegureze (phonetic), to look for people of integrity to man that roadblock for the purpose of intercepting Hutu refugees on their way to Cyangugu and Kibuye in their flight from the RPF soldiers.  So that a camp was created in Nyamuyeve (phonetic) to be able to list the names of the people concerned in order to prevent them from getting into Kibuye.  The other reason of the roadblock was of course to monitor the number of people going through the roadblock in vehicles to see whether they have ID cards, and if by any chance the people at the roadblock had any doubts about their identity of such-and-such a person that was believed to a member of the RPF or to be an Inkotanyi, that person was to be arrested and taken to the competent authority.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What does Inkotanyi mean?
@A.
The Inkotanyi were the RPF soldiers that were fighting against the Rwandan Armed Forces during that period.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
As far as you are concerned, you are a member of one of the groups that worked in turn at that roadblock, manning it?
@A.
Absolutely true, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were you armed?
@A.
At the beginning when we used to man that roadblock, it was ******************* who was armed with a gun.  The others were armed with machetes, sticks, clubs, but then later on I was given by ****************, I received a grenade.  I asked him for the grenade because I needed it, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
We shall come back to the grenade.  So that the arms, the weapons you had were machetes.  Where did the machetes come from?
@A.
Well, each one brought a machete from home, because in Rwandan culture each person has a machete at home, and women are not authorised to touch their husband's machete, and the child neither.  The children are not authorised to touch the women's machetes.  A young adolescent would first of all buy a hoe and a machete, so that in our culture the machete is a symbol.  It's a cultural symbol.  Each and everyone does have a machete.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The other people in the machete -- in the roadblock, were they armed, and if so, with what types of weapons?
@A.
They had machetes.  They had clubs, big sticks, sir.

$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Was there any distribution of arms at the roadblock? 
@A.
No, sir, no weapons were distributed at the roadblock.  Up to the time the roadblock was dismantled, no weapons were distributed there. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Would this be a convenient time to break for the day?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Because then we could continue on Monday at two o'clock in the afternoon.  Since the military trial is scheduled for the morning on Monday, we will then move on to the afternoon shift in the Ndindabahizi, in the afternoon. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Certainly, Mr. President.  Probably this is the right time for me to come up with some information concerning the rest of the proceedings.
I believe we have heard 12 witnesses this week, and next week we could bring in five new witnesses.  But for the week beginning on Monday, the 10th November to the 17th November, we believe that we will not be able to bring in witnesses, Mr. President, the reason being that certain witnesses, for professional reasons, cannot make the trip before the 17th, 17th of November.  These are DD and the expert herself (sic).
You wanted to know yesterday afternoon whether Mr. Ndindabahizi could not appear during the week of the 10th of November before the expert.  We looked into this matter with Mr. Ndindabahizi, and 
Mr. Ndindabahizi believes that he should not testify before the expert.  I believe that we share his opinion, sir.  There are two reasons for that.  The first reason is that it is a matter of pragmaticism (sic).  We focussed a lot on the witnesses to date.  I was not able to meet my client; I spent most of my time with the witnesses.  Next week I will not be able to meet my client, either, because we will be in the courtroom, and we are not authorised to see them during the weekends.
There is also a reason concerning the structure of the proceedings, and as a matter of logic, he will have to look at the whole structure of the trial and he will have to answer some questions from the experts.  And we also believe that the order of appearance of the witnesses be maintained, and we beg that we continue after the 17th of November, after having heard witnesses next week, so that we'll have a week without witnesses, that is, the week running from the 10th of November.  
We should like to apologise for this.  It was difficult for us to know that we would work with such speed.  At the time we contacted the witnesses and the experts we didn't have all the information, and we didn't know the tempo at which this court would be working.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the -- thank you for that explanation.  Now, Witness DD would appear here on the 13th, isn't that so?  David-David, arrival on the 13th? 
@MR. BESNIER:
On the 13th, sir, so that he will be ready to appear from the 17th, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So he's not arriving early on the 13th, is he, because --
@MR. BESNIER:
As a matter of fact, I believe he should be here on the 14th of November.  I should review this with the witness protection section, but I think he will be here on the 14th of November. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Let us simply take note of what you said now and look into this.  There is a matter of planning, not only this trial but also the other trial.  Let's see whether we can sort it out in a way which is practical, and we will come back as soon as possible so that you know what will be the final schedule. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  Have a very nice weekend.
Mr. Witness, you must not now discuss your testimony with anyone.  We will continue with you Monday in the afternoon at two o'clock.
The Court is adjourned.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
@A.
Good morning. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, you testified yesterday, and indeed it's contained in your statement, that you have pleaded guilty before the authorities in Rwanda.  Is that correct, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the essence of your testimony before this Court yesterday was that the subject of your guilty plea was the killing of Karegeya, amongst other things.  Is that not correct, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that you testified that you witnessed and participated in the attack on Karegeya in 1994?  I can't recall the month now, but just accept whether it's 1994 or not. 
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified yesterday that your guilty plea involved you stating that a man by the name Ndagijimana struck Karegeya in your presence with a club.  Is that not so, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, have you been tried by the courts in Rwanda? 
@A.
I have not yet been tried.  I'm going to be tried before the Gacaca courts.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And your plea of guilty was made under which provisions?  Was that under the Gacaca as well? 
@A.
No, it was in the prosecutor's office. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall when you made that guilty plea, sir? 
@A.
I wrote a letter to the prosecutor's office on the 13th December 1998.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And thereafter were you, at some stage, interviewed by the prosecutor's office in relation to your confession, sir? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that in that report to the prosecutor, you outlined that you had participated in the attack on Karegeya?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you also outlined, to the best of your recollection, sir, that you had witnessed Karegeya being attacked by Ndagijimana with a club in the presence of you and other people, sir? 
@A.
Yes, that's correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours would find on your desks a document in Kinyarwanda with a translation in French and a translation in English.  So there are three -- or two documents, because the French might be stapled to the Kinyarwanda, but the English is obviously separate.  Some of you might have three, some might have two, but you all have the same documents.  So do my learned friends.
Can I ask the registry to place the Kinyarwanda version in -- before the witness, please.  Just the Kinyarwanda one, because he doesn't read English or French, obviously.  The top one, the handwritten one, thank you.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

It states that your confession date was the 16th of November, 2002, and that you were arrested on the 9th of July, 1998.  Is that correct, sir? 
@A.
That is a second document.  I pleaded guilty the first time and the document was misplaced, and I had to make a second document because they couldn't find the first one.  They couldn't find the first document, so it became necessary for me to repeat my confession, and a second document was put together.  So what you are saying is true, this document concerns me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  And this is the second and most recent confession, is it not, sir?

Yes, that document relates to me.

Indeed.  Who were the witnesses to this crime, Mr. Witness?  Who was present when this crime occurred, sir?  Can you help us with that, very quickly? 
@A.
In Gitaka, there were people living there, of course.  There were people that were there.  Karara, for example, we were in front of his house.  There was another man called Mwirinde who was trading in that centre, but at that time their shops were not open, but those people were in front of their shops.  There was another Nsengimana.  There were many people.  There was also Jotham Sebarame.  I do not remember the other names because it has been a long time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
May we have the last name spelled, please.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Will you spell the last name for us, Nyirahamwe (sic) you said?  Something to that effect. 
@A.
Are you referring to people that were present? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, yes. 
@A.
Sebarame, spelled S-E-V-A-R-A-M-E (sic). 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two such names, Mr. Mwirinde and Mr. Sebarame.   Did you mention any other observers of this crime?
@THE WITNESS:
I mentioned Karara and Mwirinde, Mwirinde, Gitan (phonetic).  Mwirinde is spelt M-W-I-R-I-N-D-E.  I also mentioned Nsengimana.  Nsengimana is spelled N-S-E-N-G-I-M-A-N-A.  I also mentioned Sebarame.  These are the people I remember being present at the time, sir.

In your confession statement to the prosecutor, in the last section, which is a statement from you entitled "Commission of the Offence," you state at length the activities that you were involved in, the date, and the location of your activities at the time, do you not?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If the registry can assist in showing him what I'm talking about. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I did talk about the commission of the offence, but I did not give any dates because I couldn't remember those dates. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You say as follows:  "I the undersigned," I skip your name, "confess that we were in Nyarusange," the secteur indicated there, with the district, "province, Kibuye, in April 1994, in the company of Bagaruka and other co-perpetrators named above, and we killed a certain Sekaraga," in brackets "illegible," because the translators can't read it.
You then describe how you had killed him.  You forced him to go to his house, committed suicide by hanging on a rope which someone had given you, and you state there that he preferred to die in that manner for fear of being killed brutally.
Now, you then talk about the killing of Uwimana.  You describe who you did it with and who asked you to do it.  You describe the killing of Habiyambere.  You describe how you did it.  The child of Alfred, you also tell us how you did it.  You talk about a cow that you ate, and the roof of a house that you removed.  Absolutely no mention of the things you've talked about in this courtroom between yesterday and today, is there, Mr. Witness?  Yes or no. 
@A.
But you didn't ask me questions on these things.  It is true that I ate the cow and that I took off the roof and that I killed those people, but you never asked me questions on these, questions on these issues.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I've noted your answer, thank you.
Now, are you -- at the location that you're currently detained at, would I be correct in saying that a man called Seyeze, Ezikias, is also detained with you?  S-E-Y-E-Z-E.
@A.
That is correct, Seyeze is at the same prison as myself.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And does this man Seyeze have any relationship with the Accused in this case? 
@A.
That is his younger brother. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it true, Mr. Witness, that the man Seyeze is the one responsible for having you come all the way to Arusha to testify in this matter, together with the others that are to come?  Is that not correct, sir? 
@A.
People came to investigate.  They came to question me at the prison, and I gave them answers.  But those persons also talked to Seyeze, but I do not know what they said to each other because they came in turns to talk to those people. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  Why are you willing to accept responsibility for something you did not do, sir? 
@A.
I said that I played a part in the commission of that offence because I accompanied them when they went to kill those people.  But I was also one of the attackers because I had a club.  I accompanied the group of killers.  We got to Gitaka, and I stayed at the place where those persons were killed.  This was why I decided to recognise the crime because I feared that I might be told later that I was also responsible because I was in the company of the killers.  This is why I accepted to make that testimony and to confess that I had some responsibility in the commission of that crime. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was -- were you particularly forthright and forthcoming with the prosecutor in Kibuye?  Did he believe your confession and accept it, sir? 
@A.
I told them the truth, and they accepted that I told them the truth, and such a person -- a person whose confession is accepted by the prosecutor's office is given a document that authenticates the fact that his confessions have been accepted by the prosecution's office.  I do have such a document with me. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indeed, isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that the prosecutor made a notation on your confession where he stated that in his opinion, you did not explain the role of each co-perpetrator in the crimes that you seem to have confessed to?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The registry can hand me the Kinyarwanda; I will show him where it is.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Have you seen that, sir, in Kinyarwanda document on the bottom of that page, his comments?  Yes or no? 
@A.
Yes, I can see that notation.  Usually when someone makes confessions to the prosecutor's office, sometimes additional questions are put to him.  I knew that I had other questions to respond to our Gacaca.  Well, I was being told to summarise because they didn't have enough paper, but when I go to Gacaca's jurisdiction, I shall explain everything.
And I should like to add something else, if I may.  I want to explain that what I said is the truth.  If you allow me, I will explain to you why I am insisting about having said the truth. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Witness, I honestly -- I honestly am not interested in your explanation. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you want to say about that, Mr. Witness?  You can elaborate briefly on it. 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, in a word or two, I believe that the prosecutor's office accepted that I have spoken the truth, and they gave me a document to that effect. 
Now, we, the accused, have pleaded guilty, we are very few in the prison.  We decided to look for more evidence to submit to the prosecutor's office.  We held a meeting, a meeting of people that had pleaded guilty.  People had come from all areas of the commune.  We went outside the prison, we held a meeting, and we elected a leader, a leader that represented all the accused of all the communes, and we called him the préfet.  So the préfet appointed one person per commune, and we called him bourgmestre, the bourgmestre.  And in the commune we appointed councillors for each secteur, and each councillor appointed people per cellule, a leader for each cellule, and those people appointed police officers.  Now, this is the structure of those that have pleaded guilty, and we held a meeting.
Now, the secteurs came together and appointed people for each cell or cellule.  Now, that was to ensure that all the accused who pleaded guilty were present in the meetings.  We established a list of all the people killed in every cellule.  That we did, and after that we spelt out the names of the killers of those people so that we were sure that nobody would say that he did not participate in such or such a killing, because we were there.  So that if anybody wanted to lie, we will put the truth into his fruit (sic) and tell him that he was lying, since we committed the crime together.  So that is the situation, because you cannot lie in such a situation. 
If the prosecutor has more questions, I am ready to answer questions because I have pleaded guilty.  There are details that I did not mention.  Perhaps they could be asked.  I'm sure that even Gacaca will have other questions to respond to. 
This is what I wanted to say.  We were telling the truth.  We did not want to lie any more.  So, this is all I wanted to say. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no doubt that your explanation has been terribly helpful to the Court.
Now, let's go back to the issues at hand.  Is it not the case, Mr. Witness, that you and your co-detainees in Gisovu prison, and other prisons in and around Rwanda, have formed a solidarity, a Hutu solidarity; and the object, is it not the case, of that solidarity, Mr. Witness, is to absolve your Hutu brothers who are now in custody before this Tribunal of their crimes?  That's what the essence of what you've just told us, isn't it? 
You now have a préfet amongst yourselves, you have your own bourgmestres, a government in prison, so to speak, and you have all come together, formulated your evidence with a view to assisting those leaders in 1994 of their crimes.  That's exactly what you're doing here, is it not, sir?  Yes or no.
@A.
No, sir.  I have something to say about what you've just said.  I pleaded guilty.  I spoke the truth.  I believe that I cannot speak about the co-perpetrators.  If I confessed, I cannot begin to absolve anybody that participated in the criminal activities that we are talking about. 
As far as the government that you're referring to is concerned, this is not a government.  We, rather, tried to establish the truth, and we succeeded in convincing many people to plead guilty.  And indeed, before that, it was very difficult for the prosecution to know what really happened. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You did not operate in Gasharu cellule in 1994, Mr. Witness; is that not the case?  You were nowhere near that area, yes or no?
@A.
I arrived at Gasharu on the day Karegeya died. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You haven't answered my question.  You, you did not operate your criminal acts, by your own admission, in Gasharu cellule, did you?  Yes or no. 
@A.
This is what I pled.  I was not able to protect the victim; moreover, I was still with the killers that killed that person, but I did not assist them.  If not, I did not play any other role in Gasharu, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's precisely what I thought you might do, turn around and diminish your role.  But yesterday, it was different:  You were present enough to know who did what.  Today, your role is somewhat diminished, isn't it? 
@A.
No, sir, I'm not diminishing my role.  If you ask me questions, I will respond, but -- and I will not leave anything aside.  I explained the roles of one and all; I'm prepared to repeat it.  I said Ndagijimana, Ndagijimana struck him with a club.  It was Ahingereje, Ruganamanzi and Rwasibo who flushed him out.  Those were the foremost people responsible.
Now, the one that struck him, that was also Misago and Rusagara that also participated in killing him, and I told you I was there.  So what did I hide from you? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You learned all those things from your criminal colleagues in prison, did you not, sir, during your discussions with bourgmestres and préfets in Gisovu prison?  That's where you learned all this information. 
@A.
No, sir.  The bourgmestres in the prison, do not -- they do not counsel the accused; rather, they tell you to say the truth on what you have done.  Now, those people were appointed to convince the detainees to speak the truth about the acts they have carried out.  Now, the bourgmestre or the préfet cannot advise you not to speak the truth; rather, he would put questions to you to convince you to speak the truth about what you've done, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What position does Augustin Karara, the former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, hold in that prison cabinet?  Help me with that. 
@A.
No post, sir, did he have. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What about Rukundakuvuga? 
@A.
Rukundakuvuga was an ordinary citizen.  He had a post -- he has a post in the Gacaca structure. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So if Rukundakuvuga, an ordinary citizen, has a post in the Gacaca structure, how then does a former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune hold no post?  You're not being truthful here, Mr. Witness, are you? 
@A.
I don't know the type of post he occupies, but I know that he is responsible for something at the Gacaca structure.  I've just spent eight months in Gisovu so that I do not know everything that happened.  I said I came at the time the Gacaca structure was set up, and when I arrived I realised that he had a role in that structure, and my secteur is different from his.  He didn't even ask me questions about what I did because he did not know what I did.  I live in a secteur --

@A.
I did not work with Rukundakuvuga.  I did not.  In his confessions, he didn't talk about me, and I did not talk about him in my confession.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Re-examination, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, at this juncture I should like to make an observation.  This document was only disclosed to us after the beginning of this hearing.  I believe that it is regrettable.  We are not here in a theatre where we have coup d'état and surprises.  We are here to be serious. 
The parties should disclose the material they have, and the Prosecutor should be told that when he has important material, he should disclose the material to his learned friends on the Defence.  This is the observation I wanted to make, Mr. President. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The observation is noted, Your Honour, but this is an adversarial proceeding, and the whole point of the exercise is to impeach the credibility of the witness.  His witness should be forthcoming in telling him the truth. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Besnier, we have noted your remark, and we have also taken into account that this is the second time this happened; you made a similar remark yesterday.  The Chamber has discussed the matter.
Now, the Prosecutor is, as indicated by Mr. Phillips, under no legal obligation to disclose in advance documents of this character.  It is also important, of course, also stressed by the Prosecutor, that in adversarial proceedings, the party be given the possibility, cross-examining the witness, to impeach the credibility -- I don't take a position whether this was actually done in the present case, but now I'm at the general level -- to impeach the credibility by submitting documents which have not previously been made known to the witness.  So the Prosecutor is right in that respect.
On the other hand, we all think that the Defence remark is legitimate in the sense that once the witness is in the witness box, there is no longer any contact between the witness and any of the lawyers, any of the teams, either on the Prosecution or the Defence side; and for that reason, the element of surprise and the possibility to impeach the witness would not be reduced if the Prosecution were to provide the Defence with documents the Prosecution intends to rely upon when the cross-examining is starting or even once the witness has entered the witness box and therefore is incommunicado for the Defence.  So, that would reduce the element of surprise for the Defence without reducing the possibility of the Prosecution to impeach the credibility, and we think that is a practice that should be followed in this case as it has been followed in previous cases.  So if that could kindly be observed from now on. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have an observation to make.  It's an observation that centres on the inequality or equality of arms.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The Defence, during the Prosecution's case, adopted the same practice.  The same courtesy was not afforded to the Prosecution.  It is, for want of a better word, unfair and prejudicial to the Prosecution to be asked to submit documents of their own witnesses. 
They are calling the witnesses, not my witness.  They should be making the disclosure to me because they know, they ought to know the evidence and the documents.  We were not afforded the same privilege.  They sprang up with documents; I never objected because that is the essence of an adversarial system. 
The issue you make about the witness being in the box would not be helpful.  Learned counsel, with all due respect, would only tailor his examination to suit the evidence there.  The whole purpose of it -- and in any jurisdiction in the whole world, it is a noted fact that it is not a disclosure obligation of the party impeaching the witness to disclose the evidence beforehand.  It is absolutely unfair.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Now, we are well aware, coming from many jurisdictions in the world, of what is the practice in the world, so we do not need to be reminded about that.
I also take your point, Mr. Phillips, that when it comes to a document which may affect the way in which the examination-in-chief may be conducted, then certainly you will not be doing that until your cross-examination starts.  So that's absolutely -- I totally agree with you there. 
So in other words, when I made the remark about the moment he -- you may, of course, be able to wait with showing documents to the Defence if that could influence the examination-in-chief of the Defence.  That point is taken.  But the remainder of the remark remains; that is, namely, that we have now in Trial Chamber I, for at least two years, observed the practice I just outlined, and it's a matter of courtesy.  It's not a binding rule.  It's not a clear-cut rule, but it facilitates the proceedings in the courtroom.
Now, coming, then, to the point of the equality between the parties, I can't -- are there any documents or episodes in particular you want to recall?  You will remember -- I don't recall you having made any objections previously in that connection, but that is, as you say, because you accept the adversarial principle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Of course, of course.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It happened several times, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
With the same sort of documents from the prosecutor's office.  There was one that was the subject of a motion that I filed, which I haven't received a decision on.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that or which decision?  I thought we were absolutely up to --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The decision on the misconduct of Defence counsel.  It was based on a similar practice.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But what I'm saying now is not particularly dramatic or difficult, it's only a matter of courtesy between the parties.
Now, there were no questions -- do you have anything to add, Mr. Besnier? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have no difficulty with the ruling.  I understand the grounds and I accept it, but I have one question still in my mind.  If we have in our possession after this session documents which enable us to challenge the documents produced by the Prosecutor, will we be authorised to produce such documents in the interests of justice? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will make an application to have it admitted, and then we will deal with it in concreto, case-by-case basis based on the situation.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that yesterday you testified to the effect that you were guilty for three murders which you yourself committed? 
@A.
That is true, but there were some of my co-perpetrators whom I did not mention because there were many.  But it is true that I committed these crimes, and I confessed to them.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that with regard to other crimes, you testified yesterday that you had played the role of an eyewitness, and that your guilty role was attributed to you mainly because of your passiveness?
@A.
No one has even accused me of these crimes.  I voluntarily provided this information concerning the crimes so that the legal authorities are aware. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Am I correct in saying that for the murder of Cyprien Karegeya you are described as an eyewitness, as a passive witness of the murder, and that you are not yourself accused of having struck any blow?
@A.
I do accept my responsibility in that crime because people saw me pass by.  I was in the group of attackers.  I was armed with a club, and for those who saw me, I was a criminal amongst others.  And that is why I am counting myself amongst the attackers who killed Karegeya.  And people who were seeing me on the scene -- at the scene of the crime could not say that I was not part of the criminals involved, and that is why I voluntarily gave information regarding that crime so that one is aware of exactly what happened. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
With regard to the murder of Cyprien Karegeya, are there any documents in the possession of the Rwandan courts containing confessions given by you, giving an account of the events?
@A.
Yes, such a document exists.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You will see that this document is attached to your confession, a document which was given to you today. 
@A.
But I think I saw Karegeya's name in the documents which were given to me. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Witness -- I do not want to ask a leading question, Mr. President -- but the name of Karegeya does not exist in the documents which you were given today.  Does that mean that there were other confessions or other documents bearing the name of Karegeya and which you voluntarily did not wish to submit, so that we have a complete document? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, why is Mr. Karegeya's name not mentioned in the present document, the one in front of us?  Why is that? 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know how they omitted mentioning Karegeya's name.  I mentioned it.  Furthermore, I have in my possession a document which testifies to the fact that I mentioned that name. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that, the one you have in your possession? 
@THE WITNESS:
I have a document.  In fact, it's a copy of my confession that I sent to the prosecutor.  The first document which I sent to the prosecutor was lost, and I made a second document.  So I do not understand why the name of Karegeya does not appear in that document, whereas I had spoken about him and I gave the names of persons who had killed him. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when you sent that second document to the prosecutor, was that a document containing the names we have in front of us here, but in addition, also Mr. Karegeya's name?  Is that your testimony? 
@THE WITNESS:
I remember that I mentioned Karegeya's name.  I was asking the person who was writing for me, because I don't know how to write, to add Karegeya's name.  So I don't understand how come he didn't mention Karegeya's name, but I'm positive that in the document I have, that name exists. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But when you provided this second round of information, did you then give these names, plus Mr. Karegeya's name?
@THE WITNESS:
I asked the person who was writing for me to also note down Karegeya's name, but I didn't take care to find out whether he'd actually written Karegeya's name.  Maybe he forgot to mention Karegeya's name, but I had asked him to do so.  I'm positive that I asked him to add Karegeya's name. 
There were two documents.  First of all, there was a document in which my confession appeared, and then there was a document in which I was testifying on persons who killed Karegeya in my presence.  Therefore, I did not omit to add Karegeya's name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you also mentioned these other names in that connection on that occasion; is that so? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The problem of documents which are disclosed at the last minute is that we are unable to verify their completeness.

@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Mr. Witness, was your confession read to you, the one which is before us?
@THE WITNESS:
No, it wasn't read to me.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
And how much time did you spend at Gitaka roadblock.
@THE WITNESS:
I was not at the Gitaka roadblock.  That roadblock was erected in the Gitesi secteur, whereas, I was in Buyea secteur.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
And where was Karegeya killed?
@THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was killed in Gitaka behind the buildings.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Which buildings?
@THE WITNESS:
It was behind the row of buildings which was somewhat below.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Was one of those buildings Gitanen Karara, the trader's house?
@THE WITNESS:
No.  The first building belonged to Myera and the second to Sebarame.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have not understood you very well.  Where was the Gitaka roadblock, according to you?
@THE WITNESS:
When I arrived in Gitaka in 1994 I saw the roadblock.  It was erected between Karara's house and that belonging to Ndabukiye.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
But that is not where Karegeya was killed?
@THE WITNESS:
We had already passed the roadblock and it was behind the buildings, a little bit further away from the roadblock that Karegeya was killed.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
So you never spent any time at this roadblock, then?
@THE WITNESS:
No.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
You mentioned in your evidence yesterday that after the arrival of the accused in Gitaka, a few days later people began to flee, and you say this was at the end of May or beginning of June.  Is that what you said?
@THE WITNESS:
I said that I saw Ndindabahizi at the end of June and people began to flee at the beginning of July, the first week of July.  I think that's what I explained yesterday, and that's how the events occurred.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
The war was over, wasn't it?  So why were people --
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  People were leaving the country.  Ordinary citizens were no longer being killed.  There was rather a war between the soldiers.  The disturbances amongst the population had come to an end and there was only the soldiers that were in confrontation during this time.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Then you also stated -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that the Accused could not have killed Karegeya because there was no prior meeting.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
My question then is, were there prior meetings in respect of the victims whom you killed or others who were killed?
@THE WITNESS:
No, there were no meetings.
@JUDGE BOSSA: 
Thank you, that's all. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, were you provided with a copy of the confession statement made before the Rwandan Court?
@THE WITNESS:
I made a confession.  I kept a copy and I gave the original to the Prosecutor.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Do you have the original with you?
@THE WITNESS:
I have a copy but the other was sent to the Prosecutor's Office.  I'm keeping a copy with me in the prison.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did you see the name of Karegeya was mentioned in that confession statement?  Did you see the name of Karegeya in the copy provided to you by the Rwandan court?
@THE WITNESS:
I had told them to write down his name and I believe his name is there.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did you read that name?  Did you know that name was there?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know how to read.  I'm sure his name is there, because I asked that the name be mentioned, so I don't know how it couldn't be written down.  I cannot read what was written by hand.  When I'm given a document I keep it.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You are unable to read even your own language?
@THE WITNESS:
When it's a typed document I can read it and that's the case if it's in capital letters, but if it's written by hand I am unable to read.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Your confession was recorded in handwriting?
@THE WITNESS:
Someone was taking down notes for me.  I was asking someone to take notes for me, and the confession was taken down by hand.
@JUDGE KHAN:
The copy provided to you, is it a handwritten or a typed copy?
@THE WITNESS:
I kept a copy but the other one was sent to the Prosecutor.  Nobody gave me a copy.  In other words, no one sent us a typewritten copy of what we had said.  I kept the handwritten version.
@JUDGE KHAN:
That handwritten version was provided by the Court, by the Rwandan Court?
@THE WITNESS:
No, no, it's prisoners, it's my fellow-prisoners who wrote for me, and then a copy of that document was sent to the Prosecutor's Office.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, who was the leader of the group that killed Mr. Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
I saw Rwasibo, who was conducting himself like a leader.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You formed part of that group, did you, but he was the leader or you were not sure of him?
@THE WITNESS:
I can consider myself as an observer.  I was not with them in the beginning.  We met along the way, and I joined the group.  We did not discuss the plan together.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you -- but you were present when the person was killed.  What was the distance between you and the spot where he was killed, physically?
@THE WITNESS:
It's a distance that I can cover, if I walk at a fast pace, in five minutes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you five minutes away from the spot where this person was killed?  Were you five minutes walking distance away?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I was very close to these persons, about ten metres from these people.  I was a bit uphill in relation to where they were.  I was not further than ten metres away.  And I could see a person and whatever he was doing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if Rwasibo was the leader, why is Rwasibo not mentioned in this document with persons present during killing?  In other words, the document containing perpetrators and observers, why is his name not mentioned in that document which was shown to you just a few moments ago?
@THE WITNESS:
Rwasibo was often mentioned.  How did you know him, Mr. President?  I'm sure it's because his name is in a document that you have.  How then do you explain his presence in the document?  I mentioned him in all the documents.  I could not have covered up his name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, did you mention his name when you made your explanation to the Prosecutors and when you confessed to your crimes?  Did you mention Rwasibo's name?
@THE WITNESS:
At that time I did not mention Rwasibo simply because I was talking about myself.  When I gave my testimony perhaps I should have mentioned him in my testimony, but with regard to my confession, the confession is about what I did personally.  But the testimony about -- that arose in the second part and his name is mentioned therein.  I think there's a portion of my testimony which you did not receive.  There were two parts, my confession and then my testimony.  It is possible to see it in one portion of the document and not in the other.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in the testimony before this Court you mentioned Rwasibo.  I'm putting to you that there is no mention of Rwasibo in the document we were just provided with.  What is your comment to that, please?
@THE WITNESS:
I'm saying that in my statement, when I had my statement written, I asked that his name be mentioned.  I don't know why they did not write it down.  I believe those who recorded my statement did not write it.  Sometimes you ask somebody -- you tell somebody something and you ask him to put it in writing and it's possible for that person to forget certain things and to include certain things, that is normal, that is human.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Mwirinde?
@THE WITNESS:
You asked me a question regarding residents of Gitaka, people who were present and who could have seen what happened, and you asked me the names of other persons who were present, people who were observing and who were not killers, and I mentioned his name.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He was a Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he present during the event?
@THE WITNESS:
Mwirinde was there the day Karegeya was killed and we found him there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Mwirinde observing this event, the killing of this person?
@THE WITNESS:
He was present.  When Karegeya was taken away he was in front of his door, but he did not go to the site where he was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:  
Who was Sebarame, was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He was a Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he also observe the killing of Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
Sebarame saw him, he came and stood about five metres away from me and observed what was going on, and if you asked him the question as to who struck Karegeya, he will tell you because he was present and he saw everything.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Nsengimana, was he Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was Nsengimana's first name?
@THE WITNESS:
Nasone (phonetic).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he have any nickname?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know his nickname.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
He was present during the killing, was he?
@THE WITNESS:
We left him a bit uphill.  He was standing there, but I do not believe that he was present among those that I saw at the killing site.  I think he was on the road close to the houses.  I don't think he left that place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then Sebarame, was he Hutu or Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.
@MR. PRESIDENT:  
Was he also present?
@THE WITNESS:
He was standing about five metres from me and he saw everything.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in your statement we just received here there is no mention of Mwirinde, Nsengimana, and Nsabimana.
@THE WITNESS:
I added this name when you asked me the name of the persons who were present.  We did not have enough sheets of paper such that we couldn't put all the names.  We had to reduce the names and to write as little as possible.  So we mentioned only some names.  They asked us questions on events which we experienced which we witnessed, which we saw.  We gave the essential parts.  We could not have given all the names.  I have given this name before you just because you asked me a question regarding those who were present and who witnessed the killing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know anyone called Joel Ntabwakule (phonetic)?
@THE WITNESS:
It's, rather, Joel Ndabukiye, I know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
@THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.  He's detained in the Gisovu prison.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he present during the killing of Karegeya?
@THE WITNESS:
He was not present. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why is he detained?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I don't know the reasons for which he is detained.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know anyone named Emmanuel Ndabukiye?
@THE WITNESS:
Did you say Emmanuel Ndabukiye?  I don't know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the distance, Mr. Witness, between Tabeya and the place where the killing took place?
@THE WITNESS:
Where the killing took place is called Tabeya but before then it was in the Gitesi commune, and for now, when they are asking their questions about where the killing took place, we used to say in the Gitesi communal, but now that place is called Tabeya.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the place where Karegeya was killed is in Tabeya?
@THE WITNESS:
Now it has become Tabeya, it used to be Gitesi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Mr. Witness, we have concluded your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be escorted. Yes, you have anything to add, Mr. Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
I have a question, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead.
@THE WITNESS:
I have a question.  I have seen Ndindabahizi in this courtroom.  Can't you allow me to say hello to him?  We haven't seen for a long time.  That is my only request.  Thank you, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a request which is now noted and if there is a wish on the part of the Defence to follow-up that request, then it can simply be done by communication through the witness protection unit.  Your testimony has come to an end, provided that there is no objection by the Prosecution, and there is none.  So that is something that will be followed up administratively and we will see how that develops.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.

@MR. BESNIER:
Good morning, Witness.
@A.
Good morning, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, are you able to tell the Court where you lived in 1994?
@A.
I lived in the Nyagahenga cellule in the Kahenge secteur and Kibuye préfecture, in the Gitesi commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  And before you came to Arusha, Witness, where were you living?  Just before you came to Arusha where were you living?
@A.
The same place I've just mentioned.  But before coming here I was a detainee in a Gisovu prison.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  You are a detainee in the Gisovu prison.
@A.
Yes, in the Gisovu prison.
@MR. BESNIER:
And do you recall the dates on which you were arrested to be taken to the Gisovu prison?
@A.
30th November 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
What are the charges against you?
@A.
I'm accused of genocide.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you plead guilty to those crimes?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
And have you been sentenced for this crime?
@A.
No.  My case is still before the Prosecutor.  It's not yet been brought to the judges.
@MR. BESNIER:
You admitted having been arrested for genocide.  Did you participate in attacks against civilian Tutsis?
@A.
Yes, I have a big share of responsibilities.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you able to tell the Court, taking as a reference point the death of President Habyarimana, if you remember that, tell the Court when the attacks against the Tutsis started.
@A.
In our region it was after four days that we started the killings.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did the killings start?  Who gave the signal?
@A.
We were very nervous.  I did not see any authority, but there were attacks and there were attackers from Mabanza, from Rutsiro, and they told us that, "You have not done anything to date."  And I think that is how we started.
@MR. BESNIER:
You admit having committed crimes against Tutsis.  In which secteur did you perpetrate these crimes?
@A.
In three separate secteurs, Gitesi secteur, in Kayenzi, as well as the Ruragwe secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you recall having gone to a cellule called Gasharu during the genocide?
@A.
Yes, very often.  We virtually lived in this cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you going to Gasharu every day?
@A.
We didn't go to Gasharu every day, but we used to go there -- we go through the cellule when we were going for attacks, and then we came back to this cellule to have a drink.
@MR. BESNIER:
And yet the Gasharu cellule is not the cellule in which you have your house.  So why do you go there so often?
@A.
It's a cellule which is neighbouring to our own.  There's a river dividing the two and every day we used to meet in the Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there a trading centre in Gasharu?
@A.
Yes, there was a small trading centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what is the name of that trading centre?
@A.
It's the Gitaka trading centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
During the events that we are discussing, are you able to tell me if there was a roadblock at Gitaka?
@A.
There was.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was manning this roadblock?
@A.
There was a young man called Sumayire Minani and another one called Nbonyubwe.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can witness or the Kinyarwanda interpreters, are you able to spell this name for the Court?
@THE INTERPRETER:
Minani, M-I-N-A-N-I.  Sumayire is S-U-M-A-Y-I-R-E.  Nbonyubwe N-B-O-N-Y-U-B-W-E.

Thank you.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let's come back to this roadblock.  Do you know if Tutsis were killed on this roadblock?
@A.
No Tutsi was killed at this roadblock.  People were brought from neighbouring hills.  Some were killed behind the house and others in other places, but nobody was stopped and killed at the roadblock; to my knowledge.
@MR. BESNIER:
To your knowledge, did it ever happen that Tutsis were killed within the vicinity of that roadblock?
@A.
It is in the commercial centre that the roadblock was located, and I know people who were killed close to that centre, and I myself played a role in their killing.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying that people were killed.  Who was killed during the genocide in that cellule?
@A.
There were many.  There was, for example, Nyiranye; a child called Gatemeri; there's Kayoni.  There's a child of Rwabyuma, and the little children, two of them of Nzajyinduga; and a woman named Tatiana and her two children; another one called Nyankiko, and others.  There's a woman and her child, the woman was called Mukankubito, there was another man called Karegeya who was killed very close to that centre.

Yes, it is Thacianne Mukantabana, M-U-K-A-N-T-A-B-A-N-A.
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, all those names you have mentioned, did you know them beforehand?
@A.
Yes, I knew them very well.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you on good terms with them before the events?
@A.
I had no problems with them.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We heard only, April 1994, we didn't hear the beginning of counsel's question.
@THE WITNESS:
We were surprised -- we were taken by surprise by the events.  Immediately after the death of the president, we were very nervous, very exited, and we were afraid at the beginning.  We were afraid.  We lived harmoniously on the hill, we used to work together, and we were ensuring our own -- our security together, but later when houses -- when they started burning houses in Mabanza, the events went all the way to Ruragwe and people came by saying, "Well, you have not done anything," that is when we started killing, and one person -- you attack a person you knew and you kill him.  It is a matter of shame and we are very sad about that.  I am very saddened by the crimes that I have committed and I know it will create problems for the courts, and that is why I decided to confess my guilt.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You killed Tutsis, but were you not afraid that the authorities or the police will arrest you and put you in prison during the events?
@A.
It took time for us to begin killing, but then later on, when we started killing, what could the authorities do against thousands of people?  It was impossible to quieten those people.  That was a major problem to the authorities.  Those were killings never seen before; unspeakable, but I couldn't see how the authorities could arrest those killings, and had they attempted to stop us, probably the situation would have worsened.  Thus, we started killing, it was because we were very nervous.  We had become more like beasts.  This is the only adjective I could use to describe us.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us be more precise about Thacianne Mukantabana that you mentioned.  Do you remember the date on which she was killed, Thacianne Mukantabana?
@A.
I do not remember the date, sir, but I believe that it was in May, at the very beginning of the month of May.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was there when she was killed?
@A.
Let me give you the names of the persons that were with me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are you going to give us names, sir?  If so, give us names of the people who were in your group, who could not be witnesses at this time.  We shall come back to that.
@A.
We were at Gitaka, and when we killed her it was on a Monday.  There was a first person, Nsengiyumva -- a gendarme Cyprian Nsengiyumva; there was another Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu; and then there was Ismael Mbarushimana; and I believe that there was also Frouduel  Bakinahe; there was also one Mpitabakana.
@MR. BESNIER:
Still for the Court and the transcripts,  could you be so kind as to spell out those names?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There was Cyprian Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y U-M-V-A; Ismael Mbarushimana,
M-B-A-R-U-S-H-I-M-A-N-A; Mpitabakana, M-P-I-T-A-B-A-K-A-N-A; Frouduel Bakinahe, B-A-K-I-N-A-H-E; there was also Mbarushimana, rather, Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A; Alias Rutomvu, R-U-T-O-M-V-U.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
A general remark.  When there is a list of names given by the witness, and the same list is given in a piece of paper, then, I think, the practical way to proceed is to ensure that the court reporter has the same list.  For the time being, it would appear that that list has not been distributed to the court reporters.  But could that be arranged from now on, that when there are lists of names in the document, then that is being submitted to the court reporters, then we do not have to do the spelling. So that is one issue.
The second; once names are being spelt, it is, of course, important to reflect the names and their order as testified to by the witness and not to follow the names in the list if there are differences between the two.  I am just making those two general observations. 
Yes, please.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I have taken note of that observation, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Witness, let us now hear from you, briefly, but accurately, the manner in which Thacianne Mukantabana was killed?
@A.
I believe it was around 2 p.m., we were at the Gitaka centre.  Cyprian Nsengiyumva, who was a gendarme, and Nsengiyumva, alias Rutomvu, took her to Gitaka -- they found her at Joel Ndabukage's, where she was hiding.  I asked them, "We were looking for that person for a long time, where did you find that person?" And the gendarme told me, "You cannot search for these people, I am a soldier I know how to go about it.  I cannot tell you where I found her."  And the people said, "Well, now we have found her."  And when we were going out to kill her, the gendarme said, "Well, wait a minute, she promised to give me something," so that we went away and got to Nyarubuye at one Pascal's house -- Pascal Rwuhara's house, there were the furniture belonging to that lady.  We took the furniture and got back to Gitaka.  The furniture went to Nyabahiga -- at the gendarme's house.  When we wanted to take it to Nyabahinga's house the soldier said -- when we got to Nyabahinga -- we wanted to go to Nyabahinga, but the soldier refused, the gendarme refused.  So we stayed at Gitaka, and we took her behind the shops.  We didn't go any further, and it was there that we killed her in the company of two of her children and another man who was at Ndabahinga's, he was called Nyugahingu; so that we killed four people on that occasion.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying, firstly -- firstly you found and flushed out Ndabakeke who was at Bukiye's house in hiding?
@A.
I was not one of those that flushed the person out.  She was brought in by Nsengiyumva, Cyprian, who was a gendarme.  With Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu, they were the two that brought her.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you a member of the group that went to take the furniture -- to steal the furniture?
@A.
Yes, I also went to Nyarubuye.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, you went to Nyarubuye to get the furniture.  Were you with Thacianne?
@A.
Yes, she was with us, with her two children.   We went together.
@MR. BESNIER:
And then you took her back to the Gitaka centre; is that correct?
@A.
Absolutely correct.  It was there that we found that Nyankiko, Zachari, that man -- when you get to Gitaka, you go down along rows of shops and just in front of Gatwa's residence, and when you get to a junction, you turn into a street of Rwuberamye's house, that is where the shops were.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, as compared to the roadblock that was at the central of Gitaka, what was the distance at which Thacianne was killed?
@A.
It was the distance of 80 to 90 metres.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who were the persons that struck Thacianne Mukantabana?
@A.
I, personally did.  I struck her several times.
@MR. BESNIER:
With what type of weapon?
@A.
I used a club.  There were four people to be killed, but I also had a sword.  I did not use the sword, since Nyakiko was bringing about problems, I left after having struck her twice.  She was not yet dead, and it was Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu that finished her off whilst I went off to kill the other man who was called  Nyankiko.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who ordered you to kill those people in particular -- especially Thacianne and her family, who gave you instructions to kill those people?
@A.
You mean at that very instant or just before?  In the preceding days, nobody ordered us to do so.  I have told you how it all started, but when we were on the spot the most important person was the gendarme, and it was the gendarme who told us, "Don't take her all they way to Nyabahanga, kill her here."
@MR. BESNIER:
Didn't you say that Thacianne was being sought after, who was looking for her?
@A.
Everybody was looking for her -- everybody.  All the population in that area was looking for her.  In 1985, there was an incident.  There was a teacher called Jaqueline Nyirabakwiza, who was a teacher in primary 5, she had poisoned -- she had poisoned her, and people were saying that it was her that -- it was she that poisoned her, and that is why she was called "Nyiramasitete".  And when the war started, they were saying that she has to be found and killed, and that is when -- why Thacianne was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This episode with Jaqueline, in which year was that, Witness?
@THE WITNESS:
I was in primary 5, I believe it was in 1985.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  Could you tell me whether you knew one Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before the events that we have just discussed, that is before April l994?
@A.
I used to know him.  I had seen him on two occasions.  The first occasion at which I saw him was just before -- just after his wedding.  He had come to visit his family while in our area.  We were there, we watched his vehicle so that the children do not spoil the tyres.  The second time was, I believe, in 1992.  He had come to our area in Gitaka; he held a meeting there, and I believe on that occasion, he gave us berets of his party, PSD.   We were very happy to join the party.  This is how I got to know Ndindabahizi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi once again during the war, that is, between the beginning of April l994 and the end of June 1994?
@A.
I did not see him during that period, but I heard it said that he had come to our area -- he had come to our area in Gitaka, and that he had arrested one Augustin Karara, who had a shop in the centre.  He had arrested him and he had taken him away to imprison him.  On that day, I did not move.  I believe it was on a Sunday, I was at home, and the other attackers came to see me and they said, "The minister is here, he is very serious."  And I asked, "What has happened?"  They told me, "Well, he has just arrested Karara."  And then I told them, "Well, if you continue to move around like this, you may be arrested yourselves."   And we went to a hill, and several moments after that I saw, from one kilometre away, a vehicle pass by Ndabukiye's house.  We therefore went to the centre after that, and people told us that Karara had just been arrested, and they did not know what was going to happen to him.  This is what happened, but I did not personally see him when he came on that day.
@MR. BESNIER:
Didn't you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before Thacianne's death at the Gitaka roadblock that you mentioned?
@A.
No, sir, I didn't see him.  I did not see any other authority as a matter of fact.  I didn't see any préfet or bourgmestre.  I did not see any such authorities.  And, I pleaded guilty, let me state the truth and nothing but the truth, and if I had seen the president I would have said so.  So that if we speak the truth it must be the whole truth and supply the names of all the accomplices.  So that had I seen him, I would have made a testimony against him, and that would have been done a long time ago, and that is the reason why I am saying he did not do anything in our area.  He did not call for massacres to begin.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you know one Cyprian Karegeya?
@A.
I know him very well.  He was a neighbour in the Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he survive the genocide?
@A.
No, he died.  He was killed, and that is a very well-known fact.  He was killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
When was he killed?
@A.
After the murder of Thacianne Mukantabana, that was less than seven days after that murder, it was at that time, I believe, that he was also killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know how he was killed and who killed him?
@A.
I do not know the circumstances under which he died.  Karegeya was one of the people sought after.  He was very much sought after.  I came to Gitaka, at that time Karara just came out of the Jita pub where he was having a drink.  He was very sad, and he said, "My friend has been killed."  I asked him, "Who is killed?  Is it Karegeya?"  He said, "Yes, it is Karegeya."  I said that since he is dead we no longer had to look for him.  He said that he was one of the most important people that actually had been killed.  And I said, 'Who killed him?"  And he said, "It was attackers that came from Buye."
I said, "Didn't you bury him since he was your friend?" He said, "Yes, I did bury him."  I said, "Well, well, that is the end of all of that."  It was thus that I learnt that he was killed by people from Buye.
@MR. BESNIER:
But you were not an eyewitness to that murder?  Yes or no will do.
@A.
You mean Karegeya?  No.  I was not an eyewitness to his murder.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Regarding your testimony here in Arusha, do you believe that you are going to gain anything from it -- from having -- or testifying for Emanuel Ndindabahizi, are you going to gain anything from it?
@A.
You mean interest?  You see, we in Rwanda only want people to plead guilty if they are guilty, and ask for pardon, because there are people who are wrongly accused.  People are said to have played a role whilst one did not see them anywhere.  Those people are falsely accused.  So, you the Judges must seek the correct information to get to the truth.  We are speaking the truth.  We are not protecting anyone.  We never do so.  We speak the truth, the whole truth, because what happened is deplorable, and it's for that reason that if we are to struggle and show the reconciliation of Rwandans, we must speak the truth so that we know where to lay the blame.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Now, try to be brief in your responses.  I have two more questions for you.  In the prison that you are, did you meet people very near Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, who were close to him, and who asked you to testify in his favour?
@A.
You mean people from abroad, or people in the same prison as myself?

Now, people in the same prison ask yourself, all the detainees; didn't they ask you to lie in favour of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Nobody, sir.  We are here speaking the truth about crimes that we personally committed.  Nobody close to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi approached me in that respect, and even if they did, I wouldn't accept.  There are many people that were compelled to plead guilty, but I personally can never be coerced into doing anything.
@MR. BESNIER:
In the prisons in which you are, are there Hutu groups that help one another to lie before national or international jurisdictions, and are you not one of the members of those groups?
@A.
I don't know of the existence of such groups.  All I know is that each and every one speaks out his or her own truth as he or her -- she knows it.  If there are any people who are lying, other people will challenge them. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Isn't it correct that among the detainees that confessed some are trying to help or are trying to encourage their friends also to confess; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct, it does happen.  We had meetings like the ones we had in gacaca per secteur, per cellule, and people talked about what happened in the cellules, the crimes that were committed, who committed them.  They gave the names of the accomplices and everything is said.

The front document, which has 61 written at the right-hand corner of it, is the original Kinyarwanda confession, and then there's a French translation.

@A.
Actually, I'm talking about Seyeze's house, in front of Seyeze's house.  That killing took place in front of his house.

Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you understand that to mean that Seyeze is accusing you of being an accomplice in the killing of that person, sir?
@A.
Yes, I can see that, but the problem is to determine whether Kanyoni is a nickname.  The circumstances that he is referring to are the same, but I recall that that person was called Kanyoni and that's why I'm saying that I did not participate in Simeon Higiro's death.  I do not know whom he is referring to, who he is talking about.  I must know whether that person was called Simon Higiro.  The person whom he is referring to and who was killed or who died at Gasharu, I don't know.  I don't know who he was; I killed many people, I wouldn't know his name.  Sometimes the person may have written the nickname without knowing other names, so it's possible that Simon, Simeon -- Simon Higiro and Kanyoni would be one in the same person; it is possible. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful for that, sir.  
Now, can you help me?  Does the man Seyeze, Ezechias, have any relationship with the Accused person in this case, to your knowledge, sir?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And what is that relationship, to your knowledge?
@A.
I don't know what the exact relationship is; maybe they are brothers.

Are you speculating?  Are you saying you are not sure, or you don't know, sir?
@A.
They have their sister who lives on their land, on their property.  I was going to school and I didn't know everybody, nor the relationships that existed between them, but I know that their family relationship is very close.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, if you -- do you recall the people who were present during the incident of Simon Higiro's death, who you say may be or may not be the same person with the nickname?  Do you recall those who witnessed this crime, sir?

Yes, there were other people with me.  For instance, there was a soldier known as Boniface Mgabo.  There was another person, and it was very early in the morning.  There was a man known as Uwimana; I don't know his first name.  There was Uwimana, yes.

@A.
I have made a confession, but I was not able to know who the witnesses to my crime were.  I was able to give the names of the co-perpetrators, yes, and that was by chance, because the truth will come out as nothing will be able to be hidden.  And since Seyeze was their neighbour, it's obvious that they knew him, and he's the one who is going to help you and I and the Tribunal, to remember the names of those who were present.

I was a farmer, but before that in 1988 when I was in secondary school, I left secondary school in 1990 and I came to remain at home.  And when the war began I was a farmer.  I had just spent four years in that profession of farmer or cultivator.

Sir, have you confessed your crimes before the courts in Rwanda, sir?

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And would I be correct in saying, sir that you would have confessed to killing at least -- maybe I should ask you, Mr. Witness. How many people have you confessed to killing, sir?
@A.
They are very many, more than 20 people that I killed or in whose deaths I was involved.  But if there was a particular location, I was responsible for having killed six people.  So I myself must confess to having participated in a crime during which these six people died, and I needed to denounce those who participated in the killings, because we formed a single group of evildoers, people who participated in that crime, even if I had only killed two people out of the six.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that Mukantabana and her children or child, as you say, had been hiding in the home of Joël Ndabukiye before her death, sir?
@A.
Yes, that's where she was hiding.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How was it that Joel then decided to betray her and subsequently became involved in her death, sir?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
No, Joël didn't participate in the killing of that woman, but as I have already told you, I asked the gendarme to tell me how he had found the woman, and he told me, "You were unable to find her, so I can't reveal to you my secret how I work."  And until today I do not know who told the gendarme that this woman was hiding in Ndabukiye -- Joël Ndabukiye's house.

All the people who were living in Gasharu, anyone who you would ask questions about me would tell you the truth, and he cannot have been unaware of what happened in his cellule and the crimes that were committed in his cellule, and he must have been a witness because he was there.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did Karara Augustin, to your mind, hold any official position in the local administration in Gasharu during the genocide, sir?
@A.
I think he was a responsable.  If not, he must have been a member of the cellule committee in 1994, during the period of the events.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And what, to your knowledge, very, very briefly, would be the duties of the responsable de cellule or a member of the committee at the time, if you know?
@A.
Those were people who were responsible for solving problems arising between the inhabitants, and when they failed to do so, they referred the problem to the secteur.  Furthermore, they are responsible for the development of the cellule by involving the population in the implementation of development projects. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So if crimes were committed in Gasharu cellule, would it have been the functions of the responsable to report them to the conseiller or would it not?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you then help us with this:  how was it, then, that this person, this responsable, was then aware of your crimes and did not prevent them, sir, or report them?
@A.
It's true that if there are attackers who attack a cellule, the responsable should refer the matter to the higher authorities, but I described to you what we were like.  Some authorities could do nothing against us.  We could even attack them.  Now, without even talking about the responsable, even the conseiller couldn't approach these people who were killing.  They could do nothing, they could say nothing.  For instance, Karara; there were young people who came to destroy houses in Gitaka, and when he tried to stop them they wanted to kill -- to beat him, and I told you that he was my neighbour, so they made him pay a fine of 30 litres of beer.  So people became afraid, and the authorities remained silent in the face of all these crimes because they were afraid. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How then was it, Mr. Witness, that Ndindabahizi was able to order Karara's arrest, as you say, in the month of June?  Can you explain that for me, please, in the light of your --
@A.
What I know is that these young men who were with me during the attacks told me he came, he arrested Karara and put him in jail, and that he put him in jail because he suspected that he killed. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, if, according to you, none of the authorities could stop the killings at the time, how then did the killings stop, or did they go on forever, sir?
@A.
I think that the killings stopped when the soldiers on the front line realised that they had lost the war.  They fled and we members of the population fled.  In fact, we perpetrated these killings in a record time.  We had virtually finished in the month of May.  There were a few survivors, and, to tell you the truth, when we left the country, when we fled the country there was no one else to be killed.  And they told us something which I'll tell you.  When the French came, someone came and told us, "Be careful.  These French have sophisticated equipment which can track down criminals".  So we got afraid and -- we got afraid and we stopped committing the crimes.  There were some survivors who passed in front of us and we left them alone because we thought the French were going to track us down.  And that is how the killings stopped.

And it is your testimony that you never saw with your eyes Emmanuel Ndindabahizi throughout the genocide in Kibuye, sir?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your statement dated the 7th of October 2002 to my learned friends for the Defence, you mention six names who you describe as people who had accompanied you -- in other words, accomplices -- during the killings.  Do you recall doing that, sir?
@A.
Yes, I did. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recall if you mentioned all six people in your confession statement to the Rwandese authorities, or did you just mention some of them?  Did you mention all of them, as you have done here, in your confession?
@A.
My case file is very voluminous.  Possibly all the names have been mentioned.  If I were with someone in a certain place it is possible that I went with him to commit another crime, but when they were asking us the questions they asked us to list the names that we remember, and they told us that later on if we remembered some other names, we should come and add them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the registry show the witness a copy of his confessional statement in Kinyarwanda, please.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I'm having them hand over to you -- can I see it; yes, correct -- the voluminous document that you have described in Kinyarwandan.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it is the last document I am going to refer to, Your Honour.  It has got his name in front of it and it has got a French translation as well.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you see the document that I have had placed in front of you?
@A.
Yes, I have the document.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you recognise it as a copy of your file before the prosecutor in Kibuye?
@A.
Yes, that indeed is my case file. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, Mr. Witness, I want you to -- with the help of the registry, I want you to turn to -- it is all numbered -- if you turn to page 22 of that document, the Kinyarwanda document, and the name under 5 which in the French translation can be found on page 19, No. 5 as well on page 19 of the French.  You see that name there, Kampira Deboura; do you see that?
@A.
Yes, I can see that name. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know that person, sir?
@A.
Yes, I know this person. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You have described her as having witnessed some of the crimes that you committed, have you not, sir?
@A.
Yes.  Regarding Kampira Deboura, she knows the crime I committed against her because I killed her son, I can no longer remember his name. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is indeed correct, sir.  Now, can you turn with me to page 27 of that document, and can the registry assist him; 27 of the handwritten document, and I will try and find it in French.  I think in French it is on page 22 and 23.  The name against No. 20 in that document is the name Nkurunziza Joël, N-K-U-R-U-N-Z-I-Z-A, Joël.  Do you recall that?  Do you see that, sir?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Again you have described this person as being a witness to some of your crimes.  Do you recall saying that, sir?
@A.
Yes, I did. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, on 21 you also describe the spouse of Joël Nkurunziza as being a witness to some of your crimes.  Do you see that, sir?  Just look under Joël's name, and you see the other entry there?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, which crimes or crime did Joël and his spouse witness, sir?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
They witnessed the killing of two children of Nyirahembe and the killing of an old woman whose name I cannot recall.  So, it is the killing of two children of Nyirahembe and an old woman. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Nyirahembe is spelt how for the record, please?
@A.
Nyirahembe is N-Y-I-R-A-H-E-M-B-E.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you in addition refer to an old man or an old woman? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, an old woman who sought refuge in Nyirahembe's house.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, do you know -- in your confessional statement you describe one of your accomplices by the name Sendiragora Uwimana?
@A.
Yes, I collaborated a lot with this person, and I know him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is on page 16 of the handwritten Kinyarwanda document and on page 13 of the French.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, can you tell me if this man Sendiragora has any relationship with the accused person in this case, and, if so, can you tell me what that relationship is, sir?
@A.
I do not know the relationship between the two.  I don't even know where this person comes from.  I know he is a young boy who was keeping cattle in the area.  I don't know any relationship between him and the Accused in this case. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Mr. Witness --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Registry, that is enough for that document.  Can I have the document back.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Finally, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether or not the prosecutor in Kibuye accepted your confession?
@A.
I do not have the confirmation.  After I sent my confession, the Prosecutor received them, but then he was transferred.  Following that, I sought to find out what had happened to my case, and lately after people were invited to participate in a meeting to be told about what should be done in the country, I raised the question as to what had happened to my case file.  I was told to refer the query to the prosecutor's office and that my case file was still with them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indeed there is a notation on your confessional file which indicates that the prosecutor has accepted your confession and has categorised the crimes in this confession under the first category.  Does that surprise you, sir?  That is on --
@A.
There is no problem with that.  In my confession -- in my confessions I wanted to bring out the things that we had done.  I have committed a lot of crimes.  That is why I cannot but plead guilty.  I wanted to ask for forgiveness, and I find it necessary -- I find it normal that I'm classified in the -- in category 1.  I have committed a lot of crimes. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your killings were operated in units, following your testimony; that's what you say.  Is it possible for someone who was not in your unit of attackers to be involved in a particular area, or how were those units arranged?  How did you operate?
@A.
We could start with our cellule, form a group of ten persons, leave the cellule, and when we get to another cellule we are told, "There's a person hiding in such-and-such a person's house".  In our group we would take a decision to go, and after killing that person we could go to another cellule and that we might meet another group which would tell us that there's another -- "There's somebody hiding in X or Y's house", then we go after this person.  That is how we used to operate. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for answering my questions. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions, Your Honour. 
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel.

I have to enter the documents as Prosecution exhibits.  The first one is the first one I used, Seyeze Ezechias, which would be the next exhibit.  Can the registry help me with the numbers, please.

Re-examination? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Just one or two questions, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you recall that the Prosecutor asked you a question on the killing of the child of Rwabyuma?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you admitted having committed that crime?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
The Prosecutor referred to witnesses who witnessed that killing, and as witness you mentioned Mukamana Julien.  Do you remember that?
@A.
Yes, I said so.
@MR. BESNIER:
And then the Prosecutor referred to one Sibomana.  You did say that he lived in the neighbourhood, in the region; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
During the killing of the children was Sibomana present?  Did you see him?
@A.
Since I was with Ndabukiye, Ndabukiye was mentioning the names of these persons.  I am sure that I saw Mukamana Julien, he came from Kirambo to hide in that locality.  But regarding Sibomana and the other name that I saw, it was -- the crime site is close to the house, it is possible that they were there.  And I brought out this child from a banana plantation, everyone could see us, and I see that what these witnesses are saying is -- is true. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, the question is simple; you can give a yes or no answer.  Did you, yourself, see Sibomana at that time?
@A.
During that crime, I did not see him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Does the witness still have the Prosecution exhibit that is the confession, that is the bulky document? 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you now have that document?
@A.
Yes, I do. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Page 1, that indeed is your name on that page?
@A.
Yes.  I can see that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you recall the date on which you made that confession?
@A.
No, I have no clear recollection of that, but I believe it must have been last year.  This document was put together last year.  At the very beginning when I wrote down my confessions, this was in 1994; that I remember.
@MR. BESNIER:
This document that you have in front of you, was it written based on your confessions of 1994?
@A.
In 1994 I was arrested by soldiers.  The genocide survivors pointed me out and said he's -- that I am a criminal.  That is how I was arrested.  I was detained in the Gitarama prison, where I stayed for four years.  When I got to Gisovu I felt it necessary to plead guilty and to make my confessions.  That is when I started drafting my confessions.  I think what is contained in this document reflects what I did, but it was later on, when I did some soul-searching based on the questions that I asked myself, I decided to confess. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Can you please move on to page 8 of that document in Kinyarwanda, that is the figure which is at the top right-hand side of the document.  Are you with me, Witness?
@A.
Yes, I am. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you read out the name against the entry No. 24 on that page?
@A.
Mukantabana, Thacianne. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Would that mean that before you came to this courtroom, Witness, that you had confessed to the killing of Mukantabana Thacianne?
@A.
Yes, that is the person that I killed.  He is among one of my -- he is among my first victims. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Do you know Nzaminduga -- Nzajyinduga?
@A.
I know Nzajyinduga.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is there a relationship between the children that we referred to a while ago and Nzajyinduga?
@A.
These are the grandchildren of Nzajyinduga.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know if there is any blood relationship between the children of Nzajyinduga and Ndindabahizi?
@A.
No, she is an old woman, and I wouldn't know of any relationship between her and the Accused. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Witness.  No further questions. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, what did Karara tell you about the killing of Karegeya? 
@THE WITNESS:
As I explained earlier on, soon upon my arrival at Gitaka they was drinking beer in Gitan's beer bar.  When I got there he was sad and told me that "They've killed my friend.  It's over".  The question I asked him was to know who the killers were.  He answered that it was not necessary to answer that question, that he was killed by people who came from Buye.  That is what I know about the death of Karegeya.  He was killed by people who came from Buye. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it your testimony that no Tutsi were killed at the roadblock at Gitaka?
@THE WITNESS:
No Tutsi was killed there.  The people that were killed there came from other hills, and they were going by and they went by and were killed elsewhere.  For example, the woman I talked about did go through there.  She was going to Ruhara's, Pascal Ruhara's, and upon her return she also went through there, that location.  We did not arrest anybody at that roadblock. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
How long were you at this roadblock?
@THE WITNESS:
I was not there for a long time at that roadblock.  I wouldn't say that I was all the time at that roadblock.  People were brought and went through in our presence.  So far as I was concerned, I went through when I was on the way for an attack, and I came back only for a drink. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And you said attackers came from Rubanga, Rutsiro and Ruragwe, and you were told that you had done nothing and that is how the killing started.  Who told -- who were telling you that nothing had been done in order for you to start the killings? 
@THE WITNESS:
Among the people who came there were people who were usually called Abakiga.  We were scared of those people; they had intimidated us.  Some people had taken refuge at Kirambo, and those people, the Abakiga, came to kill them and threaten -- and to retaliate against us if we did not take part in the massacres.  I can't tell you the names of these Abakiga.  They went through and went to Bisesero and elsewhere.  So far as we were concerned, we stayed in our given location. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you went to kill Mukantabana, a schoolteacher; is that correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You said after giving the two blows you went away.  You left her and you went away to kill other persons.  Why didn't you finish her finally?   
@THE WITNESS:
I did so because that man who was also called or known as Nyankiko wanted to confront the person that had taken Mukantabana, and when I saw that I came to help, and the woman was finished off by other people who were around.

We are waiting for the translation of Zacharia.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's Nyankiko, Zacharia.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Rwasibo, do you know that name? 
@THE WITNESS:
I know him.  That was Rwasibo, Augustine.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in any particular killing, to your knowledge? 
@THE WITNESS:
Indeed we worked together in several places.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in the killing of Tatiana? 
@THE WITNESS:
Perhaps he stayed in Gitaka, but among the people that I remember, I can only remember six persons, so that was a sizeable attack.  Now, what I did was that I tried to observe people, I tried to remember people who took part in the attack.  If I knew that he participated in the attack I would have said so.  Perhaps he was in Gitaka but that he didn't come to the location at which we were and at which we killed the people that I talked about.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Rwasibo involved in the killing of Karegeya, to your knowledge? 
@THE WITNESS:
I believe that Rwasibo is from Kayenzi.  People could move from one secteur to the other for attacks.  If somebody mentioned him as having been in Buye, perhaps he was there.  As I said, and as Karara told me, those who killed him came from Buye.  I don't know how he got to Buye, perhaps he was one of the killers.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not know; isn't that the situation, Mr. Witness?  You do not know whether he was involved in the Karegeya event?  That's your explanation, isn't it? 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I could have confirmed it if I were there at the killing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know someone called Emmanuel Ndabakuye -- Emmanuel Ndabakiye? 
@THE WITNESS:
I do not know that name, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you name -- you know the name Joel Ndabukiye but not the name Emmanuel Ndabukuye.  Am I right now? 
@THE WITNESS:
I rather know the name of his son, that is Emmanuel.  I know the one called Ndabukiye, Joel.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You know Joel Ndabukiye.  Have you ever heard of anyone called Emmanuel Ndabukuye -- Ndabukiye.
@THE WITNESS:
No sir.  In our area we only had one Ndabukiye and that was Joel.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which area was that -- no, you don't have to answer that question.  
Now, do you know anyone called Appollinaire Bugisiga? 
@THE WITNESS:
I do know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is that? 
@THE WITNESS:
He was a farmer.  He was a farmer.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in the killing of Tatiana? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, sir, I didn't see him at the place Tatiana was killed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Mr. Witness, we have -- we have now --

Could you tell us your commune, your secteur and your native cellule?
@A.
I'm from the Kibuye préfecture, Gitesi commune, and Gitarama secteur, Kigesi cellule.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At this time where do you live?
@A.
I live at the same place that I have just indicated.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
More precisely, do you presently live in Rwanda?
@A.
At present I am in detention at the Gisovu prison, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Which is your ethnic group?
@A.
I am Hutu, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
At what date would you place the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
President Habyarimana died on the 6th, but I only learnt about it in the morning of the 7th.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Which month, which year?
@A.
It was the month of April 1994, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What happened in the days following the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
In a very few number of days after the death of President Habyarimana nothing much happened in my area, but at about the 12th, I saw many Tutsi taking refuge in Kibuye from Mabanza.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What did you yourself do in April 1994?
@A.
In April 1994, after the days I have just said, I lost my brother-in-law who used to live in Ruhengeri and I was not able to go to Ruhengeri, but later on I was able to go to Ruhengeri.  And when I came back  I realised that the people that had taken refuge at the stadium had died and those that had taken refuge in the church were also killed.  There were dead bodies almost everywhere.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You went back home after the burial of your brother-in-law.  At what date was that, approximately?
@A.
I do not clearly remember the date, but it was between the 20th and the 25th of April 1994, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you say as from the end of April 1994 and May -- April and May 1994 what you were doing in terms of activities?
@A.
At the end of April and during the month of May, I stayed at home; I did not go anywhere.  But at the end of May, a roadblock was set up in our area and myself, just as anybody else, was asked to take part in the manning of that roadblock until such a time as the French arrived and after they had said that they were going to ensure security.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
When were you arrested, Witness?
@A.
I was arrested on the 9th February 1995; the 9th of February 1995.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Why, to your knowledge, are you still in detention?
@A.
I am presumed to have taken part in the genocide, just as the others that are detained along with me.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you plead guilty?
@A.
I recognised having been at the roadblock I am being accused of having been at the roadblock.  I am also accused of have a grenade in my possession, which I confessed, but I used the opportunity also to testify on the events that took place at that roadblock.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, let us come back to the roadblock.  
To your knowledge, when was that roadblock erected; when was it built?
@A.
I do not clearly remember the date, but I would say that it was at the end of the month of May or at the beginning of the month of June.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Could you be more precise as to the precise location of that roadblock?  Where was it erected precisely?
@A.
The roadblock was set up in front of the Nyabahanga River bridge.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Who erected that roadblock?
@A.
That roadblock was set up by the conseiller of the Gitarama secteur -- which is my secteur -- Gitarama secteur by the name of Ngerabayeyi, Etienne.  Ngerabayeyi is spelt N-G-I-G-A-B-Y-E-Y-E -- N-G-E-R-A-B-A-Y-E-Y-I.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You were one of the people manning the roadblock, were you?
@A.
That is correct.  I was one of those members of -- one of the groups manning the roadblock.  We were being relayed by another group.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, at the date that roadblock was set up, what was the purpose of the roadblock, to your mind?
@A.
The instructions given us by the conseiller who set up that roadblock were given out when I was there.  He asked the -- those in charge of the Kigesi cellule, that is the person called Pierre Damien Nsegureze (phonetic), to look for people of integrity to man that roadblock for the purpose of intercepting Hutu refugees on their way to Cyangugu and Kibuye in their flight from the RPF soldiers.  So that a camp was created in Nyamuyeve (phonetic) to be able to list the names of the people concerned in order to prevent them from getting into Kibuye.  The other reason of the roadblock was of course to monitor the number of people going through the roadblock in vehicles to see whether they have ID cards, and if by any chance the people at the roadblock had any doubts about their identity of such-and-such a person that was believed to a member of the RPF or to be an Inkotanyi, that person was to be arrested and taken to the competent authority.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
What does Inkotanyi mean?
@A.
The Inkotanyi were the RPF soldiers that were fighting against the Rwandan Armed Forces during that period.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
As far as you are concerned, you are a member of one of the groups that worked in turn at that roadblock, manning it?
@A.
Absolutely true, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were you armed?
@A.
At the beginning when we used to man that roadblock, it was Bonaventure, Niyikula who was armed with a gun.  The others were armed with machetes, sticks, clubs, but then later on I was given by Bonaventure Niyikula, I received a grenade.  I asked him for the grenade because I needed it, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
We shall come back to the grenade.  So that the arms, the weapons you had were machetes.  Where did the machetes come from?
@A.
Well, each one brought a machete from home, because in Rwandan culture each person has a machete at home, and women are not authorised to touch their husband's machete, and the child neither.  The children are not authorised to touch the women's machetes.  A young adolescent would first of all buy a hoe and a machete, so that in our culture the machete is a symbol.  It's a cultural symbol.  Each and everyone does have a machete.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
The other people in the machete -- in the roadblock, were they armed, and if so, with what types of weapons?
@A.
They had machetes.  They had clubs, big sticks, sir.

Because then we could continue on Monday at two o'clock in the afternoon.  Since the military trial is scheduled for the morning on Monday, we will then move on to the afternoon shift in the Ndindabahizi, in the afternoon. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Certainly, Mr. President.  Probably this is the right time for me to come up with some information concerning the rest of the proceedings.
I believe we have heard 12 witnesses this week, and next week we could bring in five new witnesses.  But for the week beginning on Monday, the 10th November to the 17th November, we believe that we will not be able to bring in witnesses, Mr. President, the reason being that certain witnesses, for professional reasons, cannot make the trip before the 17th, 17th of November.  These are DD and the expert herself (sic).
You wanted to know yesterday afternoon whether Mr. Ndindabahizi could not appear during the week of the 10th of November before the expert.  We looked into this matter with Mr. Ndindabahizi, and 
Mr. Ndindabahizi believes that he should not testify before the expert.  I believe that we share his opinion, sir.  There are two reasons for that.  The first reason is that it is a matter of pragmaticism (sic).  We focussed a lot on the witnesses to date.  I was not able to meet my client; I spent most of my time with the witnesses.  Next week I will not be able to meet my client, either, because we will be in the courtroom, and we are not authorised to see them during the weekends.
There is also a reason concerning the structure of the proceedings, and as a matter of logic, he will have to look at the whole structure of the trial and he will have to answer some questions from the experts.  And we also believe that the order of appearance of the witnesses be maintained, and we beg that we continue after the 17th of November, after having heard witnesses next week, so that we'll have a week without witnesses, that is, the week running from the 10th of November.  
We should like to apologise for this.  It was difficult for us to know that we would work with such speed.  At the time we contacted the witnesses and the experts we didn't have all the information, and we didn't know the tempo at which this court would be working.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the -- thank you for that explanation.  Now, Witness DD would appear here on the 13th, isn't that so?  David-David, arrival on the 13th? 
@MR. BESNIER:
On the 13th, sir, so that he will be ready to appear from the 17th, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So he's not arriving early on the 13th, is he, because --
@MR. BESNIER:
As a matter of fact, I believe he should be here on the 14th of November.  I should review this with the witness protection section, but I think he will be here on the 14th of November. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Let us simply take note of what you said now and look into this.  There is a matter of planning, not only this trial but also the other trial.  Let's see whether we can sort it out in a way which is practical, and we will come back as soon as possible so that you know what will be the final schedule. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  Have a very nice weekend.
Mr. Witness, you must not now discuss your testimony with anyone.  We will continue with you Monday in the afternoon at two o'clock.
The Court is adjourned.

$BY MR MARÇAIS:
@MR MARÇAIS:
Good afternoon, Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon, Counsel.
@MR MARÇAIS:
Did you know one Pierre Mugemangango?  Shall I spell it, Mr. President?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
@THE WITNESS:
Pierre Mugemangango, I know him.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Let me spell, Mr. President, Mugemangango, M-U-G-E-M-A-N-G-A-N-G-O.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness, you may answer my question.
@A.
I know Mr. Mugemangango.  He was advisor at the Gitesi secteur.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Does it mean that in April 1994 he was still conseillé at the Gitesi secteur?
@A.
Yes, you're quite right.  That is absolutely correct.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, during the events of 1994 was he able to give you or was he in a position to give you orders or did he give you orders?
@A.
No, sir.  He did not give me any orders.  Moreover, he was not our conseillé, he was the conseillé of the neighbouring secteur, and all the instructions we received came from conseillé Etienne Bidayeye (phonetic) who ran the Gitarama secteur in collaboration with the president in charge of the Gitesi cellule called Mr. Seyevereze Pierre Deninene (phonetic).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you need that name, Mr. Marçais?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
No, sir, it's probably for the interpreter I was waiting.  I didn't want to go too fast.
$BY MR. MARÇAIS:
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So, is it correct to say that the conseiller gave instructions was the conseiller for your secteur, is that correct?
@A.
That is absolutely correct, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Was there -- around the roadblock were there any bars, any pubs?
@A.
Yes, indeed, there were many, many bars, around eight, I would say, but the road building operation, Kigali, at the road Kigali-Kibuye were, in fact, thought that those bars had to be pulled down, destroyed.  At present there are only two of them remaining.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Would it have been possible for an adult, during the period in question of April-May 1994, to hide behind those bars for one week without being seen or uncovered?
@A.
Now, to tell you the truth, even without talking about being able to hide for a week, there was nowhere one could hide.  You can only be there for about five minutes, there were so many people roaming around.  During that period we did not work much, but there were many people around, and behind those bars there were kitchens; there were latrines; and there were people doing different things; household chores; there were those who were peeling potatoes, and then there was a road behind the bars and those people could use those roads to go home or come to the bars.  So there was nowhere to hide, as much.  Moreover, during that period no Tutsi could go out from his or her hiding place without being seen, because even during the night all the pathways were monitored, there were the night patrols, nobody went to bed, that was the order of the day, and that was the purpose of preventing any soldier from RPF to come by and create a situation of insecurity.  Such was the situation.  In other words there was nowhere to hide behind those bars.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were there, apart from the bars, was there any possibility of hiding in the surrounding fields?
@A.
Well, there was a field in which there were various plots.  There was Everest Ndawari, he had sold one of his plots.  But as there was war the plot was not fenced and administered properly, whereas after the war a house was built or houses were built in those plots, so that there was really no place to hide.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Were there any plantations or banana plantations sufficiently well grown so as to serve as hiding places?
@A.
The banana fields were planted only when the houses were destroyed.  If not, there were banana plantations here and there, so when one was at 100 metres away one could see what was happening in a given banana plantation, for example.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
So, a person hiding at about 35 metres away from the roadblock or around the roadblock could have been Tutsi, he could have been Tutsi and would be very quickly found.  Is that correct?
@A.
Thirty-five meters is very short.  That was not possible, because there were houses between the roadblock and the 35 metres you were talking about.  You couldn't hide because there were buildings.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
You mean the bars?
@A.
Yes, sir, the bars, but a little bit further down there were houses where people lived, so that there were no places to hide.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, a few more questions, Witness.  Did you know Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, I do know him.  I have known him for quite a long time when he was a young man.  He came to us at the hand of a young lady in our family.  That means I know him very well.  I cannot make any mistakes about him.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you see him during the 1994 events?
@A.
During this period I did not see him, not once.  And I was very often on the road, but I did not see him.  I couldn't tell you that each and every time I was on the road, but for all the time I was by the roadside or on the roadside I did not see him.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Did you see or hear about the presence and activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the Nyabahanga bridge during the 1994 events?
@A.
I didn't hear anything concerning Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and had there been anything I would have known, because I was very often informed.  But when all that happened, I was in the area very often, but I didn't hear anything concerning Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Is it possible, Witness, that Mr. Ndindabahizi came to distribute machetes at the roadblock without your knowing?
@A.
That is not possible either, sir, because everything that could have been distributed at the roadblock during my absence I would have my share kept for me because I was on duty there, and during that period it was no longer necessary to use machetes because the Tutsi were no longer there to be attacked.  During that particular month machetes would have been useless.  We did not need machetes during that period because we had a sufficient number of machetes.  One can get machetes from anywhere, anybody's home.  Even the people that went by the roadblock had their own machetes.  So I did not hear anything about a possible distribution of machetes at that roadblock, sir.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Now, my question was, if there were to be any distribution of machetes, would you be informed?
@A.
Yes, sir.  I would have been informed.  Nothing could have prevented me from knowing that such a distribution took place, because I was in the area.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
This is all for the examination-in-chief, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Prosecution.
$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
@A.
Good afternoon, Prosecutor. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that the Nyabahanga bridge is located on the main road that goes from Gitarama to Kibuye?
@A.
Yes.  That is correct.  The Nyabahanga bridge is on the main road.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying, sir, that if you had to travel from Kigali-Gitarama to the southern préfecture of Kibuye in April-May and June 1994, that would be the road that you would have travelled on past that bridge to Kibuye, sir?
@A.
Yes, sir.  You are quite correct.  Everybody that left Kigali-Gitarama to go to Kibuye or to Cyangugu would go on that road, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In response to a question from the learned counsel for Ndindabahizi, would I be correct in saying that it is your testimony, sir, that whilst you were at the roadblock at Nyabahanga you never saw the Accused, Mr. Ndindabahizi, go past that bridge or that roadblock, sir?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir? 
@A.
I said that I never saw him go by that spot.  I didn't see him with my own eyes, unless he did so during my absence, but whilst I was there I never saw him pass by, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it also your testimony, sir, that if, indeed, Mr. Ndindabahizi had gone past that roadblock you would have heard about it, sir; even if you didn't see it with your own eyes you would have come to know about him going past that roadblock on that road, sir?
@A.
I would have heard about it if there was any reason for that.  For example, if he, as a minister from that region, where he is very well known by one and all; for example people told him, well, "We are thirsty", and he accepted to buy them drinks, that I would have learned.  For example, had he made a communication to describe the situation in Kigali and to proffer advice, I would have been in the know.  But if he simply went through with his bodyguards I probably would not have heard about it, because people would not be particularly keen about coming to say that he had come and gone by, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, is it your testimony that if Mr. Ndindabahizi had driven past the roadblock you may or may not have heard that he went by; is that what you say?
@A.
I said that had he gone by, I would have learned about it.  If there was any particular reason for that, if he had made a statement in the area or distributed something at the roadblock, I would have heard.  But had he simply gone by the roadblock without people talking about it I would have no means of knowing, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your opinion, sir, if you cast your mind back to April, May and June, 1994, sir, would it have been possible, sir, in your opinion, that if a government official had arrived at the roadblock those manning the roadblock would have been able to recognise him as such?  Can you help me with that?
@A.
That is a possibility, but those people were very important.  They were high authorities, escorted by soldiers, and very often they were said to be in a hurry, and the people who were manning the roadblocks had all the confidence in the soldiers and they could open up the roadblocks and allow the authorities to go through, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would you have been told, at the time, sir, that such an important person had driven past the roadblock?  Would it have been a topic for discussion or would it have been just a normal event in a day's workday that would have gone unnoticed?  Can you help me with that, sir?
@A.
Well, people would not have gone through the pains of talking about it, because there were many authorities that went through, military, ministers, and during that period they moved their families towards Cyangugu or Bukavu and they came back.  There was movement forwards and backwards, so that it was not necessary to scrutinize a situation to know who went by or did not.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At what stage did you start operating at the roadblock, what month?
@A.
It was towards the end of the month of May or the beginning of the month of June.  I do not quite remember the dates, but it was during that period the roadblock was set up from the very first day, and from the very first day I started working at the roadblock, and when the roadblock was being erected I was there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it then your testimony, sir, that you witnessed other government officials and their families going past that roadblock towards Cyangugu in the months of May and June, sir?
@A.
Yes.  During that period the authorities moved here and there.  I saw some of them.  But there are those that I did not see.  There were many vehicles going by to and fro, and sometimes I had to leave the roadblock to go get some food.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, is it your testimony, sir, that those authorities waited until May and June to move their families towards Cyangugu, sir, and not before?
@A.
Even before that the authorities could go by.  There was no roadblock at the time, and at that time I couldn't have been informed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, is it your testimony that not only did you join the roadblock at the end of May-June but that the roadblock did not, in fact, exist during the months of May and April?  Is that what you are saying, sir, it did not exist before you joined the roadblock?
@A.
In our secteur the roadblock was erected at a location called Josie, and that roadblock was demolished on that day, because the people who manned it had just robbed the refugees of their belongings and the roadblock was demolished or rather dismounted and taken to Nyabahanga.  This is what happened sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I'm only interested in one roadblock.  I'm not interested in the roadblock in your area. I'm interested in talking about the roadblock at Nyabahanga.  Can we agree on that?  Yes or no?
@A.
Yes, I agree with you.  There's no other problem.  The roadblock was erected at Nyabahanga after the other one was demolished, the other one that was in another location.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Now when was that Nyabahanga roadblock erected, sir?  Can you help us with that?
@A.
The roadblock at Nyabahanga was erected at the end of the month of May, when Hutu refugees were displacing themselves towards Kibuye and Cyangugu.  It was at that time that that roadblock went up.  Also a transit camp was set up to enable vehicles to pass through and get all the way to Kibuye.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, if I understand you correctly, Nyabahanga roadblock or the roadblock at Nyabahanga bridge was not in existence at that location in the month of April.  Is that not your testimony, sir?
@A.
That is correct.  In April that roadblock did not exist.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That roadblock also, according to your testimony, sir, did not exist in the first two weeks of May, did it?
@A.
As I told you, I don't know the exact date when the roadblock went up, but as best my memory serves me it was at the end of the month of May, at around the 20th of May I would say, and between then and the beginning of the month of June, that is when the roadblock had gone up.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, what, in your mind, was the singular reason for setting up a roadblock on the Kibuye-Gitarama road at the end of May?
@A.
The reason the roadblock was erected was because refugees who were moving would reach Kibuye, and there were too many of them in the city.  To stop that flow of refugees, a roadblock was set up, a transit camp was set up to take down the names of people who were coming through the roadblock, such that vehicles could be attributed to them to transport them.  In fact, that roadblock went up to ensure security in Kibuye town.  Refugees who came on foot were led toward the camp.  Those who were in vehicles were first controlled and then they were able to pass through.  Vehicles were not allowed to park at Kibuye.  Vehicles and people they were transporting continued on their road outside of the city of Kibuye.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And this, to your mind, these refugees, to your mind, were Hutu refugees, were they not, sir?
@A.
Yes, they were Hutu refugees who were coming from Ruhengeri, Byumba, Kibungo, Gitarama, and Kigali.  Those refugees were moving towards Cyangugu looking for refuge because Inkotanyi had just taken Kigali and Gitarama.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Was anyone, to your mind, killed at the Nyabahanga roadblock?
@A.
At the roadblock, just near the bridge, no one was killed.  However, people were killed further on, after the roadblock, but they were not killed by persons manning the roadblock.  We learned the names of those persons, and we gave those names to the authorities, because those people were killed by people from other secteurs or cellules, such that if ever there are going to be trials no innocent would be condemned.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you tell me the names of two or three people that you are aware of as having been killed around the roadblock in Nyabahanga?
@A.
Indeed, I gave those names to the prosecutor's office.  It's not just two people.  I remember talking of certain André Rurakaza; a certain Sarambuye; Rusingiza; and a young man called Claudien.  I testified regarding the death of those persons so that the authorities could identify them, but I played no role in their deaths, nor did the people who were with me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Could we have those names spelled into the record, please?
@THE INTERPRETER:
Let's begin with Sarambuye, S-A-R-A-M-B-U-Y-E.  André Rurakaza, R-U-R-A-K-A-Z-A.  Rusingiza, spelled R-U-S-I-N-G-I-Z-A, and Claudien, C-L-A-U-D-I-E-N.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Now, Mr. Witness, what ethnic group did these four men or women belong to?
@A.
The four persons that I named were Tutsis.  They were of the Tutsi ethnic group.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And around about when were they killed?
@A.
Regarding Sarambuye and Ruswgiza, they were killed well before, in April that is to say.  Regarding the other two, they were killed afterwards.  One of them was killed towards the end of May; whereas, Claudien was found in a house where he was hiding.  Those who found him wanted to bring him to the bridge, but when they saw that his host was not at the house, they wanted to kill him.  So they didn't bring him all the way to the roadblock where we were at.  
Rurakaza, his death only was known to us later on.  He was killed in Josie cellule and not at Nyabahanga roadblock.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The crimes that you confessed to before the prosecutors in Kibuye, where were those crimes committed, sir?
@A.
I did not confess to a crime.  I did not participate in any person's death.  I was guilty of being at the roadblock and having a grenade in my possession.  I also confessed that we had sold a cow because the gendarmes had thrown a grenade and cows ran about and we grabbed one of them.  I seized that opportunity to talk about the death of the persons that I mentioned so that I would not be accused of participating in putting them to death.  If you look at the documents in my confession you could see that in page 6 and you could look into the details of exactly what happened.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The grenade that you had whilst you were at the roadblocks was meant to be used for what, stopping the Hutu refugees from going past, sir?
@A.
No, it was not to stop Hutu refugees from passing by.  In fact, I only got that grenade after.  In the beginning I didn't have it.  But I had a problem, I had a disagreement with the people who had killed my cousin.  We were not on good terms.  They were angry with me and they said that even my mother was Tutsi, even if she died well before the events.  So I got that grenade in order to defend myself in case I ever needed to do so.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  And do you know whether or not the prime minister of Rwanda went past the Nyabahanga bridge during the months of April, May, June of 1994?
@A.
I didn't know the prime minister.  I did not see him.  Nevertheless, I heard people coming from Kibuye saying that they had seen him at the guest house in Kibuye, but personally I did not see him pass.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you were not at the roadblock in May of 1994, were you, sir?
@A.
I already stated that during the entire month of April (sic) the roadblock did not exist.  It was erected towards the end of May.  I wasn't called on to stay there permanently.  I could leave to go home.  Some days I was not there at that roadblock working, so perhaps he came through and I didn't know about it.  In fact, furthermore, many people didn't know who he was.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
How long have you been detained, Mr. Witness?
@A.
Soon it will be nine years.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And, as far as you are concerned, you are detained for stealing someone's cow, are you, sir?
@A.
No.  Furthermore, I wasn't accused of stealing that cow.  I stated that that incident happened.  When I was being held I was accused of being at a roadblock and of having a grenade in my possession.  After investigations were conducted, just when I was about to be released, I was accused of killing people, in fact, so that they would not release me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But you were manning a roadblock which was erected to control the flow of Hutu refugees like yourself.  Why are you accused of killing?  Were you accused of killing Hutus or Tutsis?
@A.
I'm not accused of killing Hutus.  Even if those allegations were made against me it doesn't mean that I really did anything -- really killed anyone.  Furthermore, there are people who admitted to killing those persons and I'm waiting for the gacaca jurisdictions to be operational so that I can appear before them, and if I am acknowledged innocent I will be released and I will go home.  I played no role in the death of those persons for which I am accused.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your testimony on Friday you were asked why the roadblock had been established, and you have testified as follows:  "The other reason of the roadblock was, of course, to monitor the number of people going through the roadblock in vehicles to see whether they have ID cards and if, by any chance, the people at the roadblock had any doubts about their identity of such-and-such a person that was believed to be a member of the RPF or to be an Inkotanyi, that person was to be arrested and taken to the competent authority."  I quote directly from the transcripts of 31 October 2003, 
Mr. Witness.  Now, what you said on Friday is completely at variance with what you've told us this afternoon, isn't it, sir?
@A.
No, there's no difference in the two statements.  As I said, we would control people who were coming through in vehicles.  We could not send them to the transit camp.  We had to verify whether or not there were firearms and see -- make sure that everyone had their own identity card.  But even the as we did that we did not discover anyone in an irregular situation.  We controlled those persons who passed, and if there was someone who did not have an identity card, but if there were other people who could attest to the identity of that person, that person would be left to go through with the members of his or her family.  That is how we worked.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You drew on Friday a link between the identity cards and membership of the RPF; did you not, sir?  Yes or no?
@A.
A member of the RPF could not have an identity card in the way members of the population in the country did.  Such a person would be brought before the communal authorities who would deal with the case.  That was the instructions we were given.  But once again, I would underscore that we never stopped any members of the RPF at that roadblock.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You were not armed at the roadblock, apart from having the one grenade you never used, sir?  Is that not the case?
@A.
Well, we had traditional weapons, such as machetes.  Other people had clubs or machetes or spiked clubs, but only one person had a firearm and that person was Bonaventure Nyikura.  He brought that firearm from Kigali and he was assigned to that roadblock for control reasons.  Other than that, there were no other weapons besides the ones I mentioned. Regarding the grenade that I mentioned, I only received it afterwards.  From the start I did not have that grenade.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, if you came across a lorry load of RPF -- lorry full of RPF soldiers, people you refer to as Inkotanyi, with a couple of machetes, clubs, and one single grenade which you never used, how would you have apprehended them at that roadblock and handed them over to the competent authorities, sir?  Can you help me with that? 
@A.
Indeed that was a problem that we always pointed out.  Because if ever we were taken by surprise we would be decimated or risk that.  We spoke of that problem to the gendarmery authorities who promised to bring us weapons.  But up until the point the roadblock was dismantled, those were not brought to us, but we kept working at that roadblock because we were given an order to do so.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you were sacrificial lambs, were you, sir, stationed at the roadblock with no arms and asked to stop RPF and Inkotanyi from going past, is that your testimony, sir, civilians like yourself armed with clubs; and you lived to tell the story, did you not, sir?
@A.
It is true, at that time we had no choice, we could not refuse to go to the roadblocks.  We were under constraints, even if we didn't want to go, and we were worried if we refused to go we would risk being called accomplices of the Inkotanyi.  Therefore we were compelled.  We had to go to the roadblock.  Even during the night nobody slept.  They had to participate in night patrols.  People were not authorised to go home to sleep.  These were orders, hence we could not do things differently.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And those who supervised the roadblocks were the conseillé and his son and the résponsable?
@A.
Instructions were given by the conseillé, but he did not spend his time at the roadblock.  There was a résponsable and other persons I already mentioned and one had a firearm and they supervised the roadblock.  The résponsable was in charge of making sure that people came to relay in shifts, the other workers.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the résponable, by virtue of his title, is a member of the local authority in your area, isn't he?  He has a position of authority, doesn't he, sir?
@A.
Yes, you are absolutely correct.  The résponable is an authority.  He is the one just under the conseillér and when the conseillér is not all problems are given over to the résponable.  The résponable is in a position to talk to authorities who come through the roadblock and therefore the résponable is also the person who gives the orders.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know a man by the name of Seyeze, Ezechias?
@A.
Did you say Seyeze, Ezechias.  Yes I know a Seyeze but I don't know if his first name is Ezechias.  ***************************.  If you can tell me where he's from I can clarify for you and tell you if, indeed, it is the person I know.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony that you do not know that this man is the brother of the Accused in this case?  Yes, I know.
@A.
It's because I know one Seyeze from our secteur, but there is a Seyeze from another secteur.  I don't know if the question you were asking is about Seyeze from our secteur or the other Seyeze from the other secteur.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm asking you about Seyeze, *************************with the Accused in this case.  Do you know that person or don't you?  Yes or no?
@A.
Yes.  I know him very well.  He's from Gitesi secteur but for Gitesi, he's free, sir (sic).
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And this *********, where is he now, sir?
@A.
**********************.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, does he have any relationship with Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, sir.  When we were questioned he said that they were brothers, but I did not know whether they had any blood relationship, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So is it your testimony that you did not believe him.  You doubted what he told you?  He said they were brothers.  Do you believe him or do you not, sir?
@A.
I did not talk to him, sir.  I heard him, sir.  I have nothing to add to that, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You've never spoke to him in prison, sir.  Is that your testimony, sir?
@A.
******************and we do meet, but we did not have any discussions, sir, concerning the reasons he's in jail.  The crimes for which I am detained were crimes which were committed in my region, and he was detained for crimes committed in his own area, and I do not have much information concerning crimes that happened in his area, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But you certainly had information as to what happened in his brother's area.  That's why you are here, is it not?  You have more information on Ndindabahizi, don't you?
@A.
To tell you the truth, I don't even know how I was identified and picked to come and testify here.  I didn't think about that.  And for the time I was detained, I never thought that I would come here to testify, but I saw people come in to ask questions to me, the location where I was detained, and that's all, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, how did they come to know that you were detained at Nyabahanga bridge -- or you were manning Nyabahanga bridge, a roadblock at Nyabahanga bridge?  Is that documented somewhere that people know about?  It's an obvious fact.
@A.
The fact that I was at the Nyabahanga roadblock, and *****************; the fact that the people, the local people knew me very well, could perhaps be the reason why somebody may have given my name.  I surmise that it is such the manner I was identified for interrogation.  But at any rate, I believe one could learn about my name or could know my name in one way or the other.  I have no way of telling you how, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  I'm going to ask that you be shown this piece of paper.  There are some names on there I don't want to read publicly because they are witnesses. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you show my learned friend and then show Their Honours and then show the witness.  
I intend to enter it as an exhibit, Your Honours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I see that this takes a bit of time.  Next time if you can make copies for the Judges then we can move on.

Mr. Witness, I have placed before you that piece of paper.  Do you see those four names on there?  Don't read those names out, please.  Just look at the paper.  Can you see that, sir?  Can you confirm to me, sir, whether or not all those four people are currently detained at the location where you are, sir?  Just a yes or no answer, to your knowledge?
@A.
All the four are in detention, sir, at the same location as myself.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination?
@MR. BESNIER:
Sir, Mr. President, Your Honours, no additional questioning of the witness, sir.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  I have a few questions.  You testified that -- correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I understood you to say -- that there was no need for the Accused to come and distribute machetes because by the time the Tutsi had been killed and there was no need for these machetes.  In any case, all those present had their own machetes.  My question is, if there was no need for these machetes, why were you armed with clubs, machetes, a gun, and a grenade?
@THE WITNESS:
I must say that if it were necessary to distribute machetes, they would have been distributed before, that is when there were still attacks on Tutsi groups.  I'm saying that that period, the distribution of machetes could have been justified, but in June there was no Tutsi resistance, as such, and even those Tutsis alive were hiding so that we didn't need machetes anymore, because we had enough machetes.  Had we needed machetes, we would have used the machetes we had.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question.  In what capacity you were at this roadblock?  Why were you called up and why did you accept to come to the roadblock?
@THE WITNESS:
We were ordered to remain at the roadblock to ensure that those people who were running away, either on foot to settle elsewhere, were denied access to Kibuye city.  So we had established a transit camp where people were identified and counted and lorries were designated to take these people across Kibuye city, one. 
And two -- the second reason for the roadblock was to monitor the vehicles who came through to see if there were anybody, there were any people on those vehicles that  could jeopardise security in Kibuye city.  It's another reason why we were ordered to stay at the roadblock, because a refusal would be tantamount to seeking punishment.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
My question is you - you, the people who were ordered, who were you and why were you ordered, in preference to other people.  Like you, for instance, there must have been very many people in the village who could have done the same type of work.
@THE WITNESS:
Well, when the roadblock was set up the conseillé instructed those in charge to look for people with integrity that were not going to take any property from the refugees.  So there was the person in charge who was to select certain people.  It was up to him to choose this and not that, because he knew how this and that behaved, so that the person selected was due to -- bound to participate in the manning of the roadblock.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
My final question was if you were a member of the Interahamwe.
@THE WITNESS:
No, not at all.  I was one of the people among the population.  In our area we didn't have many Interahamwe.  There were people who said that they belonged to the MRND party, but Interahamwe, they were the youth wing of the MRND party.  As far as I'm concerned, I was not even a member of the MRND.  As a matter of fact, I was not a member of any political party for that matter.  I couldn't, therefore, have been called an Interahamwe.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay, thank you.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, for how long you manned the roadblock?
@THE WITNESS:
I wasn't there every day because we relayed one another, but I got to the roadblock and I worked there for a period of three weeks.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You said that sometimes you left the roadblock to carry food, didn't you?
@THE WITNESS:
When it was my time to work I worked and then I will go back home for food, just as anybody else will go back home to eat.
@JUDGE KHAN:
How many times you left the roadblock and what was your duration of absence at the roadblock?
@THE WITNESS:
Sometimes I'll be there for more than usual.  It depends on the time food is ready at home.  When meals are ready I went back home quickly and I went back to the roadblock quickly, so if I tried to tell you how many minutes or hours I spent at home, because it depended on whether the food was ready or not.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Can you put your time in hours or days or in minutes?
@THE WITNESS:
Sometimes I spent 40 minutes at home, one hour sometimes, and at other times I may even spend more than an hour.  It all depends whether the meal in question was readily available or not.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you work around the clock at the roadblock, or in shifts?
@THE WITNESS:
We worked in shifts, sir, at that roadblock.  One group worked in the morning and they stayed there throughout the night and then they stayed on the next day until the evening and then they would be relieved by another group, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So are you saying that one shift started in the morning, the whole day, throughout the night, and until the next morning?  Is that what you just told us?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.  But it should be said that there were breaks in that period, because we were authorised to go for meals at home.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you were then -- when you had finished your shift, for how long were you then not working and at the roadblock, until the next shift?
@THE WITNESS:
Well, sometimes I waited for a whole day and a whole night before going back to duty and, of course, when I didn't feel well, when I had a reason, I could seek permission.  I could be replaced, as was the case for everybody that had any problems, in particular.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How many were at the roadblock?  How many persons were stationed at the roadblock, posted there, in each shift?
@THE WITNESS:
When the chief of the cellule gathered ten persons, including himself, plus the one who had a firearm, that would be 12 people.  That's the number of people to man the roadblock while they waited for relief from another group, another shift.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Bossa asked you whether you were Interahamwe and you said, "No, no, I was not part of the Interahamwe youth party."  But you know the name "Interahamwe" has a different meaning; namely maybe somebody in these kitenge clothes and during that period in '94.  Would you consider yourself an Interahamwe in that sense of the word?
@THE WITNESS:
No, sir.  I was never considered as an Interahamwe in that respect.  Apart from the roadblock where I was compelled to be on duty and according to the instructions received, they never did anything that would link me with the Interahamwe.  Had I done anything, I would have been accused of having done something.  I have never been pointed out as being an Interahamwe.  Because I asked for a grenade, I asked for a grenade just to protect myself, personally.  This is all I can say as far as that question is concerned, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Witness.  Your testimony has come to an end.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you for having come the long way to the Tribunal to give evidence.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.

@A.
Well, he put a question to me as to the case in conjunction to which I testified, and I answered that question.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you simply tell us whether, in that case that we talked about, you were a Prosecutor's witness or a Defence witness?
@A.
I was in for Prosecutor's office.
@MR. BESNIER:
That is most interesting.  Did you know or were you informed of the decision made in that case in which you testified?

I did take cognisance of the decision.

I thought you were asking whether I knew about the sentence handed down.  I did say that I was aware.  The accused was found guilty, with a life sentence.
@MR. BESNIER:
A life sentence, did you say?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, could you pause for one or two minutes or one minute after my questions to allow the interpreters to follow you. 
Let us now proceed, Witness.  We talked about a visit Emmanuel Ndindabahizi paid to you in 1994.  Did you know the reason for that visit?
@A.
Well, he came to see me at home, mainly for the reasons that we have just talked about, so that I believe the main reason why he came to see me was regards that ***************************
@MR. BESNIER:
At what time did he visit you, what time of the day?
@A.
He came very early in the morning, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know whether Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, before coming to see you, had gone to other areas in the Kibuye préfecture, before coming to see you, that is?
@A.
Well, according to the information at my disposal - well, what I realised that very same day, he had gone through his own area -- that is, Gitesi secteur, he went through the Gitesi secteur, and he came to Kibuye after that, very early in the morning, so that he went through his own secteur.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, when you say that he went home, what cellule are you referring to?
@A.
I'm referring to the Gitaka centre, because on his way back, he left somebody at the commune cell from that particular area.  This is why I said that he came through his own native area.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are saying that he left somebody in the communal jail; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
And who was it that he left in the communal jail?
@A.
You mean the name?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.
@A.
It was a fellow that was called **********.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know the profession of *********? 
@A.
********.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know why he took him to the communal jail?
@A.
I'm sorry.  There were allegations according to which he was involved in the matter of certain people known to Ndindabahizi that he participated in looting in that area -- that is in the Gitesi secteur -- so that those two allegations, they were levelled at him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who told you that ********* did participate in looting?
@A.
Well, that very morning following our discussions, that is, my discussion with Ndindabahizi, we went to the commune to check on that particular case, and if my memory serves me right, we reviewed that case together.  But the information came from Ndindabahizi in the first instance.  He told me that he left somebody in the commune jail for offences, for certain offences, as he said.  And when I went back to the commune I started looking into that particular case myself.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us focus on the visit paid to you by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  What did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi tell you concerning *******?
@A.
Well, really, it must be said that this happened a very long time ago.  I didn't pay meticulous attention.  What I do remember is that he came to talk to me about a particular problem that we had talked about, and that subsequent to that he told me that there was somebody that he had left in the communal jail.  He told me the name of the fellow, and he told me why, in one or two words, and told me to continue checking on that case.  And we went together to the communal office, and I did take note of the fact that the fellow was there.  This is what I learned.  But to tell you precisely what he told me, I believe I may make some mistakes, but the general picture is that.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you question *******, personally, concerning those allegations?
@A.
Well, there were the allegations on the one hand, and usually before any questioning there is an interview.  And one gets the picture of what happened, and not as an investigative officer, but in an effort to understand the situation and see what measures could be taken.  And during that discussion, I did not -- I cannot remember whether it was with Ndindabahizi that went to that fellow, but I interviewed that fellow who was in jail, and he told me what happened, and that brought me to my first decisions, subsequently.
@MR. BESNIER:
*************, did he recognise facts or did he say he was innocent?
@A.
According to the information I have, I received information at that time, the fellow -- there was a mistake on the identity of the person, so that he was not involved in that problem.  He gave us information that enabled us to go on, to go after people who were involved in one way or the other in those -- in that affair.  But according to the information we had, he was not involved, so that he was released and other people were called in because the explanations he gave were convincing, about his non-involvement.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who made the decision to release ********?
@A.
It happened inside the office.  He was in jail, in a communal jail.  That means that I was the one who released him********************. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you release him before or after having undertaken the investigation you mentioned?
@A.
As far as I can remember, he didn't spend a long time in jail there, and I believe I am convinced that the explanations he gave were convincing enough.  I do not think he spent a lot of time in that jail, so *************after having exhausted the investigations.  It was after having been convinced about what happened on the basis of his explanations.  So if my memory serves me right, procedurally, that was what happened.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, please help me a little, Witness.  We are talking about June 1994, aren't we?  This event happened in June 1994?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
At that time was the country, in particular, Kibuye, wasn't it overrun by massacres, looting, murder?  A simple yes or no would suffice.
@A.
Yes, yes, what you are saying is quite correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you remember when this episode took place?  You see, now it was put to you that it was in June and you said yes, but do you remember, yourself, when this happened? 
@THE WITNESS:
The precise date, I cannot tell.  This is why I put it in the month of June.  It was June, during June, towards the end of June.  This is all I can remember.  As far as the precise date is concerned, I really have doubts about it.  I cannot confirm it here, sir.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
The question I wanted to put to you is as follows.  At the time, at the time the country was overwhelmed with killers, how could one suspect or accuse anyone of genocide at that time?
@A.
Yes, that is a rather delicate question.  As you say, the country was engulfed by killers.  But at that time, too, people were being arrested.  People were being jailed and released by their own people or others.  And people were put in jail, and their case files were at the prosecutor's office, so that that was chaos.  
So, all the same, when you have somebody who supports you, as Ndindabahizi, for example, he says, well, he's intervening, he's a minister, he's asking questions, and when his prosecutor is not still -- I personally was directly involved in the case.  So that to a certain extent I am covered.  There was prosecution, I did say so.  Even by carrying out the investigations, it would not be easy to carry on the case.  That was why I couldn't do so, but I attempted to carry out the investigation, and that is what I did.  It was possible that was what I did.  
Now, to complement that, I should say that once the population is mobilised, that it points its fingers at somebody.   That somebody must be arrested because somebody is accused by a section of the population.  There were arrests, it is what we said.  When there are grounds, one has reason to carry out investigations and, of course, the case was very difficult to investigate wholly.  But in this particular case, even if I had called people who came, I was not able to carry out the investigation in full because -- but I cannot give you a clear-cut answer because the situation was such that people were careful.  I was not able to exhaust the case, but I did attempt to do so.  This is all.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Now, you said that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on that very date we are referring to.  For how long did he stay with you?
@A.
Well, it was very short.  At my house, it was early in the morning, and, first of all, I had to go and get him at his house.  There was an appointment.  I went to see him, and at the time he came to see me.  If I am with Ndindabahizi at the commune, I would tell him that Ndindabo was not there.  And we took the decision to go and get him at Bwakira.  I could not go along with him.  I stayed in Kibuye.  So throughout that period, and perhaps the time we talked about the arrest, et cetera, et cetera -- that is, by the end of the morning it was all over.  We didn't stay together all the time.  We left, and I went to the communal office.  He joined me there, and he realised that the fellow I was looking for was not there, so we decided to go and get him.  That was by the end of the morning -- or in the morning.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, was ********************* released at the time Ndindabahizi left?
@A.
That I cannot say, really.  At this time, I am unable to tell you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi again during the events; that is, after the visit, the visit we've just talked about?
@A.
After the visit, I saw him when I went for my swearing-in in Gisyeni.  I did see him in Gisyeni.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see him once again at the Kibuye préfecture after the visit at your house that we talked about?
@A.
No, sir, I did not see him again.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see him at the Kibuye préfecture before that visit?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the date?
@A.
It was the 3rd of May.
@MR. BESNIER:
On what occasion?
@A.
At a meeting of Kambanda; that is, Jean Kambanda, the prime minister.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the purpose of that meeting?
@A.
It was on invitation, a security meeting, presided over by the prime minister.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Ndindabahizi take part in that meeting?
@A.
Yes, he was there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the préfecture at another date, apart from the two visits, the two meetings that we've already talked about?
@A.
It was at only those two occasions that I saw him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you informed of the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in the Kibuye préfecture between April 1994 and the end of June 1994, apart from those two dates?
@A.
I have no information on that.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us move to another issue.  Between April 1994 and June 1994, were there any roadblocks in your commune; that is, the commune in which you lived?
@A.
Yes, sir, there were roadblocks.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the purpose of those roadblocks?
@A.
They were roadblocks that were set up by groups of people who were officially supposed to monitor RPF infiltration.  That was the main purpose why they were -- that was why they were on the main thoroughfare, junctions and streets.  But later on it was realised that those were locations or sites for the massacre of people.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the authorities ensure that those roadblocks were monitored in the setting up of -- the mounting of the roadblocks?
@A.
The mounting of the roadblocks was done by the Bihiditero (phonetic).  Those were mobile units.  And those attacks -- those attacks were carried out by groups who couldn't be controlled by the authorities, who couldn't be monitored by the authorities.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, did the authorities mount those roadblocks?  Was there a plan for the setting up of roadblocks in Kibuye?
@A.
To my knowledge, in Kibuye there was no determined plan.  We just saw the roadblocks being set up progressively.  There was one set up here and then another and another until such a time as they sort of formed a complete network, so that they were being mounted progressively.  As far as I am concerned, there was no plan there set up for their set-up.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know whether there was a roadblock at a location called Nybahanga?
@A.
At Nybahanga, that is on the river, on the tarred road, that is Kibuye-Gitarama, yes, there was a roadblock on the bridge.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was it there for a purpose, that roadblock?
@A.
Yes, indeed.  The purpose of that roadblock was clear.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the purpose of the roadblock?
@A.
It was a roadblock that was mounted, but I can't remember the date.  It was May, June, following the establishment of a refugee -- a displaced people camp.  That had been established on a hill overlooking the river.  The roadblock was to block the out (sic) of the people from that area to the city, because there was an emergency evacuation plan established, so that there was a plan and a roadblock to stop them from leaving the camp.  So that, in a nutshell, it was a roadblock at the exit of the camp.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there a roadblock at a place called Faye, F-A-Y-E?
@A.
At Faye, that location, if you are talking about Gitesi -- the place we call Faye is the one that is called also the Kayenzi, the small Kayenzi centre, that is what we call Faye -- there was no roadblock there.
@MR. BESNIER:
How do you know that?
@A.
I know it was on the road.  The roadblock was, rather, at about two, three hundred metres after that, in Gitesi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Witness.  Witness, very quickly, another topic.  At what day, as far as your recollection -- you can recollect, the massacres at Kibuye and the Kibuye stadium, at what date did they take place?
@A.
The massacres at the church -- you are referring to also the Saint Jean Home, because it's the same location -- took place on a Sunday morning, on the 17th of April.  The massacre of the Gatwaro stadium took place the following day, on the 18th, in the evening, so that it was on the 18th of April, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where were you during those massacres?
@A.
I was at Kibuye.  To be more precise, the massacres -- during the massacres at the church, which took place during the morning, I know that people gathered at a roundabout.  I went there to discourage them.  We quarrelled, it didn't work, so that I took refuge at the communal office, myself.  So that I was at the commune office when the massacres started to take place.  As far as the Gatwaro massacres took place, in the evening, when I was at home.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you witness the massacres, either or both?
@A.
I have just told you that the massacres took place when I was at the communal office, so I didn't take part in that massacre.  I did not witness side events.  I was at home during the massacres, at the communal office, too.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did the killers come from?
@A.
Regarding their identity, in general, there was a group known as Wakiga (sic), the people from the hills, the mountains, who mostly came from Rutsiro, from the neighbouring commune of Gisyeni, Kayove, Abakiga.  They are called Abakiga, and they are a very powerful group.  There were also people from Kibuye itself with the gendarmes, some elements from the gendarmerie, other people in the population from Kibuye, these Abakiga.  That is how I was able to distinguish the group of killers at those two places.  That is to say, the Saint Jean Home and church, and the Gatwaro stadium.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did those killers remain in Kibuye for some time or did they just stay long enough to perpetrate the crime and then leave?
@A.
They came and went.  I wasn't there.  Perhaps some stayed there, but in general it was just a movement we saw from the road.  It was a daily movement.  So they stayed for some time, a rather long time, in fact, because -- so, it was a movement from May to June.  It was continuous, if you will.  People coming from Kibuye didn't go elsewhere, and the gendarmes remained.
@MR. BESNIER:
When they were in Kibuye where did the killers stay?
@A.
I don't know if they were officially being hosted by someone, but they stayed in some empty buildings uninhabited, in the primary school, for example, because at that time there were no studies.  But when classes were open, they left that place, the primary school in Kibuye.  There was another centre, an agricultural training centre, called SAF, which is in a little valley past the primary school.  Those buildings were also occupied and damaged.  I also believe that some of them stayed at the buildings of the tribunal -- court of first instance.  But they found a place to stay, at any rate.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did they feed themselves?
@A.
That's difficult to say.  I was not in a camp where they were.  I didn't really see them.  But I know that at each place where they perpetrated attacks, the attack was followed by looting, especially at the church and the Saint Jean Home.  There were supplies there.  Those were given by Caritas to be used to feed hungry people in the commune, and they were stocked at the Catholic Church, where the attacks took place.  Those supplies were completed looted.  And of course they didn't loot to sell it; they used it.  People who took refuge at the church and at the stadium also had brought some of their cattle with them.  Well, that was looted as well. So, in part, they used these kinds of things to feed themselves.  I think mostly it came from things that they looted, therefore.
@MR. BESNIER:
Last question.  Did people try to oppose these killers?  Did they try to stop them from committing these crimes?
@A.
To be frank, there was no opposition in Kibuye, not manifestly speaking.  There were attempts on the parts of some individuals, but there were no groups, if you will, of people to oppose these killers.  Some individuals tried to avoid the massacres taking place.  I can give you some names, if you wish.  I know the area commander of Kibuye attempted to put up a fight against these massacres.  Other people came to see me.  They asked for my advice on how to stop these.  They asked me to find a way to stop the massacres.  These people took initiative, if you will, to stop the massacres.  Earlier I spoke about a quarrel that I had at a roundabout with the killers.  And it was a fight.  I had to take refuge at the communal office because of that quarrel.  So there were some confrontations or opposition, but it wasn't manifestly organised, if you will, into groups.  It was just individual attempts, and isolated cases, if you will.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you for those clarifications, Mr. Witness.  Let's move on to another subject.  Did you ever go to the Gitaka centre in Gitesi in April, May or June in 1994?
@A.
Please repeat that question, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you ever go to the Gitaka centre in Gitesi secteur in April, May or June of 1994?
@A.
Yes, I went to that place; at least I went by that place.
@MR. BESNIER:
On which date?
@A.
In the early part of April, I went to Kirambo health centre, and I had to go through Gitaka centre, I had to go by it.  That was on the 13th of April 1994. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you go over there?
@A.
I had just been informed that part of -- a group of refugees who were at Kirambo had gathered.  I wanted to go and see if I could do something for them.
@MR. BESNIER:
What did you do in fact?
@A.
I did see that there were people there.  They were surrounded; they were from Gitesi in Kibuye secteur.  They had attempted to seek shelter at a parish there, a Presbyterian parish there.  I didn't have any means to protect them, and I decided to evacuate part of them, some of the children and elderly.  I took them in my car, and I brought them to Kibuye.  At that time we had set up a camp for displaced persons in Kibuye at the Gatwaro stadium.  And it was semi-guarded, so I brought them there hoping to get some help to keep them out of harm's way, if you will.  That is what I did.  Now, another part remained there.  I assigned a police officer to them to escort them to Kibuye.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, you are speaking about Gitaka.  Do you know a certain Joel Ndabukiye?
@A.
Yes, I know him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know about his role or any role he may have played during the genocide?
@A.
No, I didn't know him at that time.  We didn't live together; we didn't meet each other.  It was only during the Ndindabahizi trial that he was spoken of.  In other words, I don't know of his involvement in the genocide.
@MR. BESNIER:
What do you mean the Ndindabahizi trial, or case?
@A.
In the Ndindabahizi case there were people who I called, and one of them was this certain ********

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
You are talking about the arrest of *******; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, this is the case I'm talking about. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Between the 6th of April and the end of June 1994, did he go to your house to visit you?
@A.
No, I never had any visit from that person.  I never had a visit, private or otherwise, unless it was at ****.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you go to Gasharu at any other point between April and June 1994, aside from 13th of April as you already said?
@A.
Well, I know that I was in Gitesi secteur where Gasharu is, I was at the secteur office.  I organised a meeting there with the population in April, around the 30th, I believe, or on the 30th.  So I think it is the 30th of April, from the information that I have.  I organised a meeting of the population at that place.  So I was at Gasharu in Gitesi secteur where Gasharu is, but I don't really see clearly the exact borders, if you will, of the cellule, therefore I can't tell you if I was exactly there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, you were talking about a meeting of the population.  What was the objective of that meeting?
@A.
It was at the end of the month of April, the 30th, and, as you see, this is when the massacres were taking place, killings were taking place.  I was attempting to see if it was possible to stop the massacres.  It followed another communal meeting that I held on the 27th or 29th of April, where we tried to do everything possible to dissuade the population from perpetrating those massacres, to try to confront the criminals.  That was the first secteur meeting that I had in the secteurs.  I started with Gitesi secteur. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, those meetings, were they a success?
@A.
Well, in general the population was not entirely in agreement with the massacres.  People were opposed to them, but they didn't have support.  We didn't know what to do.  So in the meetings you would find people who supported us, who understood.  And furthermore, killers were asking for forgiveness and saying that they were guilty.
So, yes, it should be considered a success.  When you organise such a meeting, after that there are counter-meetings, groups of people who influence the population.  And there is the radio stations like the RTLM who continues with propaganda, and in the end the population changes opinion.  For those who were discouraged, think they have no support, and they find support in the RTLM and in other venues.  That was the situation that we observed.
So there wasn't a big success, because the massacres continued in some way, if you will, but by talking with the population and seeing their warm welcome and their enthusiasm, normally we should have achieved tangible results. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi spoken of in these meetings?
@A.
No.  There would be no reason to bring him up. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Where did you live before your transfer to Arusha?
@A.
This -- this trip, you mean?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.
@A.
Well, this goes to my identity.  ********************.
@MR. BESNIER:
What are you accused of, Witness?
@A.
I am being tried for genocide in general, for having organised and supervised it in the commune.  That is how things took place.  There are particular facts.  If I look at the charges described against me, I am being tried or prosecuted for complicity with Prefét Kayishema.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you plead guilty or not guilty?
@A.
Not guilty. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, sir, while you were detained were you ever questioned about Emmanuel Ndindabahizi by Rwandan judicial authorities?
@A.
I wasn't really questioned in that sense of the term, but I was brought into the prosecutor's office and they asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi and what I knew about him.  We had a discussion, and I think that was the only discussion that I had with the Rwandan judicial authorities on that subject.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you asked to confirm that that took place by writing a letter?
@A.
Yes, I was asked to write down what we had just discussed, and I sent a letter to that effect.
@MR. BESNIER:
With the assistance of the registry, I would like to give you a copy of that letter of which you speak so that you can recognise it for us.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would also like to give a copy of it to Their Honours.  This letter is also found in the bound document that we gave to the Tribunal following the testimony of Witness BN -- DN.  It is the letter in Kinyarwanda, but we have a translation in French.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have a copy of this letter with you now?  I have a copy in French for you.
Now, let's go through this very quickly.  Do you recognise the original copy of the letter you sent to the prosecutor of the republic in Kibuye?
@A.
Yes, the handwriting is mine.  I do recognise the letter as well.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the date on the letter?
@A.
The 26th of March 2001. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you write a letter on the 26th of March 2001 to the prosecutor of the republic?
@A.
Yes, it is this letter. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the subject of the letter?
@A.
It refers to the interview I had with the prosecutor, so this is a sequel to the interview we had concerning Ndindabahizi Emmanuel. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  We shall not read the letter, but I should like you to read out to the Court the penultimate paragraph of the letter. 
@A.
The penultimate paragraph begins with -- would you like me to read?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, the paragraph beginning with "Malgré que".  This is in Kinyarwanda.  Could you read it out in French?  That would be better for the Court.
@A.
"In spite of the fact that Ndindabahizi was the minister in the Abatabazi government, his family, which lived in the Gasharu cellule, had problems as serious as those of the families considered as traders or pro-FPR, and in the Gacaca organised by the detainees in the Kibuye prison, no detainee had said anything against Ndindabahizi".
@MR. BESNIER:
That is enough.  Now, in this document did you in any manner accuse Ndindabahizi at the time you wrote the letter?
@A.
No, I had made no accusations against Ndindabahizi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you very much, Witness.
Now, you are talking about the Gacaca organised by the detainees of the Kibuye prison.  What was that?
@A.
Well, this is a name we use -- commonly use at home; that is to say that at the very beginning when we started organising Gacacas, and that is even before the promulgation of the law, the organisation of Gacaca was attempted at the level of prisons.  It was organised at the level of prisons, and even after the Gacaca, the manner that Gacacas were organised at the level of cellules and secteurs according to the law, was supposed to be adapted to the various detainees.
Now, it was such practices as ordained by the law that we call the Gacacas organised by the detainees.  That is the form that is used, so that the tribunals, the courts, refer to it in their deliberations as it is reflected here. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Gacacas organised by the detainees; that is very clear.  Now, did anybody talk about Ndindabahizi in this Gacaca before the letter or after the letter?
@A.
Yes.  Before, at the time I was writing the letter, I didn't hear anything about Ndindabahizi so far as my co-detainees were concerned and at the Gacacas neither.  After that, I cannot tell you. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, one last thing concerning this letter.  Could you kindly refer to the fourth paragraph of page 2 in the French version, the one beginning with "Upon his arrival at the communal office" -- "A son arrivée au Bureau Communal"?  Could you kindly read that sentence, just the first sentence?
@A.
"Upon his arrival at the communal office he was able to address a farmer, I think, called *********for suspecting him of having been involved in that catastrophe". 
@MR. BESNIER:
So that as soon as the 26th of March the year 2001, you have pointed this out to the prosecutor of the republic; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President, I should like to pray that the original copy of this document be a Defence exhibit in French whilst we wait for the English translation, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is Defence Exhibit 41, is it?  Exhibit 41A for the Kinyarwandan, 41B for the French, and the English will be C one day.  And because the witness's name is mentioned, we will place it under seal, all these three versions of that exhibit.
$Exhibit Nos. D. 41A, D. 41B and D. 41C admitted, under seal)
@MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged.  I believe that the original is still with the witness, Mr. President.  Perhaps it should be taken back and handed over to registry. 
Registry, I still need your assistance.
Now I should like to hand over this piece of paper to the witness, and I should like the Court to read the name on this piece of paper, so that -- the Prosecution should also perhaps take note. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, look at the name on the document.  Don't pronounce it.  Do you know the person by whom this name is called?
@A.
Yes, I do. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see him in April 1994?
@A.
Yes, I saw him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you see him?
@A.
At my house. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he live in your house?  Has he lived in your house?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
At what period did he arrive at your house?
@A.
Well, he came precisely on the 18th, in the morning.  That was on the 18th April 1994.  That was the time he arrived at my house.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who brought him to your house?
@A.
It was a communal policeman, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you give any instructions to that police officer to bring that person to your house?
@A.
Yes, I had ordered or instructed him to look for that person because I knew that person was in Kibuye.  I knew about his movements and was to look for him, so that I had instructed the policeman to look for him. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And why did you want to find that person?
@A.
Well, his family, when he left his native area, that is Gasharu, they came and he remained at the Gatwaro stadium.  Part of his family, his wife and his children, came -- went to my house, that is my parents' house.  His wife -- well, he was a good brother of mine, so his wife is my sister.  So that once I -- when I went back home I saw that his wife and children were there, and they told me that he was at the stadium, so I looked for him, I began to look for him.  The fellow went twice, and it was after that that he was found.  This is how he came to my house. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now when you say he or the fellow --
@A.
I am referring to the person whose name is here on this piece of paper.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, let us summarise.  You are saying that that person is your brother-in-law; is that correct?
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you say --
@A.
No, I said that he was my brother-in-law  -- brother-in-law.  His wife is my sister.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was he threatened?
@A.
Yes, they were threatened.  This is why they left Gasharu.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why were they threatened?
@A.
He is Tutsi. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  How did you know where to find him?  How did you know where he was?
@A.
Well, his wife gave me the information that he was at the Gatwaro -- Gatwaro stadium.  I don't know the place, but I knew that he was there, so that I instructed the person to go and look for him at the Gatwaro stadium.  And I knew he was at the stadium, and that was where he was found. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Who did you ask to go and look for him?  The name, please?
@A.
No, it was a police officer that I knew who used to come to his secteur.  His name was Mbonigaba.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you spell it?
@A.
M-B-O-N-I -- Mboni -- G-A-B-A.  Mbonigaba.  It is G, not J. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, that police officer, was he able to find the person -- the person in question?
@A.
No, he went twice, because they were in and out, they were on -- out of duty.  He came the first time; he didn't find him.  When he came back from duty, I told him before he went home to go and find the person before going home.  So he went the second time and found him.  It was thus that that fellow was brought to my house. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Where precisely did he find that fellow?
@A.
The fact that he went to the stadium to look for him at the stadium, the very precise location I cannot tell you, but he found him at the stadium, got him from the stadium.  He got information from the people at the stadium, some people were called and they said "We're looking for so-and-so", and that person, the fellow, came, presented himself, and he was met.
@MR. BESNIER:
At what time did the person you were trying to protect arrive at your house?
@A.
Now, the policeman was off duty during the morning at seven, and I had asked him before going to pass by, so he passed by at 7 o'clock.  The precise hour I cannot tell, but when I came back home at about 11 a.m. the fellow was at my house, so it must have been around between 7 and 11 in the morning. 
@MR. BESNIER:
That is between 7 and 11, what day?
@A.
On the 18th April. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  That is very clear.  Now, when that fellow arrived at your house did the -- had the massacres begun at the stadium?
@A.
No, not yet.  The massacres started at around 3 p.m.  
@MR. BESNIER:
At that time, where was the family of the fellow?
@A.
The family stayed at my parents' house.  They didn't come to my house, they stayed at the parents' house.  They were separated; he was at my house and they were at my parents' house.
@MR. BESNIER:
How long did that fellow stay at your house?
@A.
Well, he stayed at my house up to the month of May.  In May the situation had changed.  There was a lot of danger, and I decided to send him out to Zaire.  He left between the 20th and the 25th.  At any rate, after the 25th he was no longer at my house.  I am talking about the 25th of May. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What did you do to send him over to Zaire?
@A.
We rented a canoe with other people.  He didn't go alone.  He left with other people, and I rented a canoe that took them to Idjwi. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Whilst that fellow was at your house, were you hiding him?
@A.
Absolutely.  If he is there at my house and we are being suspected of keeping Tutsi, could he just come in broad daylight?  No, he would try to hide from people, and he will hide.  During the day  he will behave as though he was a gardener in the garden, but he would avoid people.  And at the house he tried to hide himself somehow or the other, disguised.  He wasn't out there to be seen.  I was being attacked from keeping people or suspected of keeping people, so he had to hide.
@MR. BESNIER:
When you had visitors, did you invite him to take part in your discussions?
@A.
For what reason?
@MR. BESNIER:
Answer the question.
@A.
Why should I invite him?  To expose him and to get involved?  No.  To give me any contributions?  No.  I didn't think he was interested or should be interested or involved.  That would be a manner of exposing him, yet again. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Let us be more clear.  Did you invite him because you had visitors; yes or no? 
@A.
It's impossible, so the answer is no.  You invite a person because you need his or her contribution, and they'll probably have something to do with the discussions.  This is a person who was hiding, who was being sought after, and he had to be sent off to Zaire.  I cannot expose him.  He couldn't even leave the area.  In the sitting room he wouldn't show up.  He stayed in his room. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now during the time the person was at your house, did you receive *******?
@A.
No, I cannot see ****** coming to my house at that particular period, as far as I can remember. 
@MR. BESNIER:
During his hiding at your house, did you receive Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
I've told you that Ndindabahizi came in June.  That fellow had already left. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And generally speaking, did you receive visits from any authorities in the presence of that fellow?
@A.
Firstly, let me say that I don't know the authorities you're talking about, but talking about authorities in Kibuye, I didn't receive any authorities at my house.  We meet, we meet outside, not in my house.  And even if I received authorities, it wouldn't be upon my invitation, I believe.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you very much, Witness.  Only three questions left, Witness.  Did you know one Barayata?
@A.
Yes, I do. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Who is Barayata?
@A.
Barayata Anastase, you mean?  He was a police inspector that was at the office of the prosecutor of the republic in Kibuye. 
@MR. BESNIER:
During the events in April to June 1994, did you ever receive Barayata at home?
@A.
Barayata is a person who at a given period of time was working as a Gitesi police inspector.  He left Gitesi because he quarrelled about his behaviour, and I helped, and he was posted to the Kibuye prosecutor's office.  He was at the prosecutor's office, I had no special relationship with him.  My relationship with him was rather strained, so that we didn't have any contact as such, not to speak of visits.
@MR. BESNIER:
Penultimate question, Witness.  Why didn't you run away from Rwanda at the end of the war?
@A.
Why?
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you not run away from Rwanda?
@A.
Well, that question is a broad, broad question, but in a nutshell, in a nutshell, I would say that I had no reason to run away.  On the one hand the problems of security that one talked about were there.  It was during the period of Opération Turquoise, Operation Turquoise, during which French were involved, and it was necessary to resolve such security problems that were said to be there.
The other reason was that the very principle of running away and the operation that went as far as Congo, well, the principle I rejected.  The reasons for the operations, those were political reasons with which I disagreed.  I believe that these were the two reasons why I did not run away. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Last question.  We have talked about a political party to which you belonged in 1994.  If you do not remember the name of the party -- I mean, don't call the name of party, at any rate, just answer the question.  Do you remember, in 1994?
@A.
Yes, I know the party you are talking about. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was it very well implanted in Kibuye?
@A.
All the political parties, apart from the MRND and the MDR, had very good references.  All those tried to implant themselves in Kibuye.  But so far as the cadres are concerned, that is the top -- the people at the top, or from the top to the bottom, that party had many representatives.  We had a regional committee, very powerful; we had a communal committee.  In other words, we had everything, even to set up our service properly at grassroots level.  That was a party that was being set up, and it had its own trump cards. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Kibuye its main stronghold in Rwanda?
@A.
No, it was not Kibuye.

Could we, before we leave each other now, have a look at the week and the remaining witnesses so that we make sure that even if we stop a bit earlier this week, that we will still have full control over the schedule.
So, Mr. Besnier, if you would now lead us through the remainder of the Defence witnesses in view of the present situation, please.  So No. 14 is the one we have started.  Your estimated time for cross-examination, Mr. Phillips? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I defer to Mr. Kapaya on this one.  I would imagine about an hour and a half, something like that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
An hour and a half.  All right.  That implies that we can start on the second witness tomorrow.  And the next witness tomorrow will then be, please? 
@MR. BESNIER:
DA; No. 9.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that a long witness? 
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President.  One hour, one hour and 15 minutes, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And after DA, follows? 
@MR. BESNIER:
DF; approximately one hour 30 minutes in examination in-chief.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And are you then moving on to DP and DQ? 
@MR. BESNIER:
DP, DQ; we estimate one hour 30 minutes for each one of these witnesses, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that will actually bring us to the end of this week's witnesses, won't it? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But if that is the case, we can see that even if the Chamber closes down for the day a bit earlier this week, we will still have no problems in finalising the available witnesses.  And then we are aware of the situation with the three remaining ones, that is DD, the expert and the Accused.  Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, that was helpful.
We will meet tomorrow then at 2 o'clock.

Yes, good afternoon, Mr. President.

Did we hear the witness's response into channel one?  
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I am sorry; I believed he said it in English that's why I didn't interpret it, but you're probably on a different channel. Indeed, he said, "Good afternoon".

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.

Good afternoon.

@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you tell us when you were arrested for the offences for which you are now detained?
@A.
I was arrested on ***********************.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Has trial in your case started, or it has not?
@A.
No.  It's still underway.  It began in 19 -- in 2002.  I'm sorry, 2002.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yesterday, in the course of your testimony you alluded to a meeting that was held in Kibuye on the 3rd of May '94; do you recall that?
@A.
Yes, I remember that.
@MR. KAPAYA:
This is a meeting you testified to in the Niyitegeka case as well, did you not?
@A.
That is true.
@MR. KAPAYA:
In fact, you had four days testimony in the Niyitegeka case; that is the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th of June 2002 was centred almost exclusively on this meeting; was it not?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And are you aware also that the Trial Chamber was very impressed in its judgment about your testimony in the Niyitegeka case; are you aware of that?
@A.
That, I did not know.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And are you aware, also, that the Trial Chamber found you in a better position than an expert to interpret the meaning of words used by the radio speakers at that meeting?  Are you aware of that?
@A.
No, that I didn't know either.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So, if you read paragraphs 247 and 249 of that judgment, you will see those findings.  Now, were you present at that meeting from the beginning to the end?
@A.
Yes, I was there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And that meeting was called by the prime minister; is that so?
@A.
The meeting was called by the prefét, but he said that it would be chaired, indeed, by the prime minister.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Would you say that the meeting was well attended?
@A.
Yes, there were many people there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can you estimate about how many people attended that meeting?
@A.
Well, it would be difficult to give you a number, but I think that that question was put to me in the affair I spoke about earlier.  But the room that we're in, in any case, was full, so I would say 100 or so people.  The room was full, so I would say 100 or so, but I don't know the exact capacity of that room.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, the prime minister, did he come with other people from Kigali?
@A.
Yes, he came with a strong delegation and I gave some names, but there were other people who I did not know.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi part of the PM's delegation?
@A.
Yes, he was there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, was that meeting broadcast on Radio Rwanda?
@A.
Personally, I listened to the entire taping on Radio Rwanda, so, indeed, it was broadcast.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Would you be in a position to know whether it was broadcast simultaneously as it was taking part, or it was broadcast a few days later?
@A.
Well, if it was simultaneous, I wouldn't know because I was in the room itself.  All that I can confirm is that I listened to a broadcasted tape on Radio Rwanda, so obviously that was afterward.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, can you help us with the agenda?  What was the agenda of that meeting?
@A.
On the invitation it said it was a security meeting.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And did you stay at the meeting from start to finish, or you left before it ended?
@A.
That is correct.  I was there from beginning to end.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, sir, did you see any Tutsi at that meeting, any Tutsi you know?
@A.
No.  The meeting was on the 3rd of May and, as we said before, there were massacres.  Even in April, there were massacres, and those massacres targeted mostly Tutsi persons, so those persons could not have been there.  So, if that meeting took place, it means that it was a hidden, or secret, rather, meeting.  So, no, in answer to your question, I did not see any.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Any why, sir, to your knowledge, were Tutsi sought after in this period?
@A.
They were targeted.  What people were saying at that time was that they were considered as accomplices of the RPF.  It was a way of targeting them and the members of the RPF -- as members of the RPF.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, the first person to speak at that meeting was the préfet; do you recall that?
@A.
I believe so.  I do believe so.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And the theme of his speech was that the préfecture, Kibuye préfecture supported wholeheartedly the interim government; do you recall him saying that?
@A.
Well, I believe that first he spoke of the security situation in the préfecture, and that was mostly what he spoke of.  If he said that all of the population was behind the government, it's possible, but I cannot confirm that for you here.  I don't have the minutes, if you will, to that meeting.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And do you recall how he described the security situation in Kibuye préfecture?
@A.
I can't give you the details of his speech, but the general idea was that in Kibuye préfecture, the situation was going to get better.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, following Mr. Kayishema, it was the prime minister who took up the podium.  Now, the theme of the prime minister's speech was security, was it not?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, he spoke about the needs to review the Arusha Accords and to increase the influence of the Rwandan government in those Accords; did you hear him say that?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
He also spoke about the ability of the interim government to meet the Inkotanyi and elect the previous or the Habyarimana government; did you hear him talk about that?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
He also asked the people to be vigilant against the infiltrators who he described as Inkotanyi; did you hear that?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, sir, did you understand Inkotanyi, accomplice, or enemy to cover the Tutsi in general.  Was that your understanding of those terms?
@A.
I didn't see it like that personally, but according to what was being said at the time, in general, what people were saying was that, indeed, but my personal opinion was not that.  But within the population, the general idea, and even of the assembly, I think, it was indeed that idea.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What you're saying, Mr. Witness, is that you understood that Rwandans in general would interpret the word "Inkotanyi" to refer to all Tutsi who inhabited Rwanda, and who were outside.  Is that what you're saying?
@A.
Yes, that's what I said, but I specified that was a general idea, that doesn't include everyone, and it certainly does not include me.  That is not how I saw things, but that was the general idea, that was what was being heard.  That is what people in general understood by -- in that vocabulary.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Witness, you are taking some -- you're going -- it pays to distance yourself from what the general population think.  Could you tell us what you understood -- what you personally understood those words to mean?
@A.
Inkotanyi, normally, is the RPF with its armed wing, and they were fighting on the war front.  That's what I understand by Inkotanyi.  Others, you don't call them Inkotanyi.  Those who were targeted within were more accomplices of the Inkotanyi, but not Inkotanyi.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Very well.  To your knowledge, there were no Inkotanyi in Kibuye as of 3rd May '94; is that correct?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Inkotanyi being used in the significance, RPF soldiers?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@THE WITNESS:
Right.  As I said in the previous trial, there were no Inkotanyi in Kibuye.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
But at that meeting some people, particularly the bourgmestres of Gisovu, Gishyita, raised issues pertaining to - raised complaints about RPF attacks in Bisesero; did they not?
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have an objection, an objection to this question.  I did not, in my examination-in-chief, talk about what was said at that meeting of 3rd May.  I didn't speak of it at all.  Furthermore, everything regarding that meeting of 3 May was withdrawn from the indictment; it was Article 24 in the indictment.  Mr. Ndindabahizi is not being indicted for participating in that meeting.  We've been speaking about it for 20 minutes.  I did not bring up this issue in my examination-in-chief, and I think that the Prosecutor would do well to move on to a new subject.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, please.  Mr. Kapaya.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the 3rd of May meeting was a subject of a long discussion by our expert Alison Des Forges and it is contained in her expert report. 
Secondly, this very witness was present at that meeting and as we will go further, Your Honour, it will show that even the Accused person was present at that meeting, so we will tie up what the prime minister said and what the -- our expert says in the general context of proof of our case.  So, it is my humble submission, Your Honour, that this meeting is very relevant to our case and, actually, the witness alluded to it in his testimony, and we said, further, under Rule 90(G) a party cross-examining a witness has a (inaudible) or right to raise issues which go to the credibility of the witness, and also to issues that advance the case of that party.  So, for those reasons, Your Honour, I submit that Mr. Besnier's objection should be overruled.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine.  Mr. Kapaya, you can proceed.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We grant.  And the exception under the relevant Rule, having heard your explanations, bearing in mind, as you said, that this is time consuming, but something may come up.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
So, Mr. Witness, my question was that you have testified that as of 3rd May '94, there were no Inkotanyi or RPF soldiers in Kibuye, but some bourgmestres raised the issue that there were attacks in the Bisesero area made by RPF soldiers.  Now, how do you explain this phenomenon, if you can call it that?
@A.
It is difficult for me to explain what people said, what someone else said, especially the Gisovu and Gishyita bourgmestres.  There were people who were extremists, and who talk of Tutsi and Inkotanyi in one breath.  In general, the terms that were used, he spoke of Inkotanyi in Gishyita, perhaps in order to give more strength to his argument to justify what happened in Gishyita, but what was really said, or used, rather, was accomplices, but I'm sure in Gishyita there were no Inkotanyi.  So, if he spoke of Inkotanyi in Gishyita, there were none; and I even spoke of this in the trial that you mentioned earlier.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So briefly, when those two bourgmestres referred to Inkotanyi in Bisesero, what they were referring to actually were Tutsi, is that not so; Tutsi civilians?
@A.
That is how I see things. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
So when Mr. Kambanda made up that speech, he was aware that killings had occurred in Kibuye, many killings had occurred in Kibuye at the Catholic church, the Home St-Jean, and at Mugonero Hospital, Mubuga, Nyange, and like places, was he not? 
@A.
That is correct. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
He was also aware that the killings in many of these places involved not only civilians but gendarmes and other members of the armed forces; is that correct? 
@A.
The details of how those crimes were committed were not discussed during that meeting, but since the intelligence services gave him information, from that I understand that he must have been in position to know exactly what happened and who committed exactly those crimes. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did he make any reference to those killings?  Did he commission, for instance, anybody, say the bourgmestres or the préfet, to find out who was responsible for the killings in those places?  Did he do that?  Did he mention that? 
@A.
No, he did not do that.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So even after that meeting, would you say that the killings stopped in Kibuye, after the 3rd of May?  All right, let me put it this way:  Even after the 3rd of May, killings did not stop in Kibuye, did they? 
@A.
That is correct. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
For instance, Tutsi survivors at the Kibuye hostel were killed after the 3rd of May, were they not? 
@A.
That is true.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Children who were at the hostel, Kibuye hostel were also killed around the 4th or 5th of May?
@A.
Yes, that's correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
$Microphone not activated) ...at the Gasharu cellule, were they not?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Prosecutor repeat the name of the cellule?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Gasharu, G-A-S-H-A-R-U, Gasharu cellule. 
@THE WITNESS:
Gasharu, what secteur is that in? 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
It's in the Gitesi secteur.  Gasharu is in Gitesi secteur. 
@A.
No -- well, yes.  Now I see where it is.  Gasharu in Gitesi, there were not massacres before the meeting -- there before the meeting of the 3rd.  What I was able to observe is that the massacres there took place well before.  At the end of April I held a meeting to try to improve the situation, and so those massacres took place well before the 3rd of May in that place. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that after 3rd of May, no Tutsi were killed in Gasharu cellule? 
@A.
No, I can't specifically mention Gasharu.  What I can say is that massacres didn't necessarily stop after the meeting or because of the meeting of the 3rd of May. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  There were large-scale attacks on the 13th and the 14th of May at Muyiro (phonetic) in Bisesero, right? 
@A.
Where? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Muyiro.
@A.
Can you specify where, Counsel? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
I said in Muyiro hill in Bisesero area.  Did you hear of large-scale killings of many Tutsi who were seeking refuge in those hills on the 13th and 14th of May? 
@A.
That I don't know.  I only know that in Bisesero, the massacres did not stop, but I don't know exactly which region or which hills.  But in general, the massacres in Bisesero that began in April continued on through May and June; they did not stop. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And in fact, many of the leaders who attended the 3rd of May meeting took part in the Bisesero attacks, did they not, to your knowledge? 
@A.
According to the Gishyita and Gisovu bourgmestres' testimony, it proves that they participated.  Their statements proved that they took part. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
People like Kayishema, Musema, Ntakirutimana, we talked about at that meeting, were convicted of taking part in the attacks in Bisesero.  Have you heard of that? 
@A.
I've just heard about it, yeah, from you. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, the other speaker at that meeting was Mr. Ndindabahizi; is that so? 
@A.
Yes, he did before. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
And he spoke on behalf of the PSD party, did he not? 
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke basically on the relationship between the RPF and the PSD.  Do you recall that? 
@A.
Yes, sir. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Could you tell us, Mr. Witness, what precisely Mr. Ndindabahizi said, if you can recall? 
@A.
Yes.  To begin with, to give you a bird's eye view of the statement, at this time I cannot say -- I cannot confirm that it was a message from the PSD or just a stance he was listing, vis-à-vis an intervention just made before him by one of the participants.  I do remember that there was someone that was at the meeting that raised a question that tended to point out the PSD as an RPF agent, and that the people -- members of that party were not credible.  That was a question they put to the prime minister, and I don't know whether it was because of that question that he took the floor.  But Ndindabahizi did take the floor to show and justify that the PSD was not an RPF agent, and that the members of the PSD should not be considered as RPF accomplices, and that they are -- they were in the government, just like the others, who were not RPF.  It was along those lines that I understood his statement, and it was thus that I could interpret what he said. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
You've made -- you made a statement to ICTR investigators on the 15th and 16th of May '96, did you not?  Do you recall that?  Do you recall making such a statement? 
@A.
Could you show me that statement? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, sir, have you got that statement I was referring to? 
@A.
Yes, the document is before me here. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
This is a statement -- this is a statement you made to ICTR investigators; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, could you kindly turn to page 6 of that statement, on the penultimate paragraph, the second paragraph from the bottom.  Have you got it?
@A.
Yes, I can see it.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, it says there, this is what you said, and I read, "In the name of PSD, a speech was made by Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, the minister of finance.  He said that his party used to be pro-RPF, but now they were supporting the government in its policy." 
Is that what you said, Mr. Witness? 
@A.
Yes, I can see this statement. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
So, Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech went further than just distancing the PSD from the RPF but supporting the interim government.  Isn't that a reasonable construction of your statement? 
@A.
Well, if you take these two lines, just these two lines that I said to the investigators, it could be interpreted in that manner. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
I now --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But are these two lines correct, Mr. Witness?  Is this your view?  Is it correct? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.  The issue is when we were answering questions and when we were summarising the statements made, those lines were included.  They were recorded in the statements, but they do not totally reflect my understanding of the statement made by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. 
If I were to explain this, sir, I do remember that he was there.  There was a statement made by Jean Rwabukwisi, who attacked the party openly, and its members, at the meeting, and that had to be dealt with.  He therefore talked about the PSD that was considered as pro-RPF, but that they did not attack the government.  That means that they were not pro-RPF. 
So this is the manner in which I wanted to put it.  It was a position typed on a statement that was made at that meeting. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that statement was made by whom, please, if you could just repeat.  This is a reaction to a statement made by someone else.  Who was that someone else, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, the name was one of the participants in the meeting, Rwabukwisi, Jean.  He is a businessman who stood up and pointed at the PSD party and its members as not being credible, and that -- that the RPF was still present at the conference, thanks to the PSD.  So that's -- in reacting to that statement, Ndindabahizi took the floor.  This is why (sic) I interpret his intervention. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if you could have this name spelled, please, of this other person who made the initial observation, please. 
@THE WITNESS:
R-W-A-B-U-K-W-I-S-I, Rwabukwisi, first name Jean, who was also at that meeting, sir. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
$Microphone not activated) ... Mr. Ndindabahizi, then? 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, that is the question mark and the reservation I formulated.  Now, during that meeting, if I remember what happened, there are some things I can remember.  I do remember this person speaking, pointing at the PSD and its members.  I do remember Ndindabahizi's statement.  I am saying that I do not quite remember whether he made a statement as a specific statement of the PSD, or whether he was reacting to that question.  But in my mind, in fact, what I understand, I believe that it was in reaction to that statement.  This is why I am saying that he took the floor and explained PSD's position vis-à-vis that person that had made the statement and vis-à-vis the government in place. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
According to you, Mr. Rwabukwisi made a speech during that meeting or had an intervention during that meeting. 
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You are not absolutely certain as to when he made that intervention? 
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  That is what I wanted to say, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, sir, let me divide my question into bite-sized chunks.  One, did Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech, was it -- was Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech, did it consist entirely of reactions to people's questions, or did he make a speech on behalf of the PSD, to begin with? 
@A.
Yes, I do understand the question.  Now, I cannot at this time confirm that he made a statement that was prepared beforehand to be made in public.  This is why -- this is what I said in my reservation concerning the statement I made.  But it is a matter of fact that he took the floor.  He took the floor at one particular time to react, and I believe that he was reacting to a question that was raised. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Sir, I have with me here the minutes of that meeting.  They've been produced here.  They've been tendered in this Tribunal as Prosecution Exhibit P. 30.

Now, that document is a summary, it contains the minutes of the meeting of that day. It's in French, English, and Kinyarwanda.  It is also a list of the participants.  Now, would you refer now to Mr. Ndindabahizi's statements and tell us -- Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech, any language you prefer.  It's on page 12 on the English version of the minutes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want the witness to find this speech as such?  Do you want the witness to find the speech of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@MR KAPAYA: 
Yes, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you found it, Mr. Witness, in any language?  You say that it was page 12 in the English one? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it's page 12, Your Honour, in the English, at tab 3.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's also 12 in the French, if you prefer that one, Mr. Witness.  
The K-number of the French version, Mr. Witness, would that assist you?  If you see the K-number on the top of the pages, it is K0246612.  That's where the French version of Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech starts.  Have you found it?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I've found it.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
There are about ten points -- ten paragraphs attributed to the speech Mr. Ndindabahizi made.  Have you seen them?
@A.
Yes, I can see it.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Would you say that the issues contained in these ten paragraphs were made in response to the question raised by Mr. Rabou Kizi, or Rabou something?
@MR. BESNIER:
Objection.  Firstly, the witness should be asked whether he remembers whether Ndindabahizi talked about all these ten paragraphs.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will go step by step.  Now you have found the speech from page 12 onwards, haven't you?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you glance through these few pages, do you recognize the substance as you remember it when you were there?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, perhaps I should read the paragraph in the record and request the witness to make a comment on those paragraphs.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That is an alternative way.  Let's just see whether he is through now because this is actually less than two pages, so since we have been waiting now for a little bit of time, he can just be given the time to finish that exercise and then you can start with your method afterwards. 
Are you through with these two pages now, Mr. Witness?  Have you glanced through them?
@THE WITNESS:
No, not yet, Mr. President.  
I have run through it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We realise, all of us, that it's difficult to approach such a document on the spur of the moment.  Now, Mr Kapaya is going to go paragraph by paragraph and ask for your comments.  
Please go ahead.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
On page 12, Mr. Witness, there is the paragraph which is, "The RPF claimed that the Rwandan Government had prevented them from returning to their mother-land.  It has now become clear that this is a lie because Rwanda has never prevented them from returning home.  The RPF also claimed that there is no democracy and when Rwanda accepted to organize elections so that the will of the majority may be shown through democracy, the RPF was at a loss."  
What do you say to that paragraph?
@A.
You want my opinion as to whether the text is correct or not?  I do not know what you want from me.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I want from you to explain faithfully whether you heard something akin to this spoken by Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Secondly, I want you to tell this Tribunal whether he spoke it as just a PSD representative or in response to a question from a member attending that meeting?
@A.
Is it possible to find in this passage all the statements, Raubo Kizi's and the others?  I see that it's a message, but that was a reaction of one of the participants that pointed to the PSD.  I'm wondering whether the statement of that person is in the summary, too -- in the minutes, too. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe we will come to that, but do you want to pursue this point by point first?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  That is what I intended to do.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then we will look at other parts of this document later on.  So this, you say -- this is a speech, you say.
@THE WITNESS:
That's correct.  Now, so far as the occasion of the statement is concerned, I do not know whether it is a reaction to an intervention or simply a message.  All I know is that Ndindabahizi spoke and that a question was raised along those lines.  This is all I can say.  
Now, as to the contents of the context of the first paragraph, that is what I said, because I confirm that at his intervention he wanted to show that the PSD was not an accomplice of the RPF and it was the government and that was a testament to the fact that it was not of the RPF, so that that is the line along which I wanted to interpret the statement he had made.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q. 	The second paragraph reads, "The RPF had intended to reject negotiations.  It resumed hostilities after killing the President of the Republic.  Documents were found with its members which showed how the war in 1993 and that of early 1994 were planned.  At that time, we Rwandans had put our hopes in the Arusha Peace Accords, they were planning and preparing a war to exterminate us."  
Did he or did he not say this?
@A.
I say that this is a continuation of the first paragraph and I believe that the one who summarised the statement did not imagine the words.  It is a summary made by somebody, and I cannot call that into question as to what he has written, this person who made a summary.
@MR. KAPAYA:
The third one reads, "They secured accomplices in the main political parties and caused these parties to split.  It has become clear that the RPF never wanted power sharing but rather wanted all the power for itself.  During war preparations, the combatants had taken up war hero names so that outsiders would not recognize them if they called each other." 
Did he say this, the reference to Inkotanyi?
@A.
What does panégyrique in French mean?  This is part of the statement.  It is a part of a statement that describes the RPF, and eliciting as tenants vis-a-vis the  RPF.  I don't know whether I can say, or if he said or he did not say.  All I can say is that this is an excerpt of his statement.  That is all.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay.  The third one reads, "The RPF wanted the Rwanda government to remain paralysed from December 1993 up to the time when it would seize power.  In the meantime however, it would be making preparations to take over the country.  This became clear through the previous government."  
Mr. Witness, did Mr. Ndindabahizi say or did he not say these words, and, if so, in what context?  If you can recall, tell us you recall; if you don't, say you don't.
@A.
Well, so far as I'm concerned, the answer is the same as to the one I offered earlier on concerning the other paragraphs.  This is a political speech and whether they are political statements by Ndindabahizi, I do not have the entire texts with me or in my head.  All that I can say is that he made a statement, the statements which I commented on, and this is only a summary of a statement made in the course of the discussions that took place at a meeting and, of course, it is part and parcel of the statement, so that I'm not denying that he did not make a statement in the course of that meeting.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But do you remember actually now what he said, Mr. Witness?  When the Prosecutor is now putting these sections to you, he wants to know whether he said it or not.  That is the first issue, and are you able to remember whether he said it or not?
@THE WITNESS:
Sentence per sentence? Is that what you mean, Mr. President?  It's a bit difficult for me.  Do you mean sentence per sentence if this indeed was the statement of someone?  That seems difficult, but if you mean the general idea that came out of it, to say that it was the exact statement he made when this is a summary, I don't know, but I do know that this was broadcast over radio.  You could even see tapes that you probably have, console tapes that you probably have, but to confirm whether or not this summary is complete and whether or not there are mistakes, I'm not in a position to guarantee that.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
In the course of his speech, did Mr. Ndindabahizi say something along these lines, the fourth paragraph: "No Rwandan leader will ever again be negligent.  If there had been no accomplices among Rwandan leaders and if they had been Interahamwe, Rwanda would not have fallen so low"?
Do you recall him saying anything along those lines?
@A.
Yes, he said such things.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Then it reads, "It is no longer a secret, as evidenced by retrieved documents, that the RPF had soldiers in each Commune whose objective was to exterminate us one day."  
Did he say this?
@A.
That I cannot guarantee.  First, there were no soldiers in Gitesi, they were not in Kibuye, no.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Another summary reads, "What happened, happened, but no leader will ever work for the enemy again."  
Did he say that?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And by this statement, he meant that if the PSD was associating with RPF, it would not associate with RPF again, right?  Or do you have a different interpretation?
@A.
Yes, that's true.
@MR. KAPAYA:
The other paragraph reads, "The RPF has now become too confident about its strength.  It has openly stated that it wants a Ministry for Tutsis, that of Justice.  He called upon the PSD party members to join others in fighting for the country's security, even if many accomplices were from their party.  This was also the case in many other parties, which did not mean that these parties would stop working.  He called upon Abakombozi, PSD party members, to register for civil defence in big numbers."  
Do you recall that summary?
@A.
First, he did speak of accomplices within the party.  That the youth wing would join the civil defence, that, too, he underscored.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And finally, it reads -- the statement is, "In ending the PSD party's message, Minister Ndindabahizi called upon members of the population to point out early enough any leader who might lead them astray because it was now clear which side each of them supported, between the RPF and the Rwandan people's government."  
Did he say that or did he not say it?
@A.
In fact, what is underscored here, to denounce authorities who were responsible, that is why I was against this.  This is a reaction to a question that was asked.  The question underscored this aspect, that there were authorities who were not credible, who were not good people within the population.
@MR. KAPAYA:
The message here is that the PSD -- the PSD position was clear between the RPF and the interim government, so is this a message that the PSD was supporting the Rwandan government -- the interim government, actually?
@A.
No, to say that the PSD -- this PSD situation with regard to the RPF is clear, I don't agree.  The PSD never worked for the RPF as the population said it did.  However, it is true this position was similar than the RPF.  That's why people said that the PSD was working for the RPF, but by saying that they support the transitional government, that is what he wanted to say, by saying that they are in the government, they work in the Abatabazi government.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So the message is that formerly the RPF supported -- the PSD supported the RPF, but now it's changed its position, it's not supporting the RPF government, isn't that the position?
@A.
There is a position that I don't understand.  There is one position and name you give to one party, and that I explained.  The party was in the government even before the RPF came into the country, but the people called them accomplices.  What I am sure of -- and I was a member of the party -- is that we did not work for the RPF, but we were assimilated as doing so.  We always worked in the government within the country.  That is why that he takes this position, to show that the RPF, and not PSD members, are working for -- as accomplices of the RPF.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, we shouldn't spend too much time on this issue because I think it's clear from this statement you say, you end your statement in -- you met with investigators on the 10th and 16th of May, that Mr. Ndindabahizi made it quite clear that formerly the government, the PSD was pro-RPF, but now it was supporting the interim government and its policies.  Is that not what you summarise is what Mr. Ndindabahizi said at that meeting?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you notice the question just posed?  The Prosecutor is now going back to your statement and he's putting that sentence to you.
@THE WITNESS:
Well, the summary that I have here seems to take up what is in the summary or is contained in the summary, that's correct.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay, Mr. Witness.  Now let's move to 16th of May.  Do you recall that there was a meeting on the 16th of May in Kibuye?
@MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  We are no longer speaking about the report of Alison Des Forges.  We have spent an hour and 15 minutes on the May 3rd meeting, and now we are speaking of the 16 May meeting which I did not mention at all in my examination-in-chief.  We have already spoken for long enough about issues that were not brought up in my examination-in- chief, so I now figure it is time we go to issues brought up in my examination- in-chief, and not on these other issues.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Comment, Mr. Kapaya. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, this matter relates to credibility of the witness.  It is contained in the witness statement, and under Rule 90(E) I'm entitled to ask questions of this nature.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are now moving from page 6 to 7 of his witness statement, isn't that so, this declaration to investigators?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But was Mr. Ndindabahizi present during the meeting on 16th of May, Mr. Kapaya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that is what I'm interested in in asking these particular questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, why don't you ask that question?  It's a leave question, and its credibility, but we see the need now to go to the main portions of the examination-in-chief. 
Did you get the question from the Prosecutor, Mr. Witness?  We are now dealing with the 16th of May meeting briefly.  So what is your question?
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, did you attend that meeting?
@A.
I was there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was this a prefét security meeting and that representatives of various political parties were required to attend?
@A.
Yes, they were invited all the way to the level of representatives of the prefécture.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What was the purpose of that committee?
@A.
It was a visit of the head of state at the time who visited the prefécture.  It convened a number of people, especially heads of sections, divisions, and bourgmestre and people -- authorities in the prefécture, so it was a meeting with the head of state.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did the president come with Mr. Ndindabahizi as Minister or representative of the PSD?
@A.
If my memory serves me well, I did not see Ndindabahizi there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
You are saying he could or could not have been at that meeting?
@A.
I'm saying that if my memory serves me well, I did not see Ndindabahizi in that meeting, nor did I ever say so in any investigation or interview that I had with the investigators.
@MR. KAPAYA:
The president at that meeting said that the prefécture of Kibuye had done very well and there were no problems concerning security.  You heard that, did you not?
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, objection.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't need to hear you on that, Mr. Besnier.  Now I don't see any need to go on, Mr. Kapaya.  You have to explain that, because now the witness has said that he can't remember that the Accused was there.  Why do you want to go on?  One thing is credibility, but what is the relevance to the case now? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
The relevance, Your Honour, is that the person who I'm asking the witness to respond to, if it was the president of the republic and whatever he said represented policy of the government generally.  Now, the government is one where Mr. Ndindabahizi and this witness, and -- sorry, Mr. Ndindabahizi said, so it's important to explain the policy in which the accused person said it, and the question actually pertains to any issue which -- when we get the witness's response, you will see the relevance of it, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence.  
@MR. BESNIER:
Does the Prosecutor wish to ask the witness to speculate about Ndindabahizi's reactions to a meeting that he wasn't at, or is the witness being asked to know whether or not, in his opinion, Sindikubwabo's words committed all members of the government?  Can we have a more precise question then?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that is a question or matter of interpretation as to whether what was said there binds everybody, but what I want to know from the witness is the interpretation of those very words the president used, what they mean to the people who attended there, and this, as I say, is relevant in explaining the policy the government pursued.  Actually, Your Honour, it's the very last sentence in the witness's summary.  It explains everything there, what the witness understood by those words to mean in the statement.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In the statement to investigators?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In the other case?
@MR. KAPAYA:
It's in this case, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The 15th and 16th of May statement, is that the one you are referring to?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You are on the borderline here, Mr Kapaya, but the question is allowed.  You were just allowed to ask the question. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, the president said at that meeting that you had -- the prefécture of Kibuye had done very well and that there was no problem of security.  Now, what do you understand those words to mean?  That was my question.
@A.
What I know is that the president did speak in those terms.  We saw what happened at Kibuye.  From that we deduced that he was congratulating the population of Kibuye for all of the crimes that had taken place in that place.
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Now let's move to another area.  
Yesterday you testified about roadblocks, do you recall that?  Now, do you say that the local government and central government authorities were not responsible for the erection of roadblocks?  Did you say that?
@A.
Yes, that is what I said.  I said that they were not responsible for erecting the roadblocks in the sense that no orders were given, at least on a local level, to that effect to erect roadblocks.  No monitoring was done to see how it was being conducted.  What we do know, however, is that those roadblocks were being manned by authorities either of the national or local level, so it's part of the propaganda that was going on during that period.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, were roadblocks not part and parcel of the civil defence programme?
@A.
No, it's completely different.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What did you say, Mr. Witness?
@A.
It's different.
@MR. KAPAYA:
On 11th of April '94, do you recall holding a meeting with consiellers -- sorry, let me rephrase this question.  
On 11th of April, do you recall attending a meeting with conseillers in Gitesi?
@A.
Yes, I remember that meeting. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Do you recall that at that meeting the issue of security was raised and it was decided that roadblocks should be erected between sectors in order to control the population?
@A.
No, no decision to that effect was taken.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, I require you to consider a document and ask you to look at paragraphs 1, 2, 3 -- the paragraphs I have marked here, and tell me whether they don't refer to the thing I'm alluding to.  Unfortunately, it is in our language?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you be able to introduce this document briefly, Mr Kapaya?  This is a letter dated 13th April 1994.
@MR. KAPAYA:
It contains minutes, Your Honour.  It is a forwarding letter.  The offer is forwarding the minutes of the meeting to somebody.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but what you say is here comes a letter dated 13th of April 1994 and, as an appendix, there are minutes of something.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And these are minutes from a meeting of 11th of April 1994 and you only have it in Kinyarwanda.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That's right, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you know what is in there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I do, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How should we know?  You are going to read it out?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I think that is the best procedure.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there no translation in English and French in the Tribunal?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, we don't have a translation of this document here. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Would it be possible for the interpreters to have a copy of this document? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, on the first page there -- we don't have it available -- but isn't this a letter in Kinyarwanda dated 13th April 1994?  Now, do you recognize the signature at the bottom of the first page there of the letter, itself?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I recognize this document, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there is an appendix annexed to that document, and you want the witness to look at page -
@MR. KAPAYA:
The parts I have noted, Your Honour, and I wanted him just to read those parts.  He can read it aloud so it is interpreted and goes on the record.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I just wanted to find out whose signature it is that he recognized on that document.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Whose signature is it, Mr. Witness, on the letter?
@THE WITNESS:
It is my signature, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@THE WITNESS: 
I don't have the passages, Prosecutor, that you indicated to me.  Which passages?
Okay.  Well, I shall read the text as a whole.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Just the minutes, the minutes, not the covering letter.
@A.
No, I'm going to read the passages you indicated.  It is on page 3, the last part of the page.  
"The meeting noted that in general there was suspicion among the ethnic groups because of criminal acts committed in the neighbouring communes of Gitesi, to the extent that the Gitesi commune, itself, was affected by such criminal acts.  
Secondly, the meeting took note of the fact that the bourgmestre, in seeking assistance and securing assistance from the gendarmerie and the communal police force members, may continue to intervene wherever the situation became difficult, so that if any individual were to be arrested because of such acts, that that individual be severely punished.  
Thirdly, the meeting noted that each conseiller in his or her sector should continue to proffer counsel for the purpose of preventing criminal acts.  
4.  The meeting noted that the curfew instituted as from 18 hours to 06 hours in the morning was necessary.  During that period, on the thoroughfares that lead to the city, roadblocks should be erected, night patrols within the city must be ensured by the gendarme, but in the rural areas where such patrols had already begun and where people are co-operating without any problems, that night patrols must continue."
Now, will I go on? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now I move to another area.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, here reference is made to the erection of roadblocks in what you just read out, and we had the impression, listening to you a couple of minutes ago, that there were no roadblocks erected at the local level.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were none, sir, so that I believe that in this passage we are talking about roadblocks that lead to the city.  In other words, we should control, monitor the movement of people going into town so that the propaganda -- I mean, the propaganda comes in force so that movement towards the city should be monitored, so that these roadblocks are gendarmerie roadblocks.  This is why we are saying that the patrols are not initiated by the population, but rather by the gendarmerie.  This is what came out of the meeting of the 11th.  There were no roadblocks in any sectours in the countryside.  This is what I could say concerning the question put to me.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
The question that I had put to you, Mr. Witness, was whether roadblocks were not part and parcel of the civil defence programme, that is the defence that people were asked by authorities to observe, themselves.  Now, in the course of doing that, they were required to build roadblocks.  Now, were roadblocks not within the sanction of the state, the authority as part and parcel of the civil defence programme?
@A.
Very well, very well.  Now, let me try and answer that question, Mr. President.  Now, that was the situation prevailing as at 11th of April that emanated from the security situation prevailing in the commune.  The security situation is reflected in this resumè, this summary, the preamble section in the body of the text.  Of course, the entire text is not translated, but all the stages are reflected.  
Now, these are only the conclusions adopted by the assembly in view of the situation that obtained.  Now, there was a civil defence programme that was instituted, recommended by the government, and that civil defence programme was as a result of instructions from the prime minister, who wrote the instructions and communicated them.  Now, if you look at the meeting of 3rd of May, it was there that the idea of a civil defence program was communicated.  It was at that time that the idea was communicated.  
Now, if you want to link the fact of the 11th of April and 3rd of May, I believe that they are not related.  And the civil defence program, it is explained in the decision of the prime minister and the instruction of the minister of the Interior, it was communicated, it was an instruction -- we know it was an instruction and we knew it.  It was an instruction from the month of May and not April, so these are two different things, and in the civil defence program there was no instruction concerning roadblocks.  It was rather one intended to train young people thoroughly so they could support the army and the defence of the country in the event of Inkotanyi attacks in the area.  The instruction concerning the training of these people, these young people, only started after the instruction and in Gitesi started in June.  You can see this summary.  There is another summary that talks about the civil defence program and that is after the 13th of May.  You should have that summary.  
How did we react to it?  That was the one of 13th of May.  That was the decision, the meeting to discuss the decisions and instructions of the Prime Minister.  That is what I can say regarding this question regarding the civil defence program and the setting up of the roadblocks.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what you just read out to us in Kinyawrandan, and which was then read into the records in English and French, were excerpts from minutes from a meeting on 11 April in which body, which committee?  Can you put that on the record the name of the committee, please?
@THE WITNESS:
It was as it is written out here, it is the covering letter to the summary.  It was the meeting of the communal security council, including members of the communal council, among others.
@MR. KAPAYA:
One last question on this point, Your Honours. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yesterday, when learned counsel was leading you on this issue, he asked you the following question and this is your response.  "Now, did authorities mount those roadblocks?  Was there a plan for the setting up of roadblocks in Kibuye?"  Answer:  "To my knowledge, in Kibuye there was no determined plan.  We just saw the roadblocks being set up progressively.  There was no -- there was one set up here and then another and another until such a time that it sort of formed a complete network." 
Is that what you say?
@A.
Yes.  The answer to that question is still valid even at this time.  I believe that if you are referring to the decision to erect roadblocks at the entrance of the city, that wasn't part of the gendarmerie.  We requested that roadblocks be set up there.  
Now, you are asking about the roadblocks made by the population that were mounted here and there in the area, so that once again -- perhaps, I see that you have a document.  What the problem of roadblocks, I looked at it properly in the course of a meeting because  the form of barriers of the roadblocks was a problem.  There was no program of erection here and there and getting the population to set them up.  I am not denying that there was a campaign launched by certain authorities, certain parts of the media to set up roadblocks, that is a matter of fact, but to say that this and that authority decided that roadblocks be set up and manned in such-and-such a manner, that is not true.  This is what I said yesterday and this is what I'm still maintaining.
@MR. KAPAYA:
When it was found out that crimes were being committed at roadblocks, did the authorities order that they be demolished?
@A.
Now, let me come back to the answer.  I know, and I'm not denying, that some of the authorities, some of them supported and did push for the setting up of the check points, the roadblocks, and when there were crimes committed at those roadblocks, that generated a problem, so far as I'm concerned, at any rate, and I, particularly, looked into the problem on the occasion of the meeting of the committee, such as the meeting of the 11th, because that was a problem, a real problem that was there, and that was a matter of fact.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, you testified yesterday that Mr. Ndindabahizi was PSD Chairman, Kibyue, right?
@A.
That is correct.  That is what I said.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi was not the first chairman, he took over from someone, did he not?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And he had to -- Mr. Ndindabahizi took over the chairmanship because the holder of that position had to relinquish it because he was appointed to another post?
@A.
That is not correct.  That is not correct.  That is false.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Let me show you a name and tell me whether you know this person.  This person was the first president of the PSD in Kibuye, is that not correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
He was actually the founder member of the party in Kibuye, do you agree?
@A.
He was not the only one, he was with other people.  Yes, he was one of the founding members.
@MR. KAPAYA:
In line with the Arusha Accord, he was appointed MP designate, was he not?
@A.
Yes, that's correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And he couldn't be chairman and MP at the same time, could he?
@A.
Yes, that is possible.  It is not incompatible.
@MR. KAPAYA:
But the position in this case was that because he was appointed by the party to hold another post, he had to relinquish the chairmanship to somebody else.  That was a party decision, was it not?
@A.
Well, let me explain the situation to you.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I just want a yes or no answer.
@A.
No, that is not correct.  That is not true, sir, so that the post of MP and running the party, these are not incompatible at all.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Was that person -- now, that person was not -- did not finally take up his position, did he, the position as member of parliament, the person I have shown you on that piece of paper?
@A.
Yes, yes, that's correct.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And that position was taken by somebody else you know, right?
@A.
That is correct, yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Who appointed you to that post?
@A.
Now, before I answer that question, Mr. President, could I give you background to clarify these questions, the preceding questions especially, as regards the said incompatibility or otherwise or the replacement level of the party or at regional level?  This will allow me to make things much clearer, Mr. President.  
Very well.  Now, what happened, as I said yesterday, was that initially when PSD was created in '91 it was run by a member, or by a provisional committee; that is, somebody was appointed as president or chairman, secretary, et cetera, et cetera.  That was how it happened, and after the members became many, there was a structure put to the party and organs were elected, party organs, as I said yesterday.  At regional level, indeed, the person who was the founding member was running the party at the level of the region up to 1992 or 1993, but somewhere in 1992 there were regional elections, and the elected committee was established and the chairman was Ndindabahizi.  
Now, the person that was in the regional committee, the person whose name you showed me who was the chairman of the party during the interim period, was still on the committee, but not at the level of chairman after the elections -- after the elections.  So that has nothing to do with the appointment as MP.  That was after the Arusha Accords were signed in 1993.  It was then that the parties organised themselves to appoint those that want to represent them in the parliament in transitional -- the interim parliament.  That was 1993 and 1994.  That should be set apart.  
Now, coming back to the issue that was just raised as to who replaced him -- I think that was the question, who replaced him at the level of the parliament as MP.  Now, as I explained yesterday, the appointment of this replacement -- and he took part in it -- it was between the chairman of the party at regional level and the person whose name you showed me who was the vice chairman.  This is why he went to see Bwakira, and at that time -- let me explain, Mr. President.  
Before and during the transitional parliament that was programmed with the RPF, it was 11 members, but with the new parliament without the RPF, we had 13 members.  Now, I do not see why you are saying it was a matter of course or they wanted to replace him.  He was replaced, but there were members to be added to the list.  Now, the question as to why he was replaced, you didn't ask.  You shouldn't put it to me.  Put it to those people who made sure that the name of the person was on the final list.  
These are the explanations I wanted to offer, Mr. President.  Thank you.
@MR. KAPAYA:
My question to you, Mr. Witness, is very simple.  Who appointed you MP designate leading to your swearing in on 4th of July?  Who appointed you? 
@A.
I was appointed by the representative of the party at regional level and by his vice chairman, those two persons, because the committee was unable to meet.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What is his name?
@A.
Who?  The representative?
@MR. KAPAYA:
What is the name of the person who appointed you?
@A.
I said I was appointed by two people:  Ndindabahizi, who was chairman of the party, and the other person that he went to see in Bwakira, so that the decision was made by two persons.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Did Mr. Ndindabahizi tell you that he was going to tell Sindikubwabo and Kambanda that he ratified that appointment in the place of the person -- the incumbent who was there?
@A.
The chairman cannot have any right of ratifying.  It was a party appointment.  It had nothing to do with the other parties or the government.  It was not a ratification process.  There was no such step.  It was a matter for the party.

@MR. KAPAYA:
Sir, you were appointed by the party or a committee, but now you were not appointed by the committee as the constitution of the PSD required, you are appointed by somebody who told you that he was appointing you and that he would tell the president and the prime minister to ratify your appointment.  Didn't that happen?
@A.
No, no, no.  We are talking about procedures.  As far as the appointment of MPs are concerned, that never goes to the prime minister or the president of the republic, that is a decision that is made within the party, and that is all, full stop.  That is why, if the president were to ratify or confirm, the parliament would have been there a long time ago; it is because it's the parties that appoint their members.  
Now, indeed, my appointment was not made by a committee.  The situation, the conjuncture was impossible.  That is why there was consultation between two party leaders at that level.
@MR. KAPAYA:
The PSD required that you be elected by a party -- by the party and not appointed.  Now that you are appointed, this is why that happened now.
@A.
No, that is not true.  No, that is not true.  Even now, if you look at the parliament that has just been set up in Rwanda in November, how were people appointed?  There were no elections; it was the party that stood up.  They represent certain parties, certain people, and they go to parliament.  There have never been any elections in Rwanda; it was appointments.  Appointments have taken place many a time.  There have never been any elections so far. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
What was the ethnic group of the wife of the person you replaced?
@A.
Tutsi, sir.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And that person you replaced did not tell you that he was relinquishing that post voluntarily, did he?
@A.
Voluntarily?  No.  At the beginning he did not relinquish it.  According to the communications we had, he did not relinquish it, but we took note of it later on.  
But I do not know why you insist on saying that I replaced so-and-on, whereas I am telling you that the list of the members of the party was increased by two.  There were two préfectures that should have been given two members, whereas others had only one member.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Witness, why did you choose to serve in a government that pursued a genocide policy?  Why did you not resign, if you were not part of it, part of the game?
@A.
Well, that is a question that I would like to dwell on, if I may.  That is always a matter of speculation and interpretation, and you should allow me time to explain this.  Now I am -- and I explained the functions that I performed from 1990 to 1994 -- now, during that period of time the government of Rwanda was to be seen -- could have been seen in four ways.  There was the MRND government, and up to '91 there was a government in which you had only two political parties that only was there for three months in 1991, and now you have a government where there is an agreement between political parties where now we have four, five parties within that government, that is, from 1991 to 1993.  Now, these political parties that took part in that government of the MRND, for example, they were there with their own identities as parties, they were there upon agreement with the government.  Now, these are three governments, and I was in there, I performed my functions, and nothing ever changed.  
Now, I do not know whether the functions I had were absolutely related to the policies of those governments.  If not, I should have been changed each and every time the government changes.  Whereas in those governments the political parties that agreed to run the country -- and those political parties did not abandon their programs, their various programs and their status -- they were there on the basis of government status and together to run a government that is patronised, that is sponsored by the MRND, so that there were groups of parties and the opposition within one government. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
$Microphone not activated) 
@A.
Very well, but the question is very broad as you put it to me; I do not know how to tackle it to be as clear as I could be, as I am trying to do.  I did not decide -- to come to your precise question, I did not decide to serve in a government, a government came and found me in service.  I tried to manage the situation, and that is all.
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.
Now, I put it to you, Mr. Witness, that Mr Ndindabahizi used undue influence to remove the MP who was elected by the party and install you as a reward for supporting him in his various activities in Gitesi commune.  What do you say to that?
@A.
Now, that is a question that should not be put to me, because I did not appoint myself.  Perhaps the question should be put to Ndindabahizi himself.  All I know is that I do not see any reason why this innuendo should be there to -- or any influence should be exercised so that I get that post.  I do not see any reason for that.

The war with the RPF started in April, continued up to July 1994.  It was taking place within different areas in Rwanda.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
That is correct.  
During the 3 May meeting in Kibuye, do you know if Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke as a minister or as a member of the PSD?
@A.
When I made my statement about his declaration, I said that he spoke on behalf of the PSD; he was a representative of the PSD party.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did it appear surprising to you that this particular PSD member would support a government that he belonged to?
@A.
Pardon me?
@MR. BESNIER:
Did it appear surprising to you or bizarre or shocking that this member of the PSD, that is to say Ndindabahizi, supported the government that he belonged to?
@A.
That question seems difficult to me; I don't understand.
@MR. BESNIER:
I'll rephrase.  Was Mr. Ndindabahizi a member of the transitional government?
@A.
Yes, he was.
@MR. BESNIER:
During the public meeting, should he oppose the government that he belonged to?
@A.
No, that would have been impossible.
@MR. BESNIER:
During the meeting of 3 May did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi personally, directly or indirectly say things that would encourage the massacres in Kibuye, the massacres of civilian Tutsis?
@A.
Indirectly or directly?  I don't understand.  I don't have what he said.  I don't have -- I don't see what he said before me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Earlier the Prosecutor asked you who designated you to be in the National Assembly.  You said there were two people; yes or no?
@A.
Yes, that is what I have just said; correct, indeed.
@MR. BESNIER:
The first person, if I understood, was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; the second was the person -- was it the person that the Prosecutor showed you a name on a piece of people?
@A.
Yes, it's the same person whose name I saw on a paper.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you ever meet this second person after Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's visit?
@A.
Yes, we often met.
@MR. BESNIER:
During those meetings with that second person, did that second person tell you that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi pressured him by underscoring the ethnic group of his wife?
@A.
I was called by the prosecutor of the republic of Kibuye to talk about Ndindabahizi.  I was in the same jail with this person whose name was shown to me.  He was also in contact with the prosecutor.  I am sure that those statements never made it to the prosecutor of the republic's office.  If that had taken place, it must have vexed them.  I think that they would have talked -- confronted us about this story if that had happened, or such a statement would have appeared in our depositions before the prosecutor of the republic, because we lived together, that person and I, in 1994.  We lived through difficult times.  Even when he exiled to Zaire, he left his property with me.  When he came back, he stayed for some time outside the country and then he was arrested.  We lived together.  I made these statements when we were together in the prison in Kibuye.  So what I have just here -- heard, perhaps that happened, perhaps these are inventions.  Nevertheless, I am not aware of such pressure of which you speak.  What else?  If there was pressure to designate me, it wouldn't have been necessary in 1994; couldn't have declared that.  They wouldn't have gone to -- from Kibuye to see him.  I think that's the only answer that I can give you to this question.
@MR. BESNIER:
That is very clear. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no further questions. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
You talked about seeing the Accused in 1994, in the month of June, that he passed through his own area and came to your house, and he had arrested another ***********************.  What was the nature of the allegations that the Accused made against that person, and when your investigations were made and *******, what were your findings about who the culprit was, about the allegations made by the Accused?  Is the question clear? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, I understand.  
***********, I didn't find any guilt with respect to the allegations as they were communicated to me from Ndindabahizi.  Only I did that after a meeting and after a discussion -- after a discussion, and after an exchange of ideas with Ndindabahizi who had brought him, because he left him in jail ********
But during the discussions -- I then had discussions with Ndindabahizi, so we were able to talk about the situation with regard to this person.  ************88On the other hand, I tried to conduct an investigation into what this person had told me, and that investigation that I conducted, I was not able to complete it because it was very difficult, it was very complicated.  So I let it go until the situation became more calm, so such an investigation could take place.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
$Microphone not activated) ... allegations which were made by the Accused against this person, what did the Accused tell you about what that person was alleged to have done?
@THE WITNESS:
The Accused -- the Accused had suspended his activities *****, and there was a murder of a person and he was supposed to protect that person, and he must have had a friendship with Ndindabahizi or been a member of his family, but he didn't sufficiently protect a person who was murdered.  And we found that those few facts were not sufficient for that person to be arrested, to say that he didn't protect somebody who was murdered, when he himself was not implicated in the murder.  Just to say that he didn't protect somebody, given the situation in the country, I said, "Frankly that is not sufficient to put somebody behind bars."
@JUDGE BOSSA:
$Microphone not activated) ... and the person who was murdered?
@THE WITNESS:
It was a cousin of Ndindabahizi, cousin -- at any rate relatives of his cousins, cousins who were massacred, or their entire families.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
My next question relates to the meetings of 29th and 30th April.  You testified that one of them was a communal meeting and another one was a central meeting and they related to security in your area.  Now, you testified that in those meetings the Accused was not spoken about because there was no need, there was nothing anybody could do -- correct me if I am misquoting you.  So my question is this.  This was -- the Accused was a minister in the government of the day, ********, he was a native and people were dying -- you say they started dying in April, continued through May -- didn't you see a need *********to at least approach him to bring him on top of issues in your area?
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
I did not contact him.  First, we must consider the relationships between civil servants, especially given my position and his position, and given his position, it was difficult for me to be able to contact him for anything, unless I could individually contact him since he was a minister to help me, to try to help me calm the situation.  But on a functional level, it was very difficult.  Communications could not permit such a thing.  
You spoke about the meeting of the 29th; indeed it took place.  It was with the members of the conseiller and members of the security council in the préfecture to see what we could do about the killings, see what measures we could take to try to reduce or completely stop these massacres.  If he was in Kibuye at that time, if we had the opportunity to receive him in Gitesi, we would have invited him, as a minister, to our meeting for his support, but he was not at that meeting.  
The meeting took place.  If he had been there, he would have participated as a minister native to that commune.  We would have invited him and I don't think he would have refused the invitation, and we would have launched him through contributions.  The next day there was a cooperation meeting in the secteur.  If we had contacted him a bit before, if he had visited us before, indeed, I would have asked for his contribution to talk to the population of the area of which he was a native, but I didn't even think of that.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
$Microphone not activated) ... Kibuye, 3rd of May meeting, I believe that was just a few days after the meeting you had in your area.  Did you have an opportunity to talk to him about it?
@THE WITNESS:
No, the way they were escorted with the presidential guard made it difficult to individually contact a person.  I didn't have any particular meetings with him.  He came; we had the meeting together and his escorts of the presidential guard took him away.  He had very tight security around him.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And did he in his address to this meeting talk about the security situation in his native area, generally in the préfecture and in his native area --
@THE WITNESS:
No. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
-- considering that he commended that particular area for the killings that took place?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  During the meeting of the 3rd, during his speech he did not mention the security situation in his native area, not even in his cellule, or secteur, or commune in general; there was no mention of that.  
As you have noticed, he generally spoke of the party and its position within the government that was there.  He -- the president thanked the people in Kibuye.  That is why when I explained myself, I said that the president in his address was not really discouraging what was going on.  He really was trying to further what was going on.  That is why in my commentary, when he said that, "You've worked well", he really meant that he was thanking the crimes that were going on.  I didn't see in the president's speech anything that was discouraging what was going on.  
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.  
@THE WITNESS
Thank you, Your Honour.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, in 1990, before your appointment as bourgmestre, did you have any political affiliation with the president at that period in time?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  At that time there was only one political party, and in fact, all Rwandans had to, without choice, adhere to that party, and so I was a member of it.

Good afternoon, Counsel.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, yesterday during your testimony, you talked about the fact that whilst you were detained at the Kibuye prison, you saw new co-prisoners that hailed from Gitesi commune, the area of Gitesi.  Do you recall saying that, sir?
@A.
I did not say that that prisoner was from Gitesi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't think you understood my question, and I'll repeat it.  During your testimony yesterday, sir, you testified that you and other prisoners often discussed the fact that Mr. Ndindabahizi was being accused of crimes.  Do you recall telling us that yesterday, sir?
@A.
Yes, I remember saying that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And as far as you know, sir, are you able to confirm whether or not people who were accused or suspected of committing crimes in Gitesi commune were often detained at the Kibuye prison following the genocide?  Can you help me with that, sir?
@A.
Some were detained at Kibuye prison, others at Gisovu prison.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying, sir, that many of those who committed crimes in Gitesi commune and who were now detained at Gisovu prison were transferred there, and by "there" I mean Gisovu prison, following the closure of Kibuye prison.  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
@A.
I cannot confirm that.  I was not present during their transfer, but I do know that the detainees were transferred to different prisons.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you able to confirm whether or not, to your knowledge, the Kibuye prison is still operational to date?  Can you help me with that, sir?
@A.
Since that prison closed, I never went back to Kibuye.  I believe that that prison is indeed closed, but when there are sick prisoners who come to the hospital in Kibuye or when prisoners come to appear before the court, and that's a small number of prisoners, I believe that they are detained in that same Kibuye prison.  But officially that prison was closed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  Sir, I want to show you a list of names and I want you to look at these names and tell me whether or not you are able to confirm if any of these people, to your knowledge, was detained at the prison in Kibuye whilst you were held there, sir.  
Do you see the list that has been placed before you, sir?  Please don't mention any, any of the names on that list, please.  Are we agreed on that?  Please don't mention the names.
Can you confirm for me, sir, if, to your knowledge, any of those mentioned on that list was detained at the Kibuye prison on or around the same time that you were detained, sir?  Please don't mention the name.
@A.
Yes, I can see one of these names.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, using the numbers that I have indicated next to the names, can you please identify the person by the number and not the name, sir?
@A.
The person whose name I recognise is No. 2.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, sir.  Now, let's talk about No. 2.  Would I be correct in saying, sir, that the person you identify in No. 2 was detained in Kibuye prison around about the same time that you were detained there, sir?
@A.
Whilst I was detained at Kibuye prison, that person was also detained at the same prison.  When I was released from the prison, he was still there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, sir.  Now, as part of your testimony yesterday, sir, you also testified about a supervisor who you claimed boasted about some things that he had done whilst you were all -- whilst you, sir, was detained at the prison.  Do you recall telling us about that, sir?
@A.
Yes, I said that I saw a person who was boasting for doing something amongst the supervisors of the prison.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, can you help me with this:  In your testimony yesterday you stated that there were other people present in the courtyard when the supervisor boasted about the things you told us about.  Now, was this person present with you at the time, sir, the person at No. 2?
@A.
I believe that that person who is listed here at No. 2 was not present.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, do you know if there is a relationship between the supervisor who you wrote his name down on a piece of paper, which is now Defence Exhibit 45, and the person you have identified as being on No. 2?  Do you know if there is a relationship, a family relationship, between them, sir?
@A.
I heard people say that No. 2 on this list was the brother-in-law of the person whose name I wrote down on the piece of paper.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is therefore your testimony that in all the time you spent with No. 2 at the prison, he never alluded to the fact that he had a relationship with the person on Defence Exhibit 45, sir?
@A.
The person at No. 2 never talked to me about that subject.  I never heard him say anything about that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, sir.  Now, following your release from the prison, would I be correct in saying, sir, that you never reported the events concerning the person identified in Defence Exhibit 45 and yourself, you never reported that incident to any of the law enforcement authorities?
@A.
I never met with any authority.  As regards what that person may have said or done, that is to say the person whose name I wrote down on that piece of paper that was because nobody asked me any questions regarding that subject.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying, sir, that you never discussed the events concerning the person you identified on Defence Exhibit 45 with the man you have indicated on No. 2 of the piece of paper I have just given you, sir?  Would I be correct in saying that too, sir?
@A.
I remember that when I spoke with such and such a person regarding the testimony, especially my friends, sometimes we spoke about those events, but not with many people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am sorry, sir, I don't understand your reply, and that is probably because you don't understand my question. So I would ask it again:  The events that you told us about, the boasting by the person you wrote down for us yesterday, can you confirm, sir, whether or not following that event, the boasting event, you discussed it with the person you identified on No. 2 of the piece of paper?  Just a simple yes or no is fine.
@A.
I never spoke to that person regarding that subject, because I often -- I did not often meet him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  So would I be correct in assuming, for the record, that the first time you have discussed the boasting event is before this Tribunal, and in your statement, of course, to the Defence?
@A.
Counsel, could you please repeat that question for me?  It is not very clear for me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  Would I be correct in saying say, sir, that perhaps the first time that you have told anyone or discussed the events concerning the supervisor boasting about what he said was in this courtroom yesterday?
@A.
No, it wasn't the first time that I spoke about it.  I told you before that I spoke with some of my friends about this after I was released.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  Now, in your testimony yesterday, and I am moving to a separate issue now, you described the Accused as a minister being a man who is educated, a person who works on behalf of the people and, therefore, he cannot distribute machetes.  Because he is such an important person, he wouldn't be someone who would distribute these things.  I am quoting from a draft transcript of

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, would you expect, however, a minister, as you described, an educated man, a minister who works on behalf of people, as you put it, would you expect such a person to renounce and condemn the killings of innocent civilians? 
@A.
I think that it is one of his obligations, that is to say, to defend all innocent people if they are victims of any type of aggression.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, sir.  Now, yesterday -- moving to a separate topic now -- you testified that the market at Kibilizi was not functioning for the better part of the events of 1994, and that the market resumed its operations in June, when Opération Turquoise came to the area.  Do you remember telling us that, sir?
@A.
I do.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, is it your testimony, sir, that Hutus who were not in hiding were not able to purchase any commodities throughout the hundred days during which the genocide was perpetrated at Kibilizi market?
@A.
I explained that the markets, churches, were not working because you wouldn't see many crowds, many people in the streets, either going to market or going to one church or the other.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But in your testimony yesterday, sir, you testified that as far as you were concerned, and I quote directly from the same transcript at page 3, "I would say that the massacres ended towards the month of April 1994".  Then you go on to explain how you came to that conclusion.  Sir, if, in your opinion, the massacres in and around Mabanza commune had ended at the end of April 1994, why then would the commercial centre of Kibilizi remain closed until the French arrived in June?  Can you help us with that, please, and the churches and the offices and everything?
@A.
Even if in Mabanza and around Rubengera where I lived the massacres stopped at the end of the month of April, I explained that one of the reasons was that the Tutsis who were being hunted down had gathered at the communal office where they had gone to seek refuge.  This was around the 13th or 14th.  Those Tutsis were sent to Kibuye so that they could be protected.  To tell you the truth, there were no longer any Tutsi in that area, expect, rather, for those who were identified later on when the French arrived.  They had been hiding at their friends' houses and they were -- they asked to go out when the French arrived, or sometimes the French found them when they were hiding.  But there were no more massacres.  You couldn't see any more Tutsis.  Many houses were destroyed, the others were gathered at the communal office, and you could see them at Kibuye at the Gatwaro stadium.  They left that stadium when some of them started to be killed.  These were refugees from Busesero.  Busesero was not in Mabanza but in Gitesi, in Gishyita.  Interahamwe, who were going to kill them, you could see them come through in buses.  They went through Mabanza coming from Gisenyi.  They came through Mabanza to Bisesero.  The massacres continued elsewhere, but in Mabanza, as far as I know, there were no more massacres.

And just like anyone who is detained falsely, you were, quite rightly, able to feel some resentment to those who detained you, are you not, sir?
@A.
Yes, I resented being detained, and that was unjustified, but I didn't feel any hate, because in everyone's life there are times when you have to undergo injustice or where you are a victim of injustice.  But the people who were investigating my file found that I was innocent.  I don't hate them for that.  That is what happened at the time, and that is just how life goes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In fact, isn't it the case, sir, that you have no doubts that there are several other people, Hutus like yourself, who are in exactly the same position, wrongly incarcerated?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
@A.
That is correct.  People were arrested en masse.  Hutus were gathered together and put into prison.  What is interesting, though, is that after investigating, examining the situation of each individual, those who are found innocent are released.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I thank you very much for being so kind to answer my questions.  
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no other questions for this witness other than to enter the document before him as the next Prosecution exhibit.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Prosecution Exhibit 44 under seal.  
$Exhibit No. P. 44 admitted, under seal)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No re-examination?  Thank you.
@THE INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This person who may wrongly have accused Mr. Ndindabahizi of something, do you have an explanation why he did so, the person who boasted about what he had done?
@THE WITNESS:
The reason for that is that all of the authorities, during the genocide, are considered as criminals by the IBUKA association.  There are strategies used to find prosecution witnesses against those different authorities.  I can confirm that this person is one of those.  This person was someone who was trained, if you will, to accuse Ndindabahizi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that person a member of Ibuka, to your knowledge?
@THE WITNESS:
All survivors have to be a member of this association.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You say "have to be."  Is it obligatory?
@THE WITNESS:
They are asked to join the association, and they are even courted to become members of the association.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did this person, when he spoke with you, mention the organisation, or is this an inference that you are making, that it was that organisation being behind this?
@THE WITNESS:
I don't know of all the members, the list of members of Ibuka, but we do know that all of the survivors of the genocide are a part of this association.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he tell you himself why he made the false accusation?
@THE WITNESS:
He did not tell me why.  He wasn't a particular friend of mine.  As I said, he said this in a public setting, in the courtyard of the prison, where other detainees were around me.  In fact, I have no particular friendship with that particular person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday you said that, "He told us that lies were said about Mr. Ndindabahizi, and the supervisor suggested that somebody had encouraged him," that is the supervisor, "to make false testimony.  He mentioned names.  He said he had mentioned names of people to be killed and distributed weapons."  What did you mean by that, please?
@THE WITNESS:
I wanted to tell Chimba about that person who had accused Ndindabahizi wrongly on certain facts.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What I didn't understand was the following sentence:  "He mentioned names.  He said he had mentioned names of people to be killed and distributed weapons."  Can you explain that a little bit further, please?
@THE WITNESS:
Well, I, neither, didn't understand your question, sir, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I'm simply reading out a sentence from the draft transcript yesterday.  Now, that sentence is attributed to you.  So what I'm doing is to read out what you said in court yesterday in order to understand you a bit more fully.  That's the communication going on between the two of us now.
@THE WITNESS:
Perhaps I don't understand you, because in my statement I did not talk about a list of persons.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in the English version, in what I just mentioned to you now in English, I also did not talk about the list.  So there is a translation problem between the two of us.  Let us try again.  Now, what you said yesterday, according to the transcript, is as follows:  "The supervisor told us that somebody had encouraged him to make false testimony.  The supervisor mentioned names," he must be the supervisor, "he mentioned names.  He said that he had mentioned names of people to be killed and distributed weapons."
@THE WITNESS:
I said that the supervisor had been requested to testify against Ndindabahizi for having distributed arms for Tutsis to be killed, and that Ndindabahizi is said to have encouraged or sensitised people, too, and encouraged them to kill Tutsi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And did he inform you about the particulars of this?  In other words, did the supervisor give you any further details about what he had said when he gave false testimony?
@THE WITNESS:
Well, those are things that the supervisor said in public.  What pains me more was that the supervisor said that Ndindabahizi was wrongly accused, without showing (unintelligible) at that time that he did not see him, and also because during those difficult times, the person concerned was hiding at Karara's.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  There are no further questions to you.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to testify before the Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I wish you more courage for your task that is very useful for all Rwandans.  Thank you again.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will now be asked questions by the Defence, first.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President.  Mr. President, the Tribunal has seen that we wanted to hear DQ before DP, who was here, because of technical reasons.  Now I would like to appeal that the testimony of DQ be heard entirely in closed session.  This is a very vulnerable witness.  He worked in some official course in Rwanda and he exercised those functions that will be the subject of my examination-in-chief.  The risks are many in that exercise so that I would like to plea that you grant this sitting in camera throughout the examination-in-chief.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problems from the Prosecution?
Let me say that we do not have a summary in English of the witness's previous statement.  We do not have that in front of us here.  Usually we have that provided by the Defence.  Here, it's coming from the registry.  Thank you.
Any problems with closed session?  Comments?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My learned friend and I have discussed this matter.  I have no objections.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
No objections.  I have looked through this document now and I realise the need for such a request, which is now granted.  So from now on, we will move into a closed session, and I must ask the public kindly to leave the gallery, because we have to protect the identity of this witness by an in camera hearing.

Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. President, I have three questions on the identity of the witness.  I should like to seek leave for a closed session, so that I put these questions that affect his identity.  It will not take three minutes.

Witness DP, from now on we are in open session again, so now you have to be careful when you answer questions so as not to reveal your identity.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, for that.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness, now during the sitting when I refer to your functions I will talk about the profession that you said you were exercising in 1994 during the closed session.  Is that acceptable?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, still in 1994, how did you learn about the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
I learnt about it over the radio when I went back home in the evening, at about 8:30 p.m. or 9 p.m.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you in your native commune that you told us when you learned about the death of the president?
@A.
No, I was in Kigali.  I was residing in Kiyovu where my house -- my official residence was Kiyovu.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you tell us, in a few words, what happened in Kigali in your neighbourhood following the death of the president?
@A.
As soon as we learned about the death of the president it was said over the radio that there was a curfew, and we were compelled to stay at home without going out.  Then, at around midnight, we heard gunshots and we, of course, remained in our houses for about almost a week.  And it was on the 12th of April that we were able to leave Kigali, and I was on my way to Gisenyi to my parents' house.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you decide to leave Kigali?
@A.
We wanted to run away from the fighting.  It was only on the 12th that we were able to leave Kigali, because the situation had subsided.
@MR. BESNIER:
The 12th of what month?
@A.
The 12th of April.
@MR. BESNIER:
What form of transport did you go out of Kigali? 
@A.
I had my own car.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you said that you wanted to go where, which city?
@A.
To Gisenyi, at my parents.  First of all I went to see my in-laws, who lived in Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  Where did you stay in Gitarama?
@A.
With my in-laws.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you meet people that you knew before in Gitarama?
@A.
Members of my in-laws, the family of my in-laws, yes, and in the evening Mr. Ndindabahizi came to see me at my in-laws' and told me that the interim government had just decided to reopen the banks to be able to pay depositors their money and pay for the food supplies of the army.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let's go back a little.  Did you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before that?
@A.
Yes, I had known him in 1973 when we were together at university.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see him again since then?
@A.
No, I only saw him again, practically, when he came to see me in Gitarama.  It was on the 12th of April in the evening.  Before that I had heard he was appointed director of cabinet and I did not see him at the Ministry of Finance, of course.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  On the 12th of April, in the evening, at what time, approximately, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?  Do you remember that?
@A.
I believe it was 7 p.m., 7:30 p.m. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you meet him by chance?
@A.
Yes, for me it was by chance.  I don't even know how he knew I was there, because we just arrived in Gitarama.  I don't know how he learnt about being in Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he come to see you?
@A.
Yes, yes, because it was his mission to come and tell me that I was summoned by the government to go back to work.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you give us more details concerning the reasons why he was himself in Gitarama -- Ndindabahizi I mean?
@A.
It was because the interim government had decided to set up in Gitarama and to get away from the fighting in Kigali.  They had set up their headquarters in Murambi first.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know the date that the interim government took seat in Murambi?
@A.
We heard it over the radio while we were still in Kigali.  It was around the 9th of April, we were told that they were sworn in in the Hotel de Mille Collines& was all we knew.  It was broadcast over the radio.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  And on this 12th of April in the evening at around 1900 hours, what did Ndindabahizi tell you?
@A.
Well, he told me the interim government had decided to reopen the banks and that -- because my functions, precedingly, the government had decided to enroll me to work with the other members of the bank who were also called in.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you obey?
@A.
Yes, I couldn't refuse because it was a decision of the government, all the more so as there was nothing else I could do.
@MR. BESNIER:
On that 12th of April, how long did you stay in the company of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Well, he didn't stay for a long time.  He only stayed for about five minutes and left.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you start working on the 12th of April or later on?
@A.
It was later on; on the 13th in the morning, at around 8 a.m., they came to fetch me from my house, from my in-laws.  Then we went to Murambi, that is the headquarters of the interim government.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who came to fetch you?
@A.
It was a driver -- no, it was a soldier.  I do not remember his name anymore.
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, we may not find it important.  I wanted to know if it was Ndindabahizi himself.
@A.
No, it was not Ndindabahizi himself.  I do not remember the person as such.  At any rate, when they came to fetch me we found Colonel Bagosora within the government.  We were told that he was responsible for supervising the entire operation now.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us go step-by-step, Witness.  On the 13th of April, in the morning, they came to fetch you, and where did they take you?
@A.
To the headquarters of the government at Murambi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, who were you introduced to on the 13th of April in the morning to start you off?
@A.
First of all we met the governor of the national bank who was with the accountant-general at the national bank, Mr. -- well, I can't remember his name at this time.  And we were told that he was responsible for the team that was to run operations in the national bank.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, how did you settle down?  Were you given an office in Murambi?
@A.
No, not in Murambi.  We were with Colonel Bagosora, and the guard for the funds were -- I mean for the funds were and we therefore went to the secondary offices of the commercial bank in Gisarme.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you meet Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 13th of April?
@A.
On the 13th of April, in the morning, he was there, but as the rest of the operation was therefore without him, he went back to his office in the Ministry of Finance.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I didn't get this quite clearly.  Counsel asked you whether you were given an office at Murambi and then you provided an answer with reference to Colonel Bagosora, but I didn't get the gist of your answer.  Can you repeat that answer, please?
@THE WITNESS:
Very well.  Now, there were no offices because in principle we were supposed to work in the banks.  So that we left with Colonel Bagosora to visit the offices in the commercial bank, down in the bank in Kigali, and inspect the situation, as far as the coffers of the banks were concerned.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Still on the 13th of April, to make this point clearer.  The purpose of your mission, was it to find you an office or was there any other thing, because you are talking about your mission with Colonel Bagosora?
@A.
Now, the purpose was firstly to see whether the coffers of the two banks were safe and comfortable so that we could deposit funds that we got from Kigali in them for operations.  We saw that they were rather empty, so we had to go back to Kigali, but they could take some funds.  We brought back some funds for deposit at Kigarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
What are these funds you are talking about?
@A.
First of all, the funds came from the general accountant -- the general cashier, the funds that were in circulation, and a bundle of bank notes that were not in circulation to supply the main cashier, if she needed some. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Did you meet Mr. Ndindabahizi on the 13th of April?
@THE WITNESS:
No, only except on the 13th in the morning.  After that, we did not see him for the rest of the day, because we went  to Kigali.  We came back with the funds to deposit the funds in the bank.  We didn't go back to Murambi on that day.
@JUDGE KHAN:
But in the morning time.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, in the morning.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Perhaps we can try to reconsider what happened on the 13th of April.  Now, you went to Murambi on the 13th of April in the morning, is that correct?
@A.
To inspect the premises.
@MR. BESNIER:
You also met Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 13th on the morning, is that correct?  Then you met Colonel Bagosora, is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Then, together with Colonel Bagosora, you went to scout for a safe place to keep your funds, is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you find the described coffers?
@A.
Yes, we found two coffers at the Kigali bank and at the commercial bank, at the two banks.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, still on the 13th of April.  Now, after having found the coffers to deposit money, what did you do?
@A.
Then, of course, we organised our departure from Kigali to go and secure the funds and, of course, the documents that were necessary, the accounting documents.
@MR. BESNIER:
And in Kigali, where were the funds kept?
@A.
They were in the coffers of the Rwandan national bank.
@MR. BESNIER:
Have you actually transported the funds from Kigali to Gitarama?
@A.
Yes, we transported them under the escort of soldiers that Colonel Bagosora had obtained from the Kigali camp.

1500H
BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
How long did the operation to transfer the funds last?
@A.
Indeed, it ran up to the 14th because we had to go back on the 14th as well.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did it run for two days?
@A.
Yes, two days.
@MR. BESNIER:
That operation ended on the 14th of April; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct, on the 14th of April.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, during the course of the day of 13th April, did you see, apart from the morning, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi once again?
@A.
No, because we never went back to Murambi.  After having deposited the funds, I went back directly to my in-laws' house.
@MR. BESNIER:
And where did your in-laws live?
@A.
Near the town there.  Very near the stadium -- rather, very near the Gitarama market and near Kabugaye (phonetic), called Giahogwo (phonetic).
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  This is as far as the 13th of April is concerned.  Now, the 14th of April, did you meet Emmanuel on the 14th of April?
@A.
The 14th of April, neither, because they came to fetch us very early.  We didn't have time to go back to Murambi except in the evening when we finished the operation, when we went to get something to drink at very near the Goma headquarters.
@MR. BESNIER:
And when you took your break after that, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
No, I caught sight of him in Murambi.  I caught site of him.  We were not together.  I caught sight of him at the time when we went for a drink.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I take it on the 14th of April the transfer of funds was finished.  Now, what was your job after the 14th of April?
@A.
Let's say the 15th, because the operations began on the 15th of April, and on account of my qualifications and my functions, I was to prepare vouchers for payments for the national treasury, the treasury of Rwanda.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you have an office at that time, as of the 15th of April?
@A.
No, we didn't have any permanent office, because sometimes we were at the Kigali bank, sometimes at the commercial bank.  We didn't have a fixed office as such.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you perform the same duties?  Did you have the same functions?  For how long did you operate in those functions from the 15th of April?
@A.
Up to the time that we left the country for Goma, sir, that is around the 14th of July.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you stay in Gitarama since the -- from the 15th of July -- from the 15th of April to 15th of July?
@A.
No, Gitarama fell, so we left Gitarama at around the 30th of May.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Could you very quickly and very simply, Witness, tell us what your work in Gitarama consisted in?
@A.
The work I did in Gitarama consisted in the execution of payment of vouchers from the general treasurer, so that I established the payees and they were usually the suppliers, and of course the payment of salaries for civil servants.
@MR. BESNIER:
Shall I take it that you were responsible for preparing payments for some suppliers for the state?
@A.
No, the vouchers for the payment I did not pay.  The payment was done by the chief cashier of the state.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, who were the suppliers that you paid?  What do they supply you with?
@A.
Food supplies, especially for the army that was engaged with RPF; that is, engaged in combating RPF.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you responsible for buying arms for the army that was incumbent?
@A.
Before, that was one of my attributions.  But at that particular time, one couldn't pay for anything except in foreign currency, and we used only Rwandan francs at that time.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are now in Gitarama, are you, from the 15th of April to when? 
@THE WITNESS:
Up to the 30th of April.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's when Gitarama falls? 
@THE WITNESS:
That's when we left Gitarama.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then from the 13th of May, where were you then, just to get the overview? 
@THE WITNESS:
We settled down in Gisyeni.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And then --
@THE WITNESS:
We left Gisyeni on the 14th of July to take refuge in Goma. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  We'll take it that you were responsible for preparing vouchers for payment vouchers.  
Now, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, was he your hierarchical supervisor in Gitarama?
@A.
No, he was not my hierarchical boss.  He was minister for lands and responsible for the national bank.  My hierarchical boss was director of the national bank.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you regularly in contact with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, actually, he asked me to update him about the situation as far as the treasury was concerned, because he needed that to be able to establish contracts because the government had decided to give advance payment to suppliers because the bank wasn't functioning anymore.  So the government decided to give advances to suppliers so that Ndindabahizi needed an update on the situation, the financial situation.  So every day I had to update him so far as the accounting situation was concerned. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you said that he was not your boss.  Mr. Ndindabahizi was not your boss.
@THE WITNESS:
So, I do agree with that, but he had asked me, as minister responsible for my department, because I couldn't find the governor all the time.  It was, rather, the minister of finance who was more directly concerned.  I saw the governor, I told him what the situation was, but I reported that to the minister because the minister needed that information to establish contracts and to evaluate the level of funds.  He also was to pay the civil servants; that is, the civil servants: the teachers, health personnel, legal personnel, and sometimes the gendarmes and soldiers.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You are saying that you gave information under the directions of the governor of the --
@THE WITNESS:
Well, the governor also had asked me to give him such information.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Who was you're -- I need a clarification.  Who was your immediate boss?  Was it the governor or the director of finance, or both? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, it was the governor.  But he was in touch with Ndindabahizi because he was the one that needed the information, so that I should give it to him directly.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Are you referring to the governor of the bank of Rwanda? 
@THE WITNESS:
Of the National Bank of Rwanda.  And his name was N-T-I-R-U-M-B-A-B-A-Z-I.  And that was the governor of the Bank of Rwanda.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And who was above the governor of the Bank of Rwanda? 
@THE WITNESS:
As I said before, it was the minister of finance as being the responsible minister for that portfolio. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
When we ask questions again, it's not because we haven't understood the previous answer.  It's because we want to place it in context.  Thank you. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Starting on the 15th of April 1994, did you regularly work with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Yes, in fact, we did.  Well, he would come to ask me for that information or sometimes I would go to give him in Murambi such information.
@MR. BESNIER:
When you say that one of the two of you would travel to see the other, from where?
@A.
Well, I would go from the bank, the Bank of Kigali, to Murambi, and he would come from Murambi, either at Kigali -- at the Kigali bank or Bank of Commerce, because I used to work in those two places, either one or the other.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the distance between the banks that you spoke of and Murambi?
@A.
Between the Bank of Kigali and the Bank of Commerce, there's not even one kilometre distance between the two, and from the bank of commerce to Murambi, there's a distance of not even two kilometres.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are those three places in Gitarama?
@A.
Yes, they were in the city of Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Sir, to assist us, can you briefly describe the nature of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's work in Gitarama?
@A.
As I said, he was in charge of signing contracts with suppliers.  He also had to look at the state of accounts to see what the spending situation could be, and to spend, he could only see what had been deposited by the state into the coffers.  
We had 2 billion 700 million Rwandan francs at the time in the coffers.  When the money became insufficient, he negotiated special advances with the national bank.  He only did that once.  Because the Rwandan government no longer had any income, any revenue, and so he had to go to the system.  When the overdraft was completely gone, he had to look for other situations.  And this was provided for in law. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Given the event in your country in 1994, was the minister of finance's work real work or was it just a facade?
@A.
No, he did do real work.  Depositors were able to have their money because banks were open.  Civil servants could get their salaries, at least those who could get to Gitarama could, so I would say his work was -- did consist in some real things.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you have an office in Murambi?
@A.
Yes, with his immediate associates, collaborators.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he receive many visitors in his office?
@A.
Certainly, I'm sure.  Each time we would go to see him there, there were people looking for him, especially suppliers, food suppliers.  Others were looking for advances; others were looking for past payments.  That means he was constantly being looked for, as people were looking for solutions for payment.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, you yourself, how often did you meet with him? 
@A.
As I said earlier, it was once or twice a day: once to give him the information on the state of the accounts, and perhaps in the evening when we would go to have a drink in a bar that was very close to the government headquarters.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you be more specific?  In one day how many times would you see him, on average?
@A.
On average, once or twice a day, not more.
@MR. BESNIER:
In a week's time, how many days of the week would you see him, on average?
@A.
Well, excluding the weekends -- we were working.  On the weekends we didn't have any free time, but we did try to rest.  Except we couldn't when we were really demanded.  So it was mostly during the week, and I know that sometimes he went on mission to Nairobi and he left the work to his collaborators, the treasurer and the budget director.
@MR. BESNIER:
You said -- that in mid-May he left?
@A.
Yes, he went to Nairobi for a few days, about a week.  In mid-May he went there.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the objective of that mission in mid-May?
@A.
I think that he had a meeting with the PTA, of the PTA, there.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the PTA?
@A.
It's the Preferential Trade Area of East Africa.  It included Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, I believe.  There were about seven countries from central and eastern Africa.
@MR. BESNIER:
To the best of your memory, how long did he spend away?
@A.
I think it was about seven days he was away in that meeting.  I think it was around the 17th of May, if I'm not mistaken.  Six or seven days he was away.
@MR. BESNIER:
Outside of that trip, did Mr. Ndindabahizi voyage often, did he leave often?
@A.
No, only when the government would decide to have meetings in Kibuye or Gikongoro.  I don't remember the exact date, but in the evenings he would always come back to Gitarama in such cases.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, these seven days, how do you count them?  You mention -- will you relate these seven days to the date of 17th of May, please. 
@THE WITNESS:
This was in mid-May, mid-May 1994.  It was between the 15th -- he left between the 15th and 17th.  And the meeting took place during about a week's time.  But I can't give you the exact dates.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the commencement of the seven day's period was between the 15th and the 17th of May?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I think it was the 17th, the 17th, I believe.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the departure was on the 17th? 
@THE WITNESS:
It's been ten years, Mr. President; I'm trying to remember the date.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We really appreciate that, of course, of course. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you mean to say that Mr. Ndindabahizi left Gitarama on 15th of May? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, approximately on those dates.  I don't -- I can't say it was precisely the 15th because if I was to try to confirm that, wouldn't be telling the truth, because I don't actually know exactly.
@JUDGE KHAN:
But you left Gitarama on the 13th of May?
@THE WITNESS:
What I do know, it was in mid-May.
@JUDGE KHAN:
When did you leave Gitarama?
@THE WITNESS:
To go where?
@JUDGE KHAN:
You left Gitarama on 13th of May, didn't you say?
@THE WITNESS:
Me?  No, I don't recall saying that.  Myself?
@JUDGE KHAN:
On 13th of May? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, Your Honour, it was the 30th, 30th of May that we left to Gisenyi.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It is very often difficult to hear the difference between 13th and 30th.  Thank you. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, sir.  Let's go back over this, briefly.  So Mr. Ndindabahizi left for about a week around 
mid-May.  We agree on that point?
@A.
Yes, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he go back to Gitarama after?
@A.
Yes, I saw him after his return.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, during his absence, did you remain in Gitarama?
@A.
Yes, we never left Gitarama.  Well, we did later to go to Gisyeni, as I mentioned.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, besides that trip in mid-May, did Mr. Ndindabahizi leave Gitarama to go to another préfecture as far as you know?
@A.
Yes, I think he went to a meeting convened by the prime minister in different préfectures, especially in Kibuye.  I think that he also went to Gikongoro, but I can't remember the dates.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Let's speak about these meetings -- or this meeting.  Did he leave?  Well, how long did he leave?
@A.
It was during the day.  It was just a day, during the day. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let's speak of other absences that you might have noticed.  Did he -- did he ever leave besides these times that you mentioned?
@A.
No, I don't think so because we would regularly contact each other, until the point where it was unsafe to remain in Gitarama, because the RPF became stronger and stronger there. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
These two one-day trips, Mr. Witness, do you remember when they took place?  Let's start with the meeting in Kibuye.  Do you know when that meeting took place, please?
@THE WITNESS:
I really don't remember the dates, but I do know that it was in May. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you remember whether it was the beginning, middle or end of May?
@THE WITNESS:
I think the Kibuye meeting was in early May. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What about Gikongoro, then? 
@THE WITNESS:
Gikongoro, I'm not sure.  What I do know is that the prime minister convened meetings during the month of May.  They were bundled together, but I don't remember the exact dates.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So your recollection is that also the Gikongoro meeting took place in May; is that so?
@THE WITNESS:
I do believe so, but I'm not entirely sure.  I do know that the Kibuye meeting was in early May. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Lets go back to Gitarama.  When you worked with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, did you have a specific meeting time during the days with him?
@A.
No, we didn't have, really, working -- specified working hours.  He only would come to see me when he needed to or wanted to.  Perhaps it was at ten o'clock in the morning or maybe later in the afternoon when I would find him there.  And he didn't have any schedule when he came to see me.  We never had specific meeting times.
@MR. BESNIER:
To meet him, did you have to make an appointment?
@A.
No, I did not.  He had a small office in Murambi.  He was with his employees there.  They were makeshift offices.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you meet Ndindabahizi himself or would you deal with state affairs with his collaborators?
@A.
No, that information was given directly by me to Mr. Ndindabahizi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Outside of the absences that you spoke about, was Mr. Ndindabahizi there every time you went to see him at his office?
@A.
Most of the time I went there he was there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was he there even when you would show up unexpected to see him?
@A.
Yes, he was.  He was so busy that he could rarely get away.
@MR. BESNIER:
In spite of being busy, would it have been possible, during the month of April or May, for 
Mr. Ndindabahizi to leave for private issues without you knowing about it?
@A.
I don't know.  I didn't see him every hour of every day.  It would be pretentious to claim that I did.

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you ever know or learn that Mr. Ndindabahizi left his duties as minister of finance to distribute -- to go and distribute machetes in Kibuye, his native préfecture?
@A.
No, I never learned of such a situation.  That would be surprising to me, especially because I know Ndindabahizi very well.  When we were together in '73 in Butare there were Hutu and Tutsi tensions, and he never had any animosity whatsoever against the Tutsis.  I don't know, but based on what I know about him, I don't think that he would be capable of doing such things. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, besides his moral qualities, do these things seem physically or practically possible in your mind?
@A.
Well, given the position of a minister, it seems unthinkable that a minister would distribute machetes to the population.  Perhaps a conseiller could do it, but a minister, would he really go out and do that?  Personally -- this is my personal opinion -- I don't think so. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Leave your personal opinion aside.  Let's concentrate on the facts.  Can you say whether practically, would Mr. Ndindabahizi have the means and time to organise a trip to Kibuye to distribute machetes, given what you know?
@A.
Materially that would seem impossible to me, especially given the distance between Kibuye and Gitarama, and given his work and his workload in Gitarama.  I don't know if he could be in the two places at the same time, but it seems very improbable to me that he could be.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, what is the distance between Kibuye and Gitarama? 
@THE WITNESS:
I don't remember exactly.  It's pretty far, and the roads were not good. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
@THE WITNESS:
But I don't know the exact distance, especially since I've never been to Kibuye.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Can you give us an approximate distance? 
@THE WITNESS:
A hundred or so kilometres.  I'm not really sure. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the state of the road between Kibuye and Gitarama in 1994?
@A.
Well, it was still under repair.  All I know is that it was not easy to get there. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Sir, can you repeat, when did you leave Gitarama?
@A.
We left Gitarama on the 30th of May.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why?
@A.
Because of the RPF advance.  We were told to pack up our things and leave as quickly as possible.  On that day the RPF began to attack the market, and so we had to quickly prepare ourselves to leave.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you go after you left Gitarama?
@A.
We went directly to Gisenyi with part of the funds.  We only had one truck.  When we arrived in Gisenyi, I returned back with two soldiers to get the rest of the money. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did the government set up shop in Gisenyi?
@A.
At the Meridien Hotel. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And where did you stay when you were in Gisenyi?
@A.
I went to my in-laws.  It was two kilometres from Gisenyi, so I would just go to their house. 
@MR. BESNIER:
One clarification, there was one thing that is not clear.  Who did -- where did you live in Gitarama and where did you live in Gisenyi?
@A.
In Gitarama -- oh, no, rather in Gitarama it was at my in-laws'.  At Gisenyi it was with my own parents.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in Gisenyi?
@A.
Yes, from time to time, but we saw less of each other than in Gitarama.  But I would see him, because next to the Meridien Hotel there was an MRND office, and that's where people went to get passports quickly, because the situation was becoming serious and people were getting passports to be able to leave the country.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was your work in Gisenyi?
@A.
It was the same as it was before, the exact same job. 
@MR. BESNIER:
And what was Ndindabahizi's work in Gisenyi?
@A.
In principle, he had to do the same thing, but the situation changed.  There was practically chaos, save what you can.  Very few suppliers were paid, because the situation became very grave indeed.  It was chaos. 
@MR. BESNIER:
During that period, starting from the 30th of May in Gisenyi, how often did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi? 
@A.
Well, I would say not very often, perhaps once every three days, perhaps once every two days.  Not more than that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
When did you leave Gisenyi?
@A.
I spent the night at home, and on the 14th of July when I went to the office I saw that everything had been packed up.  I followed suit, so I left on the 14th of July in the morning, but there were so many vehicles on the road it took us two days to go to Goma.  When we arrived to Goma, it was two days later. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi when you left Gisenyi?
@A.
No, I was with my son, my wife, and other children had left on a bus which was transporting funds, in a bus or a truck.  I was in my own car.  That's why it took me two days to get across. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Ndindabahizi stay in Gisenyi? 
@A.
No.  When I arrived to Goma he was already there, and he had already set up there in Goma.
@MR. BESNIER:
Does that mean that he left before you to Goma?
@A.
In principle, yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, sir.  I don't have many more questions for you.  Perhaps just one or two remaining questions.
@MR. BESNIER:
I would ask the Registry for assistance for my last two questions, as I would like to distribute a document.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
I have given you a document, sir.  Do you have it before you?
@A.
Yes, I do.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you tell me, do you recognise this document?
@A.
No, I hadn't seen it before till I was at the place I'm staying. 
@MR. BESNIER:
You mean the place you are staying here in Arusha?
@A.
Yes.  I hadn't seen it before that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What is this document?  Can you describe it for us?  What is it used for?  What is it?
@A.
It is a document giving advice to witnesses on how they should behave themselves before the Tribunal.

Can you look at page 9 of this document, please?
@A.
Yes, sir.  Yes, I've found page 9.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is page 9?
@A.
This looks like a floor plan of a courtroom in -- of the Tribunal. 
@MR. BESNIER:
On this floor plan, can you find the place where you are seated?
@A.
Yes, I'm No. 2, at No. 2. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you see what is indicated at No. 4?
@A.
I see that the Accused is seated there at No. 4. 
@MR. BESNIER:
In this courtroom can you see where the Accused is?
@A.
Yes, I see him behind you, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Before coming into this courtroom, did you know where the Accused was?
@A.
No, I saw this document in the house where I was staying. 
@MR. BESNIER:
That's not my question, sir.  What I mean is, by reading this floor plan, would you have an idea of where the Accused would be seated in the courtroom?
@A.
Not at first sight, no, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Regarding this floor plan, would you have an idea if whether -- where the Accused is sitting; to the right of you, behind you, to the left of you?
@A.
Well, I would have to look at how the courtroom is situated to know what side is right and left.
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, now that you are in this courtroom, and after looking at this floor plan --
@A.
I see that he is on the right-hand side.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you identify the Office of the Prosecutor?
@A.
Yes.  It's at No. 5, I believe.  Yes, at No. 5, to my left. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you identify the Bench?
@A.
Yes, the Judges are just in front of me. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you see the seat of the Accused?
@A.
Yes, it's to my right, at No. 4. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you find this document when you came to the safe house?
@A.
Yes, I found it when I arrived at the safe house.  There was a document in French and another one in Kinyarwanda.
@MR. BESNIER:
This document is also in Kinyarwanda?
@A.
Yes, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do all the witnesses get this document?
@A.
Yes.  It's in the living room over there at the safe house.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Witness, and good to see you again.
Witness, I'm going to ask you some questions about your testimony in this courtroom, and if I ask you any questions that may seek to identify you or you feel uncomfortable with, please let me know, because some of them impact on the work that you did in 1994.  Do you understand that, sir?
@A.
Yes, I do understand that, Prosecutor. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Prior to the genocide of 1994, you were employed at the same institution that you have testified to this afternoon, were you not, sir?
@A.
Yes, yes.  I've been working there since 1974, in actual fact. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you, in 1994, held the same position that you testified to in this courtroom earlier today?  Just a yes or no; don't repeat the position, please.
@A.
Yes, the same position as I occupied since June 1993, I believe. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the institution that you worked for was what we, in my language, we call the bankers' bank, was it not, sir?
@A.
Yes, in principle, because it's the one that oversees all the banks. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  And would I be correct in saying that by virtue of that function of that -- that oversight function, the bankers' bank regulates the functions of what we call the commercial banks, does it not, sir?
@A.
Yes, sir, especially credit and exchange operations. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it also true that most of the reserves of the commercial banks are always held by the bankers' bank?  That's why it is called the bankers' bank, isn't it, sir?
@A.
No, not true.  Each bank was entitled to keeping its own funds.  The bank only oversaw the level of foreign exchange as far as the entire country is concerned, but it didn't have direct control over the commercial banks. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, that wasn't my question.  My question to you was as follows:  the bankers' bank, by regulatory authority, demands statutorily that commercial banks keep a certain amount of their funds with the bankers' bank; is that right?  They can't keep all their money in their own vaults, can they?
@A.
To my knowledge, no.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you say no to now, Mr. Witness?  That became unclear.  So just what is your position?
@THE WITNESS:
No, the banks' funds belong to the banks, but the use of the foreign exchange, it is done under regulations from the bank.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But are the commercial banks or the normal banks obliged to have part of their funds in the bankers' bank; that's the question. 
@THE WITNESS:
No, not to my knowledge, that is not the regulation at national level as far as I'm concerned, if I refer to what I used to do before I was appointed, because before that I was also at the directorate for foreign exchange.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  Now, your operation -- within your operation, how many staff did you have before the genocide, sir?
@A.
About 15. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And how many of those staff were of the Tutsi ethnic group, sir?
@A.
I didn't ask them for their ethnic groups.  It is difficult to answer that question because I did not seek to know their ethnic groups.  It is a piece of information that I do not have.  I did not make any efforts to seek such information.  Probably somebody else can answer that question. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, is it your testimony, sir, that you were never aware of the ethnic groups in 1994 of those who worked with you, sir?
@A.
No, they were Hutus and Tutsis, really.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Let me ask you the question -- let me ask you the question in another way.  Did you have all 15 members of your immediate office after April 6th 1994?  How many of the 15 worked when you got to Gitarama; let's put it that way.
@A.
Well, I used to work alone.  I used the commercial bank staff, especially for typing assignments and operations like crediting accounts.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's precisely what I thought the situation was, sir.  Now, what had happened to the 15 or 14 or so staff that worked in your immediate office after April 6 1994, sir?
@A.
I have no clue, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So when Mr. Ndindabahizi prevailed on you and others on the 12th of April at your in-laws' house, you had no idea what had happened to the 14 or so people or 15 people that worked in your immediate office, sir?  Is that your testimony, sir?
@A.
No, sir, I said that after the murder of the president there was a curfew and we all hid in our houses.  I was only able to go out on the 12th when the situation subsided.  We were able to leave Kigali.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  Very well, sir.  So it would suffice to say that when you then moved to Gitarama you ran pretty much a one-man operation, didn't you, sir?
@A.
No, sir.  There were other members of the team, including the accountant general or the auditor-general, who was the head of the mission.  He came next to the governor in this operation.  We had the director for banking operations, and there was also -- there were also two agents that were found in Gitarama.  They were responsible for producing cash-desk receipts.  So that as far as we were concerned, that was the team. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  I'm more interested in, sir, of the members of your immediate office, would I be correct in saying that you were running a one-man operation, not the entire institution, but your operation, your unit?
@A.
Yes, in my unit, my unit, I was practically alone, apart from the fact that I used people that I found there. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And would I be correct in saying that there is a very obvious distinction, sir, between your role and the functions that you performed, the very practical function that you performed, and the role of people like the auditor-general and governors and things like that?  There was an obvious distinction, practically, on a day-to-day basis, was there not, sir?
@A.
Absolutely.  Absolutely different.  Totally different, actually. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that based on that practical distinction, you ran a very manual operation?  It was not theoretical, it was manual, hands-on?  Is that a good way of describing your functions at the time?
@A.
Manual, yes, but not routine, because it was not routine work.  There was some discretion to the exercise, for example, which account was to be credited, et cetera, et cetera, so that it was not routine.  There was some cross-checking of accounts or orders to be made beforehand, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Pardon me, Witness, I didn't imply at all that the work was routine.  What I actually meant was that it actually needed you physically to be present, it wasn't automated; that is what I was trying to say.  Do you understand that, sir?
@A.
Yes, yes.  Yes, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You then testified earlier this afternoon that you then, because of the nature of your operation, of your unit, you needed to enlist the help of some people from some other bank; is that what you said, sir?
@A.
Other people?  No, I -- there were bank officials that were there that helped me prepare the credit vouchers, and after that I handed it over to the payees, who got paid by the main cashier.  So that I had my own work and the others had their own work. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And in terms of your office accommodation at the location you were between April and 30th May in Gitarama, you were located in the commercial centre in Gitarama with other commercial banks; is that not the situation?  You were using the facilities --
@A.
Yes, it was at the commercial centre, because the two banks were next to each other, at about one kilometre one from the other inside Gitarama city, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In other words, you were using the facilities of existing banking institutions, commercial banking institutions in Gitarama, were you not, sir?
@A.
Yes, that were there in Gitarama. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, whilst you --
@A.
Yes, still in Gitarama, in the office of the commercial banks that were there. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, whilst you were temporarily located in Gitarama, did you know a man by the name Gerard Kwangegyo, K-W-A-N-G-E-G-Y-O, Gerard, a young man who worked for Bank Kigali?
@A.
No, I don't know him. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, the government at the time was located in Murambi, was it not, sir?
@A.
Yes, sir. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you testified earlier that as far as you were aware, Murambi was some two kilometres from Gitarama; was that not your testimony, sir?
@A.
Two or three, I can't remember, approximately. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I represent to you, sir, that it was, rather, four kilometres, sir; would you agree with me?  Could it have been slightly more?
@A.
One kilometre, more or less.  I'm not saying precisely that it was three, but one kilometre plus or minus, I don't see the difference.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The location in Murambi consisted of what, where the government was located at the time?  What did that location in Murambi consist of?  What was it before the government got there?
@A.
Before the government occupied those premises, I believe it was a training centre for cadets for Murambi, that is, for the central administration of Murambi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So it was like a --
@A.
It was where they trained civil servants, that is cadets. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it was -- it was a compound, it was an enclosure, wasn't it?  It was like a compound, it wasn't just on the street?  It had a main gate, didn't it?
@A.
If I'm not mistaken, there was a main gate with several buildings inside, but the main gate was not always locked, perhaps with the exception of the night.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do you know why it was necessary for the government to move from Kigali to Gitarama, sir, at this time?
@A.
Really I cannot answer that question because they could have done so in sovereignty -- in their sovereignty. They didn't talk to us to go there, and I don't know why they chose that location instead of another.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would you agree with me if I represented to you, sir, that the government moved from Kigali to Gitarama for security reasons, sir?
@A.
Certainly, because the city of Kigali was engulfed with fighting.  If not for reasons of security, perhaps for other reasons, because they couldn't worked in a city that was almost falling.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, would you also agree with me, sir, that the location in Murambi afforded the government an element of security for at least six weeks, sir?  Would that be a fair assumption to make, sir?
@A.
Security, it is quite relative.  Probably they were in greater security or not, but I'm sure if they chose that location it was because they were in greater security.  Perhaps there are other reasons to that effect, so to tell you the truth, I cannot give you my opinion on this one.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You testified that as far as you know the gate of the complex in Murambi was often open, except at night.  Is it therefore your testimony that you could go in and out of that compound at will?
@A.
Yes, sir.  At any rate, whenever I went there it was open.  Yes, it was open.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And how did you go there, sir, did you walk, did you drive your car, did you -- how did you go?
@A.
No, there was a vehicle of the national bank that we used in Gitarama.  There was a Combi minibus, a Nissan Combi minibus -- no, sorry, Toyota.  It was a Toyota.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it is therefore your testimony that you could access that location any time you wanted to, couldn't you?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And remind me, the location we are talking about was the location that at the time housed the president of the republic, didn't it?  Yes or no, or was he somewhere else?
@A.
No, he also had an apartment there.  Practically all the ministers had apartments there in those premises.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So the president was there, the prime minister was there, the entire cabinet was there, and it is your testimony that you could just access it at any time?
@A.
No, not the apartments they lived in, but the office area, because there were different sections.  There was a section for the apartments and residences, and another section for the offices.  People could accede the office very easily (sic) -- or accede to the office or access them, but the other section, no.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  Now, I want to talk you to about the sort of things that you did in terms of your functions.  Is it your testimony, sir, that you reported to someone other than Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time?
@A.
Yes, sir.  Yes, I did say so, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And in terms of the hierarchy of your particular institution, you had, as your immediate superior, the treasurer or the director of finance; which one came first?
@A.
Who came first?  It was my boss, that is the cashier general, who at that time was sick, unfortunately.  He was there but he didn't do much because he was ill.  By the way, he died later on.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And after him was who -- came who?
@A.
After him, it was the auditor general, who oversaw the entire staff of the national bank apart from the governor -- or, rather, instead of the governor, that is, on behalf the governor.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And then the governor himself?
@A.
After the governor you mean? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, and then came the governor?
@A.
No.  It was the auditor general who was practically the overall head, and then the governor.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  And in terms of the dealings with the ministry of finance, who was in charge of that liaison between the two institutions prior to the genocide?
@A.
Before the genocide, at what level?  At the level -- as the overall -- as the overall supervisor?  Well, firstly, I dealt directly with the treasurer who gave out instruction for payments who was under the orders or instructions of the ministry of finance, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Where did the chef de cabinet and the director of budget feature?
@A.
The chef de cabinet, I didn't deal with him before and even after, because the chief of cabinet was between his minister and the other ministries.  It was not with us that he worked.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So despite the fact that you didn't have any official established lines of -- reporting lines, it is your testimony, sir, that during this critical period in the country you had reason to report directly to 
Mr. Ndindabahizi, is it not, sir?
@A.
Yes, I said so and I underscore that.  It was upon the expressed request of the governor the national bank who told me that I could report thus to Ndindabahizi directly if he needed such information.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you have any official correspondence between yourself and Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time?
@A.
No, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Everything was off the cuff, informal, oral?
@A.
Well, apart from the fact that I used to give him figures of payments which were made out to suppliers and for salaries, I gave him the balance as well, and that was on a piece of paper and he used it as he wished, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you would write, for example, two million dollars on a scrap piece of paper and just show it to him that that's what the government has got in the bank; it's that sort of thing?  That was the way it worked, didn't it?
@A.
Well, that's not the way to operate, but if I gave him information, whether it was in writing or not, it was between himself and me.  He did what he wanted to do with the information because the governor had -- the governor had confidence in him and he was the boss too.  I could have told him verbally or given it to him in writing.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, why was it necessary on the 12th of April for you to -- for Colonel Bagosora to come and pick you up at your in-law's house and take you into the complex in Murambi?
@A.
It was not Bagosora that came to fetch me from my in-law's, it was Ndindabahizi, I said, himself.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You are correct, pardon me.  I meant on the 13th, the following day, not the first day, the 13th of April.  Why was it necessary for the soldier or whoever picked you up and -- why was that necessary?  Why didn't you just drive into the complex yourself?
@A.
Well, they came to my in-law's very early in the morning and they came to fetch me in a vehicle.  Of course I could walk down there, but it is rather far.  From my house to Murambi -- from my in-law's to Murambi, already from my in-law's to the city is one kilometre, plus four kilometres on foot.  I believe it was natural for them to come and fetch me by a vehicle.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But you had the Combi, the Combi belonging to your institution, which I don't want to be tempted to mention.  Where was the Combi at that time?
@A.
But the Combi only started working with us later on.  At that time it was in Kigali.  We only took it when we went to Gitarama.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the previous day, how had Mr. Ndindabahizi become aware that you had arrived in Gitarama and were lodging at your in-law's?  Did he know your in-law's house beforehand, sir?
@A.
Yes, yes, because he was a friend of my wife's aunty who also lives very near my in-laws, very near the -- opposite the Gitarama market actually.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, that's what I thought.   In fact, he was some distant relative, was he not, sir?
@A.
Not to my knowledge.  I knew him, but before that date, I did not meet him apart from the time we were at university.  He'd gone his own way and me, mine.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I was just going to come to that.  But despite the fact that he was able to find his way to your in-laws' house on his own on the 12th of April, it was you testimony earlier in this Court that you hadn't set eyes on this man since you left university.  Wasn't it, sir?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And during all the time that you both worked in Kigali, him at his place of work at the ministry of finance, and you at your place of work, the place where we've discussed already, it is your testimony, sir -- wait a minute, sir, wait, wait, wait, just wait --
@A.
Already --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is your testimony, sir, that you never ever had any official business with each other, let alone personal, sir?
@A.
Yes.  At any rate, he was only appointed director of cabinet when the parties were there.  He was director of cabinet for PSD.  It was -- it was very recently that he had -- he was appointed minister of finance.  Before that I didn't know where he worked.  Even at the time he was director of cabinet, I knew about it but I didn't meet him at the time.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, he had been the director of cabinet for two years before the genocide, sir, 1992; two years.
@A.
No.  In 19 -- with the advent of the parties; is that correct? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You think about it. 
@A.
It is possible, but I wasn't interested in that.  I didn't go and see him at the ministry of finance, at any rate.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
More importantly, sir, you didn't have any official reporting lines or connections with him since 1992, did you, you didn't, no?
@A.
Yes, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Sir, were you a member of the crisis committee at the institution where you worked in 1994?  Did the institution have a crisis committee and were you a member of it?
@A.
I never knew about any crisis committee at the national bank.  There was never any.  We just worked as normally as possible.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And is it your testimony that during the month of April -- I'm not talking about May now -- the month of April, Mr. Ndindabahizi did not leave Murambi at all?
@A.
Not to my knowledge.  I saw him practically every day.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And is it also your testimony, sir, that you saw him everyday because you worked officially with him, and you sometimes socialised with him in the evening, sir?  That's how come you saw him every day, sir.
@A.
Yes.  And on formal occasions sometimes after work he would find me at the aunt's house that I spoke about.  We would talk for a few seconds and then he would leave.  Or before going home I would see him in Murambi.  He was coming -- he would come in front, pass by, but the conversations we had was at the aunt's house.  Sometimes I would go to see that old woman that was his friend for a long time.  She was a friend of his family. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it is your testimony that you are able to account for movement -- listen to this very carefully -- from at least the 15th of April 1994 to the end of the month of April, isn't it, sir?
@A.
No, I did not assert that.  I said that I saw him from time to time, but I did not follow him every single hour.  I could not know where he was every day of every minute -- every minute of every day, rather.  We would meet sometimes 10 minutes in Murambi, but it doesn't mean that we were always together.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let me rephrase my question.  Is it your testimony that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at least every day?
@A.
Yes, once or twice a day.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, between at least the 12th to the end of April, not the 15th, the 12th; is that not correct, sir?
@A.
No, not from the 12th; from the 15th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Why not?
@A.
Because on the 12th I saw him in the morning -- no, no, on the 12th he came to see me one evening.  The 13th we left to Kigali.  The 13th in the morning I saw him.  We had finished transferring the funds and documents on or around the 14th, I believe, and we began work on the 15th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So, let's go over it.  12th, one sighting, p.m., correct?  You saw him once on the 12th, in the evening?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Location, your in-law's, correct?
@A.
Yes, yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Second sighting: first thing in the morning, 13th; location, Murambi?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Fourteenth, no sighting?
@A.
No.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Then 15th to -- I don't know how many days April has, perhaps 30 -- 15th to 30th April you saw him every day, at least once a day, at least?
@A.
Yes, you had that -- that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I just wanted to make sure I got you right.  Now, let's go to the month of May.  Now from the 1st of May to the 31st of May, you saw him at least, at least once a day, save for the period when he was in Nairobi for seven days on mission at a time which you can't remember, but some seven days.  For the rest of that month you saw him at least once every day until the end of that month, sir?
@A.
Up until the 28th May, because on the 28th of May before we moved, there was a dangerous situation in Gitarama and I think people left before us.  You could no longer move about because there were bombings very close. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So what happened on the 28th; 28th you stopped seeing him?
@A.
The 28th and 29th we couldn't go to Murambi, the fighting was coming closer.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So when was the last time you saw him before the fighting started getting closer, 20-something; do you remember?
@A.
I saw him from the 27th but from the 28th I no longer saw him.  But I saw him in Gisenyi upon our arrival on the 30th.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay, so you saw him on 27th, you didn't see him on the 28th, you didn't see him on the 29th, but you saw him in Gisenyi on the 30th of May?
@A.
Yes, yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, let's go to the month of June.  Did you see him every day from the 1st of June to the 30th of June, sir, at least once a day?
@A.
I told you that I saw him not as often as I would in Gitarama, and I would see him once every two or three days in Gisenyi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And this was despite the fact that you had to combine seeing him with your duties at the time, which was as you state them to be.  You did your work and you also met with him throughout this 
three-month period, sir?
@A.
In Gisenyi, I also said that work was not as regular as it was in Gitarama.  The situation had completely changed.  Even our contact with each other was limited.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have no further questions.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I have no re-examination, Mr. President.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I have one question.  
Where was the governor during the period April to May, and May to June?
@THE WITNESS:
He was also in Gitarama.  He would also come to see me from time to time, but I saw him less often.  He would come to see me, he would return to Murambi.  I saw him not so frequently because we had a direct supervisor who -- the controller general who supervised the work.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
So both the governor and the controller general were present there and available? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, but the governor and the controller met often.  The controller general would give information from him to us.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I understand a minister of finance to be a political head in that ministry. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Not only political, though.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
But you have stated that the Accused would -- did you say would approve, or look at which 
suppliers --
@THE WITNESS:
There were contracts.  The interim government had decided to give advances to the suppliers because they could no longer get credit to buy supplies.  So the government asked the banks to give it advances.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
So what was the role of the Accused in that as a political head of the ministry of finance? 
@THE WITNESS:
As a political authority, I don't know.  I know what I did with him, but on a political level, I don't know what his responsibilities in that manner would have been.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And what did you do with him?  If you could repeat that for me, please.
@THE WITNESS:
What we did together?  Well, I would only meet him to give him the information he requested, but we would not discuss politics.  Politics was not something I dealt with.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Did he give you instructions on what to do about suppliers and things like that? 
@THE WITNESS:
No.  He only wanted information on the deposits in the coffers.  And he needed that information on -- such information to be able to distribute the vouchers and decide on which suppliers to use.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you have given detailed description of his activities in Gitarama, Gisenyi and Ngoma.  Admittedly, Mr. Ndindabahizi was not you boss, or you were not his subordinate or his secretary.  You were only helping him with financial information under the direction of the governor of the national bank.  Could you tell us --
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, upon instructions of the governor.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Could you tell us, how did you get to know his personal day-to-day activities in those cities, such as visiting -- receiving the visitors, suppliers looking for him, and his other personal activities? 
@THE WITNESS:
I would see the suppliers who would go to see him when I went to Murambi.  Regarding his other activities, I said that I would go to give him information but not really to see what he was doing outside of the times I would see him.  I supplied him with the information and he would continue to work with his team.  I didn't know in detail what all of his activities were.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This period from the 15th of April to the end of April, on one occasion you said that, "I used to see him practically every day".  On another occasion you said, "I saw him once or twice every day".  Now, what is exactly the correct description of the frequency, Mr. Witness, in this period? 
@THE WITNESS:
Once or twice.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you ever a member of any political party after --
@THE WITNESS:
Not a member, but I was a supporter of the MRND.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that also after the multiparty system? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  But before we were automatically members of the MRND.  After that, each individual could make his or her own choice.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, that's why I asked that question; that's why I asked that question.  So you had no affiliation with the PSD, for instance?  That's the point.  You had no PSD affiliation either?
@THE WITNESS:
No, Your Honour.  I was not an activist either in the MRND, but I did support that party. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  This brings us to the end of your testimony.  Thank you very much for having come the long way to give testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home, and please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much, indeed.
@THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You will now be accompanied out, Mr. Witness, and then we will just have a few technical practical issues at the end.

1630H
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  That was the end of the week, Mr. Besnier, but we have to plan the week in one week.  So could you, maybe, now indicate the schedule for the week in about a fortnight or in ten days?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  For the week of the 10th, 10th to the 17th, we, unfortunately, will not have any witnesses to present.  In fact, we have very few left.  We are waiting for Witness DD who can be in  Arusha on the 17th of November, that would be a Monday, and who can start testifying on that same day.  
We are also waiting for the expert witness, who can be in Arusha on the 17th of November in the evening.  We could like to work with the expert at least for the day, the following Tuesday, so that he would be able to testify on the 18th of November in the afternoon, and I think that one day will be sufficient for the examination-in-chief, and that would enable the Prosecution to cross-examine on the 19th of November, 19th or - - 20th.
After that we will have the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  If we look at our calendar, I think that he can begin testifying on the 24th of November, if my math is correct.  I think that examination-in-chief of Mr. Ndindabahizi should last approximately half a day, perhaps one whole day -- one whole day, perhaps, in examination-in-chief.  
In other words, I should have finished my case by the 26th of November at the very latest. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. And in fact there is some possible room here if you look at period from the 17th to the 21st.  Maybe we would even proceed a bit faster than you just outlined.  But at any rate, DD goes first, then some time, then the expert and then Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
@MR. BESNIER:
That is correct, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  
All right, the parties finished their examination and cross-examination within the estimates they gave yesterday.  Thank you very much.  
Thank you to everyone in the courtroom for having been sitting this afternoon, and we wish you a very good weekend.  Thank you.

@MR. BESNIER:
Good afternoon, Expert. 
@A.
Good afternoon, Counsellor.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, probably we would gain time if the Prosecutor would tell us whether he wanted to question the expert on his CV, or make observations on the expert CV, because if there were no objections on the part of the Prosecution on the CV, we should go straight into business.
@MR. KAPAYA:
We haven't got a copy of the expert CV.  No, we don't have a copy. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we just found it in front of us now when we entered the courtroom. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I thought that the CV had already been served to the Prosecution, but this is not the case.  I am sorry for that.  I shall ask a few questions of the expert concerning his CV, and then we should go on to the report of the expert.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What you might wish to do is to simply allow the Prosecution to look, glance quickly through the CV. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Unfortunately, it is in French so we cannot make any -- you know, a quick assessment of it.  We'll give it to our assistant and see what can be done.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead, please, Mr. Besnier. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  In this case, I should like the CV to be offered as an exhibit, but following the testimony of Mr. Lugan.  This will give time to the Prosecution to look through the document.

@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. Expert, if you take a quick glance at your CV, I see at the last line on the first page that you are a lecturer, a distinctive expert.
@A.
Well, this is the university language in the French system, as the French language would classify.  It means that my salary scale is at the highest; that is, the highest grade as far as salary is concerned.  For lecturers, it is an honour, and it is also financial in real terms.  Do you want me to go into details?  Is that answer satisfactory?
@MR. BESNIER:
We shall take a few seconds between the questions so the interpreters can interpret into English. 
What subject do you teach?
@A.
The history of Africa, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
And since when?
@A.
Since 1972.  My first post was at the National University of Rwanda.  I taught as a professor at the University of Rwanda from 1972 to 1983, first of all in Butare in the south and Ruhengeri in the north.  From 1983, I was appointed at the University of Lyon, and since that time I have been working at the University of Lyon.  That is approximately 30 years that I have been teaching the history of Africa.
@MR. BESNIER:
Apart from the period during which you taught at the University of Rwanda, did you travel inside Africa, especially around the Great Lakes and Rwanda, in particular?
@A.
Mr. President, my research area at the university is precisely Rwanda, because my thesis, my doctoral thesis -- and my doctoral thesis (interpretation unintelligible) is on Rwanda, pre-colonial Rwanda, colonial Rwanda, so that I stayed in various areas of the Great Lakes areas.  But it is not only the Great Lakes that I am interested in, because I published a history of Morocco, a history of Egypt, a history of South Africa, several general works concerning areas that are more expansive in Africa, especially -- this is a voluminous book that came out four years ago on the history of Rwanda; and I am ready to publish in April a book on the history of the genocide; and this week in the United States, a book entitled The African Legacy, which thought (sic) on the history of Africa by a research worker who has been roving the continent over the last 30 years and has come to a stage where he could put something down on paper from his own point of view.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The book that you just held up to us, I see on page two there that you have Livres publiés.  Which number is that book, please, on your list? 
@THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, this is -- let me see through the list.  It is paradoxical to see that this book is not in my bibliography.  Perhaps I forgot.  Let me see.  Yes, thank you, Counsellor, twelve, History of Rwanda, From Prehistory to Our Day, 604 pages, 48 maps.  I'm sorry, Mr. President, for that.  Sometimes I get lost in my list of publications. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I believe that that suffices, appears to me to be comprehensive.  The Defence is happy about your competence as far as this area is concerned.  We could, therefore, begin to talk about your report, your expert report.  
Expert -- you have served (interpretation unintelligible) report entitled, "Report by Bernard Lugan", expert witness before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us go through the report, the expert report.  We will be more precise concerning questions of pertinence to this case and Tribunal, but so far as questions I should like to ask you, Expert, we all know that the contemporary history of Rwanda appears to be linked to the coexistence of various ethnic groups on the Rwandan territory.  Very quickly, could you say more about that, about the ethnic groups, which are the ethnic groups, where do they come from, and when did they settle down in Rwandan territory.
@A.
Counsel, the question is very important because there is the (interpretation unintelligible) of reality, on the one hand, and then there is the imaginary.  It so happens that the imaginary is, of course, very determining in the events that came afterwards.  
Now, I should like to dwell on a particular issue that is concerning the second point of your question.  Rapidly, I would like to say that this is all known that there are three ethnic groups, the pigmy, the Batwa, the Hutu and the Tutsi.  Now, when one says that one has said all, one has said nothing, because the Hutu and the Tutsi speak the same language.  They have the same religion, the same value systems.  They were aware of belonging to the same state.  Now, semantically speaking, these are not different ethnic groups; they are members of the same ethnic group because the ethnicity is cultural.  We are faced with another thing.  We are faced with two populations which originally were different, and the most modern and contemporary research on this issue would allow us to make considerable progress.  
Now, the Hutu, for example, the (interpretation unintelligible) of the Hutu, that is the proto-Hutu, as they could be called, come from West Africa, following extensive migrations, that are known to linguistic archaeology, and Professor Vansina.  Now, these ancestors of the Hutus arrived when?  It is an open question.  It could be said that they arrived between 8 BC and 500 BC.  Now, we know that they didn't circumvent the forest by the north, but they crossed it from Manyema, and from Manyema, they went through Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika.  Linguistic archaeology would determine that the languages in those areas are proto languages of all the Bantu languages around the lakes, which shows the migration.  
As far as the Tutsi are concerned, the situation is more complicated because of the official ideology of the Hutu monarchy, just as the official ideology of the Hutu monarchy was tantamount to saying that the Tutsi arrived recently.  Now, why is that?  Because when the last clans, the Nyginya, the Bega, gave rise to the contemporary and modern monarchy of Rwanda, when they arrived, they are talking about the last migration, because all of the Tutsi, just as all of the pastoral population in the Great Lakes areas and in East Africa, came from the north.  The phenomenon is well known.  It is related to the last phase of the drying up of the Sahara.  And those populations left the Sahara towards the Nile valley -- present-day Sudan.  It took them from 700 BC, and then they went down.  
So that, firstly, in Rwanda and in Burundi, in the Great Lake areas and in eastern Africa, there are pastoral populations of the Tutsi type or Tutsi typology.  But those who were going to create modern Rwanda were the last to arrive.  They arrived in the 14th-15th centuries.  And in order to assert their (interpretation unintelligible) regions invented a divine origin, the Ibimanuka, "that which came from the sky", to determine their civilisation.  So that we are faced with a considerable contradiction here.  We know through archaeology, through history, that the proto-Tutsi, or the P-Tutsi, were there for more than 2,000 years, but the official Tutsi traditions, they ought to legitimise the presence of those people.  So that we are faced with two historical situations created by the Tutsi monarchy.  
Now, the actual (interpretation unintelligible) is that the Hutu are going to use the official mystique, official Tutsi and dynastic mystique, to legitimise the 1959 revolution that we will talk about later on.  So that if you ask me when did the Tutsi arrive, my answer is that for the majority of the Tutsi population, probably 2,000 years ago, but for the leading clans and for the Nyginya, the Bega and the other clans, probably in the 14th or 15th century, because the migrations -- a long migration.  Here, we are at the crux of the entire contradiction -- of the contradictions in the Great Lakes area. 
Mr. President, if we miss that point, we cannot understand the rest of it, because the history of Rwanda is based on a series of falsifications, but those falsifications are culturally dominant.  Hence, what is not said in the history of Rwanda is there.  
Have I satisfied you, Counsel?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  All that is very interesting, Expert.  We have gone very far into the past.  Now, let me bring you back to a more recent period.  You have explained to us, and I thank you for that, that one couldn't understand the contemporary history of Rwanda without shedding light on the more early history of that country.  You've talked about the ethnic groups.  Now could you tell us, on the basis of the history of Rwanda, the history of Rwanda, has it revealed any cleavages, differences, social, economic, political differences between the two main ethnic groups; that is, the Tutsi and the Hutu?
@A.
Counsel, yes -- there are two -- yes and no.  Yes and no, because it all depends on the area that you want to talk about.  It should be said that each and every one wanted to get their system to prevail.  The Tutsi didn't control all of Rwanda.  (Interpretation unintelligible) demonstrated this in his work, in his thesis.  Ferdinand Nahimana, who was one of my colleagues at the university, he worked on prehistory.  (Interpretation unintelligible) demonstrated that Hutu power didn't govern the entire Rwanda.  The Bushiro mountainous areas and the surrounding areas were controlled by the Tutsis during the colonial period only.  
Now, what happened is that in former Rwanda we were dealing with royal domains controlled by the monarchy.  There were peripheral areas which, with history, would be dominated.  
Now, the administration of the land was very peculiar.  The administration was three-fold.  In former Rwanda, that is before 1900, you had agriculture and pastoralism.  The mutwale wa butaka is the first on the line.  These stages are very important because Belgian colonialism brought up an upheaval and Tutsi-ised that area.  And then there is the second stage, and then the third stage, the herdsman.  The lead herdsman is very important for the Tutsi.  
Now, it so happens that in the former Rwandan monarchy in general, three functions were held by the Tutsi chiefs -- in general, not all the time.  And we've seen many cases in which the land governor was Hutu.  So that the Hutu problem -- the Hutu-Tutsi problems were not there in the former monarchy, just as they are from the colonial period onwards.  They were not created by the colonial period.  But it is a matter of course that when the Belgian administration from 1924 and 1929 reorganised the administrative system in Rwanda, what did it do?  What did the Belgians do?  It extended throughout Rwanda what was prevalent in the areas of the Tutsi royal domain.  And it was at that time that we saw Hutu areas that had never been administered by the Tutsi being put under Tutsi chief administration.  And from that time onwards, the (interpretation unintelligible) hierarchy had no Hutu.  Before independence, out of the 555 sub-chieftains, there are only about 14 left.  
Now, this shows the development of these administrative situations.  That is why I am saying yes and no -- I'm answering yes and no to your question.  Is that acceptable to you?
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  As we said, this is very important.  Perhaps you should speak a little bit slower so the English interpreter can follow you perfectly.  
Now, you were talking about the colonial period of Rwanda just now.  Up to what date did that colonial period extend?  At what date did Belgian colonialists exercise power over Rwanda?
@A.
Well, one thing, there were no Belgian colonialists.  It was in '62 that Rwanda became independent, with self-government in 1961.  Throughout the Belgian period, this was what it was before the Belgian administration from 1897 to 1816 was -- 1917, it was -- Germany was there.  It was the United Nations that entrusted it to Belgium, and the United Nations confirmed that tutelage to Belgium.  So that there was no, so to speak, colonisation by Belgium.  Congo was a different matter, between '47 
and '42 (sic).  There was a report we had given to the United Nations on their mission.  The mission was to get Rwanda -- to lead Rwanda towards independence.  There were not masters there.  Rwanda wasn't a colony.  It was an indirectly administered area. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, to the point, then, how administratively and politically was Rwanda administered before the 1959 revolution, and what was the role of the various ethnic groups, that is, the Hutu and the Tutsi?
@A.
Well, there was a vice-governor that was in Rwanda.  There were ten territories with territorial leaders.  There was a certain number of chieftainships, and a certain number of sub-chieftainships.  After 1924, we had 47 chieftaincies and five, six, seven sub-chieftaincies.  It is through these chiefs and 
sub-chiefs that Belgium governed.  But it was not Brussels; it was Kabgayi; it was a Catholic mission in Belgium: all of them participated in the administration of that area.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, this system, was it stable, or up to the time of the 1959 revolution did it change considerably?
@A.
No, not considerably, but there were arrangements here and there in the following sense.  Belgium tried, as soon as 1949 and '50, tried to associate the Hutu more to the administration and created the supreme council for the country.  And in that supreme council, that was dominantly Tutsi, Belgium tried to inject more Hutu.  But you can say that the administration was not the crux in the genesis of what happened and which led to 1959.  
I believe that the most important thing is to see -- let me come back to the religious aspect, which is very basic in determining.  The colonisers of Rwanda was the Catholic Church.  It was -- the Kabgayi archbishop was the real master.  A policy in Rwanda developed between 1916 and 1962 and was developed in Kabgayi.  And during the first republic it was done at Kabgayi.  We'll talk about this later on, but what is essential here is to see the manner in which the Catholic Church developed.  Because all the stakeholders in Rwanda, all things in Rwanda, are affected by the way the Catholic Church developed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us go into the details.  Thanks to you, we know that the church played a considerable role between -- 1959 revolution.  In which manner did it play a role vis-à-vis the ethnic groups?  Did it favour one to the detriment of the other or vice-versa?
@A.
No, the Catholic Church came on the basis of a lie, a state lie.  It came to chase the slave traders, which never were in Rwanda, because there were no slave traders in Rwanda.  They were accused of being in Rwanda.  Of course they wanted an argument.  They had problems in Uganda with the Muslims.  They had problems with the court in Belgium.  They had problems with the Ugandan matters, which were very well known.  They had problems everywhere.  In East Africa, the Protestants were there.  Rwanda was a virgin, so far as external religious influence was concerned.  So they had to come in very quickly.  They used the slave trade as an excuse to come into Rwanda.  They came into Rwanda in 1889-1900.  
So they were received courteously at the court because they were sent by the Germans.  The people in the court were very careful; they couldn't receive them otherwise.  Now, they were given land to keep them aside in the south (interpretation unintelligible) where they set up their first mission.  That was against the royal power.  
Now, so that there was the order of the white fathers with Cardinal Lavigerie (interpretation unintelligible), babouche dress and chéchie, in sort of eastern-looking attire that was meant to re-evangelise the people in East Africa.  They came to Rwanda to change the religion of the chiefs.  
Now, the Tutsi did not want anything about that religion.  They did not understand it.  They didn't know the basis of Rwandan civilisation.  So that was the first contradiction, because -- now, who was going to be converted first?  Of course it was the Tutsi power that -- it was the Hutu who understood that the missionaries were powerful, they were supported by Germany, and they arrived.  They came in with people that transformed the feudal relationship from the Tutsi chief to the Catholic mission by saying the missionary protector will be higher than the chief; at any rate, he will be less exploitative than the chief.  So that the missionaries that came to convert the chiefs saw the rebellious subjects of the chiefs convert themselves.  So that when the 1914 war erupted, there were no Tutsi who were baptised, but thousands of Hutu were baptised.  
Now, as far as the court is concerned, royal court, people were beginning to think chiefs were saying, "Well, is our competition correct?  If we continue along these lines, most Hutu will be Catholics and we're going to lose.  Our power will be gone".  And the movement developed from 1916 onwards, when the Belgians gave more support to the missionaries as compared to the Germans, because the Germans had maintained parity between the Protestants and the Catholics.  In 1916 there were no more Protestants because they went with the Germans.  So there were only Catholics.  The (interpretation unintelligible) Catholics, that's Belgians, supported the missionaries.  So that the Tutsi chief -- well, it is time for us to change policy.  
Now, Monsignor Classe, Léon Classe, that is the Archbishop of Rwanda, felt that there was a chance.  He established contacts with a certain number of young chiefs that were around King Musinga, and they signed an agreement, a gentleman's agreement, we may call it, an agreement.  We are going 
to -- the Tutsi said, "We are going to be converted, but you will help us in our power".  "Yes", say the missionaries, "but your king must go, Musinga" -- this is an article written by Monsignor Classe -- "and we will replace him by a Christian".  And this is what happened.  Belgium supported the missionaries' policies.  In 1931, Musinga -- King Musinga, M-U-S-I-N-G-A, is taken away, is sent out to Congo on exile.  And one of his sons, his older son, reigned under Mutara III.  He was seen as the representative of the whites, the missionaries. 
Now, having done -- having abdicated forcibly, the missionaries broke the backbone of what was formerly Rwanda.  From that time onwards, the Tutsi system changed totally.  It changed totally because it was totally under the missionaries and the colonial powers, hence the events that came afterwards.  
And for the Catholic Church, the result was extraordinary.  We're talking about the time -- in Rwanda we are talking about the Holy Spirit being like a tornado.  We're talking about Christ.  The king in 1946, Mutara, the king of Rwanda, consecrated Rwanda under the king.  We are talking about the maximum stage of Tutsi alliance, alliance between the missionaries, Belgium, and the Tutsi.  The Tutsi was no longer traditional; it became powerful.  At any rate, before colonialism it had never had such power, and Tutsi power was generated very strongly.  And from that time, there was a total disruption, Counsel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Am I right -- this is, of course, extremely interesting, but am I right in assuming, Mr. Besnier, that what you are particularly interested in is the period after multipartism and maybe the way the parties developed, and the factions and so forth?  Because that seems to be maybe where this expert could be particularly helpful.  So if you could assist us a little bit.  
And you, Mr. Expert, we are certainly listening with great interest, and we are always interested in the history of Rwanda, but if your answers now could be slightly briefer so we can now concentrate on the period where we get closer to the political voices.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  We've gone over a few thousand years in just a couple of minutes.  Now let's come back to a more contemporary period.  As the expert said,  this information is, however, essential to understand the tragedy of 1994 in Rwanda.  
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now we've got to about the end of the 1950s, Mr. Expert, and from the information you gave, I understand that the church and Belgium created an imbalance between the ethnic groups and in the exercise of power.  Now, did that imbalance -- is that imbalance the only cause of the revolution of 1959, or were there other causes?  In other words, how did the revolution of 1959 happen, and what was behind it?
@A.
Counsel, this is an important question and it also helps me answer the President's question.  
Let me just open up an aside.  The origin of Hutu power in 1971-1974, began in 1957.  If we don't see how it was borne, Mr. President, we will go blindly ahead.  It is excessively complex.  We must have this background because phenomena will come one after the other.  
What happens in 1955?  The alliance between the Tutsi monarchy and the Catholic Church and Belgium starts to break.  It breaks in 1955 precisely because two essential parts of the alliance change.  A new vice-governor is appointed to Rwanda.  Harroy, H-A-R-R-O-Y.  Monsignor Deprimoz, the bishop, is replaced by Perraudin, who is a Swiss bishop.  These two men want democracy by majority, differently from their predecessor, who supported Tutsi power.  They wanted the victory of democratic majority, and they would do everything to install a majority in Rwanda, and so the Tutsis would be all alone and have the impression that they were betrayed, betrayed by their religious supporters and by their political supporters.  What would Mwami do?  He's going to turn to the UN, to the UN, the protectorate.  
And the Mwami, the Tutsis -- and here we're at the heart of the issue -- will become nationalist and claim immediate independence.

@THE WITNESS (continuing):
And the Hutus, on the other hand, will say, "No, we don't want independence right away.  Oh, our great missionaries and Belgian fathers, please stay".  They were afraid.  They knew if elections were to take place for independence given to the Tutsi, their majority democracy would never come to pass.  And they were before a paradox:  Rwandan independence would not happen against -- would not take place against a colonial power, but an interior colonial power.  The Hutus will use the external colonial powers to chase out those who represent the interior colonial power, that is to say, the Tutsis, and that is where the ideology of Hutu Power comes from.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
On a practical level, how did this revolution break out?  Who lit it and how did the bomb explode?
@A.
The Hutu-Tutsi question is never put to Rwandans before 1957.  It is taboo.  You don't talk about it.  Everybody knows who the Tutsi and Hutu are, but the official version is that there are only Rwandans.  They are different, but they are unified in Rwanda under the unificating monarchy.  
What happens in 1957, therefore?  Some Hutus from the southern region, mostly from Gitarama and some from Savi in the south, published what was called the manifesto of the Bahutu in March, in March 1957.
And here we see a rupture, Mr. President.  Why is there a rupture?  Because the manifesto of the Bahutu exposes all of the cleavages that existed that were taboo before.  It globalises the Tutsi and the Hutu worlds.  It considers that all the Tutsis are feudals and that the Hutus are serfs.  What are they going to do?  What are the interior colonisers going to do?  They are more dangerous than the external ones.  They are going to use the Belgians -- external -- to try to eliminate the internal colonisers.  Who signs this manifesto?  This is fundamental, because then we see the parties in the multi-party state.  This is why it is important to explain this background, Mr. President, because we can only understand multi-partyism if we look at the essential parties that are born at this time.
There are nine signatories, seven from Gitarama and two from Savi (phonetic).  They have -- well, there is a common thing between them, they are all Hutu and they are all very devout Christians.  Several of them have just come out of seminary.  And the two leaders of the group, Grégoire Kayibanda, later to be the first president of the first republic, and Joseph Habyarimana, who has no relationship to President Habyarimana; Habyarimana.  Gitera, Joseph Gitera, was about to become an ordained priest.  So they were really from the Kabgayi bishopry.
What would these men say?  What would these leaders say?  They are going to tell Belgium, "Let's not have immediate independence.  No, not right away", and Belgium will be sensitive to this argument.  Everywhere else colonists are being chased out, but in Rwanda, "Please stay, colonists".  The Belgian colonists say that, "This is magnificent.  They want us to stay.  This is great.  But the bad people, those are the Tutsis".  What happens then?  The Tutsis feel betrayed; they are going to provoke.  What are they going to say:  "You want to secede.  You want to divide us".  There was never a Hutu-Tutsi problem in Rwanda, and the Tutsis on the 4th of April 1958 are going to say that there is no longer Hutu or Tutsi, they want to completely suppress on identity cards the mention of ethnic group.  So, in 1958, in April, they want to suppress this from identity cards.  
Mr. President, I would like to read you a very interesting page why the Hutus would refuse that by saying -- here we are at the genesis of these events.
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can we have the indication for the page, Mr. President? 
@THE WITNESS:
"We are Bahutu, we will remain Bahutu, and we do not at all want to see Bahutu removed from anything, but Tutsi Batwa removed from official documents.  We want Muhutu, the singular term, to be proudly used and frequently used so that it will be rehabilitated".  So, they become radicalised.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What you read from there, what was the source, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, this source is called Deliberations of the National Superior Council of the Country, 6th July 1958.  These are the official archives of Rwanda.
Would you like another source Mr. President?  I can give you another source.  You will find this reference in my book, in fact.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The system here is that we have your report in front of us, and whenever a reference is made it is important either to find out whether it is in the report or whether there is some other source, and you have now confirmed that this was some other source and you have given the reference, and that was very helpful.  Thank you very much. 
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  Thank you for clearing that up for me.  I have one report here and the document on the other side; I can sometimes mix them up. 
Now, we can see this Hutu ideology being created, an ideology affirming themselves in front of the Tutsis.  Once again, Mr. President, this idea did not exist before in the old Rwanda, in the pre-colonial Rwanda; this never existed.  They became radicalised during the colonial period.  Mwami protested this.  He said, "We are all Rwandans, after all.  This will divide us, and this must stop".  But it was already started.  The Hutus would go even farther in their radicalisation, until we find something we hear in the 1991-1993, discourse.  These are not -- the people who spoke in '91 and '93, the radicals, were not the ones who invented what they said.  It was invented back in 1958.  This means that radicalisation began and political parties would start to exist, and they were going to use these things.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  You said that the issue of confrontation between the ethnic groups was taboo before 1957 -- after 1957, and specifically after the revolution of 1959 the cleavage between the ethnic groups got deeper.  Were Tutsis the victim of bad treatment and violence or even massacres on the part of Hutus?
@A.
Yes, indeed they were.  It wasn't so fast, though, Counsel.  You must realise that at that time there were many political parties being created.  There were Tutsi parties, but Tutsi parties would be conservative, but they didn't really act.  There were mostly two Hutu parties behind several political movements.  First they began in the south in Butare, and a party was called APROSOMA, A-P-R-O-S-O-M-A.  It is the Association for the Social Promotion of the Masses.  Its leader is Joseph Gitera.  And what do you see in their program?  What do you read in their program:  "Rwanda shall no longer be a colony of the Tutsis.  They should not reduce the native Hutu to slavery".  Another party, this is created in the northern part of the country, and this will be very different.  It cannot get to the southern part of the region because it is blocked by APROSOMA.  You see Gitarama in the middle of the country, where APROSOMA has influence.  This other party needs activists and supporters and members.  This party turns to the north for support, and here we are at the origin of the alliance during the first republic between some northern zones and the region of Gitarama.  This party would recruit in Ruhengeri.  It will go to recruit in Gisenyi.  And what is the difference between the Parmehutu, this new party, and the APROSOMA?  They have the same political idea in opposition to the Huti (sic), but the Parmehutu always mentions its association with the Catholic Church, and this is a party supported by the Catholic Church.
So in 1959 everybody is in place, everybody for the revolution is in place.  The UN is faced with a major issue.  The UN, indeed, has given over to Belgium the mission to lead Rwanda to independence, but not at the price of a revolution, not at the price of abolishing the monarchy.  The UN sees that there is a disequilibrium between the Rwandan monarchy, Tutsi, which is more and more isolated, and a new alliance between Hutu, the church and the Belgians.  So the old alliance between the Tutsi, the church and Belgium is replaced by Hutu, Belgium and church alliance.  Belgium completely changed its policies, therefore. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, sir.  You spoke about the Hutus; let's clarify things.  Starting in 1959, starting with the revolution of '59, how is political power exercised?  What is the nature of it?  Is it a presidential power?  Is it dictatorial power?  Are there elections?  Starting in 1959, how is power administered in Rwanda?
@A.
Counsel, you are asking me how the 1959 revolution took place.  We are right before the revolution; Tutsis are still in power; the monarchy is still there.  We must see how the monarchy is overturned and how the republic is proclaimed.  Is that the question you are asking?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, sir.  How did the 1959 revolution take place, and starting from that revolution, how was power administered over Rwandan territory?
@A.
The 1959 revolution was brought by two men, the church and Belgium.  There was one military leader and the Governor, Harroy, H-A-R-R-O-Y, and the military chief was Colonel Logiest, L-O-G-I-E-S-T, the military leader.  These two men have written their memoirs, and they are very exciting to read.  They are pro-Hutu activists.  When he arrives -- when they arrive at the head of the Belgian administration in Rwanda, they acted against New York and the UN and against Brussels to place the Hutus in power.  The colonel, Logiest, was very clear; Governor Harroy as well.  I can give you entire passages in their books and memoirs where they speak about their common combat for democracy against feudalism and against colonialism.
I will not dwell on this, because I have the impression of what I'm telling you, all the historical background, might be a bit long for you.  But I will have to stop myself, and that's a bit unfortunate, because we are going to miss some links between some of the things that I want to talk about.
So this revolution is started by Belgium in 1959.  Minor incidents become major ones.  Belgium intervenes, and on the 11th of November 1959 the new state is proclaimed.  The Belgian paracommandos intervene, and each time the Tutsis react forcefully against the Hutu, the paracommandos intervene against the Tutsis.  Belgian soldiers stay, and so Mwami, the king, loses control.  Tutsi power is destabilised.  The subversion worked, and the monarchy is broken.
In 1960 there are communal elections, and they are boycotted by the major Tutsi parties, the UNAR, the U-N-A-R, the National Union for Rwanda, and of course the Hutus win the election.  It is a majority democracy.  The Tutsis are 15 to 20 per cent, the Hutus are 80 per cent.  One man, one vote; it gives the power to the Hutus.  And so what the Tutsis were fearing, happened.  Majority democracy is born.  From that time, on the 18th of October 1960, the governor, Harroy, gives the power over to the Hutus, creating a provisional council of 48 ministers, and that provisional council will define the creation of a provisional government with a prime minister who is appointed, and that is Grégoire Kayibanda, therefore the man from the Parmehutu from Gitarama that we spoke about earlier. 
But, the game is not finished.  The UN does not want to be overtaken by this revolution without having its say.  It feels that it hasn't been considered as politically legitimate, and so the UN demands legislative elections -- they don't want legislative elections to occur, rather, as long as Tutsi refugees haven't come back to the country and as long as the pacification in the country has not gone under way.
Brussels agrees with the UN.  What will happen?  The Belgian governor has a coup d'état.  He disagrees, he disobeys.  They bring about a coup d'état.  They encourage the bourgmestres the government put into place and Hutu authorities to unite, meet on the 28th of January 1961 in Gitarama, and the republic is proclaimed at that time.  The UN is put before a fait accompli.  The UN can no longer lead a country to independence, a country which has just proclaimed its own independence.  By claiming independence, there is no more monarchy, the feudal Tutsi power is overturned, and 28th of January 1962 we have the total independence of Rwanda. 
@MR. BESNIER:
I am completely following you, expert.  You spoke of a problem of refugees and pacification.  Does that mean that that revolution of 1959 was accompanied by violence, violent acts or pogroms, and, if so, who were the victims of such acts?
@A.
Yes.  There was a series of massacres and killings.  If you wish, we can begin to say that even the genocide of 1994 was not an invention from 1994.  The genocide of 1994, over history, begins in November 1959.  There will be variations, but there will be phases of massacres.  The first phase, it is not very bloody; there are deaths, but relatively it is under control.  The Belgian army is still there; it stops most of the massacres.  We are in 1959, in November.  Chieftains think it is better to leave; "Things have gone bad.  Rwanda, which was ours, is no longer ours.  We can no longer live here".
Now, between 1960 and 1961 we see a phenomenon develop towards specific eliminations of persons.  You will see little killings across Rwanda, one individual, one group of individuals, but it is not large scale yet.  And then in the end the situation becomes crystallised in 1963 and 1964.  At that time, there is mass murder, there is a kind of genocide, but it is a small genocide, small scale.  Would you like me to talk about that, Counsel?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, please do, sir.
@A.
What happens?  This is at the end of 1963.  Some Tutsi refugees are going to raid Rwanda.  They call them Inyenzis, Inyenzi, which is also a cockroach.  They are called cockroaches by the Hutus.  Now, they raid the country.  These weren't really raids, they just had a few people, peasants, with some traditional weapons, some of them had some firearms, but there was never a military plot described in the propaganda at the time.  Nevertheless, the Hutu government becomes afraid.  These Inyenzi are pushed out, in part, by the Belgian army, and after that in January 1964 they launch a concerted plan for massacres.
What is interesting to see is that these massacres are not going to take place in the north.  They will spread to the north, but they break out in Gikongoro, in that region, which is a region controlled by the Parmehutu, and I told you the Parmehutu terminate.  You want to look at the origins of the Hutu Power.  I have scientific evidence that backs this up.  This is why I am continuing to speak of the genesis of the Parmehutu.  We will see the same phrases over and over in the decades.
In 1964 we have a concerted plan, but unfortunately for the victims there is no communications in Rwanda at the time.  There's no NGOs, there's no observers, there's no journalists in the country.  All communication networks depend on the Catholic Church.  Who is in charge of the Catholic Church in Rwanda at the time?  Perraudin, Monsignor Perraudin.  He is the one who put the Hutus into power.  So it is evident that one year after putting them into power Monsignor Perraudin is in a bad spot.  How can he denounce the massacres that his protégés are committing?  What about the alliances with the UN and the western countries?  This first republic was a triumph of democracy against feudalism and arbitrary Tutsi power.  He is in a bad spot to denounce the massacres that are going on.  That means that this genocide is silent.  It is a closed genocide.  Nobody knows about it.  There are no observers. 
How did the genocide of 1964 occur?  Here, Mr. President, I believe that we have elements, documentary elements that we can find in the future.  How would this happen?  In Gikongoro, the minister of agriculture at the time comes to that region; a small meeting with the prefét.  The prefét calls the bourgmestres.  The bourgmestres call the activists of Parmehutu, the official party.  The order is given to chase down the Tutsis, and only in that prefecture of Gikongoro there are between eight and twelve thousand Tutsis who are killed.  We don't have the exact numbers, I can only give estimations, and I am a researcher and I don't want to give you approximations.  They are vague, but certainly there are thousands.  We can't be more precise than that, however.  
What will happen?  Two hundred to three hundred thousand Tutsis will leave for exile, so the movement of refugees that began in 1959 and spread to '60, '61, will be amplified in 1964.  The refugee camps from that time grow; the refugee camps, but also refugees move to Burundi.  They move to Congo, Zaire, and other neighbouring countries.  So here we are faced with the first reality of a genocide, which is very important.  It won't be surprising to see that the Parmehutus' offspring will continue with the Hutu Power, just like their founding fathers before them.  It will continue.  This is why we must use historical perspective to explain events. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, thank you.  Let us come back to the Hutu party after the 1959 revolution.  Was that party united or divided, that party?
@A.
Now, after '59 there was only one Hutu party, only the Parmehutu, because the opposition at the time was not another Hutu opposition as it is in the south, the opposition is between southern Hutus, Parmehutu Gitarama, and APROSOMA Gitarama.  Now, since the Parmehutu party wanted to impose itself on APROSOMA, it was this time as the general spokesman of Hutuism.  It will turn to the north, to Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, and there will be sort of a division of labour there.  Political power was entrusted to the central Hutus in general, and the army was left to the north Hutus.
Now, Counsel, this question is very important, because we are talking about 1963-1964.  In that period the armies were not a source of power in Africa.  The period of major military coups d'état came about in '66, '67 up to '70.  At that time in the independent countries the elite that ran those countries were civilians, very often from faculties of law, faculties of arts in French universities.  It is not like the period following that, when the military took power through coups d'état.  So that it is not socially correct or beneficial to be an army man, so that they kept the political power and left the crumbs to the army.  Especially in Rwanda; the army didn't mean much, it only provided security.  And that they will regret, because the army had to take (interpretation unintelligible).  So that an opposition it was in the centre south which transformed itself into the Gitarama Parmehutu and englobed the whole of the Hutu world subsequently.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now during the same period, did we have Tutsi kings and how did -- or Tutsi movements?
@A.
There was a Rwandan national movement; it is no longer there, it went into exile.  Another movement, nostalgic, composed of old chiefs, had no control over the events or over the refugees, so that very gradually young refugees, sons and daughters of refugees, began coming into the political game in Uganda, for example, and in East Africa, and the anti-colonial movement was big, so the traditionalists were no longer there.  
Now, the other Tutsi party, that is, rather, the Rassemblement Démocratie de Rwanda, which was only marginal, it also disappeared in the years of independence.  So that the Tutsis were on the decline from 1959 to 1960.  The Tutsi that remained in Rwanda were to consider themselves lucky if they were alive.  They had nothing else to do, they only had their business to do, but nothing to do with politics, and they shouldn't attract any attention.  They were second-class citizens, so to speak.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, expert.  You have given us a clear picture of the Hutu movement and what happened to the Tutsi movement.  Could you briefly tell us developments, political developments between 1960 and 1973?  Was the power satisfactory to the Rwandan people?  Was it the expression of the autonomy of the Rwanda people?  Was it confronted with political, economic or military problems?
@A.
Now, they used to say one thing in Rwanda -- I was in Rwanda, I came in in '72 -- they used to say the Parmehutu governs Rwanda, and Gitarama governs the Parmehutu.  So that nationally, the Hutu nationalism was just never there.  We went to the stage of regionalism.  So that there was a slip between a Tutsi power, which was a power that governed the whole of Rwanda, with contradictory social reports that I've told you about, and a power that didn't see Rwanda as a whole but saw Rwanda in terms of regions.  And the entire share of Rwanda from 1963-64 to 1973 -- 1994 changed a little, but there was a sliding scale for one micro-regionalism to the other and the history of the internal definitions within such regionalisms.
So that the Kayibanda regime was a regime that was brought out, naked, by the Catholic Church, supported as it was by Belgium, a regime that rushed into a political catastrophe, and the political game was closed.  That must make the people from Butare, that is the south, that is, the former APROSOMA people, were set aside, with a few exceptions.  So far as the northerners were concerned, they had played the game of the union with Gitarama's end for several years.  The northerners had lost their patience.  
When President Kayibanda wanted to turn in for a fourth residential term of office, things changed between the various regions and the regime had its back up against the wall because of political and economic problems.  And many difficulties arose, and the more the difficulties were the more they turned to Gitarama, and instead of spreading they really concentrated on Gitarama to the tune of 80 per cent, and the government had its back against the wall.
What did it do?  The magic wand is used.  The scapegoat was the Tutsi.  They tried to use that to create Hutu unity around Gitarama, around the Parmehutu, and this began from January 1973.  It was accelerated in February 1973, and then what happened?  They developed a term that one cannot translate into English.  In my first report that was translated, the scouring away, (interpretation unintelligible), to scour away, to hunt people out; it was not by force, they were told to leave, to go.
Now what happened?  The militants of Parmehutu, in all their administrations, came with their lists.  They came with lists, and once again a certain number of responsibilities that we will see again in 1994 originated in Gitarama, not in the north, but in the first republic.  The linkages are all there.  And this purge went through the universities -- for example, the night of the 15th or 16th February -- in a violent manner.  A personal example, in one night I lost half of my students.  They were beaten up, and I couldn't lecture any more, because the students were not there.  I had to wait for June.  All the students were sent away, and it was surprising to see later on that some of those that were the killers came together in camps that were opposed, up to 1998.  So that the situation was not healthy.  The government was not sure of itself, and the government was scared of the army.  The government was faced with a policy of contradiction, because on the one hand it was coaxing the northerners, the northerners -- that is, the militant heads, that is General Major Habyarimana Juvénal at the time, and some chiefs wanted to kill him.  So that there was a contradiction, total contradiction.
We were in a world that could be compared to a time bomb.  The situation was very serious, and on the 5th of July 1973 Habyarimana cut the Gordian knot and General Habyarimana with his committee of public safety toppled the republic, toppled the Gitarama system, which was fruit that was ripe and ready to fall.  And I can say -- tell you something I experienced:  that coup d'état was welcomed with great relief.
I think we should keep things in perspective and be objective, and we should not be carried away by ideology or propaganda.  I can tell you here that that coup d'état was welcome.  It was a relief, welcomed with a sigh of relief by the Hutu, by the expatriates, except for those that ran Gitarama at the time; except for them. 
@MR. BESNIER:
If I get you correctly, expert, we are now at the 1973 coup d'état.  Now Kayibanda's power enhanced anti-Tutsi confrontations and a drive to enhance his own power, and he failed.  But was that the only cause of the 1973 coup d'état? 
@A.
No, I cannot say that it enhanced.  He organised -- he created all of that, because you had militants coming in with their lists that earmarked Tutsi (interpretation unintelligible) and Tutsi students.  Some were killed here and there during those events.  Men and women were killed here and there.  It was a movement that was organised for a very simple reason:  the regime was at the end of its tether, and it used the Tutsi scapegoat.  The regime would not have been toppled if it had been only that.  It was toppled because everything was shaking.  Everything was machinations, traffic of influence, favouritism, plots.  One should have experienced it at the utmost in Rwanda at the time to get to know what really happened.  It was like it was the day the earth -- I mean the world was going to end.  And it was General Habyarimana that resolved the issue, that settled the question.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let me come back a little.  You said that the government at the time organised the anti-Tutsi pogroms.  Now, did that organisation here and there come with spontaneous anger against the Tutsi in the hills and in the university?
@A.
Not to my knowledge.  The movements, those that scoured away, is different from the type of movement that happened in 1963, because those that ran away or got to run away were not followed to be killed.  It was there, because -- it was there to show that the administration was nice enough to have Tutsi in the government.  So that was a political move to show the Hutu that the government was a Hutu government all the same, and it was for Hutuism.  There were mistakes, of course there were mistakes.  For example, I saw -- the university was closed, and since there were no classes any more I had to go, I took my vehicle and went to Kigera where I used to work at the time, and I saw (interpretation unintelligible) on the road to that area, there were some huts that were burnt down.  So there were events that took place that were very tragic.  We don't have enough documentation on that, but I wouldn't like to dwell on something that I do not know about thoroughly. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, did those events occur all over Rwanda or only in certain areas?
@A.
Now, to my knowledge, in the whole area of Rwanda, perhaps with less intensity as compared to those in Kibungo.
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, thank you, expert.  Let us come back to the 1973 coup d'état.  Very quickly, in a nutshell, what happened?
@A.
It happened just as anything that happened in Rwanda; we learnt about it over the radio.  Well, I learnt about it in a different manner, because I was going to Kigali.  I was called over the radio for an administrative matter, and I was stopped at the Kigali bridge roadblock.  Throughout the morning I saw vehicles coming in the other -- from the other direction.  They were being stopped and they were telling me, "You are going to Butare.  Something is happening there", and when I got to Butare there was a military coup d'état.  A committee for public salvation was established, and there was a coup d'état, and that coup d'état was very well received by the population. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, you were saying that the coup d'état at that time was welcome.  Was it welcome in terms of its duration?  Habyarimana, was he called to do that, or did he play a role in the events?  Was he for regionalism, the regionalism that beset Rwanda during the '60s? 
@A.
Well, you are jumping the gun here, because there were two periods.  There was the euphoria, and then the regime getting bogged down.  There was the phase of optimism.  General Habyarimana had a very clear discourse.  He said all Rwandans have equal rights; the divisionists should go.  General Habyarimana had a very pacifying discourse, and to the Parmehutu he said, "Our revolution was indeed sold by a clique, and I'm going to put the revolution back online in a disinterested manner".  But that clique, the Kayibanda clique, they toppled it, of course.  Later on General Habyarimana undertook to purge the people of the first republic, and they were all sent to the sinister prisons of Ruhengeri.  But all the spokespeople, spokesmen and women, supported the coup d'état, and the Catholic Church, too.  The Catholic Church was there at the face of Rwandan history.  The Catholic Church immediately disseminated the following message:  "General Habyarimana is a member of one of the oldest families in Rwanda.  His wife was a fervent devout Catholic.  It is a pious couple.  This couple is going to run -- the general is going to run Rwanda like the head of a family, and he is a good head of a family".
Let me correct something in my report.  There is a typing mistake in page 5 of my report.  I would like to correct this, because this report should not be official with this mistake.  The wife of General Habyarimana is not Agathe Kanzinso, but Agathe Kanziga, K-A-N-Z-I-G-A, K-A-N-Z-I-G-A.  Algaseke should be replaced by Karago.  That is two lines after that.  I'm sorry for this.

@MR. BESNIER:
I am sorry for this.  Just let me explain.  In the English version it's page 4.  The expert somewhere at paragraph 2, after chapter 2 -- 
@A.
I think we have made the corrections.  Please bear with my secretary on this, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Besnier, you are making sure that you are only getting the information that you need for the purposes of your closing arguments.  You are doing that; aren't you?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  This is exactly what we are doing.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Expert, could you tell us the parties, in which we are talking about the development of modern Rwanda, the parties we heard about in 1994, those parties that played a role in the life of the country?  Now, on which party did Habyarimana base his power?
@A.
Well, he used the power or party that he created in 1975, that is the MRND, that's the Revolutionary Movement, the National Revolutionary Movement for Development, MRND, which became the single party, and all Rwandans were de facto members of that party by birth.  
Now, here we are talking about 1975, the general phase of African history, and Rwanda is no exception to Africa.  We are talking about the single party being in Africa for about 20 years.  Except for a few English-speaking countries and Senegal, Africa will be ruled by single parties.  That is what they used to call the authoritarian short - short cut that was supposed to enhance national cohesion in all countries, and Rwanda, just as any other African country, was also to use that authoritarian short cut.  
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, between '73 and 1990 was there a genesis of political opposition?
@A.
Now, such political opposition -- I would not say it was clandestine, well, it was not official -- it came about through plots, imagined or otherwise, the denunciation of plots here and there.  For example, that involving Major Denise Lizinde who was imprisoned in Ruhengeri and freed by the RPF and who had a tragic end.  There were other events such that the regime also turned to micro-regionalism.  
And what is important here is something that the historian has to contend with on the basis of hindsight, because we saw that the Hutu regimes that came one after the other in Rwanda, apart from certain periods, a limited period during their existence, always had to turn to regionalism, but also to micro-regionalism; in the case of Habyarimana, we are talking about northism.  That is not true for Parmehutu, it talks about the south.  Parmehutu was APROSOMA, and the other one was Gitarama.  Habyarimana's regime cannot be Gisenyi and Ruhengeri at the same time, just as Rukiko or the Bakiga regime, those mountaineers essentially from Bushiri, the high valley of Mukungwa, those mountain people have never been dominated by the Tutsis, except for certain episodes that went to certain Tutsi chief.  I am not talking Bugeyi and Rwenga; I am talking about the mountain areas.  
Now, those mountain people saw first the Tutsi chief during the Belgian colonial period.  So it is clear that in proportion, events went on, and in proportion, as anarchy and the calling into question of power was there, the general had the tendencies to turn towards his own people; that's a human reaction.  He was going to turn those from his own area, his region, his hill, and he was going to turn to his wife.  And from that time onwards, we went from Hutu nationalism to northern micro-regionalism and Bushiri regionalism with that region which was going to run the affairs of state.  In proportion, there were more difficulties, the more one run towards one's own identity; it happened in Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did I call your question correctly?  Outwardly you talked about the dwindling of power, you talked about Habyarimana retreating towards his family.  Could you tell us whether his own close circle played a role and what role?
@A.
Yes; what we know as the small house or the Akazu.  Let me, once again, point out a mistake, please blame me if you want; this is not because of my secretary.  It is in the French version, page 6.  I have not the page in the English version.  There is a mistake, page 5.  Now, I may, Mr. President, the sentence beginning with, "In the hands of the Bakiga mountain people, the country was run like a family enterprise whose decision-makers were three; that is, Colonel Elie Sagatwa, S-A-G-A-T-W-A, (the particular -- private secretary to the president), Protais Zigiranyarazo, Z-I-G-R-R -- G-I-R-A-N-Y-A-R-A-Z-O, Préfet of Ruhengeri, and Pascal Simbikangwa S-I-M-B-I-K-A-N-G-W-A in charge of intelligence.  As for Serefo Rwabakumba, R-W-A-B-U-K-U-M-B-A, he was in charge of the family's funds, F-U-N-D-S".  That is the correction I wanted to make, Mr. President.
@MR. BESNIER:
The names you've just read out, Expert, are names of those people who are the inner circle of the Akazu.  What is their influence on Rwandan policy during the months following the ascent to power by President Habyarimana?
@A.
It should be said, Counsel, that Juvénal Habyarimana had a good military career.  He had legitimacy conferred to him by the Catholic Church because his father was one of the first baptised, but his lineage was not very influential.  But the wife of the general, Agathe, came from one of the very interesting families in the country, the Wakagari, in the Bakiga area, the mountainous area.  I have talked about the work of Ferdinand Nahimana that talked about this dynasty in his first works.  I am not talking about his political works; I am talking about his university work, especially his work at the University of Rwanda.  And that lineage was one of the important lineages in the Busero area so that the general had to turn to the people of his wife, his wife's brothers, his wife's people, to influence people, Akazu.
The Akazu was essentially composed by people who were from the family of the wife of the general, and the Akazu had a determining role.  I talked to you about a certain number of responsibilities carried out by the members of the Akazu.  Here we are talking about the apex of state.  The important thing was to be recognised by the Akazu and to be accepted in certain circles by the Akazu.  Akazu seconded certain authorities, so we are talking about a micro-regional system, a system of regional favouritism that came after the experience we had in the Gitarama region during the period of the third republic.  
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Expert.  Now, let us move ahead.  
What is the political situation at the beginning of 1990 in Rwanda?
@A.
Now, for that, I think, we must transgress the boundaries of Rwanda, I am very sorry.  The Berlin Wall fell.  There are no blocks, and Africa is coming into a final phase in its history and the wind of democratisation was blowing almost everywhere.  In July, we had the speech made at La Baule by President Mitterrand of France.  
All over Africa opposition was dying to emerge.  There was a stifling of political life by single party states.  There was movement in Zaire, in Togo, all over Africa; and if there was no movement the call for democracy all over the place became an aspiration, unavoidable as it was and insuperable as it was.  It was in that context that at the time that when the regime was most uncomfortable because of the economic crisis, crisis by the payment of salaries, the food crisis.  Countries were on the brink of shortages, and there was overpopulation everywhere, agonising as it was.  
In my book, I have talked about the suicidal over-population in Rwanda.  It was thus that at the beginning of the (interpretation unintelligible) epoch, the population of Rwanda was six to 700,000.  At about '62, it was about between one and 2,000,000, and in 1990, we were talking about 8,000,000 inhabitants.  Now, all that for a territory as big as two French departments and only 45 to 47 per cent of the land is arable.  Nothing is there to farm, there was no way out; there was land hunger.  The refusal of the fertility pill was going to enhance birth; there was no birth control, realistically.  Rwanda was exploding, was bloating out of itself over its borders, because pre-colonial Rwanda was bigger to the east as compared to what it is now.  Because of the Berlin Conference, it has now been narrowed.  
So all these frictions, all these events were such that we are in the phase of a time bomb which is about to explode.  No one caused it; there were many, many causes.  There was one cause that we have talked about, that is the problem of what is now -- the Tutsi refugees that left in 1959 and came back in - up to 1973, had children, and their children grew up and wanted to come back to Rwanda.  And whenever they said they wanted to come back, they were often refused for several reasons, but one reason was most determining.  How would you in an over-populated country, how would you receive an additional, several hundred thousands of people?  There was no place in Rwanda.  And all these elements were such that tension grew and that is the job -- the context in which the Tutsi attack was going to occur, that is, the RPF attack -- we will talk about the RPF later on.  That occurred on the 1st of October 1990.  That is the context in which it occurred, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
You spoke of the attack, 1st of October 1990.  What is the RPF?  Where is it from?  Who is it made up of?
@A.
It's the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  The armed branch is the APR or the RPA rather, the Rwandan Patriotic Army.  It's a movement -- a multi-ethnic movement; it's called that.  It's true there are Hutus within it.  There's even Hutu combatants, in the beginning anyway.  In the first fight, the directors would even be Hutu, but the RPF really is an emanation from the Tutsi refugees who lived in Uganda. It would be created slowly but it would become very important in Uganda starting in 1986 on which date in Uganda, as we know, following the tragic events in that country during the 20 previous years, those tragic evens would lead to civil war - civil war.  And finally in that year, the current president of that country, Yuweri Museveni, would come to power now.  
Now, Museveni, who's from L'Ankole, belongs to the Hima ethnic group.  Rwandan Tutsis who took refuge in Uganda took refuge in that L'Ankole area where the Hima live.  Now, the links of ethnic belonging are clear between the Hima and the Tutsi, even if they are one and not the other, but there are links.  There're inter-marriages through history between the two, and in fact, the most determined young immigrants, Tutsi immigrants living in Uganda following the persecution of the Obote regime, which came before Museveni's, would align with Museveni, and they would join his army.  They get into his army, and when Museveni comes to power, those Rwandan Tutsis are very important officers at times in the brigades, in the training, and from that beginning -- time, the Tutsis immigrants are going to have a tool that is going to enable them to play a role in the event.  
Now, when the Habyarimana regime refuses to deal with the question of refugees, these men who are in the RPF are going to decide on the 1st of October 1990, to attempt -- well, we don't know really what they were attempting.  Were they attempting a quick raid to take Kigali quickly, hoping the Hutu opposition were going to support them?  Did they try to start a war?  We don't really know.  Nevertheless, they go into the country near Lake Muhazi, north-east of Kigali, and they are stopped, quickly.  The RPA and the RPF move back and start a war that's going to last for three years, leading to dramatic events that we all know about.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I believe that Habyarimana's regime must have felt threatened by that attack.  How did they react to that threat?
@A.
Well, militarily, they would be helped very quickly by France and by Zaire.  Zairian military aid would not be useful tactically, but we did see large numbers of troops that can occupy the area between Byumba and Gayayo.  Now you push -- they move the RPF troops towards the north.  Now the French troops come immediately, and it's felt immediately.  Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, Mitterrand's -President Mitterrand's son, called Habyarimana.  The decision was taken directly in Elysée Palace, and they immediately decided to intervene.  France sends troops who don't really intervene, but they are going to take over the airport and secure the areas behind the Rwandan armed forces, enabling them to support on that defensive line and launch a counter-offensive.  That counter-offensive immediately hits the RPF troops, who move back and who go through much difficulty.  Some of their leaders are going to be killed.  Kagame is not there yet.  He is in the United States.  He comes back and he starts to negotiate with the Ugandan government to obtain authorisation to repatriate his troops, under the condition that they are not too visible, and they move back, they walk back very long into the Burunga massif, 3000 metres altitude.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You cannot possibly -- maybe I am wrong -- be interested in detail about the military operations in 1990.  You cannot use that in your closing argument, can you?

We will shorten our questioning, but we must say that Alison Des Forges talked about issues that went well beyond the indictment for more than an afternoon, and we are here in a way contesting the report of Ms. Des Forges.  Des Forges did not only talk about the multi-party state but also about ancient Rwandan history, and I would like this expert to be able to freely express himself on these issues.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is why you have been allowed to do this.  That is why you have been allowed to do this for more than one and half hours, and we are still listening.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  As I was telling the Chamber, from now on the questions I will put to the expert will regard the birth of the multi-party state.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
My next question, Mr. Expert:  France.  Did France unconditionally support Rwanda militarily, or was that support accompanied by some political conditions?
@A.
Well, by answering your question respectfully I will answer the President's question.  If France can influence Habyarimana's regime through the multi-party state, it didn't -- it reacted immediately, it didn't count on that military support.  
Now, look at the feudal relationship between Mitterrand and Habyarimana.  He is coming to the aid of his serf.  He calls him, "Please, help.  I am being attacked.  My power, my friend, can you please help me?  Send the Foreign Legion".  "I will send the Foreign Legion, but you are going to do what I say politically."  France does not hesitate to unconditionally support Rwanda.  It would be an even better place to impose the multi-party state on Habyarimana.
That is the end of my remark, Mr. President.  I hope that you can be able to place that.  I don't want to go beyond my bounds.
Now, France is in Rwanda.  The speech in La Baule was given in July.  You see a contradiction.  In July, Mitterrand says France will no longer help any country that is not democratic.  And in October, it sends elite troops to help a country that is not democratic.  So you have to play on both sides of the field.  
France is saying to Habyarimana, "We are going to help you, but you are going to start following a multi-party system."  Habyarimana does not agree, though.  He knows what are the main fractures, the deep fractures affecting his country.  He knows he is very well placed to know that, and he knows that if a multi-party state sees the light, these cracks in the system will only get bigger.  So Habyarimana will drag his feet, and finally we have to wait until June 1991 to see the multi-party state come about, or at least to see the day when Habyarimana would accept the idea of a multi-party state.  
How did that multi-party state completely become implemented?  Well, it was implemented in many different ways.  First, political parties were created.   The main political parties that would become created would be those, the offshoots of former parties.  The first party to be created in March 1991 is the MDR, the Republican Democratic Movement.  The MDR movement wants to be, or talks of itself as the offshoot of the Parmehutu which brought Rwanda to independence and had scores to settle with the regime, I must say.  Since 1973, the time when Kayibanda was thrown out and the time when the Habyarimana regime was installed, life was not easy for the Gitarama leaders of the old party.  
The second party that was created -- well, two more parties would be created, and they are very original parties.  They are not at all affiliated with the old former parties.  This is why, Mr. President, I wanted to insist but I wasn't able to fully go into detail about the politics of Rwanda in '58 and '59.  We are at the heart of the problem and we may move ahead blindly.  The MDR is the - inherits the Parmehutu and the political wing of it.  The other parties, and not the PDC because it's a marginal party, but the next two parties are very interesting.  These are parties in rupture, rupture with the Gitarama system and with the Kabaye system, and they don't agree with the MDR nor the MRND. This is the Parti Libéral, the PL, which is a small party, which is original because it is composed of both Hutu and Tutsis, and this is a party of intellectuals, businessmen, and it wants to be a party that is the party of elite.  But it refused the opposition between Hutu and Tutsi.
And then PSD, the Social Democratic Party, which is interesting, which is a party precisely whose political platform is that of refusal of the regional system, but also of the Hutu versus Tutsi ideas.  It's a party that wants to move ahead and not look at the definitions that were created in the past.  This party was created in the south of the country.  It was created in Butare, and it's not by accident it's the big university town, because in Butare there is a tradition of ethnic cohabitation.  It's a university city.  Many research institutes are there.  It's a city that is purely ethnic.  Hutus from the north and the south and Tutsis all get together.  At that time in Butare, there was physical eliminations like in other regions of Rwanda, and the Tutsis are not being threatened in Butare and around Butare.  So, of course, that is an intellectual party.  Filip Reyntjens, who wrote many interesting things about this issue, who I think was an expert before this Tribunal, talks about this.  He said it's a party of intellectuals, of intellects, of idealists, they are idealists who consider that all those old things as opposition between Hutu and Tutsi is old news; "Let's be concrete.  Let's not move forward with our head looking behind".  
And this party would develop, because at first the opposition parties would group against the Habyarimana regime, and here we are dealing with a fork in the road and contradictions.  Why?  I thought -- I think I have explained to the Chamber that extremist ideas that you will find in Hutu Power ideology are ideas that were born between 1957 and 1973.  These ideas were created in the centre and not the north of the country.  Those same ideas will be used by people who would not be afraid to ally themselves with the Tutsi PRF.  Why?  Because their objective is not Hutu nationalism but the eviction of the Kabaya northerners and their system against Habyarimana.  Between cholera and the plague you have to choose one.
Now, this will create fury among the northerners.  They are furious that those around the president and the Rukiga in general, they say, "Where are we going with all of this? You, southern Hutus, or from centre, you have never fought against the Tutsi.  You, who throughout history, you have become used to the presence of the Tutsis.  You who have never revolved against the Tutsis.  You had the Belgians and the churches had to put you in power.  You are the same people who are questioning what we have acquired through the 1959 revolution, and you are going to try to evict Habyarimana by allying yourselves with the Tutsis to triumph in your own domestic programme".  That is why the CDR in 1992 would be created, to get over those fractures.  The Hutus have to be united.  Any house divided inside of itself will lose.  You are opening the doors to the monarchists, to the feudals, to the reactionaries, the return of the immigrants, because this all going to follow suit.  We are faced with a paradox.  The paradox is that the genesis of the Hutu ideology came from Gitarama, and these people, their inheritents are going to join up with the Tutsi, the opposition.  It's going to try to use the RPF to weaken the Habyarimana regime.  This is a more correct way of saying it.
So this is a contradiction.  It is clear, the rupture of those parties was written from the very beginning since they were created.  It is a total contradiction.
@MR. BESNIER:
In that atmosphere of the multi-party system in 1991, did the government spontaneously have those parties work with them in the programme for the government?
@A.
No.  That is the entire problem.  Habyarimana knew very well that the multi-party system would create anarchy and chaos.  He knew the situation.  So during the period between the date when the multi-party state was recognised and his death, he would try to do everything to stop the implementation of that multi-party system.  And when he could not stop it, he would use it to break it, to slow it down.  So the government that would be created, that would found, that would be implemented on the 13th of October 1991, the government that would be presided by a respectable man, a president of my university in Butare, a very reasonable man, Sylvestre Nsanzimana, who was a diplomat at the OAU and elsewhere, and Sylvestre Nsanzimana's government is an open government.  Think, if all the ministries go to the MRND -- I forgot to say that the MRND became MRNDD.  In addition to "development" they added the word "democracy", "for development and democracy".  There is only one opposition minister.  From what party?  One of the smallest ones, the Christian Democratic Party, which only has one seat.  So it's only a façade, this opening, this opening up of the system.  The opposition parties are insurgent.  What are they going to do?
On the 17th of November, still 1991, the opposition parties, the MDR, the PSD, the PL -- the Liberal Party, they sign a common declaration of protest addressed to President Habyarimana, protesting the fact that the political openings are just a facade.  They don't exist.  From that point Rwanda enters into chaos.  From that point the multi-party system will create chaos; I even would say civil war.  
Starting on the 24th of November 1991 up till March 1992, the tension would only get greater.  The fights between activists and armed groups from the different parties would confront one another, and you would start seeing more and more Tutsi massacres, massacres of Tutsis in different areas of Rwanda, in the north, in the centre of the country and in the east.  The situation becomes very serious and explosive, and in March 1992, President Habyarimana retreats.  He retreats, and he realises that he can no longer stop this protest movement which is only getting bigger.  People are getting angrier.  And what does General Habyarimana do?  He decides -- he decides to create a government of national unity, a government of national union.  It's a political revolution, a revolution because the reign of the single party stops there, because the MRND is still in power, but with this new coalition government the MRND must now share power, and the MRND finds itself as one of the composing parties of the government.  Even if the government is mostly MRND, there are nine members with nine seats.  
How is power shared?  The government is created on 16th April 1992.  The prime minister is a member of the MDR.  His name is Dismas Nsengiyaremye, N-S-E-N-G-I-R-A-M-Y-E (sic).  The MDR have four seats, four portfolios, the PSD has three, the Parti Libéral has three, the Christian Democratic Party has one, and the MRNDD -- must add another D - has nine.
So MRND is no longer the master of the political game, or no longer the only master.  
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Witness.  I think we have made up for some of our tardiness in the discussion through that answer.  Now, let's deal a little bit more specifically with the PSD Party.  Witness, you said that the PSD had three seats in the government of 1992, but how representative was that party within the entire country of Rwanda?  In which préfecture was it best represented?  Were there ever elections that would enable one to see how representative that party was?  Were there fractures between one region and another, the north and the south, the east and the west?  What was the influence of that party in the country?
@A.
Counsel, I am completely unable to answer that question.  It's impossible to answer that question.  There were never elections, those parties were created, but they didn't know how they were represented at all.  Power was divided among those who had perhaps the most activists or those who made the most noise.  How can we know the influence of the PSD in a system that had no elections?  I can't tell you what the PL representation was, nor the PDC or anything.  It is completely impossible to do; I can't go beyond that.  We cannot go out of the framework of history to make such assumptions.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, it is very surprising to me, because other experts before this Tribunal have made assertions on those issues.  I would like for you to take a look at Exhibit No. P. 23. 
@MR. BESNIER: 
Could the Registry kindly assist me showing Exhibit P. 23 to the witness?  It's a map, registry, just to help you in your search for the document.
@THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, could I please have two or three minutes to examine this map?
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have that exhibit before you?  Yes, you do.  That is a map that was submitted by expert witness Alison Des Forges.  It represents the political representation in different regions of Rwanda in 1994, as a function of the party to which the bourgmestres belonged.  I have a few questions about this map.  Does it seem relevant to you and does it correspond to the reality in Rwanda?  And the second question:  the criteria used by Alison Des Forges, that is to say the political background of the bourgmestres, does that seem relevant to you?
@A.
I would like to make one remark.  I don't understand this map.  Outside of Akagera Park, the white zone which is uninhabited, outside of Mutara, this is an error.  At the time this no longer existed in 1994.  This became inhabited. This should a commune.  So this map does not correspond to the communes at the time.  What seems bizarre to me, however, is that you have white zones that don't correspond to anything at all, and grey ones that don't have a corresponding legend.  So I don't an explanation for the white, nor the grey.
Now, I could give you some ideas just off the cuff about this.  I am reading that yellow is MRND, green is MDR, orange is PSD and blue is PL, and the title of the legend in English:  "Political parties of the bourgmestres in 1994".  
Now how, Counsel, could I possibly be able to infer from the political belonging, political party of the bourgmestre, how can you infer from that the political affiliation of the population?  They are not - bourgmestres aren't elected.  Some of them have been in posts for 20 years.  This map doesn't mean anything.  It is as if you were saying, "Look at the military zones in France, and ask each general what his political party is, and say, 'Well, that region votes for such and such a party'." Scientifically for me this map is worthless.  It doesn't have any backup.  But we do have a map that shows the political affiliation of the bourgmestres, but in no way does it represent the affiliation of the Rwandan population. So the bourgmestres are appointed by the government or by different institutions up 1994, affiliated themselves with the four major parties.  They affiliated with four major parties after that period, and here we have the affiliation of the bourgmestres, but certainly not of the Rwandan population.

@THE WITNESS (continuing):
Is that sufficient?
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I want to keep going, though.  Let's look at one particular commune.  Let's look at Kibuye because it's in orange, and the bourgmestre is from the PSD.  Can we say -- would it seem reasonable to you and scientifically founded to say that Gitesi is a bastion of the PSD?
@A.
No and yes.  Yes, as far as authority there as a member of PSD.  No, because this doesn't allow me to say that there's substantial militants there for the PSD.  If I have something to tell me that Gitesi, 30 percent of the people voted for PSD, 20 percent for MDR, that is the opposing party, then I am not in the minds of the inhabitants of Gitesi, but that would have been clear, but I cannot tell you.  Here we have a partial map but there are some elements that are not there, a signed affiliation of development prior with political parties.  What this map doesn't show is the political strength of the various political parties, at all.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Expert, you've covered our question very well.  Let us move ahead a little bit more and come back to the government from the multiparty system, the government and the (interpretation unintelligible) from the PSD.  And the government was to run the country for a considerable period of time.  What were the time frames?
@A.
The first time frame will be one for pacification.  First of all, they should burst out of the war era, because the RPF retreated to the north of Byumba.  It was a war situation.  Negotiations should also be initiated.  By 1st July -- everything before July, 1992, contacts were made with the RPF; a first ceasefire was signed and, after the signing of the ceasefire, gradually we started working towards the Arusha process.  Now that government, subsequent to the Arusha Accords, had to undertake such reforms and leave its seat to another government.  Should we talk about the government that was based at the Arusha Accords or --
@MR. BESNIER:
Before the Arusha Accords, what were the effects on the Rwandan government after the two events that you mention in your expert's report, that is the RPF attack of February 1993 and the assassination of Mr. Ndadaye in Burundi?
@A.
Now, Counsel, these are two very signficant events.  These are two very significant events that should be underscored.  Why?  Here we are talking about frames of mind.  I believe that, as I talk, I have underscored the psychological/mental elements.  Now, this is the situation.  The RPF is represented by it's spokesman, by it's allies, by those that want to use it to weaken Habyarimana.  As a party, it's just like any other party, a party just as any other party that wants to play the game of democracy and, in turn, they propose to re-establish democracy in Rwanda.  Which shows that all the extremist Hutu elements or groups would fall apart and all those groupings will try to insure that the RPF are the only ones to come in, to come into the game, and in February 1993 it so happens, and for reasons that I'm not going to (interpretation unintelligible) upon the RPF, it so happens, attacked.  They attacked victoriously.  It went beyond Byumba.  It moved towards Kigali.  Now, from that time onwards, what we call the Hutu extremists -- I call them Hutu nationalists, because extremists is of what?  The Hutu nationalist are those who do not want Tutsi to return, would be winners.  They would say we told you this is what the CDR is going to do.  This is what the MRND people are going to do, because they are part and parcel of that movement.  They will turn to the MRND.  They will turn to the Hutu.  We told you so.  Look at what happened to your game.  All the games are being brought out to light.  We told you to participate in the elections.  We told you to participate in the democratic game.  No.  They used arms and they attacked and the ceasefire is in force.  Now, this initially gave eyes to major cracks among political parties and this phenomenon was amplified later on, on the 24th of October 1993, when President Ndadaye of Burundi was assassinated.  He was a Hutu.  Following elections -- there were elections (interpretation unintelligible) elections and he was elected; he was assassinated by a branch of the Tutsi army.  
Now, the second thing is that immediately the Rwandan Hutus that are (interpretation unintelligible) and the Burundian Hutus found that they were aggressed and so ethnic solidarity came into play, just as for the Tutsi at another time.  The argument is going to be, we cannot trust the Tutsi.  Look at them. They extend the democratic game.  They lose and they kill the president.  So how would you good Hutus, how would you patriotic Hutus continue to stand as to the position against President Habyarimana?  How could you continue to fight against your camp by supporting the de facto lions with the RPF at the Arusha process, because the Arusha process will give rise to the sharing of power with the Tutsi.  And the traumatism is there, profoundly, among the Hutu, because they are saying, especially the MDR people who hate Habyarimana, they hate him.  It is true they had a very serious bone to pick with him in '73, but there they tell them, "Look, we are the same.  Aren't we betraying our country, aren't we playing the part of the fifth column for the Tutsis?"  So that from that time I believe one can use as a benchmark for the setting aside of regionalism to be replaced by a Hutu nationalism that transgressed the regionalist framework.  In other words, the Hutu political parties, the nationalist factions of the Hutu political parties, came along with the extremist ranks in which said all Hutus must come together, they must unite against the feudals, against Tutsi invasion.  It is the return of feudalism, slavery, serfdom.  They will come back with their cattle, come to -- all the arguments in that direction were used.  This is what happened.  The first development would be accentuated by the disintegration of the main political parties, that is the MDR.  Because the MDR, who is the inheritor of Parmehutu, wanted Parmehutu (interpretation unintelligible) for the return of the Hutu ideology of the '50's, the '60's.  The MDR had people in it that supported the Arusha process.  They supported the continuation of the opposition, so that Faustin Twagiramungu and Agathe Umwilingiyimana, who was appointed prime minister of the broad based transitional government, of course, with the disintegration of the party, which would subsequently come. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Just as a matter of a vocabulary or explanation, you clearly said how the Hutu extremist movement behaved.  Is that same thing as what we call Hutu Power or is that different?
@A.
Well, these are movements that changed in names.  If you took Hutu Power, extreme Hutu extremists, we are talking about the same thing.  But I prefer to use a word that is much more constructive, that is clearer.  And to make a distinction between moderate Hutu and extremist Hutu, moderate or extremist Hutu, these are the vis-a-vis what?  I would like to compare those that go along the Arusha process, that would mean power-sharing with the Tutsi and those, on the other hand, who do not want power-sharing with the Tutsi.  Those Hutu that believed that Rwanda is Hutu which it transgressed leaves none of them to be Hutu and those who, for political reasons, want to topple the political regime, wanted to play the Arusha game.  Hutu Power doesn't mean anything.  I used as my benchmark the Arusha process, those who are for, those who are against.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, nationalism or extremists (interpretation unintelligible), do they affect the inference of PSD in the long run?
@A.
No.  No.  Every liberal party, which is a party that was set outside the ethnic system and it had two branches, the Hutu -- my friend Nysinga (phonetic) was killed, with his wife, in the genocide.  That party was disintegrated, but it is remarkable to see that the PSD had to escape that.  I will even go further and say that the PSD did not experience any glaring official currents of Hutu power.  It appears they had another political agenda, a political agenda that transgressed those cleavages.  One needs to look at the fate of the members of the PSD on the 7th and 8th of April to understand that.  The PSD is a very strange party.  Let me tell you a story that shows you that this party is very special.
At the end of 1993 there was, at the apex of the tension, the confrontation between the extremists, political chaos, but what happened at the end of 1993?  A delegation of young PSD militants went across the lines and went to Malindi in the military area held by the RPF.  For what purpose?  To play a football match with the young and active militants.  And what is interesting there is to see that the leader of the delegation, called Félicien Ndungutse, was the first vice-president of the party, was
assassinated.  And what is really interesting was that half of the delegation of the football players remained in the RPF zone.  So if the party, which, according to me, and I'm sure, is a party which is not within the political game.  
The Liberal Party is a party but not the PSD, because PL has Hutu power.  If you have the list, PSD, five members, four are assassinated during these events.  The first was killed in 1994 on the 21st February; Félicien Katanbazi (phonetic) and the others were killed on the 7th.  And out of the eight members I have 50 percent were assassinated on the 7th of April and on the 8th of April, so that here we are dealing - it's a pity -- It is a pity that the representativity (sic) of this entity was not established because the PSD was a party which could have held the key to reconciliation, had it played a better role.  Had it played a better role, the tragedy we saw later on may have been avoided, but the only party that rose above cleavages and rifts was the PSD.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Expert, for those explanations. (Interpretation unintelligible) we shall go through the Arusha Accords very quickly, because the Tribunal is very well apprised of the contents of the Arusha Accords.  All the same, we should like to hear from you as to the consequences of the Arusha Accords and Rwandan political life and the mermaid (sic) effect of the multiparty system.
@A.
Well, Counsel, I believe I have answered that question and, in fact, I've told you that in proportion -- and here we are dealing with when you want to do your best, you make several mistakes.  
The Arusha Accords was started to pacify Rwanda so we will ask questions, we that are here in the arena, to pacify through our work at each and every step, at each and every time a protocol is signed, there is a magnification of violence. 
Now, in Rwanda the Arusha Accords, in proportion, went on and precipitated violence in Rwanda because, on the one hand, President Habyarimana was going to do everything to (interpretation unintelligible) and those that were called the Hutu nationalists, or extremists will do everything to undermine.  How?  By securing the disintegration of their position, because in 1959 there was the revolution because there were two forces at play.  The Tutsi, the church, and Belgium.  Now, to the extent that the church and Belgium relied against the Tutsi, Tutsi power was condemned.  
The principle of the Arusha Accords was also based on those elements.  The RPF; they were two elements, this is what they were called, literature throughout this area is concerned and the 
opposition (sic).  Now, the dangerous stakes that were there in the Arusha process was that these three forces wanted to remain together, coherently.  It is clear that on paper, on paper in a parliamentary-type organisation, European time, symmetrically aligned.  We do agree that the political arraignment (sic) of the upper chamber, the lower chamber.  But if one of those elements was to disappear that would be anarchy and all the entire availability of the Arusha process was based on the fact, on the postulate, that none would go away.  The Arusha Accords said that the main component that was the Hutu opposition to Habyarimana was going to disintegrate, so that we have the Arusha process with a game of three and we are in a civil war with a game of two, because there was no civil war; there was only the RPF and the Hutu nationalists.  So the civil war was pre-programmed, so to speak, in the Accords.  
Whereas what happened after Ndadaye's assassination and the MDR (interpretation unintelligible) was such that disintegration was unavoidable.  There was no way out.  Is that clear?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  Now, according to Arusha, the PSD was going to participate?
@A.
Yes, in the transitional government, yes, with three seats.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, that transitional government, was it in accordance with the Arusha Accords?
@A.
No, the government was not established because people were dragging their feet.  The Tutsi were not in the government; in other words the broad based government, is a repetition of the same government before with the same Rwandan political parties with less representation, and that less representation is compensated by seats to be given to RPF, to be given to the RPF Tutsi, and the Accord didn't give rise to anything (interpretation unintelligible).  There was no government because generally, from April 1994, we experienced the tragic events that we all know of.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let us move along those same lines and talk about the tragedy.  What was the situation of the (interpretation unintelligible) of 1994 politically, in terms of military operations, if there were any, and in terms of ethnic tensions in Rwanda?
@A.
Now, Rwandan political life was completely disturbed, all the components disintegrated and there was no (interpretation unintelligible) transitional government, because there was no legitimacy, apart from the PSD that was united, and so far as the PSD was concerned, there was no problem, PSD was not in the game.  PSD was not in Hutu Power.  All the other parties disintegrated so that the various factions of those parties said, well, we, MDR, have two or three seats that are kept for us in the future government, but who in the MDR is going to sit in that seat, the secessionists, the legitimists, the others.  So that in the next following that year after the death of President Habyarimana all of the Rwandan political problems were going to be boiled down to (interpretation unintelligible) civil wars within the parties, all of them tried to persuade General Habyarimana (sic) that they were the legitimate ones and General Habyarimana was going to use that.  He was going to use that card against the others, to support these against the others, and his own team was going to fan the fire.  He was going to put pepper in the wound -- or salt in the wound so that there was total anarchy.  
As far as the president was there, he was there, he was sworn in and face to face with him he had parties that were divided and each was claiming legitimacy.  So that the situation was a non-starter ,so that the broad based transition government was to be set up at the beginning of the month of September of 1993.  It was never to be set up, never to be set up simply because the means were not there to be given by the United Nations for those concerned for the pacification of Rwanda and there was no agreement at all between the political parties.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, would you say that the situation you've just described, that since the beginning of your talk reflects the events in Rwanda from the death of Habyarimana or do you think that there are other causes that one may not speak about or did not speak about that could compliment research as to the causes of genocide in Rwanda?
@A.
Counsel, I do not understand the question.
@MR. BESNIER:
Expert, you have given us a picture of these (interpretation unintelligible) and political situations in Rwanda.  Now we are at the beginning of 1994.  We do understand that the situation is one of total chaos.  We understand that there's ethnic tension.  We understand that the Arusha Accords instead of giving grace to a political situation, has worsened, political solution has worsened the situation and helped President Habyarimana's plane shot down.  Then this was followed by the massacre of the Tutsi.  Now, the massacres ran for several months.  Were they due to the political situation such as you described or were they due to other causes that you didn't talk about because you are not aware of them?
@A.
Now, Counsel, what is going to happen and what happened is a result of phenomena, long term, medium term, and the triggering cause, that is the death of President Habyarimana. Let us not talk about the medium-term or the long-term causes.  If you want me to say who killed President Habyarimana, you will be quite disappointed because I do not know.  If you want me to speculate about responsibility of one and all, you will also be disappointed because I do not speculate.  I only talk about tangible facts that can be verified.  This is my profession.  So that I don't understand your question clearly.  
I believe I have explained various strings that brush about this fabric in Rwanda which has been heightened up to 1994.  Population, for example.  Food problems with refugees throughout the country.  After that time there were refugees from outside -- from inside, but because they were displaced people from and throughout Rwanda.  We had refugees coming from inside.  The situation was chaotic.  The French troops had left following the signing of the Arusha Accord.  The United Nations was not able to deploy its forces.  It was slow and all that compiled there was rancour.  There was inter-Hutu civil war, which it came back so and because those I called the extremist Hutu, nationalist Hutu.  For them the doors of the Hutu that continue to abide by the Arusha Accords, they're traitors.  They are simply traitors that are allies in their eyes, they are collaborators of the invaders. This is in parenthesis.  I am not talking for myself, I am trying to translate the frame of mind that obtained in the country.  So that we are at a terrible conjunction of facts.  There's a climate of pre-confrontation where Tutsi are being killed behind closed doors.  It was not the Tutsi that were to be in the forefront, that will come out later on.  It was the Hutu and those that were for the Arusha Accord, so that we have gone over regionalism as is tragic to see that in that poor country of Rwanda.  The (interpretation unintelligible) country of Rwanda, that has suffered so much from regional separatism.  His union or unity is going to be brought about by genocide.  It was genocide that brought about some unity.  That is the tragic paradox.  We are in the realm of tragedy in this Rwandan situation.  In Rwanda it is said that lies are equal to duplicity.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you very much, Expert.  We have tried to recapture the causes, political, economic and, as such, you have done this with maestro.
I believe that the 7th of April 1994 the political situation drastically changed.  What was the political situation on the 7th of April, 1994, in the morning?
@A.
Well, let us move to the 8th of April, because they massacred the Hutu leaders in the opposition was on the 7th and the 8th of April.  On the 8th of April, in the morning, the country was ungovernable; ungovernable because the president of the country died and the prime minister was killed. All the authorities that were responsible for running the transition died.  There was nobody.  There was nobody in line that was there to insure any political transition.  The only solution for those that were in power was to be contaginated (sic) or blended solution.  I believe that you legal experts are in a better position than myself.  I am a historian.  And probably they would have come back to the former competition, which was the only one which was normally in force.  Because those people responsible for the transition died and there was a void, a total void, as far as power is concerned.
@MR. BESNIER:
You have just said, "those in power".
@A.
Well, that was a mistake on my part.  I shall withdraw it, because there was nobody in power.  So that what I wanted to say was a void in power.  I didn't express myself properly.  I said "those in power", those that were there, but there was no power.  Constitutionally there was a void.  We will see who exercises power, but legally and constitutionally we are faced with a void.
@MR. BESNIER:
In those conditions, who decided to put together a transitional government?
@A.
Counsel, the question you put to me is one that I cannot answer.  Nobody is able to answer that.  I think that is the role of the Tribunal.  As far as current knowledge goes, we have no idea.  According to what we know, we don't know.  What we know, that that government was put together but we don't know who put it together.  We have ideas, but they are not certainties.
Let me move away from science and move into supposition or research.  Yesterday I read General Dallaire's book, which I believe is not yet here.  It came out in Belgium before yesterday; in Canada last week.  And I was able to read it on the plane.  It's very interesting, very, very interesting.  It's very interesting, and many things that he confirms are in that book.  What Reyntjens had said and what others had said before him, it's confirmed by a witness that was there, an actor.  Soldiers tried to impose a military government.  What Reyntjens said in his book, "Three Days That Changed History" even surprisingly Reyntjens is a good researcher.  He has much talent.  Have a committee that would oversee all of this, which is the overseeing committee of that.  This is the committee -- a phantom committee which seemed to exist because a civilian minister would be there.  With the committee we don't know what its composition is, at all.
Counsel, I cannot go beyond that.  Please don't let me leave my area of speciality, which is certainty, it's history.
@MR. BESNIER:
We won't make any hypothesis, but can you shed any light on how the interim government was composed, how was it implemented?
@A.
Yes.  Yes.  We can do that.  We have great documentation.  Here I can speak of certainty and I can say something about that.  The interim government is developed on the 8th.  It takes the oath the next day in Kigali on the 9th.  This interim government, let's put it in context.  Let me go back to history again.  Let me talk about chronology.  
There are two things that we know.  The first thing we know is the meeting at the Ministry of Defence on the 8th, was it very early in the morning.  And I base that on what Alison Des Forges said.  She is completely right.  That meeting was early in the morning.  The meeting took place between 8 and 9 in the morning.  
We have a second piece of information, which is a certainty, completely established by Reyntjens and others.  The government is made up during that morning, composed during that morning.  What is interesting to know is that that government will be composed in the absence of one of the political parties that should participate in the game.  That political party is the PSD.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why is the PSD not present at that meeting?
@A.
Counsel, I told you there's no longer anyone in the PSD, they all died.  I gave you the names of the victims.  Ministers left, they were either fleeing or they were killed.  There was no longer anyone.  So, when the meeting was called at the Ministry of Defence, there's no one representing the PSD.  All the parties are there, even the parti libéral, the PL, because there's the Hutu Power branch of that party is there, but there's no members of the PSD -- well, rather, let's be more precise.  Members of the PSD will show up, but much later.  The meeting will be over.  They will not have participated in the negotiation.  The second thing we know, it's obvious and all the researchers have established this, and let's talk about Reyntjens again.  He talks about this, the PSD shows up at 3 p.m. at the Ministry of Defence.  The meeting began at 8:09 in the morning.
When the PSD arrives, when the members arrive the meeting's over.  The PSD is taken hostage.  Members who are there, who are low-ranking members of that party are taken hostage.  We will see why this government, this provisional government, needs PSD members, but later.  But it's a tragic situation we are faced with.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let me ask you the question right away.  Why was it necessary to integrate PSD members into the government?
@A.
Those who -- I don't know what their name is -- but those who were behind putting that government together, could be perhaps soldiers, perhaps not.  I don't know.  Let's put a big question mark next to that.  They represented a political ideology that was very clear.  They represented the nationalist Hutu ideology, what was called Hutu Power or Hutu extremists.  
Why is it original, compared to the previous political past of Hutus and their affiliation, where we had people in Gitarama, the microregionalism?  Then we had the microregionalism of Rukiga.  People in the CDR wanted to move beyond that.  They wanted to bring the Hutu world together.  So in the context of the assassination or death of President Habyarimana, in the context of the power vacuum, in the context of the complete anarchy, it is fundamental for the PSD to be represented, because the PSD will be their trump card.  It's a party that is not opposed to the Arusha Accords.  It is accused often of playing with the Tutsis, of ailing (phonetic) with the Tutsis.  The PSD is considered as a party that betrays the Hutu cause.  It is important for those in the nationalist Hutu branch to say, "Look, the danger against the Hutu world is so important that even the PSD is here.  All Hutus are united."  That is why they take them hostage.  That is why the PSD must be present, absolutely.  
We can speak of regional equilibrium of balance.  That is a secondary issue.  Regional balance or imbalance is already achieved without the PSD members.  It has already been achieved.
We spoke of political fiction.  When the previous government shared seats in parliament.  These are not determining arguments.  I think that the determining argument and my conviction is that charges show that in spite of the terrible opposition that separates the Hutus, there's Hutu union, and these poor members of the PSD fall into the trap and they won't be able to get out.  Why?  Day after day things keep going and they find themselves, members of this government, dragged by what is considered as some kind of government solidarity.
Mr. President, please pardon me for going back in history a bit because we have to understand what happened in history to understand what happened in '94. 
@MR. BESNIER:
That is very clear, but one thing is a bit obscure for me, did the PSD participate or did it not participate in that meeting of political parties of the 8th of April 1994, which finally decided the composition of the government?
@A.
I'll be categorical.  No.  It did not participate.  The PSD arrived between 3 and 3:30 p.m.  The government was already composed.  The list was already drawn up.  They were put before a fait accompli and there was a survival strategy that had to be put into place.  They didn't have a choice.
Here we're in an air-conditioned room, people who are polite, we are having a discussion.  We are having an academic discussion.  Imagine the 8th of April in Kigali, the cauldron, the burning cauldron.  Three times in my existence I've seen these kinds of situations where either choose between life or death.  
You must know -- you must live through this to know that there are strategies for survival in place that you have to use.  And that will lead to one thing after another, a chain of events that is inferno.  You will see when you see -- when you read General Dalliare's book.  He sees two dead Belgian soldiers, his escorts refuse to stop.  It's complete folly.  It's hell on earth.  And before this hell you have cold reactions, surgical reactions, people who are in situations that are completely exceptional.  I affirm that, according to my current knowledge, the PSD did not participate in the meeting which put together that government.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
In that meeting in the Ministry of Defence in the morning, that's the meeting you are referring to now?
@THE WITNESS:
Absolutely, Mr. President, that is the meeting, the meeting that composed the government, that put the government together.  Then the government was put together there will be, of course, other meetings, where the PSD ministers, of course, will participate.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Your sources for saying that the PSD was not there, could you just mention those sources, very briefly, list them, please?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have many of them.  Well, there's Reyntjen's work and research; Premyie's work; Alison Des Forges's work.  But Alison Des Forges makes a small minor mistake in her chronology.  
Is it possible to look at her report?  At one point Alison Des Forges says it very well, and she is correct.  The meeting begins without the presence of the PSD, without PSD members being there.  Alison Des Forges makes a minor mistake in her chronology.  She says "soon after delay" or "after some delay", "After some delay members of the PSD arrive."
But they don't arrive after some delay.  It's some hours after.  We have a document that is very interesting, which was given to me by the Defence team, and it is the minutes of a meeting, and let me find it.  Bear with me, please.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Let's just hold on.  We'll get to Des Forges later.  Can you please tell us which page in her report or in her book where she talks about the composition of the interim government?
@A.
Yes, I've got it here.  Page 230, two-three-zero.  Her book and report use, in many ways, the same terms.  She says, "Early in the morning of April 8th Bagosora assembled party leaders to fashion a civilian government."  I don't know if Bagosora was the one who assembled those leaders, I have no information on that.  Yes, I have got this before me, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Does Ms. Des Forges speak of the participation of PSD members at that meeting?
@A.
In her book?  No, she says the PSD representatives were not present.  She says that, in exact terms, it was difficult.  It had been difficult to locate representatives of the PSD because most of its national committee had been killed or gone into hiding.  But after some delay, PSD members Nyacinthe Nsengiyumva, Francois Ndungutse and Ndindabahizi joined the meeting.  
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, she doesn't talk in this work about Naindabahizi's presence in the PSD delegation?
@A.
No.  No.  Pardon me.  I looked at the index, and I am always cautious with indexes because often it's not the author who puts them together but it's rather assistants who put them together electronically.  I was not able to find Ndindabahizi's name, so I started looking page through page.  No.  She does not mention Ndindabahizi in this book.  In the book you don't see the mention of Ndindabahizi's name.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, we've already raised this issue during examination of Ms. Des Forges.  I have her book, Leave None to Tell the Story and the expert, Lugar, has cited this work as a source when he speaks about the meeting of 8th April.  He also says that the name of Emmanual Ndindabahizi is not in this book.  We have supported that assertion, and we would like that this book, Leave None to Tell the Story, written by Alison Des Forges, be tendered as a defence exhibit.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be D. 49.
$Exhibit No. D. 49 admitted)
@MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Expert, you also spoke about the work done by Filip Reyntjens.  Can you tell us in which work -- in which article that he wrote does he mention -- talk about the meeting of April 8th?
@A.
Yes.  He wrote two important books, one about the crises in the Great Lakes Region.  But I'm talking about another interesting work he wrote written in 1995 called Rwanda, trois jours qui ont fait basculer l'histoire, "Three Days That Changed History" published by Amitar in 1995.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  In that book can you tell us, if you have that book before you, and if it's possible for you to do so, where does Reyntjens speak of the participation or non-participation of members of the PSD at the meeting of political parties?
@A.
Yes, it's on page 88.  Reyntjens is very clear.  Should I cite this, yes?  I'll read this, then.
Let me read the entire sentence.  "Next a government must be set up, a new government."  Filip Reyntjens writes here, "And since they wanted to appear to respect legality the government had to include the same representatives as the previous government, so they had to include members of the PSD.  It was decided, therefore, to invite two members from the politburo, François Ndungutse and Nyacinthe, Nsengivumva Rafiki, who arrive with an escort around 3 p.m.  This is on page 88.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Witness.  We also have a copy of this document and we should like to ask this document, as well, be tendered as the next Defence Exhibit, Mr. President.

That's excerpts of the book, page 88?

@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Witness.  I'm sure that you have many different sources and I'm sure that you've talked with witnesses, talked with resource persons and I'm sure that the information that you've given is the result of hard research.
@A.
Yes, I even used a source from the Tribunal.  I could even talk about a source from the Tribunal dating back to 1996-1997 on two occasions.  Would you like this source, Counsel?  Should I cite it?
@MR. BESNIER:
Perhaps we'll get to it later, because I have some more questions for you.  I have more questions about the source you are about to mention.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I'm not sure if I should continue in my examination-in-chief at this time.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a very good point.  Now, your reference to Alison Des Forges, Mr. Witness, that is page 230 of Leave None To Tell The Story book, that's the source, the quote you are emphasising in your report is page 230 of the book now entered as D. 49, isn't that so?
@MR. WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  Page 230, and on that page Alison Des Forges speaks of the beginning of that meeting of 8 of April, which started early in the morning.  In her report she says the same thing, by the way.  She confirms that in her report, but -- which is also confirmed by my own information.  She is completely right.  The whole question is to know whether it was 8 or 9 in the morning, but --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in other words, you are commenting on page 14 of her report, page 230 of her book, and you are saying that these two quotes are the same, that is the situation we are confronted with, yeah?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, page 230.  But, unfortunately, I don't have the report before me.  But if my memory serves me well, she says approximately the same thing in her report.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It follows from your footnote 32 that you refer to page 14 of the report.  All right.  
No, I think you are right, Mr. Besnier, that we will have to stop now and that we will end with you tomorrow and then after that we have the cross-examination.

Court is in session.  Good afternoon to everyone.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
Just a practical matter.  Now we are 12 minutes late because I understand the Accused arrived too late; yesterday we were 10 minutes late because a staff member arrived too late; and last week I think we lost 30 minutes because of some handcuff episode.  Now, I have still not received a report on what went wrong with the handcuffs, and I asked for a report on that.  I haven't got it, so that must be submitted immediately.  And at the same time, we want to know why these delays are occurring.  So, Registry, make sure that this happens now. 
Now, you were in the middle of examination-in-chief.  Please proceed.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Good afternoon, Expert.
@A.
Good afternoon, Counsel. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Expert, yesterday we were talking about a meeting that was supposed to have been held or that was held on the 8th of April 1994 at the ministry of defence in Kigali, and you had said that at that meeting the PSD did not attend.  Do you confirm that?
@A.
No, the PSD did not arrive at the beginning of the meeting, it did not participate in the negotiations concerning the setting up of the government.  The PSD came after the government was set up.  So my answer is yes and no; PSD was not there at the time the government was being set up, negotiated, the PSD only arrived at around 3 -- 3 p.m., 3:30 p.m., when the die was cast.  That I can confirm, in the present shape of affairs of my scientific knowledge, sir. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Perhaps you can help us with one point, Expert.  Now, we know that the PSD members that came at the ministry of defence on the 8th of April were appointed as ministers of that government, so how could they have been appointed ministers without having taken part in the meeting that was supposed to distribute the portfolios, the ministerial portfolios?
@A.
If my memory serves me right, Counsel, I believe I answered that question.  I told you that they were put before a fait accompli, and they were compelled to fight for their survival.  The posts were distributed, the appointments were made, so that they were faced with a fait accompli.  They had not a solution, lest they risk their lives.  If you know what happened in Kigali on the 7th and the 8th, you would understand the fears that they experienced. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  All the same, I believe there is a small contradiction between what you are saying today and what Alison Des Forges told this Tribunal when she testified.  If I refer to her report, her expert report, page 60 in the French version, where it says about the interim government, Alison Des Forges states:  "After some delay the PSD members, Hyacinthe Nsengiyumva Rafiki, François Ndungutse and Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, came into the meeting -- joined the meeting".  So that Madam Alison Des Forges is saying that those three personalities came to the meeting, and you have just said that they did not participate in that meeting.  What are your grounds for that assertion?
@A.
I believe, Counsel, that we have information that is quite clear.  In the chronology of events of that very important day, since the government was going to be set up, in the chronology of events we have a benchmark on which we all agree.  The meeting began early in the morning.  There is an intermediary point on which we all agree:  the PSD members were not there.  And then there is a point on which Filip Reyntjens and myself do agree, that is about the arrival of the PSD delegation at around 3 p.m.
Now, Mrs. Alison Des Forges is not very clear in her formulation.  In English it says "After some delay", "Following some delay", "After a certain time lag".  Now, the problem is very important.  I did say so yesterday, Mr. President, I am preparing a book on the history of the genocide and its origin.  The book will be published within the next coming weeks.  I was saying that I was not directly interested in this particular question of timing as far as the day of the 8th was concerned, so that when I received the report of Alison Des Forges that you sent me I raised a question.  I undertook some enquiry, because there was a contradiction.  The historian's work is to underscore the contradictions.  You cannot just write anything.  "After some delay"; could it mean half an hour, one hour, two hours?  "After some delay" could be 7 to 8 hours, because the PSD came at around 3 p.m.
So that, please remember, I turned to you, Counsel, and told you that I had a problem, because that particular point was of crucial importance to me, and I had no serious data to enable me to go further into my enquiry. 
Now, you then sent me a document which is a document that came from the Tribunal.  Mr. President, the Tribunal's documents court number or reference is TPI ICTR-2001-71-T, Ndindabahizi, 30th of November 1996, 8-11 July 1997 and 16 July 1997.
@MR. BESNIER:
Just a minute, Expert.
@MR. BESNIER:
This is Exhibit P. 25 of the Prosecutor.  P. 25.
@THE WITNESS:
Now, what does this document say?  If I interpret it correctly, it talks about a certain number of testimonies, a certain number of testimonies from Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Now, I should like to draw your attention, Mr. President, to one particular element.  To date -- and let's be very clear on this one -- to date all that I have said to you was scientifically documented and verified.  
Now, with this document, of course, we are talking about a statement made by the witness, that is the Accused.  Now, if I look into this statement carefully, it would appear to me to be coherent and I would say that it is reflective of the chronology, the timing of things done on the 8th.  Now, is that sufficient?  Is that sufficient enough to base -- to use it as grounds for assertion testis unus, testis nullus?  So that I turned back to you and said that I had a problem because that testimony was coherent, it was logical, but that I could not take the liberty of committing myself on the basis of a simple testimony, and I asked you, "Do you have any testimonies that would enable me to cross-check, from outside, such and such a point in the statement made by Ndindabahizi so that I would revise my inquiry?"  You said yes.
Now let me draw your attention, Mr. President, to the document I mentioned.  That is not in my report, of course.  Why?  Because it is a confidential document and Mr. Besnier confirmed this to me.  He said to me, "I confirm this to you, on condition that you do not mention it.  It is a confidential document".  Even the name of the witness that I couldn't, but use Witness KA3.  This is why I didn't mention it in my report, and I used that report on the basis of those conditions. 
Now, what did KA3 say?  He says something very interesting.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid we have to stop a little moment here.
Now, Mr. Besnier, are we now in P. 25? 
@MR. BESNIER:
We are talking about two documents, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
^Before the expert goes on, I think if you could kindly now direct us to the right documents so that we have them in front of us.  Could you -- because you know the codes we are using inside this courtroom, even if the expert also may have them.  So, please, first reference was made to P. 25.  We have that in front of us.  Which page do we look at? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, I believe that the expert is using -- is relying on the first page of that document, more specifically, the first two paragraphs, that is the interview of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the 8th to the 11th of July and from the 1st to the 3rd of August 1997.
The document mentioned by the expert, it is page 1, there is a paragraph, second paragraph that begins with, "The 8th of April 1994, I spent the night at Rafiki's".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So, what is relevant here is the paragraph starting "Le huit d'Avril 1994" and then onwards.  That is one document.  What is the other document he is referring to then, please? 
@MR. BESNIER:
The second document, Mr. President, is the testimony that was recorded by the Defence several months ago but which was not submitted to the Tribunal.  So that in truth I didn't know whether the expert was going to mention this document today.  This having been said, I do have a copy of it.  I am rather uncomfortable, because we are talking about a protected witness who has not testified, but of course I can serve this document to the Tribunal and to the Prosecution.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what is the pseudonym of this witness?  Is that a protected witness in this case, but a witness that was not called in the present case? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  He was not given any protective measures because we didn't say that we were going to call him, so that he didn't enjoy the usual protective measures.  So that I do have the name of the witness, and the written testimony mentions the name.  This having been said, I shall serve it to the Tribunal.  It will be an exhibit under seal, if we may, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, are you aware of which document we are talking about now, the second document?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour, we are not, and we would actually object to the production of a witness statement in lieu of calling the particular witness, unless the provisions of Rule 92 of the Rules of Procedure are complied with, otherwise we may not have a witness statement as an exhibit pursuant to the provisions of those Rules.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So it is up to you, Defence Counsel, whether you want to lead this through the expert or whether it is unexpected that the expert is coming up with this.  That's up to you.  This is your expert.  I leave that to you.  But if at some point you wish to tender this as an exhibit, then you will first have to, of course, give a copy to the Prosecution so that we know what we are talking about, and the Bench would also have to familiarize itself with this document so that we know where we are. 
All right.  So now we know, Mr. Witness, that you are talking about two different documents. 
Should we start maybe with P. 25, which is the simple one and which is the document which we have in front of us here, and that is then a summary based on a meeting with Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Yes?  What do you want to say about that, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
The document, what date is it of, Mr. President? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now talking about -- I think, based on what you said, that you are referring to a document in French called "Report of the Meeting of the Minister of Finance (no interpretation)" ... obviously conducted by Mr. Gandhi Shukri and some other investigator.  Is that the same document?
@THE WITNESS:
Very well.  Interview with Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel.  Very well, I am not going to come back to that because I have talked about it.  It is a document on the basis of which I built the chronology of events of the 8th concerning Ndindabahizi, so that I am not going to come back to that.  I am just trying to cross-check the documents at this time.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But what are the relevant paragraphs here referring to the timing of the arrival of PSD at the 8 April '94 meeting?  Can you help us with that, please?  Where shall we -- do you find any support in this document for the fact that PSD arrived around 3 o'clock and were not part of the morning meeting?  I don't know which significance this has, but just to be clear. 
@THE WITNESS:
It is not on this document that I am relying on to say that the PSD came at 3 o'clock, it is on the work of my colleagues, especially Filip Reyntjens, and on the literature.  Now, this document that I am using -- let's be very clear.  When I read Des Forges' report, this particular point concerning the chronology of the events of the day appeared to me to be very important.  I didn't raise it beforehand because it didn't appear to me to be important.  I noted a contradiction between certain specialists and researchers and what Madam Des Forges was saying.  There appeared to be some imprecision, and it did not tally with what we knew about the timing of the arrival of the people of the PSD.  I therefore talked to Mr. Besnier and asked whether he had any information, because I was quite sure -- I was not quite sure.  Mr. Besnier communicated that document to me, so that I am not coming back to that document, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we know, I understand, that P. 25 doesn't really assist us here.  Isn't that the case? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then you have referred to Filip Reyntjens on a few occasions.  I think that is a different reference, and that is also a document which you have produced, Defence Counsel, but which has not yet been entered as an exhibit.  And this is this document. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  That is the document.  I thought that it had been produced and served.  If that is not the case, we should like to tender it as an exhibit.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, very briefly, Mr. Expert, are you relying on Reyntjens' book when you enter into this chronology?  Just very briefly, yes or no, please.  And then I have a few other questions afterwards.  Is Reyntjens' book of relevance here when it has come to the chronology, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
Reyntjens' book is very relevant and Reyntjens' book, as far as the three days are concerned that changed history, it was on those three days that this document becomes relevant.
Mr. President, let me come back if I may -- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, which page is it in Reyntjens's book that we should look at now?  Is it page 88? 
@THE WITNESS:
Page 88, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So we are talking about the same page.  Do we all have that in front of us now then?  It is page 88, and it is the paragraph which starts, "Il faut ensuite procéder".  C'est bien ça, n'est pas?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, we quite agree.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  What do you want to draw our attention to there, please? 
@THE WITNESS:
I am referring to this confidential witness who is going to enable me to cross-check as to whether --
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Expert, the President wants you to point to the relevant passage in Reyntjens' book concerning the meeting of the 8th of April.
@A.
Let me point out the passage, Mr. President.  Page 88:  "Then the new government was to be set up" -- this is in French, for the interpreters, this is the first paragraph on page 88.  Are you with me?  It is the paragraph that begins with, "The new government was to be set up.  It was confronted with the problem of the representation of PSD.  It was therefore decided that two members of the political bureau be invited, François Ndungutse and Hyacinthe Rafiki, who arrived with an escort at around 3 p.m.", end of quotation.
That is the passage I wanted to refer you to, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And where is the link to the morning meeting in the passage you just read out? 
@THE WITNESS:
It is the same meeting, Mr. President, that is dated the 8th, and that points to the arrival of the PSD members at around 3 o'clock.
The preceding page, Mr. President, the preceding page, that is page 87, in note 154, that is the bottom of the page, we see the following:  "In reality several politicians of the presidential group already met with Bagosora from around 9 o'clock in the morning", and it points out as being of 9:30, that is the arrival of General Dallaire.
Mr. President, let me open a parenthesis.  Unfortunately you do not have the book written by General Dallaire in Arusha.  I saw a photocopy of it, and General Dallaire told me that he was at the ministry of defence and that Bagosora was there and certain members of the Hutu Power were also there.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But this footnote, 154, doesn't that -- that is footnote 154, isn't it, and isn't that referring to the first sentence, "That is why the first working session which started around 1 p.m." --
@THE WITNESS:
When the working session began at around 13 hours, the die was cast, because the politburo, if I can so say, met at around 9 o'clock with the personalities mentioned, and from that time onwards the entire chronology of events was mere formality.  All the more so as for the PSD people who arrived at 3 p.m.; at least for them things were already over. 
Very well, may I proceed, Mr. President? 
Now, I was saying, Mr. President, something about the historian's responsibility.  I happen to know Madam Des Forges through her work, and Mr. Reyntjens was my colleague in Butare, and who is a very serious personality.  
Now, on this particular point I did not work on in detail, and I saw some contradictions therein, and I turned to Mr. Besnier and asked him whether he had documents to allow me to forge ahead in my work.  It was on that occasion that he gave me the documents that we mentioned earlier on, that is, the three interviews of Mr. Ndindabahizi that you referred to. 
Now, by going through them, they appear to me to be coherent, they appear to me to be logical, they appear to me to be acceptable, they appear to me to be reflective of what happened, the chronology of events, during that day.  But as a historian, please understand me, I cannot rely on the statements of Mr. Ndindabahizi, even if they are coherent, to make an assertion.  I turned back to Mr. Besnier and said, "Well, this is interesting, but I cannot use it".  And Mr. Besnier told me -- I'm sorry, I asked him, "Do you have other data that would enable me on this and that point to confirm such and such an element in which Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke?"  He said, "Yes, on condition that you don't mention it in your report".  So that it is that confidential witness that is mentioned in the document given to me and is referred to as KA3.  So that I do not know who he is, and I simply would quote what does the witness say.  "In 1994  **********Emmanuel Ndindabahizi --

@MR. PRESIDENT:
So you were given this document, and asked kindly do not mention it in your report.  That is a written report.
Now do you want this witness to refer to it in his oral statement now, Mr. Besnier?  Is there something you want to introduce as evidence or as supporting documentation, or is it not? 
@MR. BESNIER:
No, sir.  No, Mr. President, I'm not asking that this document be tendered as an exhibit, it was some information for the expert, from the expert for more information, but I'm not saying that it should be an exhibit.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is the situation, Prosecution.  They are not demanding it exhibited.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Please proceed.

Could I mention this document, just mention it?  Now, Witness KA3, and I quote:  "In 1994  
********** Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  On that 7th of April at around 11 o'clock *****************stayed there for one and a half hours or two hours and then he went away to see a friend, and I never saw him any more.  He told us that he was going to see that friend at Kicukiro".  This was dated Kigali, the year 2000, 5th of January.
Now what is the importance of this document?  This document doesn't do anything for us, but it was the departure point of the testimony of Ndindabahizi. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can I say that the Defence is now trying to enter that document through the back door, because what he is testifying to appears to be the contents of that very document which he says he is not going to enter as an exhibit. 
@MR. BESNIER:
No.  Mr. President, there are two things here.  The first thing are on the sources that the expert has for his report, some information, some data and some testimony.  Now, the testimony that has just been read is part and parcel of those pieces of information, so that I didn't even know that that testimony was going to be used by the expert in his testimony.
The second thing that should be taken into account is the probative value of the testimony.  We are not saying that this testimony be tendered as evidence, we are saying that along with the documents the expert took cognisance of certain information, and this is only one of the pieces of information.  That is all.  It does not have probative value, it will not be tendered to the Tribunal, we shall not use it for Ndindabahizi's purposes.  It will merely be a source of information, that's all. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are stopping here? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  The statement has been made by the witness.  I understand that that is where this is going to stop, because you are not eliciting further information from the witness, the document will not be tendered, the Court will not have it in front of it, and, consequently, that is all we are faced with.  And this may have a bearing on the weight to such a non-seen document. 
So, proceed then, and I understand that this is the end of this matter.  Yes?

Counsel, I think this is the third time I have answered this question.  No, he could not have.  He could not have.  I don't want to bore the Court by saying it a third time, but I maintain what I said yesterday and earlier today; no.  It was life or death. 
@MR. BESNIER:
On which date did the government take the oath?
@A.
The official date is established, it is the 9th, the next morning, at the Hotel Diplomat.  This is established.  There is no doubt about that. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Do other researchers confirm that date of 9th April as the time when the government took the oath? 
@A.
Yes, absolutely.  These are official texts that this is based on. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Have other historians talked about this date of 9th of April as the government -- as the date when the government took the oath?
@A.
Yes, everybody; Filip Reyntjens, myself, Des Forges, everybody.

If we look at Mr. Reyntjens' book, can you tell us where in that book he talks about this ceremony?
@A.
In Filip Reyntjens' book it is on page 90, nine zero -- no, I'm sorry, 91, nine one.  But Counsel, this is an official date.  The government was sworn in on that date, officially. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, thank you, Mr. Expert, I don't need to go any further on that.

@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Expert, I only have a few remaining questions.  Now, regarding that government that was sworn in on the 9th of April, can you tell us if that government effectively governed the country or really governed the country?
@A.
Mr. President, I think -- I don't know if this is really legal what I'm doing, but I will come back to the book of Mr. -- General Dallaire.  It is a very exciting book.  General Dallaire in his book that I talked about yesterday, that you should have next week, no doubt, said -- this book is coming out very soon.  He talks about the prevailing environment.  It is very surprising.  And it shows the surreal atmosphere in which all of this took place.  Page 357 of General Dallaire's book, he says the following -- it is the 9th of April in the morning.  The 9th of April he goes to the ministry of defence, he learns that everybody is there at the Hotel Diplomat because they are getting sworn in.  This confirms the date of the 9th.  And I cite:  "Once I arrived at the Hotel Diplomat I met a certain number of ministers and their family members.  They were packing their suitcases.  They were putting the goods into their cars.  Nobody wanted to stop to talk to me".
I am speaking too fast.  I will begin again.
"Once we arrived at the hotel I met a certain number of ministers and their family members.  They were packing their bags.  They were putting their goods into their vehicles.  Nobody wanted to stop to talk to me, each person was very busy to get out, trying to get out of the city.  Later on I learned that they were moving towards Gitarama, some 60 kilometres south of the capital, to be in a safe place.  This scene made me think more and more about the fall of Saigon, the installation of a government determined to take control over the country".
Here we have an atmosphere that is very surprising, baffling.  These are the last days of Pompeii.  It is chaos.  It is the final fall.  Everybody is trying to save their own skin, and that must have been what this government was. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  Let's go further with these thoughts.  Can we say that the government is made up of political ministers or technical ministers who have work to accomplish, or is it both?  What is your feeling on this?
@A.
You are asking me to make a value judgement.  I'm a scientist, a researcher.  I can't say anything different.  I studied a bit of constitutional law, I know what the continuity of the state means.  Let's leave the political ministers aside.  In this government, there are technical ministers, I must say; I think so.  Among those technical ministers, I see three or four.  The one who interests us here is the minister of finance.  He is the prototype of a technical minister.  For the continuity of the state, the administration must continue to work, and generally when there is great difficulty and exodus in the country, which we saw in France in 1940 in June, there were two types of ministers, technical ministers and the rest.  These are the ones who ensure the continuity of the state.  The minister of social affairs is also, in this case, a technical minister.  This is a large -- there was a large refugee problem, the need to feed people.  That is a technical ministry as well, with work to accomplish.

@THE WITNESS (continuing):
But I can't go any further than that; I am going beyond my area of expertise and beyond my area of scientific certainty.  I hope you understand this, Counsel.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I do, and I thank you.
Let's suppose that a witness came before this Tribunal and stated the following:  that the simple fact that the civil servants were paid by that government, was for them encouragement to commit genocide.  What would you say about that assertion?
@A.
That's total speculation.  That is speculation.  The historian turns towards the lawyer.  This just corresponds to my previous answer.  We have to talk about the continuity of the state.  The civil servants are paid up to the point that the state disappears.  The state disappears when the coffers are empty.  We are in a period where the state is retracting, but it is still there, even if it is an embryo, even if it is a political facade.  I don't see a link between paying drivers or gendarmes or different civil servants, a link between that simple fact and an encouragement to commit genocide.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Expert.  Thank you very much.  Regarding the research that you have conducted, do you have an idea of the number of deaths caused by the genocide of 1994?
@A.
Regarding those -- those tragic numbers, people have been excessively cautious.  To be certain as to not distort reality, estimations, if we can speak of estimations, or macabre counting, if we could at the highest estimations, it's more than one million, perhaps 1.2 million.  If you look at the lowest estimations, it's around 800,000.  Unfortunately, in reality, it is probably one million.
It is true, though, we will never know exactly know how many people died, and that is because people were displaced.  We didn't find all the mass graves.  Even if we had found them all, not everybody was buried inside of them.  There must have been ten of thousands of cadavers that were brought away by the Kagara, that were lost in the papyrus groves.
So I give you between one million, 1.2 million, I would say about one million.  Don't ask me more, though.  I don't know the exact statistics.  However, I did work on a very important document.  It's essential, in fact, and I have had it for some time.  This document was published in February 1996 by the minister of higher education and scientific research, one of my colleagues at the University of Rwanda.  Basing my assertions on that document, I can say that those figures are more or less exact.
@MR. BESNIER:
Is this the document called "Preliminary report of the identification of genocide sites of the massacres between April and July 1994 in Rwanda"? 
@A.
Yes, Counsel, that is indeed the document.
@MR. BESNIER:
This document speaks about a large number of victims; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, this is a very interesting document.  It's a document that counts the mass graves and the victims and also counts the names of the killers and also gives -- and this a very important -- the dates when the genocide began in each of the different communes.  This is a fundamental document for historians.  I used this document very much to -- when I used -- when I made the maps that I put in book that will come out very soon.  This was research conducted by my colleague at the University of Rwanda, and this is a primary source to any historian.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Witness.  Did you ever see the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in that document?
@A.
I have had the document for several years.  When I was preparing a report on Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the PSD party, naturally I went back to everything that concerned Kibuye préfecture.  I went through the document and looked at everything that concerned the communes in Kibuye.  I was doing my work as a historian, and, in fact, no, Ndindabahizi's name is not found anywhere in the document.
I don't know if the Tribunal knows of this document.  It is an essential document because it gives a commune by commune account of the researchers' work.  They go through and give the names of the killers, those who ordered the killings, the date of the genocide, the number of victims, the number of mass graves.  It is a document, in fact, that will be used to create memorials for the victims of the genocide, and in this document, Ndindabahizi's name is nowhere to be found, unless I am making a mistake or not remembering.  Unless it is a serious mistake, I have not seen his name anywhere in that document.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Expert. 
@MR. BESNIER:

@MR. BESNIER:
Witness, do you know if massacres of civilian Tutsis began before or after the swearing in of the interim government?
@A.
If I base my information on this document, we have fundamental points that can make us be certain, that tells us that it began before the interim government was sworn in.  For example, I have taken four pages that give examples of four communes, pages 21 -- must I cite the pages, Mr. President?
Now, page 21-089, 21-089, "Kigali préfecture, Kanombe commune:  Killings begin on the night of the 6th of April" --
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are now referring to this document for preliminary? 
@THE WITNESS: 
Yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

@THE WITNESS: 
I will give you two references, Mr. President, two references:  page 183, 183.  
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you just refer to page 21? 
@THE WITNESS: 
No, Mr. President, it's page 183, 183.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's found.  We have that one. 
@THE WITNESS: 
"Kanombe commune, Kigali Préfecture:  The massacres begin on that same night, 6 April 1994."  
Page 201, 201, "Kigali Rural préfecture, Rubungo commune, Kiningi secteur, page 201:  "The first massacres begin on the 7th".  In Gashura commune it is the same.

@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I think you have gone beyond our expectations in that answer.  Thank you very much.
I only have two remaining questions for you, Mr. Expert.  You said you that you were preparing a book on the genocide of Rwanda; I am sure that you have researched many different things and questioned resource individuals.  Can you tell the Tribunal if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's name has ever been mentioned or if you have ever read Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's name in the documents that you used to prepare your book, and, if it was mentioned, was it mentioned as somebody who incited or encouraged the genocide of 1994?
@A.
The current state of my research, the current state of my research, would say no.  Ndindabahizi's name is nowhere to be found.
@MR. BESNIER:
Last question, Mr. Expert:  Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi went to Kibuye on 3 May 1994.  Was Jean Kambanda, the Prime Minister, at that meeting and were other political personalities present at that meeting?  This was a public encounter, a public meeting.  Some witnesses asserted that Mr. Ndindabahizi made a speech during that meeting.  I will sum up what he was said to have said in that speech.  According to witnesses, Ndindabahizi allegedly said; first, the PSD is not an accomplice of the PRF.  Second, the PSD is not the accomplice of the RPF, and I prove it because the PSD is supporting Jean Kambanda's government.  Does that possible statement of Ndindabahizi prove that he intended to support a policy of genocide, whatever that policy may be?
@A.
Which date, Counsel?
@MR. BESNIER:
3 May 1994.
@A.
I don't know that document, Counsel.  I am going to talk about a summary that you gave me of the document.  I am just responding off the cuff here.  We have to look at the historical context.  What was the context at the time in Kibuye?  Kibuye, one of the worst massacre sites.  He was at a meeting with the prime minister -- we are talking about Ndindabahizi -- amongst people who, of course, belong to the Hutu Power wing, the extremists, and they are against the PSD for all of the reasons that we spoke of yesterday.  The PSD was considered by many politicians, many Hutu politicians, as a true accomplice, an objective accomplice of the RPF, therefore the Tutsis.  
There again -- and I must repeat myself over and over, I always say the same thing -- here again, we have to talk about a survival strategy.  Mr. Ndindabahizi, well, I don't find it surprising, that, Mr. Ndindabahizi would say such things to get himself up, but what he said is not maximalist, it's the minimum he could have done to avoid a machete on the top of his head or a club over the head.  He is still in his survival strategy.  And so if you interpret the words as that, as those that he said, I don't see anything more than a willingness to try to gain some time, and, in rugby, just trying to make a pass.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Expert.  Thank you very much for your cooperation.   I don't have any further questions for you.  We do appreciate your coming before the Tribunal to speak with us, and I believe that the Prosecution probably has some questions for you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have two more documents to tender, two more documents; first, the CV of the expert, the signed version.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  That will then replace the present D. 50.  The signed version will replace the document which we entered as D. 50 a few minutes ago.
Yes?
@MR. BESNIER:
The last document is the expert report itself that the Tribunal already knows about.  It was disclosed several weeks ago.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you want, first, the preliminary report dated February 1996 from the commission concerning genocide and massacres to be entered as D. 52 first; that is the first document.  And then after that one, you would wish the expert report itself to become D. 53, the French version being D. 53(A) and the English D. 53(B).

Q:	Now, Professor, when I look at your report, I note that except on the introductory part where you talk about the origins of the ethnic groups, you don't -- you do not provide any references or bibliography for the conclusions that you make from pages 5 to 20.  There are of course, a few footnotes scattered here and there, but these are basically explanatory notes.  They are not, as such, references to the materials you used in reaching your decision.  What do you say to that?
@A.
Counsel, indeed, that bibliography was given to you in large part during the hearing itself.  It was a photocopy and references.  Counsel, I thought that it wasn't a really university academic work that should be referenced as an article or a university paper.  I was asked to give a presentation of the general framework and the chronology.  Of course, I can give you a detailed bibliography, especially since I'm working currently on this issue and a bibliography is very important when you do such work.  I think that from the beginning, maybe, it was a bad direction, but this bibliography, I can give it to you.  And, in fact, yesterday I talked at great length about it and even earlier today during my testimony.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So you agree with me, Professor, that your report, the way it stands, is insufficient to support the conclusions that you have made?
@A.
I do not have the same feeling, Prosecutor.
@MR. KAPAYA:
So you are saying the report as it is, without a bibliography, without references, without sources, you want this Tribunal to believe what you have put there even without those basic documents to support your findings?
@A.
I didn't mention the bibliography.  It was a question of works that you were not cognisant of and works that were not in the purview of the Tribunal.  We talked about Prunier, we talked about the report of Madam Des Forges and various books by Reyntjens.  We have talked about all these works that you have which, for me, were considered as being in the public purview and that of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Also, I did point out certain works that are very precise but that are not in your own area of speciality that shed light on the issue.  I don't think that I needed to expatiate on all of these issues for the benefit of the distinguished members of this Tribunal.

Yes, thank you, Professor.  Now, still on your report, on pages 1 and 2, you assert there are very clear racial distinction between the Hutu and Tutsi.  You say that the Hutu and Tutsi are categorisations that are racially determined at birth, like sex, and that they cannot be changed.  Now, do you still maintain that theory?  You didn't talk about it in your oral testimony.  Do you still maintain the contents of that theory as contained in your report?
@A.
Prosecutor, thank you for that question, because yesterday I didn't want to bother the President, and I did try to be succinct concerning this part.  But it gives me the opportunity of doing so, and I will do so and I will probably go beyond that, and I will rely on the works that I am going to mention, that is, works on genetics, quite recent now, that will corroborate what we know linguistically, ethnographically and historically.
Now, let us be clear.  At the origin, at the origin, we are dealing with two different populations from two different areas of Africa.  It did happen that in the course of the centuries, blending did take place. There was blending and alliances, so it is impossible today, unless one is farcical scientifically to say that there is a Hutu typology and a Tutsi typology.  But what I am saying, what I am maintaining is that we are dealing with two different populations from the very onset, from the very origin.  Have I covered that question, Prosecutor?
@MR. KAPAYA:
I am being rather specific, Professor.  I am saying, do you still maintain that racial theory as contained in your report, very briefly, that the sources, the origins of Hutu and Tutsi -- I mean, the distinction is racial rather than socially constructed; that when you are born, you are born a Hutu or you are born a Tutsi?  This is not something that you construe socially, I mean in society.  Is that your theory, because that is what you appear to be propagating in pages 1 and 2 of your expert report?
@A.
Thank you, Prosecutor.  Your question is very clear.  I do quite understand very clearly.  Yes, absolutely.  Here we are dealing with sole theories, sole theories.  For many, many years, researchers are divided into various categories.  Some categories concerning this issue of origins -- I hope I am not going to bore the Tribunal, but since you are giving me the opportunity I shall expatiate on this.
For some researchers, usually researchers that are in the Marxist or post-Marxist era, we are faced with economic distinctions; for other researchers, we are dealing with ethnic distinctions.  Now, the two are erroneous.  Why?  We are not dealing with ethnic groups in the semantic sense of the word.  I said so yesterday.  What is the definition of an ethnic group?  It is cultural, it is linguistic.  It's not racial.  The linguistic and cultural element determines the ethnic group in Rwanda, both for the Hutus and the Tutsi.  We are talking about people who talk the same language, they have the same culture, they belong to the same state, they are aware of the fact that they belong to the same political world.  So that, by definition, these are not ethnic groups.  In certain research, we are talking about castes.  And all these elements are fundamental and they will explain the genocide.
They are of fundamental importance.  Why?  Because either one belonging to one world or the other is final, just as sex, and it is from birth, or it is mobile, just as any economic speciality.  The Tutsi are rich, the Hutu are the poor.  A poor man can become a rich man and a rich man can become a poor man.  No, that is not the case in Rwanda.  In Rwanda one is unfortunately either Hutu or Tutsi, and 1 million people died, and this shows that that tragic reality is the historic reality, is the social reality.  
I will not transgress that, Mr. Prosecutor, because I can dwell upon on this for hours and hours on end, and this is my thesis of 1,700 pages.  I shall not talk as a specialist here, but I can tell you that I am one of those historians that believe that, apart from particular cases of blending here of one climbing the social ladder, it has happened in the past.  We know some of them.  There was on the one hand a Hutu world and on the other hand a Tutsi world.  There were ladders here and there.  During the colonial period those ladders were cut off.  The passages were religious, because those two worlds were not opposed to one another during the pre-colonial period.  There were quarrels between dynasties, et cetera, but there was no place for the extermination one of the other as we saw in Rwanda in 1994.  There were safety valves here and there which are such that through blood alliances, through religious cults, all these things disappeared with the missionaries.  The missionaries forbade alliances.  When in the battlefield, there were Tutsis here and Hutus there, the Hutus fought together, and if there was an alliance between Hutu and Tutsi, it was done, and that was often beyond the ethnic fact.  And so there was solidarity here and there.  There was marriage, for example.  Marriage, inter-marriages were eliminated.  
Now cults, traditional cults, they were there not as Hutu or Tutsi, the cults transcended the realities.  They were eliminated as being pagan by the Christians, Catholics or Protestants.  So that those bridges disappeared.
Very quickly, I talked about three categories that are chiefs:  the chief of the land, the water, et cetera. Some chiefs were Hutu, and after the government scheme in 1921-1924, these bridges disappeared. So that there were two elements:  one was one, a Tutsi, one was one, a Hutu, one didn't become a Hutu or a Tutsi because of the number of cattle.  My thesis is entitled, "Between the hoe and the ownership of cattle", and this is my final position, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, if it were put to you that whether you were a Hutu or a Tutsi, leaving aside whether you call it race or ethnicity or whatever, in the final analysis, depending on whether you have an "H" or a "T" on your identity card, if that was in practice the test, would agree with that, and if so, how would that coincide with the irreversibility doctrine on page 2?  I think that is linked to Mr. Kapaya's question.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, that is the question he is indirectly asking, I think.
@THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, could you be clearer as to your question?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If it were put to you that whether you were regarded as a Hutu and a Tutsi because of intermarriage, same religion, same culture, living together for centuries, very difficult to find often really big differences, even if you have the two-finger-in-the-nose test, et cetera, et cetera.  Now, because people were so similar, maybe therefore that what it really boiled down to, whether you were conceived as -- or perceived as a Hutu or a Tutsi was whether you had an "H" for Hutu or "T" for Tutsi on your ID card.
Now, would you agree that that was the position, and if you agree, how does that coincide with the doctrine that it was irreversible?  In other words, once you were Hutu, you were a Hutu, because people might change their ID card.
Now, what would be your comment to that, not to elaborate it, please, but just, I think that is what the Prosecutor is trying to put to you indirectly.
@THE WITNESS: 
My answer - I will be very short -- I do not agree at all with your position.  Is that brief enough, 
Mr. President?  I do not follow your reasoning, because you are trying to make me say what I am not saying.  I stick to my guns scientifically.  I can spend the whole afternoon explaining this, but this is what I am saying.  I believe I am one of two or three specialists in the world about this, and we can discuss it all day.  I am prepared to discuss it. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA: 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Professor, very briefly, you - it's your position that you still maintain the racial theory, don't you; yes or no, maybe, to cut the matter short?
@A.
I maintain the fact that to be Tutsi or to be Hutu is as final as sex.  Even if you are in the Belgian period at the time when ID cards were made on the basis of the moment, some Hutus will say they are Tutsi, some Tutsi will say they are Hutu, depending on circumstances, depending on relationships here and there.  But I am talking about definitions that are the original definitions, these are the basic definitions.  I am not talking about exceptions; we can find exceptions.  I am talking about the general basis, and I am formal on this, Prosecutor.  You haven't heard that very often here, but I am confirming and I am upholding that position.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Professor, that's exactly what I wanted to find out, and actually you have propagated these views in several newspapers like Real Afrique, you know that paper in France, then there is Identities, L'Afrique, Minute La France, National Hebdo and Present.  Are you aware of those papers and have you written extensively in those papers about this particular theory?
@A.
What do you mean by particular theory?  If I refer to the general history of UNESCO and the preamble section of the general history of UNESCO, it says, "We do not reject the word of 'racial difference'."  I see what you are trying to drive at.  Let us not talk about race.  I am not talking about race.  Let us talk about genetic differences and we will all be happy.  I am happy to see that my modest view in Real Africa is known to people as honourable as the Judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  This is an honour for me, and I am very proud of it.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I am not aware of that article, but the Prosecutor was referring to it, I think, yes.
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Professor.  Actually what I'm asking you is that this particular racial theory which you have advanced in relation to the Hutu-Tutsi relationship in Rwanda, it's something that you have -- I mean, you often write about, and you have written it in these papers which I have just quoted to you, and I will show you -- I will show some of the articles.

@MR. KAPAYA:
Is that so, that you have written extensively on the subject?
@A.
Indeed, I have published about 15 books.  I published several intense articles in Rwanda.  My letter of officials so, a quantity of maps, of Atlas, in all languages.  I'm an author that is very well read, and I am quite happy and proud about it.  I was -- worked in collaboration for several réveils and over the last 10 years I have my own réveil called The True Africa, which is a very elitist review.  It is limited in dissemination through subscription.  And the reviewers get talking about things that one doesn't talk about.  We talk about -- with people from some political schools of thought and this is about a certain vision of Africa which may be different from the vision I have.  I'm not an ideologist.  I believe I have shown that I had a little knowledge about Rwanda, and I had little knowledge about the issues here, and I wanted to create my own réveil in order to delve into the problems of Rwanda, because one cannot be interminably right about Rwanda.  But in réveil, the issue does not belong to one. This is why I have my réveil.  I can give you a copy.  If -- you may not have a copy, although you mention it.  I can make a copy available to you.  It's in my briefcase, Prosecutor.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Professor, you have also written several books on South Africa in Defence of that policy of Apartheid, have you not?
@A.
Prosecutor, there are -- you are not properly informed.  This is the fault of the Internet.  You took the name of Lugan from the Internet and then you went on the sites of people whose profession is calumny and, as the Prosecutor, the above act is a good historian.  He didn't go to the source.  He is now disseminating rumours that I had to pay for 14 trials that I won.  Do you want us to embark on this road about calumny, Prosecutor?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Professor, the University of Lyon 3, is their representative for the revisionist theories.  Is that not correct, where you teach.  You teach at the university of Lyon 3 in France.  Now, that university is renown well over for the revisionist theories.  Is that not correct?
@A.
Prosecutor, you are manipulating syllogism with a seeming innocence that would make the academy laugh.  We are, at the university of Lyon 3, we are legal experts, economists, philosophers, people of art.  We have about 12 to 15 faculties.  We have 4,000 lecturers.  I do not know what you are talking about, because indeed, when one talks about revisionism one talks about Lyon 2, not University of Lyon 3, the other university of Lyon.  
Mr. Prosecutor, this is where the Internet fails, once again, because documentation based on the Internet without any criticism gives rise to calumny and not to scientific debate.  I thought we were here to talk about Rwanda and the PSD.  Now you are telling me rumours that were taken to Court, and I won 14 of them.  And now I refuse to be dragged into such a debate, and I will not say anything further.  Let us be scientific here, if we may, and not talk about rumours, the type that is merely meant for recreation, if I may so say.
@MR. KAPAYA:
What I'm telling you now is that on the transcripts on the testimony of a witness, Professor Chrétien, in the Nahimana case -- these are proceedings dated the 5th of July 2002 -- he was asked about you and these are his comments, your fellow professor.

And then I think you should go document by document, if you so wish, Mr. Kapaya; otherwise it becomes too general and the discussion may become a bit complicated.

@MR. KAPAYA:
Professor, I refer to you the first one, it's the transcripts in Clement Kayishema, whenever you have them before you.  Do you have them?
@A.
I have it before me.  Yes, I do have the documents there.
@MR. KAPAYA:
This is the 5th of November '97.  The witness who was testifying here was Professor André Guichaoua.  I don't know whether you've heard about this man.
@A.
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
On page 11 there is a question.  Do you know the words of Bernard Lugan?  He said Logan but what he means is Lugan.  It's a two-page document, Professor, the very first one which I have handed you.
@A.
I don't have it.  No, I can't find it, page 11, number 11.  I don't have it.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay, there is a question there.  "Do you also know the works of Bernard Lugan?"
@A.
Yes, I do.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, and this was Mr. Besnier who was asking questions to Professor Guichaoua.  The question reads" "You also stated yesterday morning that there is no real history on Rwanda.  Do you know about the works of Mr. Lugan, his scientific approach to the history of Rwanda?  Do you not think it is sufficient in its approach?"  Guichaoua says, "It is always very difficult to make very appropriate statements about the works of my colleagues; nonetheless, I feel that with regard to his works and, in particular, to those made by Bernard Logan, I do not agree with the theories he has presented."  Have you found that?
@A.
So (interpretation unintelligible) very well.  We can talk about it.  He doesn't agree with my theories.  What's his curriculum vitae as compared to mine?  I'm ready to talk to anybody.  I do not use these foul methods.  
Yesterday you saw that I do have -- I gave you the impression that I knew the history, of  Rwanda.  Probably I gave you an impression that is different.  I am suddenly of an opinion different  than his.   We are talking about -- I'm from the French academe.  I'll go back to academe.  The problem is very clear.  We are dealing with a problem of two schools of thoughts, Africanese, the French Africanist -- this is a very Franco French problem.  He defends the theory that there's no Hutu -- no Hutu.  He is saying Hutus and Tutsi were created by organisation.  I'm saying no.  The Hutu and the Tutsi were not created by organisation.  They were there before.  Not only were they there before but they are two elements, but they are different.  
On that basis, and nothing more, came tumbling down on me and you were here to weaken my position, my scientific position, to attack me on areas that I'm not scientific.  I am sorry to say so, this is not cricket.  We may very well talk about science, but to talk about persons that gave into them, these are not articles, they are interviews or interpretations of interviews.  I've always accepted it is the work of the university man or research worker to use what he has been able to discover, what he has been able to observe, and a university teacher-research worker should be able to talk to a panel as different and, as possible, I've done this in all areas, in all forum.  
I can tell you about the news that you haven't heard.  Internet doesn't give you everything.  For calumny, Internet is excellent; but for scientific work, there is less of that.  I can talk about (interpretation unintelligible).  For example, if a journal is a newspaper, it is not politically committed.  I worked with Figaro, it's an economic newspaper, a centralist newspaper in France.  I work with economic reviews.  Now you discard all of that.  You discard all my interventions.  
You should remember that you are face to face with an expert who is a professor at the school of Lyon in France, (interpretation unintelligible) studies professor in all the main military academies.  Now all the people you are talking about are nothing.  They are in the establishment of politically correct, indeed, but I am in another secteur.  You can talk about economic jealousy in France, perhaps it's different elsewhere, but all this is to say that I am disappointed.  I am disappointed on coming here.  I have about 450 students first year, 250 students second year.  We have my I exams in one and a half months.  Do you believe that my university allowed me to come here for eight days to come here to explain foul calumny that you are passing on me?  I am here to give you my conviction, to teach you about my realities and what I know about Rwanda.  When you talk about rumours, where is the justice, where is the fate of the Accused?  This is ridiculous.  I am not saying anything further on this issue.  No use you asking me any further questions on this, Prosecutor.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So the witness has responded to the first document.  What is your next document?
@MR. KAPAYA:
My next document, Your Honour, is transcripts in the Nahimana case.  That is page 58, line 12 to 14.  We have here another professor, Professor Chrétien.  He was asked about the reputation of Lyon 3 University in France and this is what he says. 
"Lyon 3 is a university which is very well known for the importance of their negationist theory", and then on page 39 he goes on to say, "The Minister of Education in France had to launch a kind of audit on this university, and this was because of the furore which had developed around the teaching of that university.  And I'm saying that Mr. Lugan avers to that way."  That is page 39, line 29.  These are the transcripts recorded before this Tribunal.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you answer that question, Mr. Witness, let me say that this is the only question put to you by the Prosecutor.  But the Court, of course, is quite aware that there may be -- now this is the question put to you by the Prosecutor and you are now free to respond to that, but before you respond, in view of your previous answer let me simply say that the Court is, of course, aware that there may be difference of opinions between scholars, and that is normal.  So we are aware of that.  So this is not extraordinary in a trial, and it is not very dramatic, but this is the questions from Mr. Kapaya.  So what is your answer when this is being put to you?
@THE WITNESS:
Chrétien is not one of my colleagues.  He's not an academic.  He never had the chance of being integrated into a university.  He's a researcher from the CRNA.  He is totally incapable of speaking before an amphitheatre.  That's why he was never recruited to be in a university, he's not part of my world.  I'm a teacher and researcher.  He's a researcher at the CRNA who works in his office alone and I'm in contact with many students every day.  He is not my colleague.  Reyntjens, on the other hand, is my colleague.  Guichaoua is my colleague.  Prunier is my colleague.  Chrétien is not.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to put more documents to this witness, Mr. Kapaya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, they are in a sequence there.  The next one is in French, this one is dated 30th October 2001, (no interpretation), something like that.  It has a photograph of a lady on top of it.

I have that document, Counsel.  Yes, this is an excellent document which reflects exactly my thoughts.  This is the document to which I have nothing to add, especially when I explain to the population of central Africa this is a document which corresponds absolutely to my thoughts.  Ethnicism is a reality in Africa.  This is very good.  This is exactly what I said.  I agree with this.  Very well.  For the rest it's not correct, for this professor.  I don't know if in Anglo-Saxon countries you have Carnival or Shrove Tuesday.  Do you know Shrove Tuesday in the Anglo-Saxon world?  Well, I'm at the University of Lyon.  That is where we celebrate Carnival and we have a tradition of celebrating Carnival.  
We have two kinds of professors, from the old school there's one type who are afraid of their student and for them they wouldn't disguise themselves or put on a costume for carnival.  But I'm very easy going, and I put on a costume with the students every year.  The students, 150 of them, come in the amphitheatre and put on costumes.  And I do as well, and it's not something we take very serious.  That is a festival of liberty.  The king could be a commoner and the commoners could be king.  And we do this one time a year with my students, and we put ourselves on the same level.  We sing together, they put on costumes and I put on a costume and we sing together.  I like to sing old songs from the French navy, the colonial, and we put on costumes.  And speaking of costumes, because in this article it's talked about, this has come all the way to Arusha.  I'm a celebrity now.  
I had put on a costume of an officer from the 6th Regiment of Britain in Bengal with a beautiful uniform that comes from my family.  And there's the officer's stick that all the officers have.  I just saw today Tanzanian officers who had their stick.  I had a whip in my hands, they called me the "Whipped Professor" and I came in a costume of the 6th British Regiment in Bengal who went into India in the 1880s.  
Now we're on a very funny level, now, Mr. Prosecutor.  I didn't think I would come before the ICTR to talk about all of how we celebrate carnival in France.  Are you satisfied with my answer, Prosecutor?

"Following his racist arguments", that is false, "the French academic, author of Philanthropic Colonisation to Humanitarian Colonisation, claims that pre-colonial Africa ignored writing, use of wheels, of pulleys, and animal traction."  This is completely false.  I wrote a history of Egypt.  I never said that pre-colonial Africa ignored writing, use of wheels and pulleys and animal traction.  I said that one part of Africa did.  I did not say pre-colonial Africa, as a whole. 
Regarding racists argumentation, that is a value judgment.  Shall I continue, Counsel?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
@A.
"Publication of the thesis of Bernard Lugan has provoked controversy in the university world and the immigrant community of African origin living in France."  That's completely false.  Every week I hold conferences before associations of young immigrants and whenever I speak to them about the origins of the Berber peoples and the large cities in the Swahili world and the Trans-Saharan commerce they see, through me, not only someone who knows his history but also someone who loves this continent.

In fact, all of these documents have resulted in a trial I won.  This is the problem of the Internet, people are accused on the Internet, but whenever you win a trial that's never mentioned on the Internet.  So we are arriving at this problem today, where you are trying to discredit the serious and important things that I said yesterday and today under the pretext that the guy who saw the guy, who saw the guy, who saw the guy, is making syllogies.

Not at all.  My response is so spontaneous.  I'm what they call a right-wing anarchist.  I have no label, whatsoever.  I'm a free man and because I'm a free man I have the luck of being free because I'm a university professor.  I'm free because of my family situation.  I won't continue.  I had parents born before me, which is completely unequalled, but gives me great comfort in my existence.  This has helped me to refuse compromise.  I'm from a Protestant family.  Protestants don't laugh about these sorts of things.  We are rigorous people.  I have my moustache and my ways of living, but there are some limits we must not go beyond, Counsel.

Counsel, without being pretentious, I don't know if Newton was on the same terms with all of his colleagues, if all his colleagues agreed with him.  I don't know what the others think.  What the others think, I'm a researcher who knows Africa very well.  I've published many works.  I don't know just a little small part of Africa, as some of the researchers that you've cited.  I have the advantage of being a man who covers long distances and long times.  All of my university works always start with a very precise topic and enlarge it.  I'm a man who works on big major periods, linking periods.  It's these links that explain the rest of history. 
My scientific career, my publications speak for themselves.  My university title speaks for themselves.  What I told you yesterday, let's agree, Counsel, I don't believe that you can consider me as a joker from yesterday, what I said yesterday and today.  Perhaps through jealousy or any other reason for criticising my work, those people do what they want.  This is not serious business, Counsel. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, I must be a little bit firm here.  We are really not interested in this part anymore.  We've heard the questions and we've heard the answers.  Now, could we kindly move on to whether there are any comments on what the witness said in substance yesterday?  You have very rightly now, Mr. Kapaya, referred to one issue in the report, that was page 2, and that was commented upon.  Are there any other comments in that report or in relation to the oral testimony that you would like to focus on from now on, please?
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Professor, I would refer you to page 3, the fifth paragraph, English, in your report.  I don't know, I think it's page 4, 4 in the French, where you write that, "Violence against the Tutsi in 1973 was started by PARAMEHUTU trade to try to obtain power." 
Now, what is the basis of you saying this?  What is your proof?  Do you have any proof for that?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the English version.
@THE WITNESS:
Counsel.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Page?
@MR. KAPAYA:
English, page 3.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Paragraph?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Fifth paragraph.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
"Soon started a purge policy", that's the one.  Is that the paragraph, the relevant paragraph, "soon started"?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Fifth paragraph, the active is in the last sentence, so, "In the first week of February 1973 they had for Tutsis scattered".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we have identified the sentence in the paragraph, yes.
@THE WITNESS:
Counsel.  May I respond, Mr. President?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@THE WITNESS:
Counsel, sorry to tell you that in 1973 the PARMEHUTU had been out of power for 20 years.  You mean 1973?
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, that's what you write, Professor?
@A.
No, 1973, not 1993.  The PARMEHUTU was chased out of power in 1973 on the 5th of July.  Not in 1993.  In 1993 this is the Arusha agreements, this is the MDR.  We are speaking of the PARMEHUTU from the first republic, correct?
@MR. KAPAYA:
I think there is a translation problem.  The paragraph in your report, the last paragraph in the English report says, "So in the fifth week February 1973 the hunt for the Tutsi started."  Now my question is, is it not an equally forceful explanation to say that the Habyarimana challengers for are the ones who attacked the Tutsis, not necessarily the PARAMEHUTU?  Why do you attribute it to the PARAMEHUTU?
@A.
Counsel, in 1973 Habyarimana is not in power.  Habyarimana arrived in power in 1973, July.  We are speaking of February.  I don't understand your question.  I think, Counsel, that you have mixed up the dates.
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right, let's go to paragraph 7.  Paragraph 7, paragraph 6 in the English.
@A.
Which page, Counsel?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Seven, paragraph 6 in the English part of this report.
@A.
May I please have an English version?  I don't have an English version to be able to compare to the French.  There's no problem.  I understand English.  Let's work with the English text, that way we'll have no understanding issues or problems with dates, which should not come up into this type of historical debate.  Which page, Counsel?
@MR. KAPAYA:
It is paragraph 6, where the last paragraph says, "President Habyarimana, who lost his powers in and constitution even had to resign from the army."  Now, do you mean that when Habyarimana resigned from the army as general he lost his powers, is that your contention?
@A.
Not at all.  Not at all.  I simply wanted to say that in the short term, the new constitution, he could -- there could no longer be a confusion between military and civilian power.  General Habyarimana had already reached the age of retirement.  General Habyarimana became a civilian.  He was president.  They went away from this policy, which was the authoritarian policy where generals maintain themselves in power.  We were, in a new system moving towards democracy, opening towards democracy.  Habyarimana, in this system, would start to lose his military label.  At any rate he had already reached the age of retirement described by the military.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Go to page 10, paragraph 2, where you talk about dissent in the political parties.  And you say that there were no dissents in the PSD.  Now, Professor, have you not read of a Mr. Nungura, a member of the PSD political bureau, in Butare, who was a very good friend of Nzirorera?  Isn't he one of the people who you said defected from the (interpretation unintelligible)?
@A.
In the PSD, Counsel, there was no Hutu Power wing.  The party did not break up.  There were fractures within the party.  There were many resignations.  There were many -- there was much frictions in camps and sub-camps, and that was in the other parties, not in the PSD. 
The PSD is not an army regiment with a monolithic vision.  Every man has his own sensibilities.  Of course here or there you will find the exception, but as the Hutu opposition broke out against Habyarimana in that exploding world, which would implode later on following the RPF Tutsi attack and the assassination of President Ndayaye, what happened in the PSD is something we could call remarkable stability, compared to what happened in the PL party, in the MDR party, and compared to what happened in all the other opposition parties.  It's very clear.  That's the exception of the PSD.  It's too bad that that party wasn't more important, because it is a party of balance, a party that had a calling and had a programme and it had ideas that went beyond all of those old divisions of the past.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Okay, on page 11, the English version, the second and third paragraphs, you give the impression that it was from the 8th of July '93 when the RTLM was formed when Tutsi were officially labelled as accomplices.  Is that what you are saying there, Professor?
@A.
Let me look at my French version for a moment to be sure of this translation, to make sure that this translation is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are still on this, "except for PSD"; that's where we are still?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Where are you now?
@MR. KAPAYA:
I'm now on page 11, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Of the English version.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Second and third paragraphs.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
"From this moment on."
@THE WITNESS:
Counsel, the translation in English is very good, but it seems to hack up my thinking.  In French, yes, yes, the meaning is there, but the nuance is absent.  What do I say?  
In French I say the following:  "In Rwanda the -- 
@THE INTERPRETER:
Could the interpreters be given the paragraph, this is for the English for the interpreter, please.  Could he repeat the beginning of the paragraph, please, in French?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, settle down.  Exactly on where we are now, we disagree exactly on where we are now.  Now, you have, haven't you, Mr. Kapaya, referred to page 11, second, third paragraph in the English version.  Isn't that so, does it start with "From this moment on", or "In Rwanda"?
@MR. KAPAYA:
It says -- you are right, Your Honour, it is the second and third paragraphs, but we start with the third paragraph.  To have meaning, one has to read in the context of the second paragraph.
@MR. PRESIDENT:  
I understand that.  But if you could kindly repeat the first word of the paragraph where we should start reading.  Is it "In Rwanda"?
@MR. KAPAYA:
"In Rwanda".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So "In Rwanda"  And for the booth, then, have you found it?  That is page 11 of the French version (no interpretation), isn't it, at the bottom there, (no interpretation) is found?
@THE INTERPRETER:
Yes, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we all have it.  
And, Mr. Kapaya, your question, Mr. Kapaya, which sentence do you want us to focus on here?
@MR. KAPAYA:
The sentence I want the witness to focus on is the third paragraph.  He says, "From this moment on the Tutsi population living in Rwanda became hostages of the extremists because they were publicly and officially designated as RPF accomplices."  Now I asked him whether this was the first occasion - this was the occasion when Tutsi were now labelled accomplices of the RPF.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
@THE WITNESS:
It's from that date that we truly noted the amplification of the denunciative process against the Tutsi as a whole, but let us declare, the massacres began well before that.  They began, as we said yesterday, advanced as soon as the advent of RPF entered the Kibiro region in October with massacres all over the country and that were to be accentuated in various stages of the chaos.  But it is clear from the time when the explosion, the disintegration of the opposition came about, from the time that the disintegration of the opposition gave rise to the alignment of the former adversaries or part of the former adversaries of Habyarimana with the CDR, for example, that we started seeing the policy of pointing the finger at Tutsi beginning to be useful in the political tools of those people. 
$Pages 22 to 34 by R. Lear)
1615H
@THE WITNESS (continuing):
It was the arguments they used.  
What were the arguments of those people they call Tutsi extremists?  Their argument is that they are the Hutu.  They said, "We Hutus are divided; it's a matter of course.  We don't have the same political approaches; we do have our own old quarrels; we hate each other, perhaps, but we are Hutu.  Now, how do we assert the fact that we were Hutus in the face of the Tutsi, in the face of the Tutsi, of the RPF, who are attacking us, in the face of all the Tutsis that live in Rwanda, that they are our accomplices that are going to rise against us when the RPF comes here?"  And this is very important, and this is why I entitle this paragraph B, "From the United Hutu Front to Hutu Power", because here we are dealing with the crux of the problem.  We had three forces in play: the RPF -- the RPF, the government and all that is around it, and then the Hutu opposition; three elements.  
Now, the political game that is going to divest Arusha of its entire meaning, is that we are going to be faced with two forces: the Hutu element disintegrated, and part of it went along with the CDR.  So that here we are faced with a bipolar world.  And in the bipolar world, the justification of this bipolarity is pointing at the enemy, and the enemy pointed at has always been pointed at.  But here it is really put in the forefront.  You see, "We, the Hutus, good patriots, who were lost because of the Arusha (interpretation unintelligible).   We were lost in supporting RPF because we thought RPF was a normal party.  Now things are clear.  We go back to where we belong, better late than never, and we are going to do that, because in spite of everything, we are Hutus.  We are Hutus in the face of the enemy".  That is the teaching; that is the ideology.  
Mr. President, have I covered the question?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have absolutely, and if you could be a little bit briefer, that would be extremely helpful.  
Now, what is your next question?  Do you have many questions from the report, Mr. Kapaya?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Just a few questions, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, go ahead. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Professor, you said that you were a lecturer at Butare University from '72 to '83, right?
@A.
No, no.  There were no grades.  There were no grades in the University of Rwanda.  I was a lecturer in Lyon since 1985.  In Rwanda we used North American criteria.  In the Canadian system, for example, there was classification.  I had a contract on the basis of French cooperation, which was one of assistant.  I was 25 years old.  I was working at the University of Rwanda as a lecturer in geography and history, but I was never a senior lecturer.  This is, very specifically, French.  There is a chair, and of course there are very few chairs in African universities.  One of them you mentioned.  I am a senior lecturer, so to speak, but in the other university, this is a different system.  
Have I covered that question?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you have responded to the question.   
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, actually that was not my question.  I was not talking about grades.  I asked him whether he was a lecturer at Butare.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now listen carefully to the question: were you a lecturer in Butare?
Is that your question?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, between '72 to '83.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And I think maybe Mr. Kapaya is asking this question because of the CV.  
Are you?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, I want to connect it with the Accused person, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
@THE WITNESS:
Well, precisely.  I do not think that the Accused attended my lectures because he was not in my faculty.  I taught in Butare, in history, from 1972 to 1981 and in Ruhengeri from 1981 to 1983.  And of course, I taught at Butare at the same time. 
$BY MR. KAPAYA:
@MR. KAPAYA:
So at the time you were a lecturer at Butare, he was a student there, right, for three years?
@A.
Now, let me tell you that I do not know Mr. Emanuel Ndindabahizi.  I do not know him.  I believe that he studied economics -- not with me.  I was teaching the history of Africa.  And I had the happiness of being associated with Abbé Kagame, who has nothing to do with General Kagame.  He was a respected historian about Africa and Rwanda.  He ran one of the volumes of the UNESCO history.  He associated me with those lectures because we had intellectual community on certain elements concerning the history of Rwanda.  So that I only taught history.  A little bit of geography, but mainly the history of Africa.  That was my contract.  That is what my contract said, at any rate.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Professor, we agree that, I think, that the interim government was formed on the 9th of April, and not on the 8th, when negotiations were going on, right?
@A.
The swearing-in ceremony took place on the 9th at about ten o'clock in the morning.
@MR. KAPAYA:
And you allege that Mr. Ndindabahizi had joined the government as a matter of -- as a survival strategy.  Now, as a survival strategy, do you agree with me that he had to support the massacres in order to live?  I mean, did he have an alternative in that?
@A.
I am not saying that at all.  Especially, I'm not going to make any gratuitous speculation.  What I can say I can demonstrate, and what I cannot demonstrate I cannot say.  As I said, when I speak about certain reports that I mention, these are not reports that I can corroborate (interpretation unintelligible) 100 per cent.  I have a scientific démarche; I do not speculate.  
What I want to say is that Ndindabahizi was taken hostage.  He was taken hostage at the ministry of defence, and he could not refuse that seat, that administerial portfolio.  Everywhere people had been killed.  There were dead bodies everywhere.  The massacres had begun, and we were in an atmosphere -- I'm sure you understood it yesterday -- an atmosphere of hell.  People had to make options very quickly because of survival.  And I am convinced there, and this is a conviction that I have no grounds for other than my own personal knowledge of Rwanda and the context 
historical (sic).  What the historian needs to, one, not to make any mistake about chronology; two, no mistakes about context in history.  
Now, from a historian, it is not objectivity.  It is to place himself in the context of the moment, because we are not people without bodies.  We are not (interpretation unintelligible) mechanical parts.  We are human beings; we have options to make in life and for survival.  And I am saying that Ndindabahizi had an option to make which would commit his family and people around him.  He could not have done otherwise.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Professor, are you aware that in the morning of the 9th of April, before the swearing in, 
Mr. Ndindabahizi borrowed a car from a friend, drove around in town to go and see where his wife and kids were, and then drove to the swearing-in ceremony, and actually was the last to be sworn in?  Now, if this was a person who was taken hostage, why didn't he simply drive away at this opportunity?  Why didn't he simply drive away with his family towards Gitarama and flee, if he didn't decide to take part voluntarily in this government?
@A.
At the time, roads in Rwanda were as open as between here and Moshi.  There were bars everywhere; one could stop and have a drink, et cetera.  That was totally different at the time.  We were in a time of war.  
Now, I believe you'll be talking to Ndindabahizi.  It will be up to his counsel to ask that question.  I don't know what you are talking about.  I am talking about what I know.  I am a scientist, and that is an issue you should discuss with Mr. Ndindabahizi, not with me.
@MR. KAPAYA:
In mid-May, Mr. Ndindabahizi attended an ADB meeting in Nairobi.  Why didn't he simply choose to stay there if he didn't want to serve in the interim government?  He had that opportunity.  Why did he come back?
@A.
Same answer.  Where was his family, by the way, at that time?  Ask him, I don't know.  I'm not Ndindabahizi's lawyer.  I'm here as an expert to try to explain what the PSD was as compared to PARMEHUTU, as compared to Hutu Power.  I didn't study the life of Ndindabahizi.  I don't know him.  I'm not going to stand here and speak as his lawyer.  I'm not his lawyer.  I'm here to shed light on the historical context.  We drifted into realm (interpretation unintelligible), et cetera, et cetera.  But that question I cannot answer.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I'm asking you this question, Mr. Witness, because on page 19 of your report, the first paragraph, and then on paragraphs 3 and 4, you say, "This man was taken hostage".  Where do you get -- I mean, where do you get that?  What's the basis of you saying that?  And you are saying he was trying to -- that at night they were kept at the hotel, probably to avoid flight.  So if you can speculate in your report, as you have been doing, why can't you speculate now?  Why can't you speculate now as to why he didn't (sic) stay there, why didn't he run with children?
@A.
Because in the night of the 8th and 9th -- I'm not speculating at all; I am talking about facts.  This is not speculation.  In the evening of the setting up of the government, the army did take -- assign the new ministers to the hotel.  This is not speculation; this is a matter of fact.  The second question is speculation, and I'm not going to speculate.  That is not my area. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that's all the questions I have for this witness.  And I request to tender as Prosecution exhibits the bundle of documents as shown to the witness for his comments. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the first document you want to tender is the Kayishema, Ruzindana transcripts.  But there you can simply say, and I think it follows from the -- do you want to tender it, or will you be satisfied simply to have it -- it's public record and it's page 11.  But you want to tender it as a matter of convenience. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
We would like to tender it, Your Honour, to tender them as exhibits in the way that they have been arranged.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, then.  P. 47 for the Kayishema transcripts.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Can they simply be 47(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), Your Honour? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  That's 47(A) for Kayishema.
@MR. KAPAYA:
$B) for the Nahimana transcripts.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you see, (A) Kayishema, English, (B) Kayishema, French, (C) Media, English, (D) Un universitaire français défend la colonisation, (E) le négationnisme, (F) affaire Lugan, (G) biblio monde, and (H) demasque.  All right.
$Exhibit No. P. 47(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G) and (H) admitted)
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, sir.  Thank you. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I can't object to these exhibits, but I deplore their political nature.  But I heard the expert say that verdicts were handed down.  Perhaps those verdicts should be heard for fairness to the expert.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's open, if so tendered by any party.  But the Court has noted that, as you will have noted from the Bench.  
We indicated that we were particularly interested in the substance of this report, and we also said that, when we came to the last documents, that as we understand it, Mr. Expert, these are the documents which we sorted in the 14 trials, which, according to the expert, he won.  So the Court has noted this. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  It was an order to prove that assertion and to confirm it, that when the time comes, I shall like to produce those verdicts.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
$Microphone not activated)...that is, of course, perfectly all right.  So you will be free to do so, of course. 
All right.  That was 47.  Any re-examination, Defence? 
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, no additional questions. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, good afternoon. 
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I would like to refer you to this exhibit, which you already have before you.  I don't remember the number.  Is it 25?  And a book written by Gérard Prunier on the Rwanda Crisis, History of the Genocide.  Are you conversant with it?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, we talked about it earlier on with the President.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  Now, I would like to quote from both the exhibit and this book.  This book, its page 170, and what I'm quoting is produced under the sub-heading, "Negotiations Feed the Rise of Extremism".  Now, on this page the writer has this to say:  
"In the short term, the extremists' main preoccupation was how to stop the growing dynamics of peace, both in the country and at Arusha.  The MRND" -- D in brackets -- "kept protesting against the lack of consultation in signing the negotiations, while the CDR, in a more aggressive style, was demonstrating in the streets and fighting it out with MDR and PSD militants". 
Now, coming to this exhibit, which is interviews with the Accused, on page 8, the last paragraph on that page, it is stated there as an answer that the PSD was in opposition.  It was an opposition party.  "At certain moments, there were problems within our party and other parties.  Certain members were being accused of being too RPF, while others were being accused of rapprochement with the MRND, two parties recruited for the PSD and the MRND.  Previously, we had a party which was very united with MRND, which wanted to accede to power through the ballot box.  Our party was affected by the problem of division".  
Now, you have come here, to use your own words, "to explain what the PSD was", and you have said that there were no factions in this party.  I would like to have your comment on what the Accused says about this and what this writer has to say about these extremist factions in the PSD.  That is my fist question. 
@THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, Your Honour, the originality of the PSD in this context -- which is not the usual type of political context, that was before.  Here, we are dealing with splintered groups and disintegration.  The PSD is the only party that had no splinter groups.  I'm not saying that there were no quarrels.  There were no splinter groups, whereas all the other parties experienced splinter groups.  Now, the MDR, for example, when the militants fought with machetes, when Agathe was taken away, when Faustin was thrown out of the party, in the liberal parties they were at each other's throats.  Nothing like that happened in the PSD.  They didn't, probably, agree 100 per cent, but they had the wisdom -- because their political origins were different -- they had the wisdom to maintain the unity of the party.  Of course, we're not talking about a soviet-type party, with a directive from the politburo.  
What I am trying to say is that, whereas all the parties were breaking up, the PSD kept itself in unity.  This is a moot point.  We can discuss it.  Was it far-reaching, in-depth unity or artificial unity?  All I've seen is that there was no splintering PSD.  Now, let us count.  Tragically, PSD killed; they were to think, as some people have thought -- some people have said so.  The number of people dead -- wanted to show that the PSD was not seen as a party along the lines of Hutu Power.  There was no disintegration of the PSD.  We can talk about it for one or two hours, more than that, to say that this man or that man thought this way or that way.  The thing is, the party stayed united.  
Have I covered your question, Your Honour? 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.  That will suffice.  
I have another question.  You have studied the history of Rwanda, as you have told us, and you have been shown the map which was tendered by the expert Des Forges.  I think this is the map.  I don't remember the number of the exhibit.  It showed political parties of bourgmestres in 1994, whatever interpretation is to be put on that.  
Following multi-partyism in 1992 and the enactment of the coalition government accommodating more parties, would you say that the bourgmestres, the appointment of bourgmestres, reflected the support of the party in a particular place to which they were appointed? 
@THE WITNESS:
The question is very important, and I answered it yesterday -- not totally, because what you are saying goes beyond what we were saying yesterday.  As a matter of fact, the bourgmestres were appointed.  Some of them would be appointed by local assemblies, but they were very few and not very important.  And those bourgmestres were indeed going to join the political party.  Some of them would not change; that's why MRND would remain MRND.  Everybody was MRND before the multiparty system came.  Some will remain MRND; others would go to the PL, MDR or PSD.  
What one does not allow one to say is that the inhabitants of the commune were members of this or that party.  There is the leader, the one in charge of the commune, but that chooses to join this or that party, but the population is not concerned.  
Now, this map would have been useful if it were an election for the election of the bourgmestres, and the bourgmestres will stand on the basis of political lists, PSD, MRND -- PSD.  And if inhabitants voted for PSD here, PL there, one could say that the majority of the inhabitants of such-and-such a commune belonged to this party.  And this is not the case as far as this matter is concerned.  
Have I covered your question, Your Honour?
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes, thank you.  Finally, you did say that -- well, you've given us an analysis of why the Accused joined the government, the interim government.  You have analysed his actions before joining.  I don't know whether you did bother to analyse his actions after he joined.  That is one leg of the question.  
The other one is that we had a witness here who was a PSD member, who was a protected witness, and he told us that the members of the PSD had three choices, only one wasn't a choice, really, because unfortunately some of them were killed, but they had a choice to run or to join.  And he was one of those who ran away, actually.  What is your comment on that one?  
Those are my last two questions.  Thank you. 
@THE WITNESS:
In a situation of conflict -- I don't know whether you have experienced one -- there are options, of course.  And very often there is the choice of survival, which is the least of the problems that will take you away from danger.  But usually, when you take that option you are opting for more danger, for a more dangerous option.  It's just like the hunters who go to catch birds.  They use strings, and if the bird puts a foot in that trap and the trap will hold it; but the bird would not put its foot in the trap, although it came to the point.  And that was the same case as Ndindabahizi.  Ndindabahizi was there at the pond; he had to make an option.  
I don't know Ndindabahizi.  I met him here.  I didn't even know how he looked.  He was in the same situation.  I don't think he was my student in Butare.  I don't know, probably he knows.  I don't know anything about that, so I cannot give you any answer other than the one I have just given you.  It is the instinct of survival.  If you morally have a knife on your throat, your first reflex is to push it away.  If you push it away, and you fall in a hole, what you are looking at is not the hole; you are looking at the dagger of a knife on your throat.  This is not a matter of option.  You don't look back to see whether there is a hole; you have the knife on your throat.  
Is that acceptable, madam?
@JUDGE BOSSA:
But I wanted to know whether you also analysed the reasons why -- his actions after he stayed on.  You analysed the decision to stay, but did you analyse his actions after he decided to stay on, so that you can also give us an opinion on that? 
@THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I'll be very clear.  I have no scientific evidence which would enable me to give you a rigorous answer.  I have some guidelines on the period that would follow the formation of the government, but other than that, I am in a complete fog.  That question is probably better put to Mr. Ndindabahizi, because putting it to me, I am incapable of answering that question, Your Honour. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.  That's all. 
@THE WITNESS:
Merci, madam. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we thank you very much for having appeared before this Tribunal as an expert witness.  Thank you also for having come the long way to Arusha.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much, indeed.

Thank you, Mr. President.  Thanks to the Bench, and goodbye, Mr. Prosecutor, as well.

They lived in Gasharu.
@MR. BESNIER:
For how long, since when did they live in Gasharu?
@A.
Well, when I was born, they were there.  I believe it was my grandfather that settled there, initially.
@MR. BESNIER:
How many brothers and sisters did you have?
@A.
I had four sisters and two brothers.
@MR. BESNIER:
They were -- were they also living in Gasharu?
@A.
Well, there was a brother that lived in Gasharu even today.  There is also one sister that still lives in Gasharu; another sister that lives in the neighbouring cellule to Gasharu, very near called Gahigiro so that we have one brother and two sisters that live in Gasharu or in its environments.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the first name of that - - of your sister that still lives in Gasharu today?
@A.
Mariana is the first name, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
When was she born?
@A.
She was born after me, she came just after me.  She will be in 1952 approximately.  She comes directly after me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mariana, your sister, did she have any children?
@A.
Yes, sir.  She had children.
@MR. BESNIER:
How many?
@A.
She had two children, only two, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
What were their names, what are their names?
@A.
The first one was called, Ngabo, Boniface and the second is Mutirende, Jack.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was the father of Jack Mutirende, Witness?
@A.
Kajeguhakwa was the name.
@MR. BESNIER:
Of what ethnic group?
@A.
He was Tutsi, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
And Jack Mutirende, what was his ethnic group?
@A.
His father's ethnic group that is Tutsi, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you have any other living sister that lives in Gasharu or in any surrounding areas of Gasharu at this time?
@A.
I did say, that is, that there was a sister, the elder sister that lives in Gahigiro, that is a neighbouring cellule to Gasharu cellule, so that - - she lives very near the Gasharu cellule.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what is her name?
@A.
Her name is Nyiranteziryayo, Adella.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you spell Adella's name please? 
@A.
N-Y-I-R-A-N-T-E-Z-I-R-Y-A-W, sorry, A-Y-O, Y-A-Y-O, Nyiranteziryayo, Y-A-Y-0.  It's a very long name.  Adella is the first name.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Adella have any children?
@A.
Yes, indeed, she did have children.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did some of the children get married in turn?
@A.
Yes, indeed, they got married, some of her children.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did they marry Tutsis?
@A.
There is a girl that married a Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Are those children still alive today?
@A.
I did not hear you properly.  Whose children are you referring to?
@MR. BESNIER:
Please give us the names of the children, first.  There are the children of your sister Adella.
@A.
Well, the children are many.  She had more than ten children.  One was Mukamakasha, one was Mukarinika.
@MR. BESNIER:
Just a minute. What I am interested in is the names of the children that married Tutsis.
@A.
Yes, sir, I am sorry. Now the girl that married a Tutsi was called Wera. W-E-R-A.  It's a "U", 
U-W-E-R-A, Uwera.  She married a Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Uwera have any children herself?
@A.
Yes, she did have children.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the ethnic group of the children you have just referred to?
@A.
It's the same, the children - - the children's ethnic group is the ethnic group of the father.  So if the father was a Tutsi, the children were also Tutsis.  They were therefore Tutsis.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, those Tutsi children, are they still alive today?
@A.
No, sir.  They are not alive today.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were they murdered?
@A.
Yes, sir, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you know when and under which circumstances they are murdered?
@A.
Yes, I know that they were murdered between April and June 1994. That was therefore during the tragedy events that engulfed their country.  It was at that period that I learnt of the fact that they had been murdered.
@MR. BESNIER:
And, do you know by whom, who murdered them?
@A.
Well, sister, Nyiranteziryayo, Adella, talked to me about it when we met in June 1994, and she was the one that was the first who told me that Uwera's children, two of them, had been killed by one fellow whose father she knew, but you would appreciate that when we were here recently in this courtroom, one of the witnesses told us that it was he himself that murdered them.  So that the witness that stood here did corroborate that he killed them.  I heard him say so.  So my sister did mention that to me too.
@JUDGE KHAN:
All the children were murdered?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
I was told that two children were murdered.  No, no, Your Honour, I said that there were ten children from my sister, but the two were Uwera's children, that is Uwera's -- my sister's sister.   So the children of my sister's younger sister.  Now, when I was asked how many children they were, I said ten and I was then told that one wanted to know whether among the ten some of them married any Tutsis, and that is the time I talked about Uwera.  Uwera had two children who were murdered.  Uwera had two children.  So it was her grandchildren. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, along the same lines as Judge Khan, what is your relationship with the Tutsi children that we are talking about?
@A.
Now, these are the grandchildren of my sister, Nyiranteziryayo, that is the grandchildren, they are my grandchildren.  This is the type of relationship we have as far as our family is concerned. 
@MR. BESNIER:
But if we are talking about the grandchildren of your sister, we should be talking about your
grand nephews?
@A.
Grandnephews, well, I don't know in our own language we simply say grandchildren and this is -- this is, well, I translated in French.  In our language, it's grandchildren.  If they are the grandchildren of my sister, in my language, they are my grandchildren.  They are the grandchildren of my brothers they are the grandchildren of my other sisters.  This is how we say it.  I don't know how you say it in French.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, point taken.  
Now our last question is one, Mr. Ndindabahizi:  Could write on a piece of paper the name of the witness that according to you, murdered those children, please?
@A.
It was not according to me, because he stated so here.  I heard it here, and it is not according to me.  He said that he killed Nyiranteziryayo's children and he is the husband of my sister, Nyiranteziryayo.  
@MR. BESNIER:
I see the one you are referring to, Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Could we tender this as an exhibit, Mr. President?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
D. 54, under seal.
$Exhibit No. D. 54 admitted)
@MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let's finish this biographical section.  Your father, did he have brothers and sisters?
@A.
Yes, my father had a brother and two sisters.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the name of your father's eldest sister - - of your father's eldest sister?
@A.
She was called Nyirakaje.
@MR. BESNIER:
How do you spell that?
@A.
N-Y-I-R-A-K-A-J-E, Nyirakaje, N-Y-I-R-A-K-A-J-E, Nyirakaje.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was she married?
@A.
Yes, she was -- she was married.
@MR. BESNIER:
To whom?
@A.
She was married to one Gashema.  Her husband was called Gashema.
@MR. BESNIER:
How do you spell Gashema?
@A.
I spell it, G-A-S-H-E-M-A, Gashema.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was Gashema's ethnic group?
@A.
He was Tutsi, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Nyirakaje and Gashema, did they have any children?
@A.
Yes, they had children, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Cyprien Karegeya, is that one of the children?
@A.
That is correct, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the relationship, how would she appear to Karegeya?
@A.
The mother was my aunt so that Karegeya was my cousin.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, tell me, Mr. Ndindabahizi, how did you get along with your cousin especially with Karegeya?  How did you get along?
@A.
Well, we had no problems between myself and Karegeya and members of his family, that there were no problems at all.  We had no problems.  There were no problems at all between myself and Karegeya.  The members of our families, there were no problems that I knew of, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
What primary school did you go to, sir?
@A.
I attended the Kirambo primary school but I also attended Nyagasomwa at primary six.  And at primary six, I ended the primary cycle there to move on to secondary school. I was at Nyagato then that is one year after that.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now these schools at Kirambo and Nyagato, were they in the Kibuye Préfecture or in another préfecture in Rwanda?
@A.
The préfecture was Kibuye, Gitesi commune was - - that primary school was very near my area.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what secondary schools did you attend, or which secondary school?
@A.
Well, after the primary school, I -- that was in 1964, I attended the Shyogwe secondary school and then I attended the Official College of Kigali, that was another secondary I attended in Kigali. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let's recapitulate.  First of all, Shyogwe, the secondary school.  Shyogwe, would you spell it?
@A.
It's spelt, S-H-O, I am sorry. YO, S-H-Y-O-G-W-E, S-H-Y-O-G-W-E, Shyogwe.
@MR. BESNIER:
Which préfecture was -- which préfecture was Shyogwe?
@A.
Shyogee was in the Gitarama Préfecture.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you remember the years during which you attended Shyogwe secondary school?
@A.
It was from '64 to '67, that is the basical cycle, three years course '64 to '67 and then  '64 to '70, I went to the college officiel de Kigali, that is the Official College of Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
At what date were you at the Official College in Kigali?
@A.
Between '77 and '70 - - rather '67 and '70, '67 and 70, that is correct. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  If I get you correctly, from 1964 you were no longer in school in Kibuye; that is correct?
@A.
That is correct.  It was Gitarama and then Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now with which money did you attend school in Gitarama and then Gitarama?  Were your parents rich?  Did you have any financial assistance?  How did you do that?
@A.
Well, at the secondary school in Shyogwe, it was our parents that went around it, saving cattle, goats, we had some.  We had some cows and my parents sold them, that was so that we could go to school for three years, in Shyogwe with that funding from the family.  But when I got to Kigali, the family had become impoverished, and the two cows had been sold, the goats as well.  So they had to turn to the church.  I went to the Church that is Presbyterian Church of Rwanda because I am a protestant.  I knew that they had some funds for funding studies for poor or impoverished children, so that I was listed, and it was the church that paid for my fees for the three years that I spent at the college official de Kigali, that is the official school in Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now following the Kigali College, did you go on to further your studies?
@A.
After the Kigali College, I went on to the university.
@MR. BESNIER:
Which was your speciality, which special field that you studied?
@A.
I was in social and economic sciences, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
And at the end of your university studies which diploma did you obtain?
@A.
I went in university in two stages, first as baccalauréat which I ended in 1974 with a bachelor degree in economics and social sciences and then I went straight into bachelor's course or a licence course that I finished with a licence in management.  That was in 1976.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, we have a certain number of documents to tender to the Court that is the diplomas obtained by Mr. Ndindabahizi.  This is supposed to be very important because we are trying to show that Mr. Ndindabahizi did not study in the Kibuye préfecture, but rather in the school established very away.  We have the Arts Diploma, Diploma in Humanities, and then the beccalauréat and then bachelor's degree or the licence obtained by Mr. Ndindabahizi in 1976.  The Prosecution has already received these documents. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  You want these documents tendered now; don't you not?  And --
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, with your leave, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you want to start maybe with the one from 1970; don't you?
@MR. BESNIER:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Do you have it ready, Registry, Kigali, the 26th of June 1970, is it?  That's D. 55.  And there is one for 1994, isn't it?  That would be D. 56.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, let's move on.  I would like to know if during your studies, your secondary and university studies, if you regularly returned to your family in Gasharu?
@A.
I don't know what you mean by regularly because the school year is divided into three terms and at the end of each term, I would go home to spend the vocation with my family.  So during my secondary studies and even at the university studies at the end of the term, I would go home to Gasharu.  I would spend two weeks if I had two weeks' leave, because those were small vacation and we had the big vacations in July through to September.  I would spend those months at home in Gasharu.  That is how it always was.
@MR. BESNIER:
That is very clear, thank you.  When did your parents pass away, Mr. Witness?
@A.
May father died in 1980.  My mother passed away in 1984.
@MR. BESNIER:
After you received your university degree, did you begin your professional life?
@A.
I did immediately thereafter.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did you do so?  What did you do?
@A.
I didn't do anything.  In fact, I did an internship, post degree internship at Trafipro in the cooperative.  That was in 1975.  When I finished my degree, that cooperative asked me to come and work there.  That was in 1976.  The chief of personnel came to see me at the university.  He said, "You have a good internship in our cooperative.  Why don't you come and help us?"  And that is how I began in 1976.  In fact, the day after I received by degree, I didn't go home; I went straight to Trafipro to work.
@MR. BESNIER:
What were your activities, what were the activities rather at Trafipro, at that cooperative?
@A.
Trafipro is a consumer cooperative.  It had stores throughout the country, thirty or so throughout the country, and it had its base in Kigali, in Kabgayi.  That is where the general-director's office and the general services offices were, but the stores were scattered about the entire country and they sold consumer goods, clothing, food, cloth, even farming implements for the farmers.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where were assigned within the cooperative?
@A.
In the general services department, the director's office.  First, I worked in the finance department.  We called it the department before it was called the division. I worked there for three months.  After three months, I was appointed as head of that section and I think this was in 1976.  I don't remember the exact date, but I think it was around that time.
@MR. BESNIER:
In fact, I wanted to ask you in which city you were working, that was the gist of my question?
@A.
First in Gitarama in Kibuye and in Kigali. The three months before I was appointed temporary head of section was spent in Kabgayi in Gitarama.  Then when I was appointed chief or head of section, head of the finance section, I was transferred to Kigali.  That's where the management was and all the purchasing and other functions were held there in Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you work in another branch office for Trafipro?
@A.
No.  I didn't work in any branch office.  I worked in the general director's office. I was head of the finance division. I wasn't in the stores.  The stores were the managers' vendors.  I was not a vendor; I was head of the finance department in Kigali.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you mentioned that you had been or had an internship; was it so?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Yes.  Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Where was that please? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
That was in 1975 at the accounting department of Trafipro in Kabgayi.  After that - - after my degree, I went directly to that division.  And I became head of that division at the end 1976. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you ever do any auditing in any other branch offices of Trafipro in Rwanda?
@A.
I was not an auditor.  I was head of the finance section, but I was not an auditor.  There was another division; there was the sales division and made the audits in the branch offices.  So the organisation chart is very clear.  There is a parallel directive to my division and that was the sales or divisional services.  That division did audit in the stores.  They had auditors and they moved about from branch to branch to conduct their audit.  My finance division did not have those responsibilities.  We were not charged with auditing the stores.  Therefore, I didn't have that authority to go into the stores nor did my employees.  We were not auditors.  Anything that came from the stores went to the auditors of the auditing papers and there was a sales division that took care of that.  My employees and I did not have the right to audit the stores.  I don't know if that is clear to you, Counsel.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you mean to say you never remained a salesman?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you ever visit any Trafipro local department in the Kibuye area?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
No.  I did not go into the branches.  The head of sales and the auditors in the sales department had that mission.  They were in charge of auditing the stores and branches.  I did not have the responsibility for auditing stores and the branch offices.  I did not therefore go into them.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That leaves us the auditing issue:  Did you ever visit that area and in particular the Trafipro department in that geographical area? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
There was only one Trafipro store in Kibuye.  In fact, in general, there was one per préfecture, they weren't many.  So my responsibility was not to go into the stores to the branches.  So I did not visit them.  There were auditors in the sales division who did that work.  My work was at the office in the finance department.  We waited for reports given to us by those who were responsible for gathering the data, from those who were responsible for conducting the audit, that is to say, the sales division.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
What were your duties as head of finance department?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
I had to supervise the accounting.  I have the chief accountant working for me as well as his deputy.  At one point, I even had an advisor, a Swiss advisor, and I had the chief of office who bought supplies the office, he was in charge of procurement for the office.  I also had a secretary but our duties - - our main duty was to supervise the accounting operation and their accountants. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
How much time did you spend at Trafipro? 
@A.
I arrived in 1976 and I left 1981.  I believe if I remember correctly, that is the amount of time I spent there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, Mr. President, we have a document here from the Trafipro cooperative confirming that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi worked as the chief of the finance division and chief of the general services for Trafipro from November 1976 to December 1981, and we would like to tender the original version of this document as a Defence exhibit.

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you leave Trafipro, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
There is no reason really.  In fact, when I was recruited by Trafipro, it was a temporary post, if you will.  The civil service had decided if I was to remain there indefinitely, so Trafipro recruited me waiting for the civil service to confirm my appointment by a decree because the civil servant, the civil service rather, hires all civil servants in the first category, category A.  So in 1981, Trafipro wanted to keep me on board.  I had no problem with that, but the civil service, decreed a transfer and transferred me elsewhere.  So, in fact, the civil service, it was their decision to make.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where were you transferred?
@A.
I was transferred to electro gas, electro gas based in Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
What were your duties at Kigali electro gas?
@A.
It was basically the same responsibilities as at Trafipro.  Some things were different.  I was head of the administrative and financial departments at electro gas. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, when were you transferred to electro gas? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
At the end of 1981, right after I left Trafipro.

Did you ever work for a private company called Bralirwa?
@A.
Counsel, no, I didn't.  I did not work for Bralrwa.  I knew about Bralirwa, but I never worked there.  I never worked there, it would have been impossible.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, you will remember that a Prosecution witness stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi worked at Bralirwa.  We asked that company to give us a document and they gave us a certificate according to which -- which shows that Mr. Ndindabahizi never worked for that company Bralirwa, and I would like to hand it to the Registry.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to be on the safe side, Mr. Witness, is Bralirwa a private or semi-public or a public company? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Bralirwa is a private company.  It is a -- it brews beer and makes lemonade.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the owners of that company, is that - - I understand that it may well be associated under another name according to the -- 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Yes, I did not work in that company.  I don't have much information regarding its shareholders and its capital and the make-up of that.  I am sorry, Mr. President, for not having that information.

Mr. Ndindabahizi, we stopped at 1985, what did you do after you left electro gas?
@A.
The civil service transferred me again to the ministry of planning.  I was transferred there in 1985.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  What were your duties at the ministry of planning, briefly?
@A.
I didn't do much. I was head of section of the internal financing section within that ministry.
@MR. BESNIER:
For how long did you work at the ministry of planning?
@A.
I remained there up until 1991 or something like that, five years or so.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Once again, Mr. President, the Defence has found a document of appointment for Mr. Ndindabahizi as an employee of the ministry of planning.  It is a decree which was in the official gazette of the Rwandan Republic.  This is a degree - - a decree rather dated 1st of December and on the second page you see that Mr. Ndindabahizi was transferred from electro gas to the ministry of planning as the divisional head.

In which city was the ministry of planning located?
@A.
Well, it's in Kigali, Counsel, in Kigali.  
@MR. BESNIER:
In which year did you leave the ministry of planning?
@A.
In 1991, that same year, 1991.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you leave that ministry? 
A. 	I requested leave and I left.  I submitted my request and I was granted.   
@MR. BESNIER:
How long did you work at AUDICO?
@A.
I requested leave and I left for personal reasons.  I submitted my request and it was granted.
@MR. BESNIER:
After the ministry of planning, did you work, did you, after 1991?
@A.
Yes, I worked in a tink-tank in Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
A consulting group.  What was the consulting group called?  What did you do there?
@A.
I don't understand your, - - the last part of your question, Counsel.  Can you repeat it for me?  
@MR. BESNIER:
That consultancy office, what did you do there, what was it called?
@A.
It was called AUDICO or AUDICO, A-U-D-I-C-O. A-U-D-I-C-O.  My responsibilities there included audit.  We would audit the books for projects or companies, and we would make reports for ever, for those who asked us to do that consulting for them.  That is what I did there.  We are a team of about five persons and sometimes we worked together on projects and would produce reports at the end. 
Q. 	How long did you know at AUDICO
@A.
I don't really know, but I know that I left that company in 1992, that office in 1992.  I know it was in 1992.

@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. Ndindabahizi, we're already in 1992, we're moving quickly, and we're going to try to speed up even more now.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we speed up even more -- now, the first parts of your career were in the public administration, Mr. Ndindabahizi, and you were promoted and asked to move from one place to another by the civil service.  But if I understand you correctly, the Audico period was different.  Was that so?  There you resigned at your own volition from the Ministry of Planning and is that correct?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And Audico, is that a public or a private company?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Private.  Very much private.  Very much private.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This was a private consultancy, wasn't it, in auditing?  Is that the gist of it?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Absolutely, that is correct, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you leave Audico?
@A.
I left Audico because I was assigned to the Ministry of Finance.  I believe it was in September 1992.  I was assigned to the Ministry of Finance.
@MR. BESNIER:
Under what circumstances were you transferred to the Ministry of Finance?  Was it of your own free will or were you told to go?  Are there any explanations for that?
@A.
There are no such explanations.  I was transferred.  I used to go there with others to represent the PSD party; that is my party.  We used to go there, because we were suppose to be running that ministry.  And as I was a member of the PSD, it was within that framework that I found myself at the Ministry of Finance run by the PSD.
@MR. BESNIER:
If I got you correctly, you find yourself at the Ministry of Finance because you were a member of the PSD.  You are transferred to the Ministry of Finance.  Was it a political measure?
@A.
That is correct, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, who was the Minister of Finance at the time you entered the ministry?
@A.
It was Mr. Rugenera, Marc.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was his party?  What was the party of which he was a member?
@A.
I told you that that ministry was run by the PSD, so that he was a member of the PSD party, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President, we found another decree of the 15th of November 1992 published in the official gazette of Rwanda that states that Ndindabahizi has been appointed Director of Cabinet in the Ministry of Finance.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, what was your position in the Ministry of Finance?  What was it?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I was Director of Cabinet.  That is the director of the office of the minister.  I call it the Directeur de Cabinet in French.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
D. 61.
$Exhibit No. D. 61 admitted)
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And if Defence counsel would give us some more information concerning the exact function of the Directeur de Cabinet, then that would be helpful.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I was going to come to that, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, can you give us some details about the work you did as Directeur of Cabinet?
@A.
Yes, sir.  The Director of Cabinet is responsible for coordinating the activities of the ministry.  He is the one that coordinates the activities of the advisors, because in the ministry we had advisors and the Directeur de Cabinet also dealt with the coordination of activities of those advisors.  
Now, there's also the director general of the ministry that supervises some five directorates and the Directeur de Cabinet and the director-general together supervised all these services.  The Director of Cabinet replaces the minister when the latter is absent.  The Director of Cabinet carries out any other assignments given to him by the minister.  So that that is, in a nutshell, the attribution of the Director of Cabinet.  I hope I have given you all the details, but this is the general picture.  
With the Director of Cabinet, he coordinates all the activities of the ministry and when the minister is absent he is in charge of the management of the day-to-day operations of the ministry.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Generally you were the immediate boss in the ministry?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
No, I am above -- I came after the minister, directly, and the director-general was under me.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You were director and the director-general was under you.  Is that what you mean to say?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The director-general was under me, and the director was under the director-general.  This is the organisational chart of the ministry; Director of the Cabinet, who replaces the minister, who acts for the minister, so that he, was naturally above the director-general in the ministry.  This is the French system, the Director of Cabinet, then the director-general, then the director-generals.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The Directeur de Cabinet is mainly a political function, is it?  Could we put it that way?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes.  It is just a political appointment.  When the minister leaves, he leaves with all the members of his office, his cabinet.  You have the Director of Cabinet and two advisors and the minister.  They all represented the party.  And if the ministry was to be run by another party all those people have to leave.  The rest of the staff wouldn't leave, except those that came with the minister.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this is helpful.  Could you now please repeat what we could call the political staff on the top level in the ministry?  You just mentioned it, but please take it once more, because, you know, the system of each country differs here, and it's important that we get your system right.  
So it's the minister; then you mentioned the minister de cabinet (sic); and then you mentioned two advisors.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Then two advisors, one for political and administrative affairs and another for technical affairs.  So that we were four.  And it was the same pattern in all ministries, in all other ministries, even those ministries run by other parties.  The system was the same, as far as political appointees were concerned.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Whereas the director-general, he is not politically appointed, and he continues within the civil service.  Is that correct?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct.  He does not leave.  He's a civil servant.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you attend the council of ministers meetings as Directeur de Cabineti?
@A.
No, that is not possible.  The Director of Cabinet does not appear in the meetings of the ministers or the ministry of council.  He replaces the minister when the latter is absent, but he does not attend the council of ministers meetings.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  After what time did you stay Director of Cabinet?
@A.
I was Director of Cabinet until the 6th of April 1994, 6th of April 1994.  That is correct.  That is in April 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
You talked about the PSD.  How and when did you join the party, PSD?
@A.
How?  Well, the party was recruiting members ever since its inception in 1991, I believe.  
And how I joined the PSD, I was recruited by the PSD.  That is it, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you have to join the PSD in particular?
@A.
Well, that is another matter.  There were several parties that had just been created and, of course, one had the option to join one or the other.  I opted to join one party, and I chose the PSD.  I joined the PSD because I was not interested in the other parties.  The party in which I was interested was PSD.  I read its constitution, its mission statement, its ideology, and I thought that that was the party that suited me.  I knew the other parties, MRND, MDR, etc.  I chose the PSD after having perused their basic documents, their objectives and, of course, an account of what I knew about the other parties that were there or that had been there since the 60's up to '67.  I did make a choice.  The MRND was not of interest to me.  The MDR neither.  But after having given thought and, indeed, talked with people, including the chairman of the party, I made an option.
@JUDGE KHAN:
So you joined the PSD of your own accord, of your own initiative?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, nobody forced me.
@JUDGE KHAN:
What do you mean by recruited, recruited in this party?  You said you were recruited in this party.  What does this mean?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I mean that following the creation of those parties, all the parties tried their worst to enrol members.  They went to the various préfectures, the various regions or areas to get members.  The various parties, for the MRND, the MDR, they all went around looking for members.  This was how I joined.  When I talked about recruitment or enrolment, it was because there was a campaign on the part of the parties in Rwanda.  As far as these parties were created, they tried to synthesise people.  Various parties tried to show people what they wanted to do, what the ideologies were and what orientations they wanted to adopt, and people accepted.  They were not forced to join any party, but there was this campaign to synthesise people, to win them over as members.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, who founded the PSD, Witness?
@A.
The PSD was founded by several persons, sir.  You have the mention in its manifesto, some people came together, met, and they had the constituent congress to create that party.  Some of them were very well known:  Zamarambo, for example; Ngango.  Zamarambo was president, and the other was the first vice-president: Gafaranga was the second vice-president or second vice-chairman; Gatabazi, Minister Gatabazi, was inspector-general of the party.  And they became members of the national committee of the party.  But founding members of that party were not only those four; there were others that sat at the congress.  I cannot remember all the names, because I was not even there at the time the party was created.  But in the statutes of the party, I can read the names of the founding members of the party.
@MR. BESNIER:
Sir, you talked about the national committee.  Could you explain, in a word or two, how the PSD was organised, in terms of its internal structure?
@A.
Now, we had the -- what we called the politburo or the political bureau composed of those four people I just mentioned:  the chairman; the vice-chairman; the second vice-chairman; and the secretary general.  That -- those were the spokespersons of the party.  But there was also a political bureau or politburo composed of those people, and we had a structure organisation covering the préfecture to the communes and even the secteurs and the cellules.  Of course, at the top you had what we called the national congress.  This was the organisational format, if you will, of the PSD party.
@MR. BESNIER:
And you yourself, what duties did you have within the party?  What responsibilities were you given in the party?
@A.
Now, within the party I was appointed as executive secretary at the level of the préfecture of Kibuye.  At a given time, therefore, I was also in charge of the party in my own native area that is Kibuye, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you appointed or were you elected?
@A.
No, appointed I was not.  I was elected, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
At what date were you elected?
@A.
I should apologise most sincerely; as far as days are concerned, I do not know -- I can't remember the exact date, but I know, of course, it was 1993.  I do know and recollect that there were elections in the Gishyita commune in May 1993, and I was responsible for overseeing the elections on behalf of the PSD in May 1993.  So that I was in charge of the -- representative of the party in that particular area.  I cannot remember the date at which I was elected, but I know that it was in 1993.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, how has it been that you had political responsibilities in Kibuye, whereas you had not been living in that préfecture for a long long time?
@A.
No, no, that is no problem, sir.  That is not a problem.  The same applied everywhere, even for other people.  One cannot be a politician other than in your own native préfecture.  It was not possible for that to happen.  You can't be a politician outside your own native préfecture.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what was the position of the PSD in the regional political life of Kibuye, in general?
@A.
Sir, I do not understand that question clearly.  Could you kindly rephrase it, make it more clear.  I do not see the point you are driving at.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was the PSD a large party?  Did you have a greater number of members, as compared to the other parties?  Was it one of the larger parties or was it one of the smaller parties?  How did it compare with the other parties?
@A.
Sir, there were no elections in Kibuye.  There were no elections in other préfectures, either, to quantify the weight of any given party in any given region.  That was an impossibility, to determine the weight of a party.  That was not possible without elections.  But I do know that almost all the political parties, the major parties, MRND, MDR, PSD, PDC, were all represented in the Kibuye préfecture, but one cannot say for sure which party had more members.  But the PSD was there, and the PSD was there as one of the parties that had taken roots in the Kibuye préfecture, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, let us come back to some questions concerning PSD's ideology.  What was the ideology of the PSD in terms of ethnic or interethnic relations, interethnic relations PSD?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move to the ideology, just to be certain about the structures, now the political bureau or politburo was at the central level, was it, at the national level?  There was one political bureau at the national level composed of four members?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that body was in Kigali?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
In Kigali, Mr. President, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the functions were the chair, the vice-chair, the secretary-general, and the fourth you said was?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, chairman, first vice-chairman, second vice-chairman, and secretary-general.  Yes, Mr. President, that is correct.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
First and second vice-chairman.  All right.  Now, the other central organ, is that the national congress?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Now, we have the political bureau and its committee that is the political bureau's committee; that was at national level.  But we had reached a level -- we had the regional executive secretariat that worked at the level of the region.  Each region had one.  But at national level, we had these four people that were in charge.  They were the spokespersons of the party at national level.  They were the only four.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But listening to the English translation of what you said, I jotted down the national congress, a brief reference to the national congress.  Did you refer to that body?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  I talked about the national congress.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that a PSD body?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It is the supreme body of a party.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly, so that is the supreme body of the party at the central level.  It covers the whole country, doesn't it?  That's the situation.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this imply, then, that there were two central bodies, on the one hand, the politico, and on the other hand the national congress?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The politico bureau and the national congress.  Well, the national congress is above the political bureau.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The national congress is composed of?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Well, the national congress was composed of the representatives of all the regions, all the regions representatives plus the members of the political bureau.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you, being the executive secretary at the Kibuye level, were you then a member in that capacity of the national congress?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That's how I was a member of the national congress, in that capacity, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But you had no other functions, or had you, at the central level?  You only had functions at the local level.  Is that the testimony?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was only at the local level, at the level of Kibuye.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you opted for the PSD in '91 or later.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Mr. President, I said that I joined in 1992.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You may have said that, but that was not what I heard and that was a clarification I wanted.  So the party was established in '91, and you joined in '92, is that so?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  So as far as the ideology of the parties is concerned, I know you already mentioned it, but could you be more detailed as to the position where interethnic relations were concerned?
@A.
Yes.  The PSD enrolled members from all ethnic groups in Rwanda, Hutus and Tutsi.  You could find Hutu and Tutsi within the PSD, and we know that even in the objective of the party, it was stipulated that ethnic groups were not to be mentioned in identity documents.  So that the PSD did not have any problems of discriminating between various ethnic groups.  There was no distinction of ethnic groups within the PSD.  This was the reason why they proposed that ethnicity should not be mentioned in identity documents.  I hope I have covered the question properly.  Be that as it may, I can say there was no Hutu-Tusti problem in our party.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, as far as collaborative activities with the RPF, and from the point of view of the possible role of the RPF in the broad-based government on the basis of the Arusha Accords, what was the position of the PSD?
@A.
The position of the PSD on the basis of the broad-based government, as per the Arusha Accords, was to share power with one and all parties.  As far as the Arusha Accords were concerned, the PSD accepted that all parties sit around the same table and take part in the same government, including the RPF, for the running of the country during the transitional period, whilst we wait for the elections to be organised for power to be invested in the elected, those that can run the country, by the electorate.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you take part in PSD meetings in Kibuye?
@A.
Yes.  In '93 I attended certain rallies, and in certain rallies -- I do remember one place in Gishyita in Manunga, in Gishyita commune, and in Rwamatamo, they also held a rally.  And I was in Ndadabo (phonetic) and we were responsible for preparing those rallies and organising them.  I was also at Girambo in Bwakiro commune.  There, too, we held a rally.  And I believe those were the only meetings that I took part in in 1993, as far as I can recollect.  But since there were other rallies, I can only remember those three at this particular time.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you hold a rally in Gasharu, at the Gishaka centre?
@A.
In Gasharu, that is my area.  It was in my house, a meeting.  There is my house, but I did organise a meeting there.  But once I came to the area, the Gishaka centre, people knew that I was from the PSD, and at that time I had some hats, some caps, in the vehicle, and I gave them out to those who wanted them.  Those were PSD caps or hats, because I also wanted to show that I had followers in that particular area.  But I was not there to organise a rally.  I could not organise a rally all by myself.  I just went there to see what the situation was.  It's not possible to organise a rally by one person.  And political parties did the same thing everywhere they went and engage in such activity.
@MR. BESNIER:
But why did you refuse to give caps or hats to the Tutsi?
@A.
Well, what I said -- I said that the PSD party made no discriminations at all.  We even proposed the deletion of ethnic ethnicity on ID cards.  How can I refuse to give caps or hats to the Tutsi?  This is not possible.  I never did so, sir.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Do you have any member of ethnic groups -- of the Tutsi group in your party, PSD party?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
There were.  There were many Tutsis within the PSD party.  Even in the politburo, there were Tutsis.  There were many of them.  I knew them.  Even in the préfectures on the regional level, there were Tutsi representatives.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Could you please name them?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, I can give you a few names.  There was Umbanguta, Jean-Marie Vianney, who was an advisor in the technical services department at the Ministry of Finance.  
There was Thomas Kabeja, Kabeja, who was Director of Cabinet of the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock.  
Frederick Zimeranbaho.  
There was Rugema, Donatien.  You saw him here.  
François Ndumwe, who is now a parliamentarian.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we go one by one, including the spelling, so that we can avoid going back again afterwards?  
So you mentioned first Jean-Marie Vianney Umbanguta, who was an advisor.  Where was he an advisor, you said?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Umbanguta was an advisor in the technical services division at the Ministry of Finance. 
There was Thomas Kabeja.  Thomas Kabeja, who was Directeur de Cabinet at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. 
I also spoke of Donatien Rugema.  I think he is known here in this Chamber.  He's a Tutsi from Kibuye, my same area. 
I also spoke of Ndumwe, François.  Ndumwe, François.  And I believe that currently he is a member of parliament in the Rwandan parliament. 
And I also spoke of François Ndungutse.  François Ndungutse.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have the spelling of that one, please, Ndungutse?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Ndumwe not Ndungutse.  I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  Ndumwe, N-D-U-M-W-E.  Ndumwe, François. I believe that he's currently a member of parliament. 
Innocence Sabasajya.  Sabasajya, Jean, excuse me.  Sabasajya, Jean also worked at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Sabasajya, that is?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
S-A-B-A-S-A-J-Y-A, Sabasajya.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And how many members of the politburo were Tutsi?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
What?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
How many members of the politburo were Tutsi, of the four?  You briefly referred to the politburo, I think.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Mr. President, Umbanguta was a member of the politburo.  Kabeja, was as well.  Ndumwe also was.  Sabasajya was also.  They were all in the politburo.  That's how I knew them.  They were in the politburo.  The others were in the préfectures, but these I knew personally.  We worked in Kigali in the same place.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And these four were in the politburo for how long?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Ever since the politburo was created.  The party was created in 1991, in July.  When I arrived at the party in '92 they were already there.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Were there any Tutsis in the national congress?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, because, as a member of the politburo, you're also a member of the national congress.  So those four that I've just mentioned sat at the national congress.  Even the Tutsis who were members at the regional level sat at the national congress, as well.  
Rugema, whom you saw before you, was a member of the national congress, in fact.  He sat at the national congress, Rugema, Donatien.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You now mentioned four names belonging to the politburo, and they were Tutsi, these four.  That's what we just heard.  Isn't that so?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
But they weren't the only ones in the politburo.  There were others.  These are the only ones I remember.  There were others.  If I had my documents with me, I could enlarge the list and give you more names, but they weren't the only ones.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, how many members, in total, were there in the politburo?  Leaving aside the Hutu and the Tutsi question, but how many members were there in that bureau?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Not less than 24, between 24 and 30, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And if you were to give an estimate as to how many of those that were Tutsi?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I would say ten maximum.  Surely not more than ten.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I'm seeking a clarification on the structure of the party.  I am really confused about the politburo.  And it's fair to say that, according to the constitution of the party, there was a politburo which was constituted by the chair, two vice chairpersons and the secretary.  Then there was the governing structure at the préfecture level with a regional executive.  Then the national congress.  
What I don't understand is how it shall be -- or how some of them fed into the politburo.  That's on the one hand.

@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The politburo is composed of people that were elected by the national congress.  In 1993, in December, in fact, we elected the committee, the four who led the party at the end of '93.  So the congress chooses those who will lead the political bureau.  The national committee is in charge, therefore, of the party on the country level. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You remember, I asked you for how long were these four persons in the politburo members, and you said from '91.  But until when? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Mr. President, unfortunately I did not completely understand your question.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Khan asked you to mention Tutsi in the party, and you kindly gave us quite a few names.  And then I asked you to mention members of the politburo, and you mentioned four names: Rugema, Kabeja, Ndumwe and Sabasajya.  Now, these four persons that were members of the politburo, for how long were they members of the politburo?  Not only a question from when they started in '91, but for how long?  Until when? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
In 1994, in April, when the tragic events took place and began, those people were still at that time in the politburo.  They were still members of the politburo at that time.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So all these four persons were members until the 6th of April, of the politburo? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, up until the 6th of April they were still there, in the politburo.

@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, on an electoral level, were there elections that the PSD had to participate in, or participated in, since it was created in 1991?  We're not talking about appointments, now, we're talking about elections.  Were there ever elections in which the PSD participated, and, if so, were they supposed to participate in elections after 1991?
@A.
There were no elections in '92 or '93 in Rwanda.  Everybody was awaiting elections that were supposed to take place.  And this was supposed to take place after the transitional period, and this was stipulated in the Arusha Accords.  That is what I know. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Starting in April 1994, wasn't there a question of renewing the mandate of deputies in the National Assembly?
@A.
Yes, there was that issue.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was the PSD supposed to present candidates for the National Assembly elections in 1994?
@A.
Counsel, are we on the same wavelength?  I said there were no elections in 1994.  Do we understand each other?  I think there might be a misunderstanding here.
@MR. BESNIER:
You told me that the deputies of the National Assembly had to renew their mandate in 1994.  How could their mandate be renewed?  By which means? 
@A.
I don't know.  I think that you are speaking about renewing the mandates of the deputies who were at the CND, the National Council for Development, or parliament, which existed since 1991.  Is that what you are speaking about? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes. 
@A.
Their mandates had ended in July 1994.  Is that what you mean, Counsel?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes. 
@A.
If that is what you mean, then I would say the following.  The political parties that made up the government had decided in July 1994 to renew that parliament because the members' mandates had run out, and in fact, indeed, each party had to designate its own representatives.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  We'll get back to this issue a bit later.  But earlier, you talked about three meetings that you remembered in Kibuye préfecture.  Did you say that?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Starting in 19 -- in the 1990s, I would like to know how often you went to Kibuye préfecture.  We've already talked about three different meetings of '92-'93, but did you ever, outside of those meetings, go to Kibuye, either to see your family or for personal reasons?
@A.
Well, I have a sister in Gasharu, in Kibuye, therefore.  I told you that my parents passed away in the 1980s, and that sister lives in my parent's house -- has lived there since my parents died.  In fact, she moved in to stay with them, and when they passed away -- I believe that on some rare occasions I went to Kibuye, especially to Gasharu, to see my sister.  But you asked me how often, starting in 1990.  In fact, I don't remember how many times.  I do know that I didn't go very often, perhaps once a year, perhaps twice, but it was a rare occasion.  In fact, I had responsibilities to attend to -- wasn't frequent.  I had no activities in Kibuye, and so if I went there, it was infrequently, every now and then, perhaps, to see my sister.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, let's explore this issue more deeply.  When were you married?
@A.
I got married in 1987. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was your wife also from Gasharu?
@A.
No, not at all.  She's not from Gasharu. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Where is she from?
@A.
She's from Gitarama, Kabgayi (phonetic).
@MR. BESNIER:
What is the ethnic group of your wife's parents?
@A.
As we said, just like my sister's children, her father is Tutsi, her mother is Hutu, so she's Tutsi.  She would be considered a Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
If your wife is Tutsi, wouldn't she have an identity card with "Tutsi" mentioned on it?
@A.
Yes, she has a card that says "Hutu", because her father had an identity card with "Hutu" on it.  My wife continued to carry that same mention on her card, but in fact her father is Tutsi.  In fact, he was killed in 1994.  He's Tutsi -- he was Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, I don't really understand.  Your father-in-law, your wife's father, was he Tutsi or Hutu?
@A.
He was Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he have an identity card with the mention of his identity of Hutu or Tutsi?
@A.
I didn't read his card, but when I saw the identity papers of my wife, it said "Hutu".  She explained to me how that came about.  And it came from the identification of her father, but she was a Tutsi.  I think this happened frequently in the 1960s in Gitarama.  People would change, perhaps because of the prevailing events or other circumstances.  Even brothers who remained in Rwanda -- his brothers who remained in Rwanda, they were Tutsis.
@MR. BESNIER:
How many children did your wife and you have?
@A.
We had five.  I have five children.
@MR. BESNIER:
After you were married, where did you live, in which city?
@A.
Since I got married, up until 1994, we lived in Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you have any property in Gasharu?
@A.
Well, I told you that the house where my sister lives is the house that I built for my parents, so it's my house, in a way.  The fields around that house are my fields, so, if you will, that property, even though my sister lives there, it belongs to me.  But since my sister came back to the house, I thought I had to help her with her child.  She was separated from her husband and came with her child, and I said, "Well, listen, stay here in my house on my land". 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  We've often heard about Gasharu here during this trial.  Can you briefly describe Gasharu for us?  Is it a city like Arusha?  Is it smaller?  Is it bigger than Arusha?  How is Gasharu like?
@A.
Well, in the 1960s, when I was still a boy, there were very few people living in Gasharu.  Currently, there are people who came from other hills to settle there.  But in the 1960s, there was my father, my aunt, my cousins.  JX, JE, those witnesses, they lived there.  They came before this Tribunal.  CGH, his brother, he had a wife, and CGH's mother lived in Gasharu with us.  He had two wives in fact, and the other one, her mother -- CGF's mother -- lived just next to Gasharu.  Those were the people who were there.  
At that time, my father was the only Hutu on that hilltop.  All the other people were Tutsis.  Thereafter, people like Karara came to settle there in Gasharu.  My cousins got married; they had children.  And so the hilltop -- the hill got bigger; the families got bigger.  Hutus from other hills came to settle there amongst the Tutsis.  But I don't think there were many Hutus who came.  If you will, in 1994, Gasharu had more Tutsis than it did Hutus, even if you do count those Hutus who came to settle from other hills.  So that that is the makeup of Gasharu hill, if you will.  
There's nothing out of the ordinary.  There's a small market near Gatara.  I had a couple of shops there.  People go to drink beer at that market or they go to sell their livestock.  There was a small road there.  It comes from the main road to Kibuye.  It's six or ten kilometres to get there from Kibuye.  There's nothing extraordinary about the place.  But what makes it known is that it was known as a Tutsi hill since 1963, when there were problems.  The neighbouring hills are inhabited by Hutus, and those Hutus, during the '59 revolution, tried to attack that hill.  But the hilltop protected itself very well and it didn't have very many problems.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were there marriages between Hutus and Tutsis on that hill?
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I'd like a clarification before you proceed, Counsel.  
I'm interested in the witnesses who lived -- the witnesses who came here that you mentioned.  What were their pseudonyms, who lived with your parents on that hill in the '60s?  I remember CGH, but I don't remember the others.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I mentioned several witnesses through their pseudonyms, the pseudonyms they had here, because I know that they were protected witnesses.  This is why I used their pseudonyms.  I talked about CJ --
@JUDGE BOSSA:
$Microphone not activated).
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I shall give them to you now, Your Honour.  CGX; I talked about the son CGE; I talked about CGH; and I talked about CGF, who is the brother-in-law of CGH.  But CGF came to Gasharu a long time afterwards.  I don't know him.  I don't know him.  But he came to settle down in Gasharu quite recently, and I was told that he was the brother-in-law of CGH.  The wife is the sister of CGH.  The wife of CGF is the sister of CGH.  And they are all in Gasharu.  But CGF only came recently, while CGX, for example, was there ever since the '60s.  His son was born there in the '70s, so that they lived there.  It is their area.  They were one of the first natives of that hill.  
So that I am just trying to show you that on that hill there were very few people, and the people who were there were mainly Tutsi, and then gradually Hutu came to ask for land from the Tutsi.  I hope I've satisfactorily covered your question, Your Honour. 
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes, thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you coming back, maybe at a later stage, to the Prosecution witnesses, Defence Counsel? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi, tell me, up to 1994 were there intermarriages between Hutu and Tutsi in Gasharu?
@A.
Yes, sir, there was intermarriage between Hutu and Tutsi.  I said that my sister, to begin with her, had a Tutsi husband.  And I know one Gatwa, whose name should be mentioned in one of the cases here, he had a Tutsi wife.  There is a witness who said so.  There was also Ngirabanzi (phonetic) -- one Ngirabanzi, who was married to Tutsi women.  Gatwa had about seven children with that Tutsi woman, and Ngirabanzi also had children -- had many children with a Tutsi wife.  And my aunt, Nyirakaza (phonetic), was married to a Tutsi since the '20s, because when I was born, my aunt had children already been married, in 1910 or 1915, to a Tutsi.  So that marriage between Tutsi and Hutu in that area in Gasharu, and even in certain other neighbouring areas, was not a problem in 1994.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Now, let us move on to another subject matter.  Where were you on the 6th of April 1994?
@A.
On the 6th of April 1994, I was at home, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did you hear about -- learn about the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
I learned about it through a telephone call, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Through a telephone call?  Somebody called you on a telephone?
@A.
Yes, somebody called me over the telephone.  At 8:30 in the evening somebody called me.  But I was with that somebody that same evening.  That was that person who called me.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what did that person say to you?
@A.
He called me over the telephone.  We had just left each other, because we were together in a bar, and he was a cellule leader, and I used to go to his place (interpretation unintelligible) because I lived nearby.  And that evening we had just left each other about 8:00, 8:30.  And when I got home, I heard the telephone ring.  It was his telephone call, and he asked me whether I had arrived at home.  That's what he said, "Are you at home?"  I said, "Yes".  And I said, "Why are you calling me?"  Because that was not usual.  He said, "Look, I have just heard an explosion and I wanted to know whether you managed to get home".  Because at that time there were grenade explosions in the city of Kigali.  That was very frequent.  We would hear that people were shot down at the entrance of their houses, and he thought that that explosion happened very near his house.  And he said he just heard an explosion.  He wanted to make sure.  I told him that I had also heard the explosion, but that the explosion did not take place around my house, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what was your reaction when you learned about the death of President Habyarimana?
@A.
Well, sir, when he told me that he had just heard an explosion, I believe that immediately he didn't tell me that the president had died, no; he just wanted to know whether I'd arrived home.  Several minutes afterwards, he called again and said, "Look, that explosion was the president.  His plane has been shot down at Kanombe; so the explosion you just heard was the explosion of the plane of the president that had just been shot down at the time it was landing".  It was at that time that I learned about the death of the president -- at around 8:30 in the evening.  
Now, my reaction, you say?  It was no joke, because with the tension all around at that time in the country, especially in Kigali, to hear that the president has just died, it was no joke.  It was serious.  I got scared.  I didn't sleep throughout the night until the morning, myself, my children, my wife, because we were wondering what was going to happen next, because we knew that that event had just occurred at a time when the city was in itself explosive.  In Kigali, we were expecting -- we were expecting such things, ominous, bad things.  We could not sleep.
@MR. BESNIER:
And came the morning, what did you do?
@A.
Well, in the morning, there was a communiqué urging people to remain at home, but at around 8:00 or 9:00 -- I can't remember; this was about ten years ago.  And it was the watchman that told us that there were soldiers that were going around houses, killing people.  So I went out of the house and I left.  I left; I went hiding at a neighbour's house not too far away.  I went to a neighbour's house.  My wife also went out of the house to hide in another neighbour's -- the nearest neighbour, because houses were adjacent.  That is where my wife went with two children.  And three other children spent the night elsewhere.  I went away, 500, 600 metres away, at a neighbour's house to hide.  That was my first reaction because I thought that, with the news I had just heard, those people might very well come to my house.  And I knew what would happen.  With the problems I had experienced, I knew that I was in danger.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Where did you hide in your neighbour's house?  Mr. Ndindabahizi, you said that you hid in your neighbour's house.  What was the ethnic group of your neighbour -- ethnic identity?  He was a Hutu or he was a Tutsi?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I know that he was a Hutu.  He was Hutu.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Why did you hide in his house?  You were a Hutu, too.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, I was Hutu, Your Honour, but I went to hide because I knew that I was holding a position in society of a burdensome responsibility, and I said to myself that people could come to my house, they could kill me, because people told me that they were going around the first houses in the area.  They were going into houses and they were killing everybody.  And I was frightened because of my position, because of the position I had within the party and within the ministry.  That was why I had to go.  
I knew that perhaps with that small neighbour of mine, because he was not very well known -- it was a house that -- perhaps the interpreters can help me -- was surrounded by some type of bush.  I said to myself that probably those killers would not come to that particular house.  But it was just for that time.  It was not once and for all that I was going to hide in there.  It was just for the time being.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And what was the position of the neighbour, the Hutu neighbour?  What was his place in society? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I am saying that he was not of any significant stature, socially.  I didn't know where he worked, but he was not famous.  He was not well known.  I know -- I knew that he was from one of the Kibuye cellules.  So I knew him, but he was not an important man.  His house was not big.  It was a small house, and I knew that the killers would say to themselves, "Well, in that house there must be somebody important".  So I had to make that choice.  I had to choose that house, whose fence was some sort of bush, some sort of plants. 
@MR. PRESIDENT.
So what was his name and position in society, then? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What was your question, Mr. President?  Probably there was a translation we missed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The question I am asking is this neighbour, what was his position in society?  You have told us that he had not a conspicuous placement, a small house.  But who was he?  What was his name?  What was his position?  Why go to him?  That's what I am circling at. 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Well, Mr. President, he's called Gahizi, Amon (phonetic).  That's his name, Gahizi, Amon.  Now, I went to his place because he lived in a modest house with a fence of shrubs and I thought that the killers would never think that a little house was inhabited by anybody of importance.  And I thought that since it would be viewed like that, I went there.  
But my wife went to another house, another house next to mine, because we had the same wall between our houses.  That house belonged to a warrant officer of the Rwandan army.  He was from the Bigogwe (phonetic) military camp, and his house was occupied by his wife, children and house help, and my wife went there.  And she was thinking that perhaps that house belonged to a soldier, and since it belonged to a soldier, nobody would think about getting into that house. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what was the profession or occupation of Gahizi, Amon?
@A.
Amon Gahizi used to work somewhere.  I don't know exactly where, but I know that he was a civil servant.  His wife used to work with the People's Bank, but Gahizi himself, I can't remember the ministry or company in which he worked.  I can't remember that.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Could you, Mr. Ndindabahizi, tell us the nature of the threat which hung over you?  You were Hutu, one; two, you worked in a ministry as an important personality, you could be protected.  Now, what were you scared of?  Why would they attack you? 
@A.
Well, I think that it was self-evident the reason why I was scared.  I said that I was director of the cabinet of the ministry of finance, and people told me that people were being killed all around my house.  You think I should stay in my house?  No, I didn't do so.  I said to myself, "I could be killed, especially as I belong to a political party that was always said to have been pro-RPF".  It was said that PSD was pro-RPF.  Do you want me to stay at the house to be killed?  No, sir.  I was scared about what could have happened, because I heard gunshots in the area.  I heard gunshots.  I wasn't told, "Look, people have been killed and I should run away".  No, I heard the gunshots, and I ran away.  And on my flight, I saw soldiers.  I saw soldiers go into houses, breaking down doors, killing people.  I was scared.  I was right to be frightened and to run away. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, did you see people being killed near your house? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Well, Your Honour, I have told you that those people went into houses and killed, and when they killed they came out.  Now, to tell you I saw a body, a dead body, or somebody wounded, all I saw may not be true, but I saw them going in, coming out, and people they killed were left in the houses.  Doors were broken, windows were broken, but people were left in the houses.  That was the situation.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Now, how did you succeed to go to your neighbour's house? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, it was at around 8:00, 9:00, and the killers had not yet arrived on the road that led me to my neighbour.  So that there were several roads in the area, and they went straight from street to street.  And I went along the valley -- along the valley.  I used that particular road that went along the valley.  It was not very far away.  It was only about 500, 600 metres away.  Not very far at all. 
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Were there any RPF soldiers in Kigali at the time?
@A.
Yes, there were RPF forces in Kigali.  There was a 600-man battalion that was barracked at the CND, National Development Council.  They were there, those people of the RPF.
@MR. BESNIER:
And the CND, was it far from your house?
@A.
No, it was in the same vicinity, almost in the same cellule.  There was only a road between us, but it was very near.  So that in our own vicinity, we had the RPF soldiers, but there was also the military camp of the Presidential Guard.  There were two military camps on that particular hill in which I lived. 
@MR. BESNIER:
How long did you stay at your neighbour's?
@A.
You mean, at Amon Gahizi's?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.
@A.
Yes, sir, I stayed there till about 1400H.  That is 2:00 p.m.  Yes, till about 2:00 p.m.
@MR. BESNIER:
Two p.m., 7th of April 1994; is that correct?
@A.
That is correct.  We're talking about the 7th of April.  I left my home in the morning and it was still the 7th of April.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, why did you leave that hiding place?
@A.
Well, in the morning, there were soldiers that came out, that were killing, but in the afternoon, there were other soldiers that came out, and those were the RPF soldiers.  They came out of their CND barracks, and they were on the Rugando cellule, Rugando hill in which I live, and Rumera secteur.  The RPF attacked those two hills.  They also attacked the Presidential Guard camp.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what was the threat over you, under those circumstances?
@A.
Well, you see, there were soldiers in the morning.  In the afternoon, the RPF came to that hill, so that there was a confrontation brewing.  The RPF, just as the other soldiers went into houses and killed, they killed just like other soldiers.  So that seeing that the area, the vicinity, was becoming more and more dangerous, and I had to run away.  I had to decide.  
I decided therefore to leave.  I decided to call my wife on the telephone and tell her that I was leaving, and I told her where I was going.  I informed her, because people that were living around the RPF barracks and the CND area were running.  They were coming towards us.  We were near the valley, and I told my wife, "Look here at Amon Gahizi's".  And there was a telephone at that soldier's house.  I told her, "Look, I am leaving.  You also should try to run away because the RPF is outside too -- is out there too".  So I left.  I immediately left in of the midst, haze, of bullets from all over the place.  We didn't know where bullets came from.  
I was asked whether I should stay within the house.  I said no.  I was scared; I had to leave, because Gahizi's wife was telling me they were killing important personalities.  "If they come here, they will kill you".  Sometimes they would tell me to hide in the latrine outside the house.  I had to go.  I left.  I left, and I went to another hill.

And you were not scared of the enemies outside the house?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I was scared, but what do you want me to do?  I had to leave that hill.  I had to leave that hill even in spite of the shooting.  I couldn't stay at Ugando (phonetic).  I couldn't stay at Gahizi's (phonetic).  It was dangerous for me.  The RPF had come down.  The presidential guard who was also in the vicinity -- confrontation had started.  The hill was in (interpretation unintelligible)... fired.  Even if I was to be met with a bullet, that would have been it.  I had to leave and I had to get there.  I wanted to get there.  It was the way it was during the war.  It was during the war, that was what it was -- that is what -- Sometimes one is lucky not to have been shot, but as long as one is alive, one strives to be alive, to remain alive in war.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Who were killing important personalities?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The first soldiers that came out from their barracks were the soldiers of the presidential guard.  They were the ones that were killing in the vicinity.  That was it.

@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you go after having left your neighbours?
@A.
I went to Rafiki's -- Hyacinth Rafiki's house and (unintelligible) ... Rafiki, that's where I went.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was this Rafiki?
@A.
Rafiki was a director of cabinet of the ministry of public works and energy.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did he live?
@A.
He lived near around Kicukiro, opposite the Rugando (phonetic) Hill.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the distance of -- from Gahizi's (phonetic) to that particular location?
@A.
It's difficult to say.  Perhaps one kilometre, one-and-a-half kilometres, something like that.  I was on foot, and it took me a long time to get there.  I cannot measure the time I used to tell you the distance, but I could say one kilometre, one-and-a-half kilometres, something like that.  It was not too far away.  One kilometre, perhaps.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you take refuge precisely at Rafiki's?
@A.
Well, I left Rugando (phonetic), and Ugaza (phonetic) I went to his house.  And after that, the only safe hill was the one opposite, and where -- the only person I knew there was Rafiki.  I alerted him, I called him.  I called him and said, "Look, I have problems" and I was scared that -- I knew that the RPF soldiers were out in the street and I was coming to his house.  I knew that there were people.  There were soldiers in his area.  Gun shots were very sustained in the area.  There was danger everywhere.  I didn't want to go too far.  I went to Rafiki's.  He knew me.  He was a member of my party.  He was also a colleague from the minister of public works because he was a director of cabinet just like myself, and that was the case.  During those bloody and frightening events, as the ones that took place in 1994 in Rwanda, one didn't have a lot of choice.  One reacted spontaneously.  In the face of death one doesn't think too much.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Rafiki also a member of the PSD?
@A.
I told you he was a director of cabinet at the minister of public works and energy.  He's a member of the cabinet.  Yes, he's a member of the party because that ministry was led by the PSD, so, yes, indeed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did he accept to welcome you without any hesitation?
@A.
I had already called him.  I called him, he had agreed.  Yes, he'd agreed.
@MR. BESNIER:
You're a member of the PSD, director of cabinet, and you said you were in danger?  He was also a member of the PSD.  He was also director of cabinet in the ministry.  He should also have been in danger, right?  Why would you go to his house?
@A.
When I arrived at his house, there were no problems in his neighbourhood, in the area he lived in.  There were no problems.  The RPF was in Rugando (phonetic) and in Rumera, near the Amahoro Stadium.  They were attacking that area, but it was still -- his area was still in tact, but that doesn't mean that there were no problems at all, because when I arrived at his house there were problems inside the house.  He had boarded up the house.  Everybody had barricaded themselves inside their houses.  He felt threatened.  He was inside his house, but he wasn't as -- in a spot as dangerous as mine.  I didn't -- I didn't say I was going to stay there definitively.  It wasn't the last place I was going to stay.  We had before us soldiers; we heard gunfire, even up above the CND.  Here was an RPF gun shooting people at the presidential guard camp.  So we were trying to -- we didn't have a -- we were trying to get away.  We didn't have a final solution to what we were going to do.

You left Gahizi's at 2 p.m. on the 7th of April.  At what time did you arrive at Rafiki's house?

That's difficult to say, Counsel.  I was on foot and every time there was gunshots I would go down to the ground so that I wouldn't get a bullet on my way.  I don't know, I must have arrived at about 4 p.m., approximately 4 o'clock.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you spend the day of 7th April at Rafiki's house, the rest of that day, the day?
@A.
Well, in the afternoon I arrived at his house, so on the 7th at night, I was there that night.  I spent that night at his house.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you spend the night of 7 to 8 April, therefore, at his house?
@A.
Yes, at the night of 7 to 8 April, I was at Rafiki's house and in the morning on the 8th, I was at Rafiki's.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the prevailing situation in Kigali on the 8th of April in the morning, to the best of your knowledge?
@A.
There was still gun fire sporadically in the city; in Kicukiro and in Rumera and Kimihurura (phonetic), Rogondola (phonetic); there were the military camps, and those places were completely unsafe.  People were barricaded in their houses.  Other people were on the road trying to find a way to get out.  People had their suitcases with them.  It was total insecurity in that part of the city where I was in the morning, and even later on in that day.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  We are on the 8th of April now.  You have evaluated the situation, you spoke about your friend -- you spoke to your friend, rather, about the situation.  Did you prepare a plan?  What were your intentions?  Did you try to escape?  Did you plan to stay there for a few days?  What was your mood, your feeling at the time?
@A.
Counsel, I would be lying to you if I told you that I had any intentions.  For me, it was over.  I didn't know what to do.  I was in the hands of Rafiki.  If he was going to leave, I would have to leave.  If I would stay in that house, I would be killed.  I didn't have any other plan.  What was I supposed to do?  At that time, on the 8th of April in the morning, were you in touch with your family?  Counsel, you think I was with my family?
@MR. BESNIER:
No, were you in touch with them by phone, or did you have any news from your family is what I mean?
@A.
When I arrived at Rafiki's house, my wife called me.  She told me that she had arrived in Kicukiro at a convent.  She told me that she had arrived at Kicukiro, but that was on the 7th in the evening.  So in answer to your question, I was not in touch with her, save that one time on the phone when she told me where she was with two of the kids, because the other kids from the 6th to the 7th at night, they went somewhere else to spend the night.  They went somewhere else to spend the night.  They were not with us.  My wife left with our oldest boy who was 16.  He was born in 1968, and my last born son who was one-and-a-half years old and she had him on her back.  Those were the two children that she was with.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Let's get back to the day of the 8th of April.  While you were at Rafiki's house, did he receive any visit?  Did anybody come to see him?
@A.
Yes.  In the afternoon at around 2 p.m., I believe, somebody came to see him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who?
@A.
It was Colonel Théoneste Bagosora.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see Bagosora yourself that day on the 8th of April?
@A.
Well, I was inside the house.  Rafiki went outside the house to see him, outside his compound.  I saw him through the window, but I was inside.  I did not go outside, but I did see him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you hear what they talked about?
@A.
No, Counsel, they were outside.  They weren't even inside the compound; they were just outside the compound.  Bagosora remained outside.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Rafiki tell you what Colonel Bagosora wanted, what he'd come for?
@A.
Yes, he told me.
@MR. BESNIER:
What did he tell you?
@A.
Well, he told me that Bagosora had come to invite him to participate in a meeting.  That meeting was amongst the political parties and it was to be held in Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Rafiki accept the invitation to go to that meeting?
@A.
Of course.  He went, he went to the meeting.  Counsel, what do you mean "did he accept"?  Was he of the feeling that he needed to accept? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Rafiki satisfied by the invitation given to him by Bagosora, or did he feel that it was a dangerous thing to do, to go to that meeting?
@A.
Well, I can't tell you how Rafiki felt when he came.  He talked to me, and he said that the colonel just told me that a meeting is being held in Kigali, and it is amongst the political parties, and the PSD is not represented in that meeting.  So, he was going to represent the PSD.  There were no PSD representatives in the meeting.  That's what Rafiki told me.
@MR. BESNIER:
According to Rafiki, what was the objective of the said meeting?
@A.
When I was still at Rafiki's, I didn't ask that question and, in fact, he didn't tell me anything about the objective of the meeting.  He just said, "It's a meeting of the political parties", that's all.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Colonel Bagosora suggest taking Rafiki with him to the meeting?
@A.
No, they didn't go in Bagosora's vehicle.  In fact, Rafiki used his own means of transportation to get there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Rafiki inform Colonel Bagosora that you were at his house?
@A.
That's what Rafiki told me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Since Bagosora said that there was a meeting being held amongst the political parties at the MINADEF, the ministry of defence in Kigali, Rafiki said that he spoke of a certain Ndindabahizi who is head of the PSD in Kibuye, who was present in his house.
@A.
This is the Ndindabahizi who is chairman of the PSD in Kibuye and according to what he told me, Bagosora apparently asked if Ndindabahizi could come to the meeting.  That is what I was told.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did Rafiki go to that meeting?
@A.
Yes, I was with him in fact.  He brought me, we were together.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you decide to accompany Rafiki to that meeting?
@A.
Rafiki had told him that I was there at his house.  Rafiki told Bagosora I was there.  Bagosora asked him if I could accompany him, Rafiki.  That is why I accompanied Rafiki through the ministry of defence, but Rafiki had spoke about this to Bagosora.  That's what he told me.  He told me that I could.  He told Bagosora, yes, I could accompany him.
@MR. BESNIER:
But why did you freely choose to accompany him?  Couldn't you just stay in hiding at Rafiki's house?
@A.
Counsel, the situation at the time wouldn't have allowed such a thing.  When Rafiki left he closed his whole house down.  He left with his wife and all the people, and his wife, in fact, had some problems, she was pregnant in fact.  He had to bring her to the hospital where she gave birth that night or the next day.  Everybody left the house, t was closed up.  Counsel, how could I stay there, or how could I refuse?  What could I do otherwise?  Was there any other way I could have done things, under those circumstances?  He accepted to welcome me into his house, I spent the night there.  His wife was pregnant and, in fact, in that neighbourhood I told you there was total insecurity.  There was gun shots here and there.  Later on -- in fact, we never went back there.  The situation became very serious.  I could only leave with him.  That's the only thing that I could have done.  I didn't know anyone else in that neighbourhood.  It was dangerous to move about on foot and even by car if I had had one.  I decided to go with him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Where did that meeting hold?
@A.
At the ministry of defence, Counsel, in Kigali.
@MR. BESNIER:
How did you get there from Rafiki's house to the minister of defence?  By what means of transportation?  With which protection?
@A.
Well, we used Rafiki's car and Bagosora was still there.  He had soldiers with him.  They were in a jeep.  That was the protection or the security, if you will, for the group.
@MR. BESNIER:
Must I understand, therefore, that from Rafiki's house all the way to the ministry of defence, you were accompanied by Colonel Bagosora in a jeep with soldiers?
@A.
Counsel, before arriving there was something -- before arriving in the middle of our trip, there was something.  Rafiki told me that he can't go to that meeting; he couldn't go to that meeting.  He couldn't go without François Ndungutse, so we went to go to pick up someone else.  Rafiki said that he could not represent the PSD party at the ministry of defence without being accompanied by another person who was also a member of the politburo as he was, a person who was a native of the south region of the country.  Rafiki is from the northern region.  In his car he said, "Listen Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have some problems.  I don't know if I can represent the PSD, I'm afraid.  The PSD is -- it's strong hold is in the south and not in the north.  I don't want to be accused later on of taking over the PSD party which is a southern-based party".  He said, "I have to absolutely go and get Mr. Ndungutse so that he can come with me".  So, we went -- we went to Kicukiro in a roundabout way.  We went to get Ndungutse who was from Butare.  He was a member of the politburo.  We went to get him for that reason.  If I could just explain.  We were at Ndungutse's house, therefore.  Rafiki convinced him, but Ndungutse was having problems himself.  There were people who wanted to attack him from the outside.  Rafiki convinced him, and now he decided to go to the meeting.  The meeting that was holding at the ministry of defence, and from there we went to the ministry of defence, there were three of us.  I was with them.  Two members of the politburo; Rafiki and François Ndungutse (phonetic), and then myself.  We arrived at the ministry of defence together, and this was in the afternoon, the afternoon of the 8th of April 1994.  On that afternoon at around 3 p.m. we were there.  And I can't give you the exact time, but it was around 3 p.m. when we arrived there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you with Mr. Rafiki's wife as well?
@A.
As I told you, Counsel, she was pregnant.  She gave birth that night or the next day.  She was dropped off at the central hospital in Kigali.  It wasn't far away, just a hundred metres or so away from the ministry of defence, from the ministry of defence where the meeting was being held.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  It's the 8th of April 1994, it's 3 p.m. and you arrive at the ministry of defence, and who is there to welcome you?
@A.
Counsel, could you really call it a welcome?  We weren't welcomed.  We arrived and we found people in the room; some were standing, others were seated.  There was no welcome; there was no protocol, if you will, when we arrived there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was Colonel Bagosora at the meeting when you arrived?
@A.
When we arrived, there was no longer need for security and Bagosora wasn't there.  I don't know where he went.  We were not together at the meeting at the time we arrived there.  We weren't with him, to the best of my knowledge, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
What happened at the ministry of defence on that day?  Did somebody tell you something?  Did somebody propose something to you?  Describe the situation for us.  What happened during the meeting?
@A.
Well, there wasn't a meeting as such when we arrived.  Some people were standing, others were seated.  Can you really call it a meeting, I don't think so?  The meeting was over.  When we arrived, the meeting was over.  The first thing we were told is, "Oh look, the PSD has arrived".  We've already informed the government who are the persons who will occupy the ministries that you hold.  The discussion was over.  I don't know who chaired the meeting.  We weren't told who chaired it.  People were standing, others were seated.  That's how it was.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you confirm that upon your arrival at the ministry of defence, the people who were already there proposed to you and to the other persons of the PSD who were with you to join the government; is that how things happened?
@A.
Counsel, who are the other persons who accompanied me?
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm talking about Rafiki and Ndungutse.
@A.
I think I was accompanying them.  They weren't accompanying me, but, yes, I was with them.  I was with those two persons, and they are both members of the politburo of the PSD.  I was only chairman of the party in Kibuye; I was not a member of the politburo.  When we arrived, those two members of the politburo would play the game.  When they were asked who would represent our party -- first, they were surprised.  I was next to them.  I was following everything.  See, we have -- you have ministries.  Who is going to represent us?  Who is going to hold those portfolios?  That was the question that they asked.  The answer was the following: "Well, those people are dead or they've disappeared.  Those people who would represent our party are either dead or just disappeared.  What are we going to do" they said "with your ministries?"  Have I (interpretation unintelligible) satisfactorily covered the question, or should I go on to tell you what happened next?  I think, madam, Your Honour --
@JUDGE KHAN:
What do you mean by "they"?  Who is "they"?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Perhaps I should have said one, O-N-E.  I'm sorry, I should have used one.  The French, un.  That is the one that said they were either dead or they've disappeared, and if you have a proper recollection it was Mugenzi that is the president or the chairman of the PR who was there.  And I told you that the meeting didn't have any chairman, visibly.  People were seated, people were standing, and Mr. Mugenzi told us, look - when we were asked where our former ministers were, I heard Mr. Mugenzi say, "They are either dead, or they have disappeared".  This is the answer we were given, and everybody there insisted because we had all the members of the various committees of the various parties that form the proceeding governments were there.  They were all represented except the PSD so they said, "We have finished our work.  We have already supplied the names of our ministers, now it's the turn of the ministries who were assigned to the PSD.  Now it's up to you, now, to tell us the ministers that were to replace your former ministers that are either dead or disappeared".  That was it, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What time is it now?  When did the meeting start, you said?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Mr. President, I did not say the time that the meeting started, because I don't know.  When we - when Bagosora arrived, I would say that was around 2, 3 p.m. and -- sorry, we arrived at 3 p.m.  We didn't know for how long those people were there.  All I can say is that they told us that they had finished their work, and it was the turn of the PSD to supply names.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And how many persons were present in the meeting room?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Perhaps I can give you the names that I remember?  Now, for MRND, there was Gunamatse Matera (phonetic), Karamera Eduardo (phonetic).  I also saw Zidovera Joseph (phonetic).  For the MDR, I saw Murego Domat.  I also saw Karamera, Frodouald Karamera.  And for the PR, I saw Mugenzi Justin.  I also saw (interpretation unintelligible) and for the PDC, I do remember having seen Rumerigisa Caspar.  So, there was also another person for PDC, but I do not remember his name.  But there were two of them from the PDC, so that if one reckons -- it was the PSD that was missing.  So that when we arrived, I was with Ndungutse François and Rafiki, but we -- that day the meeting had ended, we did not take part in the meeting.  What we did is what I just said, that was when I was asked a question -- and, of course, what we had to tell each other -- the people we met there that it was the end of the meeting.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, what was decided in the meeting?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The purpose of the meeting -- when we got there, what we were asked to do was to appoint or to supply names of persons so that we were to occupy --
@JUDGE KHAN:
You didn't follow my question.  When you reached there, what was decided in the meeting?  Do you know what was decided?  Do you know what was decided in the meeting? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was the setting up of a government, an interim government.  That was what was decided upon at that meeting, because we were told -- you see the president of the republic is dead.  There is no longer any government, we are at war.  We should therefore look for how this country's to be run.  In other words, in a nut shell, it was a question of setting up an interim government.  If there was anything else done there, I wouldn't know.  But that was the purpose as it was told us.
@JUDGE KHAN:
An interim government was set up in that meeting? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Your Honour.  That is correct, it was set up.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was this second person representing the PR?  I got Justin Mugenzi, but then there was a second name and that was a bit fast.  I think you have to spell that one.  
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was Ntambyariro.  N-T-A-M-A-R-I-R-O.  I'm sorry, N-T-A-M-A-B-Y-A-R-I-R-O, Ntamabyariro, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The three persons representing the PSD were Hutu; is that so? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, sir, they were Hutu.  Rafiki is Hutu; François is Hutu, and Ndindabahizi a Hutu.  They were all Hutu, sir.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
There was this decision -- you found this decision made that there was going to be found an interim government, and that the PSD was to take three posts.  When was the decision made as to who was going to represent the PSD in that government?  Was it there and then, or some time later? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The members of the politburo, that's (interpretation unintelligible) decided there and then.  They were asked to appoint the representatives of the PSD and there, on the spot, they decided to allow the former directors of cabinet of those ministries to place the ministers that had either died or ran away.  That was the decision made there and then when we were there.  They immediately supplied names that were immediately added on the list.  Now, the problem was that we had three ministries; the minister of agriculture and lifestyle; the minister of finance; and the minister of public works and energy so that we had to have three directors of cabinet that should have succeeded the former ministers.  The problem was that there was a director of cabinet that had been killed, so that we only had two directors of cabinet and three ministries.  We had to find somebody else.  Now, in the decision made by the two members of the politburo --
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I want to interject.  And when these two members of PSD there and then, were you consulted or was it just handed down?  And, what was your response? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
They did not consult me.  They decided quite simply that the directors of cabinet should continue so that they did not talk to anybody.  They said the directors of cabinet, since we could not get the problem (interpretation unintelligible) where the members are at a time of war, we should show our responsibilities.  They did not consult me.  They said the directors of cabinet will continue to assume those posts.  
@JUDGE KHAN:
Who made the decision?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The two members of the politburo, Mr. Rafiki and Ndungetse.  They signed the politburo agreement between the political parties that had just set up the government.  There was a decision adopted that was called -- sorry, that was a political agreement, an additional political (interpretation unintelligible).  There was an existing protocol and in that political agreement, they added representatives of the PSD.  They were Ndungutse and Rafiki who signed along with the other parties to set up that government.  They immediately signed, but they formulated reservations, both of them, and the political agreement, they formulated reservations.  They said, "We will accept to sign with conditions, otherwise we commit to party, but when the politburo of the party or the committee is set up, it will be the people in that committee that will decide whether these people should stay or be replaced so that the decision we made was provision.  They require that that be mentioned in the political agreement they signed as the basis of the setting up of that interim government.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Who was the director of cabinet who had already been killed at that point in time?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was the director of cabinet of the ministry of agriculture and livestock called Kabesha Thomas (phonetic).
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you given information before the ministerial posts were proposed to the PSD concerning the guidelines of the interim government?
@A.
No.  When we arrived, the government was almost set up.  The only thing that remained was the membership of the PSD which was to appoint those that were to represent the PSD, but -- I did not get the subtlety there, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Let me rephrase this.  At one time or the other, at the minister of defence, were you informed about what the policy of that government was going to be?
@A.
Well, when we arrived, the meeting was almost over except for the signing of the protocol of agreement.  That was signed between the parties that set up that government.  That was the only document signed by our representatives, and that showed what the government was going to do.  As for reasons why the government should have been set up, I did give you the reasons, but we did not sit down with those people to talk about all of that, about what was to be done by the government.  Our representatives signed, simply, what the others had decided upon -- decided to join.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you know who the prime minister was going to be?
@A.
No, not at that time at all.  We did not know at all.  Personally, I did not know who was going to be prime minister.  I knew that it was MDR that was to name a prime minister, but we weren't given a name of the prime minister.  What we were interested in, when we arrived was that we give them many people to take part in the government that is all. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, you were going to take part in a government.  You didn't go the policy of the government.  You didn't know the prime minister of that government; is that what you're saying?
@A.
Unfortunately, yes, sir.  The condition, in which we were working, couldn't have permitted to do otherwise.  We were there.  We are representatives who are requested to make a decision on their feet.  The rest of the work was already done.  What do you want us to do?  We were not putting any conditions that were normal conditions and which one would have asked one to sit down and think about fair assumptions as to what should be done to make knowledgeable decisions.  We were faced with a (interpretation unintelligible).
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, I have one last question on this issue and then we'll go on.  Now, why are you Ndindabahizi, under the circumstances of uncertainty, did not refuse to take part in that government?
@A.
That is the same question as the one you put to me when you asked me why I didn't stay at Rafiki's house, or why I didn't decide to go elsewhere when Rafiki went away.  Well, I was at the ministry of defence.  I - at the ministry of defence from Rafiki's house, where I was a refugee -- he asked me to go along with him, and he gets there and he makes a commitment, he makes a decision.  He points to me and says that I was minister of finance.  Are you asking me why I did not reject that offer?  Do you really think that is possible for one under those conditions to refuse, really?  I don't know. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Should we go on, Mr. President?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have to stop now.  Now, it has been decided that the Muslim holiday will take place on Wednesday.  
That implies that we will continue these proceedings tomorrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  We will then continue with your testimony tomorrow Mr. Ndindabahizi.

$EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, yesterday we were talking about the afternoon of the 8th of April.  You were explaining the circumstances under which you were appointed as Minister of Finance for the interim government.  Can you take it up there again and tell the Tribunal what happened following that meeting on the 8th of April, that afternoon, 8th April 1994?
@A.
Yes.  I was saying that on the 8th of April 1994, in the afternoon, at around 3 p.m. we were at the defence ministry in Kigali.  When we left, we went to the École Supérieure Militaire.  There the political parties, the representatives of those parties, met with the crises committee, and they did so to close the day's work.  That's it, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you yourself participate in that meeting with the crises committee?
@A.
Yes, I was there.  After giving the names of the PSD ministers, it was decided that we would stay in Kigali, and that for security reasons, therefore, I did not leave.  I remained with the others, and I was in that meeting.  That meeting was very short, however.  After that, we spent the night at the Hotel Diplomate.
@MR. BESNIER:
Tell us briefly, what was the purpose of the meeting with the crises committee.  Was it to decide the guidelines of the government's policies, the broad guidelines, or was there something else?
@A.
No.  We wanted to put a closing to that day's meeting, that meeting which was meant to set up the government.  The political parties had to say that the interim government was set up and that work was done and that the next day there would be a swearing-in ceremony.  That was the purpose of that meeting, if my memory serves me well.  If my memory serves me well, that was the only purpose of that meeting.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you spend the night from the 8th to 9th of April?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on to the night -- now, this meeting in the Ministry of Defence, you arrived at the meeting at three o'clock, you told us yesterday, hum, isn't that correct?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you left the meeting when?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was in the evening, after we had finished that meeting.  It was from about 3 to 4 p.m.  After that we went to the École Supérieure Militaire.  So this was after the meeting that took place at the Ministry of Defence.  After that meeting we went to the military academy or ESM.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but what I want to know now is exactly when the meeting at the ministry ended.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I couldn't tell you I know the exact time.  I would be lying if I told you an exact time, but I know it was the evening, because when we left we went to sleep at the Hotel Diplomate.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But for how long did you participate at the MINADEF meeting, was it from 3 to 4 or was it from 3 to 7?  When did that meeting end, approximately? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was about 2 p.m. when we finished that meeting, because when we arrived the meeting had already ended and in a few minutes the names were given and nothing else.  The meeting after that was closed.  After that we went to ESM.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what came out in the English translation, now, was that you finished the meeting at MINADEF at 2 p.m.  What I heard previously was that you arrived at the MINADEF meeting at 3 o'clock.  So let's take this again.  When did the meeting at the ministry start, and when did you leave it?  Can you assist us with that, approximately?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
We arrived at the Ministry of Defence, the PSD delegation that is, at around 3 p.m., and our stay there was not very long.  The meeting was over when we arrived.  The PSD was simply asked to give names.  There was no more meeting, and it didn't take very long.  But telling you it's 2 p.m. or otherwise, I can't give you the exact time.  I would be telling you a lie if I tried to give you an exact time, but it was at about that time.  And after it was finished, we went to the Ecole Supérieure Militaire, but I can't give you the exact time, and please pardon me for that, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's all right.  But will you estimate the time you spent at the ministry at about half an hour, 15 minutes, one hour, leaving aside the time.  But how long were you there -- that's what I want to find out -- before you went to the École?  Can you help us?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I think it didn't last more than 30 minutes after our arrival.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And now we come to the ETM meeting.  And when did that one start, approximately?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was between 1 and 6 p.m.  But, Mr. President, I can't be exact.  I can't tell you exactly when the meeting at ESM began, but I do know that it immediately followed the meeting which was held at the Ministry of Defence.  I know that it was after.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And approximately for how long did that second meeting last?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It didn't last very long.  It was only a question of a closing to the day's work.  Just to sum up what was done that day.  There were no discussions, in fact.  It was just to report what was done for that day, and we finished and went to sleep.  I, anyway, went to sleep at the ESM, that's where we were lodged.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. Ndindabahizi, the question I wanted to put to you was the following:  Where did you spend the night of the 8th to 9th April?  You said earlier that you stayed at Hotel Diplomat.  Now you are saying École Militaire.  Have you made a mistake?
@A.
Yes, I did make a mistake.  We did not sleep at ESM, we stayed at the Hotel Diplomate.  It's right next door.  They're right next to each other.  I'm sorry for that, Counsel.  Thank you.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
I need some clarification from the Accused person.  About this second meeting -- was it the meeting at ESM -- was it a meeting of the crisis committee with members of the parties?  What was it all about?  Who were meeting, who?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The participants in that meeting included the members of the political party committees, those who met on the 8th in the morning, or during the day during the 8th, and also the crisis committee.  Those were the only participants in that meeting.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And who were the members of the crisis committee?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It is difficult to answer your question.  It was soldiers.  I didn't know them all.  I knew two of them who were leading the others.  Those were Colonel Bagosora and General Ndindiliyimana and they represented the others, but the others were also there but I don't know their names.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
That is all, thank you.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. Ndindabahizi, now it's the 9th of April in the morning, you are at the Hotel Diplomat.  What did you do in the morning, the 9th of April?
@A.
On the 9th of April in the morning I woke up, but I had a problem.  In fact, since the 6th of April I had been separated from my family and, as I told you yesterday, I believe my wife and two children had fled towards Kicukiro.  I had three other children who had spent the night with another family, of friends of ours.  On that morning of the 6th I thought that I should try to do something to get my wife back with me, as well as the two children who were with her.  I borrowed a car from François Ndmbutse (phonetic).  He had a small car.  I knew how to drive.  I also had a gendarme accompany me, so  I could go and get my family in Kicukiro.  We were asked to stay at the hotel for security reasons, because the names of the future ministers had already been made public.  We were told to stay at the hotel for security reasons, but I ignored those orders because I was very worried.  I was worried about the fate of my family.  I absolutely, whatever the cost was, had to find them, and I knew I was risking a great deal.  I went to try to find them in Kicukiro.  My wife, in fact, before the telephones were cut off on the 8th, on the 7th, therefore, of April, she called me to tell me where exactly she was in Kicukiro.  So I left to look for my wife in Kicukiro, and I went to the place she told me where she was.  She was at a convent.  I didn't know that convent, but I asked around and people told me where the convent was.  I saw the manager of the convent, who told me my wife had left that night.  But she said she didn't go very far.
@JUDGE KHAN:
What do you mean convent, by a school or what is this?  You just mentioned convent.  What was this?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was a place where Catholic nuns lived.  There's a convent of the Catholic Church, which housed Catholic nuns.  There was a nun managing that convent, and that was who I went to see. 
No, it's not a school, it's a place where the Catholics -- I think Catholics know what that is.  But it's a place where young girls who have given themselves to Jesus's service, who don't get married, and they live there and the church houses -- the Catholic Church lodges them there.  I'm a Protestant and I don't know too much about all of this, the other church so I can't give you all the explanations I would like to.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
So the manager of that convent told me that my wife had left the night before.  She was very nice to me, and she accompanied me to go to Kicukiro, to the technical school, where there were many refugees there.  She thought that perhaps my wife had gone over there.  There were Belgian soldiers guarding that place.  I asked the soldiers at the roadblock, at the entryway, if I could go in but I was sure to leave the vehicle and the gendarme a bit further away.  I did not find my wife there at the technical school.  I continued to look for her and in the end I found her.  She was on the road towards Mibilizi.  She had spent the night on that road.  I saw the child, also.  I asked, "Where's your mother?"  The child went to call mother, and very quickly we all got into the car.  I dropped off the nun manager at the convent, and then I immediately went back to Kigali.  It was at the very last minute, just before the swearing-in testimony; in fact, it had already begun.  I was the last one to come into that meeting.  They were looking for me.  They hadn't found me.  I came in.  They immediately gave me a piece of paper and on that piece of paper the oath.  The text of the oath that I had to take was on that paper, and I took it immediately.
But in the morning, that is what I was doing.  And the last thing that happened was the taking of the oath.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Two questions come up regarding this morning of the 9th of April.  The first, there must have been a combat zone in Kigali and even crimes must have been perpetrated against honest people.  How could you go from the Hotel Diplomate, where you were, to Kicukiro, and return unhindered?  How is it possible to do that unfettered?
@A.
Well, it was very early in the morning.  At about 8:00 the situation had calmed a bit.  There was no shooting.  It wasn't too far.  I think it was some three kilometres, not more.  But you must understand me, also, I knew there were risks involved, but I also knew that I had to save my family, even if I was risking a great deal.  On that morning, though, there was a bit of calm in the air, nobody was shooting at us, the RPF was next to Amahoro stadium.  And on the road towards Kicukiro there were still gendarmes walking about, government gendarmes; this was still in the government controlled zone.  That road was still protected and guarded by the gendarmes.  I saw them there.  I couldn't have done anything differently.  Without my family, I wouldn't have had nothing.  I took the risk.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, the second question that comes up is that you found your child and your wife, you were in a car, there's a gendarme with you, why didn't you flee right then and there, instead of falling into the trap of the government?  Why didn't you just flee on the spot?
@A.
You've asked me that question since yesterday.  And counsel for the Prosecution also asked Lugan, the expert Lugan that question, "Why didn't Ndindabahizi flee?  He had just gotten a car, he was protected by a gendarme, he should have taken advantage of that occasion to flee."  What I tell you to that is that if you knew what was going on in Kigali where we were, if you knew what was going on, on the road that I was travelling on -- do I know what is going on everywhere throughout in Kigali, because to get out you have to get out of Kigali.  The RPF was present; they had surrounded the city.  There were killers running about the city killing people.  There were roadblocks erected by those killers and by Presidential Guard soldiers.  I was running a risk of running into those people.  Once again, it was total insecurity. 
And then a friend, a member of our party, who gave me his car -- he was with his wife and his children.  He stayed at the Hotel des Diplomate.  So, was I to leave with his car and abandon him there with his children?  That would be too egocentric.  He gave me a vehicle.  Did he do it so that I could flee?  How much petrol was still in the tank?  With that much petrol how far could I go and with a gendarme, a gendarme assigned to me by Rafiki?  If I decide to flee, will that gendarme agree to accompany me as I flee?  Would he agree to do that?  I don't know.
@THE INTERPRETER:
There's some static in the microphone and apparently it's the paper in front of the microphone.  The French interpretation is asking that -- no, no it's just because the paper, as you are touching it, is making noise.  It's not that there is something written on it.  That's not what we are saying.  It's just that the noise comes through the microphone.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
He's saying that I'm handling the papers.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. Ndindabahizi, remind us where and at what time you took the oath of office.
@A.
I took the oath of office at the Hotel Diplomate at about 9 or 10 in the morning, but I can't give you an exact time.  I remember it was in the morning, 9 or 10 in the morning. Let's say 10 o'clock, 9:30.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, following the oath of office, you became the Minister of Finance.  Did you decide to go to the Ministry of Finance on that day?
@A.
Well, we were sworn in on the 9th, and on the 9th, if my memory serves me right, it was a Saturday.  It was the beginning of the weekend.  So I did not go to the ministry.  What would I do at the Ministry of Finance on such a day?  I did not have any keys to the ministry.  I didn't have any work to do there.  It was the weekend, so I did not go to the Ministry of Finance.
@MR. BESNIER:
Tell us when the new government met the first time.
@A.
I believe it was on that day of the 9th.  It was on that day of the 9th, there was a small meeting, but I do not have the minutes of that meeting, just as all the minutes of the meetings of the cast of ministers were not supplied to us.  But on that Saturday there was a small meeting, the first meeting of the government.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, during that meeting, did the government talk about the violence in Kigali and in the rest of the country?
@A.
I believe that what was discussed was what was happening in the area we were, because we didn't know what was happening in the rest of the country.  We didn't know anything about what was happening in the rest of the country.  Violence in the city of Kigali was known to us.  This was all we knew, and that was what was discussed.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the government decide to take measures to get those -- that violence to cease?
@A.
Yes, indeed.  That was what was said.  That was what was decided.  It was decided that the minister responsible for security -- they requested to take measures to stop the violence.  The minister for security affairs, that is the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, to those ministries it was said something should be done.  And seems we thought that the youth of the MRND was involved.  We also asked the leader of that party to do something to intervene, so that the situation could be put under control.  People are told to calm down, and prevented from committing crimes.  But that was only for Kigali city, because outside Kigali city and in the hinterland of the country we did not have any information as to what was happening and, indeed, there was not even a telephone available.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, you yourself, as Minister of Finance, did you deal with state finances during the time the government was in Kigali?  Did you deal with state finances?
@A.
Now, I did not get your question, Counsel, concerning state finances.  I did not get the question.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now you were Minister of Finance.  As Minister of Finance, did you deal with financial affairs concerning the state?  Did you begin to do your work as Minister of Finance during the time the government was in Kigali or did you do something else?  In a nutshell, what did you personally do within that government?
@A.
Now, Counsel, I told you that we were on a Saturday, that was Saturday, the 9th.  It was a weekend and the next day was the 10th, a Sunday.  So I do not see why you are asking me whether I did have anything to do with state finances.  What finance are you talking about?  What national affairs are you talking about?  This was a weekend.  There were no activities.  All that there was was what we heard that was happening in town, the war, the crisis, so that there was nothing else to think about, in terms of financial management.  There was no time for that.  It was not possible for me to do anything.  Perhaps you could make your question clearer.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, perhaps I did not understand your response.  Did you attend any of the meetings with other members of the government at the time the government was in Kigali?  We are not only talking about the 9th of April, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  We are talking about the day during which the government was still in Kigali.
@A.
Only 10th, that is the next day, there was yet another meeting of the government  council and I participated in that meeting.  
On the 11th of April there was another meeting, and that meeting was held with the préfet of the préfectures, and I did take part in that meeting as well.  So that in a nutshell there was a meeting on the 10th and there was another meeting on the 11th.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the agenda officially of the meetings mentioned?
@A.
The meeting of the 10th, I do recollect that it was a question of obtaining information concerning the security situation within the country.  It was decided -- it was decided to call in the préfet to discuss the security situation.  The préfets, therefore, came the following day, that is the day after, that is the day after the 11th, and the purpose was to discuss the security situation.  There was no other purpose, other than that.  There was nothing else to do, because the country was engulfed in fire and blood, especially in Kigali, so that it was absolutely necessary for us to be put in the know as to what was happening in the country.  That was the purpose of the meeting of the 11th.
@MR. BESNIER:
So how long did the government remain in Kigali, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
The government remained in Kigali up to the 12th of April in the morning, the morning of the 12th of April.
@MR. BESNIER:
And why did the government have to leave the capital then?
@A.
The government left the capital on the 12th in the morning; but, to my knowledge, no reason was adduced for that.  So that I went to see my children, who were at a friend's at Kiovu, that was at around 500 metres from the hotel, and when I came back I realised that everybody had gone away.  I left.  I asked as to what was happening.  I was told that they had left.  So, there was no official information as to the reasons why the government left Kigali.  The government left Kigali without I (sic) being told what was happening, and we simply took note.  It was later on that we were told that it was for security reasons that the government left.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did the government go after that?
@A.
The government went to set up in Murambi, that is in the Gitarama préfecture.  The Gitarama préfecture, Murambi, that is the headquarters of the préfecture.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, how did you do to get to Murambi itself?  What did you do?  How did you get to Murambi itself?
@A.
I did say to you that in the morning of the 9th I had borrowed a vehicle.  I borrowed a vehicle, because I had none myself.  There were two vehicles at the house, though, the driver, a car and the official car, and I had left them there at the house when I was on the run on the 7th of April. 
When I was to go and get my wife I had to  borrow a vehicle, but to leave Kigali I always had to resort to arrangements because, once again, I had to use a vehicle that I had to borrow.  A vehicle I borrowed from Pastor Twagiariayezu, who was the bishop of the Presbyterian church.  His wife was the godmother of one of my daughters and one of my daughters was there between the 6th and the 9th.  He was not there on the 9th.  He had gone to Kibuye.  When the plane of the president was shot down he was unable to come back.  It was, therefore, his wife who gave me the keys to his vehicle, which I used to take my family from Kigali to Gitarama.  I hope I have covered your question.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you accompanied by other persons to Gitarama?
@A.
I told that family -- yes, I told that family that I was leaving and that the government had just left and that the family of Faustin Michel Twagirayezu was there, and I told that family to leave, because there other vehicles, and they used those vehicles.  So we left in a convoy.  On the way I was given some children by another family that I loaded in the vehicle, and I went on with them to Gitarama.  That was in the morning.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did that family, that woman, in particular, hand over children to you?
@A.
The woman -- I knew her, and then when I met her on the road in between Gitarama and Kigali I stopped to see what was happening, because there were people on the road.  There were many people who were leaving, because in Kigali there was fighting and people were leaving, were beginning to leave Kigali in great numbers.  So I saw the lady and I stopped.  She was crying.  She was crying, and I asked her what was happening.  She told me, "Listen, my husband has just been killed."  I also knew the husband, but in the vehicle there were no seats available.  She decided to give me the two children that I loaded on the vehicle and we went along together.  So she gave me her two children.  She had one child on her back and another on foot, these were very small children, and she asked me to help and I accepted to help.  She even told me that the husband and her father had just been killed around Gatsata; that is on the road from Kigali to Byumba.  But it was in the neighbourhood of Kigali that they were killed.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was the ethnic group of those children?
@A.
Those children were Tutsi children, but the mother was -- the father was Tutsi and the mother was Hutu.  So they were Tutsi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Please tell us, what were your first assignments in Gitarama as Minister of Finance.  Try to give us a picture, very briefly, as to what you did day after day.  What were your tasks, your duties as Minister of Finance in Gitarama?
@A.
Well, really, to tell you, as Minister of Finance, with the terrible situation that obtained at that time, to tell you that I did anything was to say probably too much.  I cannot -- what can I tell you?  I'm a Minister of Finance.  Perhaps even the other ministers, was there anything for them to do?  I came to Gitarama and the government set up in Murambi, and at the same time there were many civil servants that had left Kigali, they also came to settle down in Gitarama.  So that the first thing that was there to be done, the first question that was put to the Minister of Finance, was to determine how the people were going to survive and live.  People had left Kigali on the 6th, that is the 12th, some of them left the 6th, others the 12th, and normally salaries are paid out at around that time and the salaries are paid through accounts, and civil servants did not cash their monies, because of the unfortunate events that cost us the life of President Habyarimana.  And upon arrival at Gitarama, people had nothing.  They had no money.  Some of them came here without their clothes, so that I was asked to do something about it.  Those that were to settle down in Murambi will have somewhere to stay, but what were they going to eat?  What were they going to do?  This was what I was asked to do.  And I tried to find some money to help all those people and to try to see to it that the banks opened, at least the banks at Gitarama are open, to be able to serve those that had accounts and money in their accounts.  That was the first thing I was asked to try to do, and that was the first thing I tried to do. 
Now, I do not know whether I should recount my day-to-day activities, because the government council had even asked me to secure state funds so that state funds were safely kept.  And I did precisely that.  I ensured that the governor of the national bank would do that, and he did that.  The banks came to settle down in Gitarama, and they opened for business, and they started serving the customers that had monies deposited with them.  The customers were served, those that were to be paid.  We didn't take into account the fact that the money was to go to accounts, we simply gave out instructions that monies were paid out on the basis of lists established, because there were the various ministries in Gitarama and the managers of the various ministries were in Gitarama, and it was easy to establish salaries because managers of the ministries, for the Minister of Finance, for example, was responsible for the salary distribution on the basis of lists established by the various ministries.  
That is a quite tedious type of work because of the disorder that obtained and at the time we had to know who was entitled to be paid, and payment was not only made in Gitarama, there were teachers and there were civil servants that were not in Gitarama.  That's why elsewhere in the country we had to serve them as well and all that had to be supervised.  And then, of course, there was the problem of the purchase, the procurement of food and supplies and contracts to be passed with suppliers that supplied various commodities.  There were advances to be paid to all the suppliers.  The Ministry of Finance, who was solicited to a great extent during that period, since the other ministries -- the other ministers -- because of what happened, had been done to the Ministry of Finance.  I cannot tell you I signed this order or that order on this day or that day.  I do not remember the secrets with which I worked.
@MR. BESNIER:
Up to what time did you stay in Gitarama,  Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@A.
Could you be clearer, we arrived at Gitarama on the 12th, and we stayed for the month of April and for the month of May, and that was May.  It was at the end of May that we left Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Could you tell us the conditions under which you left Gitarama, you, yourself?
@A.
Okay.  Counsel, please be a little bit clearer.  When you talk about leaving Gitarama, do you mean leaving Gitarama once and for all or leaving and coming back?
@MR. BESNIER:
No, I mean leaving once and for all.  You said that the Government stayed until the end of May.  You had gone to Gitarama, you wanted to make headway.  We want to know the conditions under which you left Gitarama?
@A.
Well, it was still the same set of circumstances.  We left Kigali precipitously; Gitarama too.  It was one morning that we were told that the RPF was in the vicinity of Kabaya and everybody started running away.  I ran away with others, and where did I run to?  How did I get away?  I had some in-laws in Gitarama, in this city or the town Gitarama, I had in-laws and it was right in that city the fighting was going on, and I was happy I came to take over that particular town.  And it was not easy for me because I had to evacuate that family -- that is the family of my in-laws -- with many, many members, about 20 of them.  I had to evacuate that family, transport them to Kibuye, and then I had to go back to get my wife to be able to move onto Gisenyi the following day.  
This was what I was able to do.  Probably you want some more details, so this is how we got to Gisenyi.
@MR. BESNIER:
What itinerary did you use to get to Gisenyi?
@A.
The way to Gisenyi -- I hope you remember the road network in Rwanda.  I left Gitarama and went up to -- that is on the Kibuye road, I went up to Rukabano and came back to Gitarama to collect the rest of the family and drop them at Rukabano.  I left that family at Rukabano with a friend, and I did know that my family was in Kirinda, because in May I had sent my wife and my children, and also the children of the préfet of Gitarama, I sent all of them the Kirinda, the state of Kirinda.  So I had to go and get them in Kirinda, and drove them to Gisenyi through Ruhengeri, that is the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road.  The next day I got to Gisenyi with my wife and the children, the five children and the children of the préfet Uwizeye Fidéle, that is the préfet of Gitarama.  We arrived there on the 3rd of June, I believe.  That is the way we arrived at Gisenyi and tried to get accommodation, and we tried to locate the government, while I tried to locate the government and rejoin the others in Gisenyi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why are the children of the préfet of Gitarama -- why were they with you?
@A.
Now, the préfet of Gitarama -- in May -- that was when I came back from Nairobi, at around the 20th of May, there was serious tension in Gitarama.  We felt pressure from the RPF, and I wanted to evacuate my family, to put it away from the town.  But since my family was living with the préfet in Gitarama, when the préfet's wife saw that I was evacuating my family, they postulated that I had some other means, and they said, "Well, can you take our children along with you?"  Well, I believed that was not a problem.  I said that the children should stay together and, therefore, I sent them to Kirinda upon the request of their parents.

@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  So that in the final analysis, where did you settle down in Gisyeni?
@A.
In Gisyeni, I tried to look for accommodation at the Meridian Hotel, but the family was not with me.  I looked for a small house, where I placed them with the family of another minister; that is, the minister of social affairs, Minister Ramaneza (phonetic).  They tried to get the two families together.  We tried to get the two families together for greater security.  So that I spent the night at the hotel, but the families were put up together to facilitate their protection in the town of Gisyeni. 
@MR. BESNIER:
What did your work in Gisyeni consist of?
@A.
It was the same as in Gitarama: paying salaries, procurement, supplies.  We even had to try to get up the banks, because when we left Gitarama, the banks left as well, to set up shop in Gisyeni.  It was practically the same thing as before.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  How long did you remain in Gisyeni?
@A.
We arrived there in early June, and we remained up to the 13th, 14th of July, something around those dates.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you go after Gisyeni?
@A.
Gisyeni signalled the end of things.  After that we fled.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you go?
@A.
We went to Goma, just next door.  To Goma, some two kilometres away.  It's just next to Gisyeni, but it's in Zaire.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Mr. Ndindabahizi, we've gone over all your activities since the 6th of April 1994 up till the government fled to Goma.  Now, I want to ask you more specific questions about specific events, events that are mentioned in the indictment or that were brought up by certain witnesses. 
@A.
Very well, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, between the 6th of April 1994 and the end of June 1994, did you participate in a meeting, a political meeting in Kibuye?

These meetings had already been planned by the government.  Everyone knew where they had to go.  That's how it was planned.  I was told that I would be accompanying the prime minister to Kibuye with other persons.  But this was all planned.  We didn't go where we were told -- where we weren't told to go.
@MR. BESNIER:
Was there an agenda for that meeting?
@A.
Yes, the agenda was just that, pacification.  That was it. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the participants in that meeting prepare their speeches ahead of time?
@A.
There were no speeches to prepare.  There was a document that the prime minister had prepared, and that document was the basis for the meeting.  That was the only document to be presented.  And he was head of the delegation, and he had to present the document.  The other people were not obligated to prepare speeches.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who spoke first at that meeting?
@A.
Well, it's very normal; the first person was the préfet.  He welcomed and opened the meeting.  He was the first person to speak, and that was exactly how it happened.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the prime minister speak during that meeting?
@A.
Yes, he spoke right after the préfet, and he talked about the contents of that document that he had.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you tell us the central theme of the prime minister's speech during that meeting?
@A.
It is difficult, Counsel, but the document exists.  You can always refer to it.  The préfet welcomed the prime minister and then welcomed the participants.  He spoke of problems of insecurity that existed in the préfecture in 1992 and 1993, and that there were also security issues throughout the country in April of 1994, but that security was being restored.  And that activities had rebegan (sic), but there were problems.  There were problems of abandoned property that people wanted to divide up amongst themselves.  He spoke of those types of problems.  And that's all I really remember.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did members of the public ask questions of those who were participating in the meeting?
@A.
Yes, people did ask questions.  Yes, they did.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were there any questions about the massacre of civilian Tutsis in the préfecture?
@A.
Yes, the bourgmestres asked questions to that effect.  They asked about the infiltrations of the RPF.  Others were saying that there were people with blood on their hands, who had killed people.  There were people who were asking for weapons to protect themselves.  And the prime minister responded to all of those questions, to all of those people.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you informed during that meeting of massacres that had taken place at the Gatwaro stadium and the Saint Jean church?
@A.
Informed?  You mean during the meeting or before we went to the meeting? 
@MR. BESNIER:
It's the same for us.  On the 3rd of May, did you know that massacres had taken place?
@A.
Personally, I did not know anything about those massacres.  I don't know if there were others who didn't know, but I don't know who knew and who didn't know.  But when you ask me, I didn't know that those particular massacres had taken place before I arrived.  And even during the meeting, I had no information to that effect.
@MR. BESNIER:
Weren't there traces of massacres or combat on the roads towards Kibuye?
@A.
There were no corpses on the road, because when we arrived -- there's only one road you can take to get to Kibuye.  When you come from Gitarama to Kibuye, into the city, there's only one road; there's not several.  On that road, there were no corpses.  I didn't see any of them on the road.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, did you speak during that meeting?
@A.
Yes, I think -- I believe I did.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you speak spontaneously or were you talking in response to a question put to you?
@A.
There were people who spoke before me; they made speeches.  There were things that I had to react to, and I reacted after hearing what the others had told me, what the others had not told me, but what they had said in their speeches.  There was information that compelled me, as a member of the PSD, to say things -- clarifications that I had to give as a member of the PSD.
@MR. BESNIER:
First, try to tell us what the nature of the speeches were that made you react. 
@A.
Well, the prime minister spoke, and he talked about the 27th-of-April document.  The MRND also spoke.  The MDR also took the floor.  And that at one point during their speech, I heard that they continued to repeat that there were accomplices.  The MDR said there will be no more accomplices within the government.  
Now, I knew that people were being massacred and they were being accused of being accomplices.  I thought I had to react to that.  I reacted, saying, "We're not accomplices".  Somebody else reacted after me, someone from the same party -- from the other one, the other person who was in the MDR.  That person also reacted.  "Ndindabahizi's just said this and that".  I think it was Rwabukwisi who said that, who was repeating what I said.  So I reacted to that, to try to calm people down.  I said, "Trust me.  We're not against you, we're not going to kill you".  
These people were afraid of the RPF.  The RPF was advancing, and as the RPF advanced, they thought they would find accomplices and they would react against them.  So I had to react to that, Counsel.  That is what I wanted to say, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
But deep down, why, at all costs, did you not want to be considered as an accomplice of the RPF before the 6th of April?  Was your party close to the RPF or why did this come about?
@A.
Yes, it was close to the RPF.  That's why people were immediately killed, starting on the 6th of April.  Our party -- and we were accused of being with the enemy, being accomplices with the enemy.  That was it.  
It was very dangerous for us and for me if people would continue to say, "There will be no more; we will not allow the RPF's accomplices to be in our government".  Because the RPF's accomplices in the government, who were they?  How many governments were there in Rwanda that had RPF accomplices in them?  In the previous government, how many parties were there which were accomplices to the RPF?  I only think there was one, that one which fell on the 6th of April.  And we knew what became of them, what fate awaited them.  These people continued to say, "RPF accomplices, RPF accomplices".  This was very dangerous, and they called the PSD accomplices.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I understand.  Now, how long did that meeting last?
@A.
I think it lasted until 3 p.m.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you go back to Gitarama the same day?
@A.
Yes, on the same day.  I went back to Gitarama on the same day.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you go through Gasharu, your native hill, on your way back?
@A.
No, I did not go to Gasharu.  I went immediately back to Gitarama.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, did you ever go to Gasharu, your native hill, between the 6th of April 1994 and July 1994?
@A.
I went to Gasharu in June 1994, yes, in June.  That is when I went to Gasharu. 
@MR. BESNIER:
If you remember, can you tell us the exact date when you went to Gasharu?
@A.
When I stayed in Gasharu?  I didn't stay in Gasharu; I didn't stay there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, when you went.  Not when you stayed, then, when you went.
@A.
It was on the 26th of June, 26th of June 1994, if my memory serves me well.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why on that day did you go to Gasharu?
@A.
Well, my destination wasn't Gasharu, but I passed through on my way to Kibuye.  I left Gisyeni to go to Kibuye, but before going to Kibuye, I stopped in Gasharu, and I stopped to see my sister who was living there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Before and during the genocide, did you ever go to Gasharu to see your sister, to have news from your family, to see how things were going on your native hill?
@A.
No, before I didn't go there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Now, on that day of June 1994, how did you get to Gasharu, by what means of transportation?
@A.
I was in a minibus.  I was with children that I was supposed to bring to Kibuye.  So we were in a minibus, a Nissan EuroVan.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who were the children you just spoke of?
@A.
You will remember I spoke about them.  These were children from the -- they were -- the préfet of Gitarama's children, Uwizeye, who had accompanied us on the 20th of May of 1994.  I said that when my family left Gitarama, the préfet had given me his children for safety reasons.  So in June I decided to bring his children back, because he was in Kibuye at that time.  I knew he was there, so I had decided to go to see him in Kibuye to bring his children back to him.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you leave from?
@A.
I left Gisyeni.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  You said you were supposed to go to Kibuye, but you stopped in Gasharu; is that correct?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you first go to Gasharu, or did you first go to Kibuye?
@A.
No, first I went to Gasharu, because Gasharu is before Kibuye on that way, ten kilometres before, something around ten kilometres.
@MR. BESNIER:
Do you remember at what time you arrived at Gasharu?
@A.
It was in the middle of the day.
@MR. BESNIER:
What do you mean "middle of the day"?  Can you be more specific? 
@A.
Middle of the day.  Well, if you have 12 hours in the day, it's about noon or 1 p.m., between noon and 1 p.m.  That is what we call middle of the day.  It's not in the morning, it's not in the afternoon, it's right in the middle: noon, 12:30, 1 p.m.  But, Counsel, I can't give you the exact time.
@MR. BESNIER:
Were you driving yourself or did you have a driver?
@A.
There was a driver, who was a gendarme.
@MR. BESNIER:
When you arrived at Gasharu, where did you park your car, or the vehicle?
@A.
You don't arrive via Gasharu, you arrive at a small market, a small road that you have to walk on to get to the house, a small path, really, you have to walk on.  
One of the Prosecutor's witnesses said that there was a road up to my place, and there is none.  I left the car at the base and I walked up.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, you left the car at the market, or the commercial centre.  What's it called?
@A.
It's called Gitaka, G-I-T-A-K-A, Gitaka.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see a roadblock at Gitaka upon your arrival?
@A.
At that time I did not see any roadblock.  I didn't see one, but when they said that the roadblock was between the house of Karara and further up, I decided to leave the vehicle at Gitaka.  To get to my house, it's not between those two places; it's some 20 or 30 metres below.  So I stopped the car there and I walked up the hill.  And I think we looked at the photos that we talked about in this courtroom.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did the situation seem normal in Gitaka when you arrived?
@A.
No, it was abnormal.  It was abnormal.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why was it abnormal?
@A.
When I arrived, there were people on the road, and when they saw me, they seemed to be very concerned, worried.  They talked to me about their concerns.  The houses on the hilltop -- and you can see them from Gitaka centre -- were desolate.  I told you Gasharu is mostly inhabited by Tutsis.  Probably 80 to 90 per cent of the inhabitants were Tutsis, so you can only imagine what the hill looked like.  And in Gitaka I could see that many houses were destroyed.  
So the situation was very much abnormal, was not normal.  People were cold.  I came across problems I had never seen before.  Such problems had taken place in the 1960s, but the people who were there were mostly young people.  There were a few elderly, but most of the people had never seen such serious tragedy.  They were worried.
@MR. BESNIER:
You told us you went to Gasharu to visit your sister.  Were you able to see her on that day?
@A.
Yes, I walked up to the top of the hill, and I saw my sister there.
@MR. BESNIER:
What did she tell you?  Did she speak of the situation in Gasharu?
@A.
Yes, of course.  But what could she tell me that I didn't see?  She told me.  She told me what had happened.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did she give you any news about members of your family?
@A.
News about members of my family?  What do you mean "members of my family"? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Your nephews, your cousins, your parents.
@A.
Yes, yes.  She told me there was a problem with the children.  She told me that she was hiding some of the children.  Some of them were still alive.  And she asked me what to do.  And I said to her, "Well, you should allow the children to remain where they are".
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, on that day, in Gasharu, how long did you stay with your sister?
@A.
I did not stay long on that hill.  I was there for about -- I looked around, and I went down.  After 30 minutes I went back to the centre, that is the Gitaka centre.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what did you do when you got back to the Gitaka centre?
@A.
At the Gitaka centre I yet again met a certain number of people, a certain number of people who had gathered there.  And I talked to them a little because some of them put certain questions to me.  I also asked certain questions.  I do remember a person, an elderly man that I knew, who was telling me that there was a woman that he had hid somewhere and was asking me what to do.  I told him, "Listen, why do you want to kill people, innocent people, just like that?  Who gave you the right to do so?"  And he asked me, "What am I going to do?"  No, he asked me, "Couldn't you tell these people to leave my wife alone, so that she can come out of hiding?"  I told those people, "Listen, leave this woman alone; let her come out alive".  I did say so.  
I also talked to Karara, one Karara -- he didn't come here.  For a long time, I thought Karara was in charge of a cellule, but I've always thought that he was in charge of a cellule.  I also knew that he was a friend to some members of my family, so that I thought that he was still in charge of Gasharu.  So I asked him to tell me what happened, but he didn't tell me; he didn't know what to say.  So in anger I loaded him on the vehicle.  
I was also told about one boy who allegedly killed about ten women.  So that when we were talking, I was trying to see what I could do because he was dangerous.  He had disappeared at that particular point in time.  So that I had told the people, "Listen, you should not kill".  But they were telling me that that was not the problem.  It was not the people of Gasharu, that created the problem; it was people from the neighbouring cellules, the cellules neighbouring Gasharu that created the problem.  Because when I told you about Gasharu, I told you that Gasharu was a hill inhabited by Tutsis, mainly.  But all around, on the other hills, those hills were inhabited by mainly Hutu.  So that that was the picture, and it was thus that I left Gasharu. 
In the afternoon, it was that I left Gasharu.  I left Gasharu with that man called Karara.
@MR. BESNIER:
Just a minute.  Just a minute.  Let us go back a little, and one or two questions.  You talked about a killer that had killed some ten women.  I did not get that clearly.  Were you told about it or did you see him?
@A.
Well, I was told about him.  I was told about one Gatete (phonetic).  People were saying "Gatete".  That was a man, a rather unpleasant man, who was about 20 years old, but he was unkempt.  He was a dirty man; he looked like a vagrant, and upon looking at him you'll see that he didn't even wash his hair. 
@MR. BESNIER:
So you saw him yourself?
@A.
No, he was pointed out to me.  I was told, "Here is Gatete.  He was the one that was killing".  And when people started to say that he was the one who was killing, he disappeared.  He disappeared, and he went away.  
But Karara did not try to hide or to run away.  He remained with me.  And I went on in the same vehicle as him.  And I told myself that he was going to give me explanations.  But the other one disappeared.  Karara was with me.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, during the discussions you had with the people around there, did you make a speech or was it a chat?  What happened?
@A.
Counsel, what do you mean by a speech?  You get to a place, people are unhappy, people tell you this and that happened.  Unfortunately, that was not a political rally.  I talked to them, and many of them knew me.  Those were old friends, people who lived all around the hill, some on the hill.  So that there was no place for any speech.  One cannot say, "Ndindabahizi, Great Ndindabahizi is here; he's going to make a speech".  No.  I came and talked to them, just as anybody would talk to brothers.  I had no political speech to make.  But I told them that, "Look, this is what I want to tell you: please do not kill".  
I even went much further.  I said something that I should not have said, perhaps.  I did say, "If somebody kills, that person should also be killed".  And that was not what I wanted to say -- really meant.  I told them to stop killing innocent people, and I asked them to tell me who authorised them to kill innocent people.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, between the time that you stopped at Gitaka with your vehicle and the time you left with your vehicle, together with Karara, how many minutes or hours did go by?
@A.
No, I did not stay for a long time at that location.  When I came down, I talked to them about 20, 30, minutes.  So that in Gasharu, all in all, I could have stayed for one hour, one and a half hours, something like that.  Because I was on my way to Kibuye with the children of Préfet Uwizeye that I had to return to their parents.  So that I had to proceed with the rest of my trip.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what did you do with Karara that you talked about, who was in your vehicle?
@A.
Well, Karara, I took him to the Gitesi commune jailhouse.
@MR. BESNIER:
And the children with you, what did you do with those children?
@A.
The children -- those were the children of the préfet of Gitarama, Uwizeye, who was in Kibuye.  So I looked for the préfet.  He was with his wife.  And I handed back the children. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you firstly take Karara to the communal jail or did you firstly hand over the children to their parents in Gitarama?
@A.
Well, firstly, we took Karara to jail and then continued, because there were some kilometres that we had to cover.  The préfet was not in the city of Kibuye; he was a little bit farther down.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you spend the night?
@A.
That evening -- in the evening, I realised that I could not reach Gisyeni.  It was about 100 kilometres away, so I stayed at the hotel in Kibuye.  And I was with my ten year-old daughter, who wanted to accompany the Uwizeye children.  I spent the night at that hotel.
@MR. BESNIER:
And what did you do the morning after?
@A.
The morning after, I saw the bourgmestre; that is, Karara, the bourgmestre of Gitesi.  We talked about Karara; that is, the Karara that I put in jail, and I asked him to take care of his problem.  I told him about what happened in Gasharu and the reasons why I had brought Karara to jail.  And I told him to take care of Karara's case.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, what was Karara the bourgmestre's party?
@A.
He was a member of the PSD, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
With the bourgmestre, did you have any discussions besides the political situation of the PSD?
@A.
Yes, we did talk about PSD's position and situation, especially the issue of representation of the PSD at the assembly.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, this is of interest to me, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  What was the problem of representation of PSD at the assembly?
@A.
The problem that was there was that the person that was to go to occupy that seat did not want to do so.
@MR. BESNIER:
Who was that person?
@A.
It was in Ndindabo.
@MR. BESNIER:
And why didn't Ndindabo want to sit in for the PSD? 
@A.
Ndindabo, I saw him.  I saw him.  I told you I had gone to Bwakira on the 2nd of June.  I was running away from Gitarama.  It was on that day that I found him at Kalinda (phonetic).  And we talked about it, and he told me that he was in flight and that he was living with Bourgmestre Bwakira, who was protecting him.  He said that his family was also there at the bourgmestre's residence for security reasons, and that for security reasons he had left Kibuye.  
So we discussed that problem of representation of the PSD at the National Assembly, and he was saying that he could not take an oath, go to take an oath and leave his family in Kalinda in a situation of insecurity, and that he had abstained from going to the swearing-in ceremony.  We discussed the matter.  
Ndindabo was my deputy at the préfectural committee.  He was my deputy, so that it was easy for us  to talk about all those problems.
@MR. BESNIER:
Just a minute.  You are saying that you met Ndindabo well before you met the bourgmestre you are referring to at around the 26th or 27th June; is that correct?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. BESNIER:
So that at what date and where did you meet Ndindabo?
@A.
I did say that it was on the 2nd of June when I went to fetch my family at Kalinda, and it was then that I saw Ndindabo, at Kalinda.  He -- I do remember he said he was with friends.  I said, "Which friends?"  He didn't want to give us any names.

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Just a minute.  Kirinda, where is Kirinda?
@A.
Kirinda is in the Bwakira commune.
@MR. BESNIER:
In which préfecture?
@A.
Kibuye préfecture.
@MR. BESNIER:
And now you're saying that during the conversation, it was Ndindabo that informed you about the fact that he was no longer in agreement about he is being sworn in for the national assembly; is that correct.
@A.
Yes. 
@MR. BESNIER:
But what was your own thinking as far as that issue was concerned? 
@A.
Well, Ndindabo had been appointed when I was chairman of the PSD, and it was quite natural that I go along with the decision it made -- that was made for Ndindabo to represent the PSD.  The parliament -- there was not a position I could take, apart from respecting that position, but as far as he was concerned, for reasons for security, said, well, I had to go away.  My family is here, I can't go anywhere else.  I am going to stay here.  I cannot go to a place where there was insecurity. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you try to influence him in one way or the other?
@A.
No, I did understand his problem and he was feeling quite insecure, but I couldn't compel him to do anything.  I said, "Look, you don't want to go.  What do we do, because we cannot leave that seat to somebody else?"  That is the seat of the party.  And it is necessary that in Kibuye -- because that was the only seat we had in Kibuye.  We said that it was necessary to have a representative in Kibuye.  This is what we talked about.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, during your conversation with Ndindabo, did you agree about the name of the person that was going to replace him (Interpretation unintelligible)?
@A.
Counsel, there were not many people there that were able to replace him.  We agreed on the name of Bourgmestre Karara, who was a PSD member and partly -- he was a friend of his.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, when you say "we agreed", was it you that imposed Karara's name while he simply agreed, or did you talk about it?  How did it go?  Why did you discuss the issue of Karara?
@A.
I am saying that Ndindabo was my deputy in the party.  We talked about it as members of the same party.  We decided together, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, let me come back to the discussion you had with Karara.  Did Karara, at the end of the month of June, get any information about the fact that he was going to become a member of parliament in replacement of Ndindabo?
@A.
At that -- at the end of the month of June -- at the end of the month of June, I told him that we will talk about that and I was asked, "What did you talk about with Karara when you were in Kibuye?"  And I said that we talked about that representation of the PSD of the national parliament.
@MR. BESNIER:
And how did he receive the news?  Did he take it as a promotion?  What was his reaction?
@A.
Counsel, at that particular point in time, with the upheaval that there was, with all the problems (interpretation unintelligible) the area, could somebody really feel that he or she was promoted by having been appointed to the national assembly?  We thought that the sole purpose of (interpretation unintelligible) was to preserve the seat of the party in the assembly, and within the framework of the constitution of the country.  So, I cannot really say that he had any reason to be facilitator of what was going to be proposed.  The proposal was dictated by the circumstances of that obtained and he accepted. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, there's one thing I do not understand.  Probably, you don't have an answer, but the country was at a loss.  The RPF had greatly advanced and had taken control of almost all the country.  The government was to leave several days after that to (interpretation unintelligible).  Now, how could you deal with matters as futile as the appointment of a PSD representative of the national assembly, things as futile as that?
@A.
Well, I've told you, Counsel.  I believe I've responded to that question.  Now, why is it that when one feels things are coming to an end, one should lay one bare for revenge simply because one would be accused of refusing to go to the national assembly?  Even if things were coming to an end, why would one want to attract any further anger and vindictiveness?
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, during your conversation with Karara, you talked about the PSD and the particular case of the person that you had gaoled.  Were there any other issues you talked about with that person?
@A.
I do not remember having talked about anything else.  I do not remember almost anything else that was discussed at that particular point in time.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  What did you do following the conversation you had?
@A.
Following that conversation, I went back to Gisenyi.
@MR. BESNIER:
On that day, Witness, or during those two days, did you see the presence of the French soldiers of operation Turquoise?
@A.
Yes, sir, they were there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you see them yourself?
@A.
Yes, yes, I did see them.
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Mr. Ndindabahizi, on the 6th of April 1994 and July 1994, did you ever go to a place called Gitwa near, Karongi hill?
@A.
Which date did I go to Gitwa?
@MR. BESNIER:
I'm asking you whether during the 6th of April 1994 and July 1994; did you go to a place called Gitwa, it is a hill located near the Karongi hill.
@A.
No, sir.  No, sir, I did not go to that location.  No, sir.  I told you that I went to Gisharu and Kibuye for the reasons I explained.  I didn't go to Gitwa, for what reason?
@MR. BESNIER:
Had you ever been to a roadblock at Gaseke, at the Gaseke hill?
@A.
Gaseke, I know.  It's on the Gitarama-Kibuye road, or Gisenyi-Kibuye road.  I told you that on the 3rd of May we used that road to go to Kibuye, and on the 26th of June, I used that road to go to Kibuye.  Now, you're saying that I went to Gaseke?  I think you should be more accurate.
@MR. BESNIER:
Okay.  Let us be more accurate.  Did you ever stop, between the 6th of April 1994 to July 1994 -- did you ever stop at a roadblock at a place called Gaseke?
@A.
No, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
During that same period, did you ever go -- come by a roadblock at a place called Nyabahanga in Gitesi commune?
@A.
Counsel, once again, I'm saying that all these roadblocks that you're talking about are on the same road, one after the other, so, I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  The roadblocks you're mentioning, Gaseke, Nyabahanga, are all on a thoroughfare, on one road.  I didn't go -- I didn't come across a roadblock.  
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you stop at a roadblock at one time or the other at Nyabahanga?
@A.
No, sir, I did not stop by a roadblock called Nyabahanga.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you stop during the same period at a roadblock at a location called Faye?
@A.
No, sir, I didn't come across that roadblock, if that roadblock was ever there.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, for the occurrence -- did you ever go to Bissesero?
@A.
Once again, for what purpose, Counsel?  I didn't go to Bissesero.  These are vendatious (sic) assertions.  I never went to Bissesero.
@MR. BESNIER:
Had you ever gone go to the Kibirizi market?
@A.
I did not go to the Kibirizi market.  I was not there at that market.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, have you ever left the Rwandan territory between the 6th of April 1994 and July 1994?  Did you ever leave Rwanda?
@A.
I did, sir.
@MR. BESNIER:
At what particular time?
@A.
It was between the 11th of May and the 18th of May; I went to Nairobi, Kenya.
@MR. BESNIER:
For what reason did you go to Nairobi?
@A.
I was on mission.  There was a meeting that I had to attend.
@MR. BESNIER:
What was that meeting, that conference?
@A.
It was the assembly.  There were two conferences: one was a national -- general assembly of the African Development Bank, the ATB; and then the yearly of the free trade, the professional trade area, the PTA. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, this question is part of defence (interpretation unintelligible) concerning the presence of Ndindabahizi in Nairobi from the 11th to the 18th of May 1994.  This document is already part and parcel in the bound document that Defence has submitted to Your Honours before the hearings, which now I would now like to tender it to Your Honours.  
Mr. President, these are the bills.  The bills are hotel bills.  One from Hilton Nairobi from the 11th to the 17th of May.  We have the original copy here, which we would like to tender as an exhibit, Mr. President.  And these are copies.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
D.64(A) for the one with 6,590 Canadian dollars, and D. 64(B) for the one 36,843.00.

@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have a few remaining questions for you.  Let's try to move ahead.  Let's go back from your -- to your departure from Gisenyi in July 1994 and your move to Goma in Zaire.  Where did you go in Goma?
@A.
There weren't many homes in Goma.  Everybody -- practically everyone had left Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  Those areas were empty.  There were two or three million Rwandans in a city of 200,000, that housed 200,000.  So we needed a place to stay.  We were looking.  I went to a small hotel called Mask for a few days.  I felt that in the hotel it was more unsafe than outside, and so I went out and stayed with a Zairian friend in Goma.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, up until which date did you remain a member of Jean Kambanda's government?
@A.
Can you say that that government existed, that it still existed outside of Rwanda?  When we left, most of the ministers had disappeared.  We were in the government by title only, but you didn't see anyone.  Everyone was on their own trying to lodge their families somewhere and the governor wrote us an official letter even, saying that the former dignitaries of the Rwandan regime had to leave the border area of Rwanda and Zaire; that is to say, Goma.  Everybody practically had left and had to leave.  I stayed, though, up until August, but really, when you say "a member of the government", if I was a member of the government while I was there, or even after, it would be saying too much.  And at any rate, my duties -- people continued to call me the minister of finance because we had deposited money in Zairian banks, and I was asked to continue to closely follow developments of that case.  The money was frozen.  That was it, basically, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
You said that you remained up until August 1994, you remained in Goma?
@A.
Yes.  If I remember correctly, yes, August 1994, or perhaps September, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Where did you go when you left Goma?
@A.
I went to Bukavu after Goma.  Bukavu is another city in Zaire in the Kivu region, but it's in the south.  It's south of Goma, some 200 kilometres south of Goma.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you remain in Bukavu up until the ICTR investigators and officials arrested you?
@A.
No, I went to Nairobi.
@MR. BESNIER:
Before being arrested?
@A.
I had already left Zaire, and I had also left Nairobi.  I was arrested in Belgium.  What do you mean by "investigators" though, Counsel? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, wait, we'll talk about that later.
@A.
Do investigators really arrest, Counsel?
@MR. BESNIER:
Well, just a moment.  When did you leave for Nairobi?
@A.
That was in 1995, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
While you were in Nairobi, were you in hiding?
@A.
I was never in hiding in Nairobi.  I never was never in hiding.  I was always visible.  I moved about in Nairobi.  I spent a lot of time there, in fact.  For five years I was very visible, I was never in hiding.  I had nothing to fear over there.  Why would I have gone into hiding? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Didn't you fear being arrested by the Rwandan authorities or being prosecuted by the Rwandan authorities, or even by the international authorities?
@A.
I had information according to which those jurisdictions didn't want to arrest me, I had information.  I was sure that I would never be arrested, so I wouldn't have been in hiding.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you have any contact with ICTR investigators?
@A.
Not only contact, Counsel, I was with them most of the time; whenever we wanted to see each other.  I wouldn't really call it "in contact with".  I was with them, I would say, all of the time.  Whenever they wanted to see me, whenever I wanted to see them.
@MR. BESNIER:
When did you start seeing ICTR investigators?
@A.
Well, the first time I met with the investigators was in September 1996.  Two people who said they were from ICTR, and they were accompanied by a Rwandan, came to see me.  The Rwandan contacted me to put me in touch with those two persons who were coming from Kigali, and they said they were members of the ICTR staff.
@MR. BESNIER:
Can you write down the name of the Rwandan who you say put you in contact with the ICTR staff members?
@A.
Yes, please give me some paper.  Thank you. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, at this stage, I must remind you that the person whose name appears on that document, was Witness DX.  Witness DX was the subject of a motion by the Defence on the 27th of October 2003.  We filed it under 92 bis under the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  We filed it, the said motion, under 92 bis (E), respecting the time delays, 14 days ahead of time.  And it is accompanied by the written testimony of Witness DX.  There was no opposition on the part of the Prosecutor under 92 bis (E).  Any opposition had to be served within seven days.  Consequently, we believe that there is no obstacle to the admission of this written testimony as a Defence exhibit.  This written testimony will confirm Ndindabahizi's statements regarding his meeting with ICTR staff between 1996 and 1998: '96, '97 and '98.  That written statement also contains other information regarding the circumstances, political and historical, of the genocide.  It also deals with the morality of the Accused person.  DX's written testimony is in conformity with 92 bis (A)(e) and (a) and (b) and also (c).  
Lastly, the testimony that we have presented respects the provisions of Article 92 bis (B).  Consequently, and since the Prosecutor did not oppose the admission of that document seven days ahead of time, I think it is the right time to ask the Chamber to admit this written statement as the next Defence exhibit. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The date of this motion was, Mr. Besnier? 
@MR. BESNIER:
27 October 2003, 27 October 2003.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Should we first now maybe gather the documents written by the witness; namely the name of the person with whom he met?  That could then be -- may be D. 65?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So then that's admitted, the handwritten declaration, we just saw the name of the investigator or the Rwandan. 
$Exhibit No. D. 65 admitted)
@MR. BESNIER:
Under 92 bis (B), Mr. President, there's also an affidavit from a notary.  This is just a form.  I don't know if this affidavit should be filed separately or at the same time as the written statement.  I think for good form, it should be filed separately.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this the last exhibit that you are tendering?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  The Chamber hasn't got this motion in front of us now, so I think we would like to recapitulate and have a look at your motion and we keep that issue floating, and we will come back to it.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Mr. Ndindabahizi, what did the investigators want, the ICTR investigators?
@A.
The first team was a two man team, and the third person was the Rwandan I spoke about.  And they came in September to see me.  The Rwandan introduced them to me, and he told me that those investigators wanted my cooperation in the investigations on certain files that they were investigating, certain investigations that they were conducting; that is what I was told.  We didn't immediately decide what to do.  They said that they would come back after.
@MR. BESNIER:
Did you accept to cooperate with those investigators?
@A.
Well, first we discussed the conditions.  So the Rwandan who brought them to me told me that those conditions -- they accepted, and after that I was not opposed in any way.  But I only gave them some conditions and they accepted those.  It wasn't cooperation in the sense you understand it here, outside.  Prosecution staff said first, you know, you can plead guilty and then we'll collaborate.  That's not the kind of collaboration or cooperation I'm talking about.  They wanted me to work as an investigator, in a sense, within their team.  They had an office in Nairobi and that is what they wanted.  So, we had a discussion.  They said, "We're going to Kigali and when we come back, we'll tell you what our decision is".  And towards the end of the year, in November, but I don't remember the date.  Starting in November, we began to meet and that Rwandan, that I mentioned, was also there and he was their collaborator.
@MR. BESNIER:
During those meetings you had, were you -- ever made written statements?  Were you heard as a suspect or a witness?
@A.
No, as a witness.  I was not a suspect.  They told me they had verified everything in Rwanda and that there was nothing charged against me.  So they wanted me to integrate into their team and help them to establish the truth on what happened in Rwanda.  So I was not a suspect, they didn't see me as such.  And if they thought me as a suspect, I don't believe they would have accepted the conditions that I laid out, even though they didn't in the end honour those conditions later on.  But at any rate, we had a verbal agreement, and that was not respected.  But I was not a suspect, Counsel.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, the written statements that you gave them, those written statements that were presented before this Chamber, were they read back to you?
@A.
I was surprised to see those here before this Tribunal.  Other witnesses who came before this Chamber, before presenting their written statements, are asked if those are signed and if it's their own statement, if the signature at the bottom of the document is their true signature.  When I was given the document, I found that it was abnormal.  I read it, and what I found inside it should have been corrected.  I was never told that they were recording or that they were taking notes.  I don't know.  I don't know how that document was introduced before this Chamber without me seeing it beforehand, and without me having an opportunity to verify whether it was true or false.
@MR. BESNIER:
Now, did those investigators ever invite you to look for the assistance of an attorney?
@A.
No, Counsel.  I was not a suspect.  We worked together as collaborators, but I was not a suspect.  I think the problem with that document is that when you re-read it, you don't even know who wrote it.  The names of the investigators aren't even on the document.  Some of the dates of the interviews are not there.  There are blanks in the hand-written document.  Who put those blanks in?  Perhaps, it's the problem of the translator who is supposed to translate.  There are just contradictions and things I did not say.  For example, "You were at the meeting in Kibuye presided by President Sindikubwabe".  If I was given that document in Nairobi, so that I could be able to correct it and even sign it and make it my own, it would have been better, more desirable.  But here, I've been brought here, and references made to that document and this a problem.  But that issue of an attorney, no, I was never assisted by an attorney.  I was not even being told that I was being recorded and if I was asked if the conversations could be recorded, I said, "No".  It was not an investigation on me that they were conducting.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, did you say that you started meeting with the investigators in November?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I say before that, because when we met for the first time, it was at the Hilton Hotel and nothing was written down, nothing was put down on paper.  It was just the first visit.  They just wanted to see who I was and we talked on a hotel balcony, but nothing was written down.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year did these interviews start with investigators, please?  And which month?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
In 1996, Mr. President, towards the end of that year.  One was called Gilbert and the other Haruna.  They had set up their office at a hotel in Nairobi, the Nairobi Safari Club.  It's just next to the Nairobi University.  That is where they had set up their offices, and we would see each other on a regular basis.  And the content of that document was not what was said.  They said I was with them from '76, November -- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 1996, 1997, 1998.  We were always together during those years, all the time, until we separated for reasons that I could give.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, which documents are we talking about here?  The Chamber has this file introduced with another Ndindabahizi.  That's one document we have, and the other is reference to a meeting at a certain date in '97, and a reference to something that may have been recorded in '96.  The names of the investigators are not the same as those just referred to by the witness.  So which documents -- you said, "I was surprised to see documents not signed by me when I came to the Tribunal".  Which document are you referring to, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, may I have that document with me so I can tell you which document I'm referring to, because in this bound document there are several documents.  I think it is P. 25 of the Prosecution, if my memory serves me right.  P. 25, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Register P. 25, that is the one I have in front of me, yes.  And that's the one we're talking about?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.

1630H
@MR. BESNIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
The first document I am referring to is document 3, document 3, which says we had on this day of 3oth of November 1996, from 1620H to 1900H, 1900H, we still had Mr. Ndindabahizi, former minister of the interim government.  This is a document that contains erasures hand-made erasures, Mr. President said that the names of the investigators, I just gave are different from these ones. I am saying that this document of the 30th of November 1996, doesn't show the names of the investigators.  I do not even see my signature.  I see that the document was corrected by hand; these are mistakes or the anomalies that I have pointed out.  And, this document that I am referring to, I know this document even if some of the contents that are to be corrected because I did not see it and I did not sign it.  It was Mr. Gilbert - - Mr. Haruna that were with me so that their names should be mentioned here together with my signature had I seen the document beforehand.  As far as the others are concerned, for the other document since there are other documents are in English and French, the other document is the minutes of a meeting of the former minister of finance, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the 8th to the 11th of July, 1st, 2nd and 3rd August 1997 by Shadely and Drack (phonetics) and I do not know these people but I know that there were people who came to see me in Nairobi but, and who were members of the team that was working in Nairobi and who were telling me that they wanted some information concerning funding of finances, how we managed our funds in 1994.  And it was that team that was working with Cherebe, and it was Juveal, who was in charge of the Nairobi team.  He was the one working within that Rwandan, and he was the one that brought in the other teams that were specialised in one or the other respect.  That is it, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now we have identified the two documents and these are the two we are referring to now.  Isn't that so?  There are no other documents from interviews that you are referring to, these are the two? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Mr. President, is that question for me?
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We want to make sure that we are on the same wavelength now because you started talking about interviews and documentation.  And now after this useful exchange I am asking you whether you are actually referring to these two documents and those are the ones and no one else.  These are the results of the interviews with the investigators; is that so? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
The problem, Mr. President, is that I did say that I was with those people from 1996 to 1998 and that they only opted for several dates to introduce as evidence against Ndindabahizi here.  Perhaps they were all the interviews that should come in on cross-examination, and I don't know why they chose only these documents here.  They were the ones that took notes.  Perhaps I would have also tendered manuscripts that I prepared because I was taking notes.  I did not know that they were recording me; they did not even afford me the opportunity of checking what I said.  Those people never gave me the opportunity and they made use of the fact that I assisted them to accuse me by using documents I had prepared myself.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, Defence Counsel, just to avoid lack of clarity now, these are the two the Chamber knows about;  isn't that so?  We don't have anything else so far.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Mr. Ndindabahizi is saying that he took part in interviews and that documents were prepared subsequent to those interviews but he doesn't know how many documents all in all were prepared because he was not invited he was given the opportunity of checking them on and signing them.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
I did not need to have an explanation of what Mr. Ndindabahizi is saying.  He was crystal clear. Thank you.  What I am just saying is that what the Chamber has, and I am talking to you now as an officer of the Court, that what we have so far is what we have in front of us; isn't that so?
@MR. BESNIER:
That is correct, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And who made these changes on that document KO184935, the document where there are no investigators' signatures?  Is that then investigators' notes, or do you know that Mr. Ndindabahizi where these corrections come from, the handwritten ones?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Mr. President, I believe that it is the Prosecutor that tendered this document.  He should answer that question.  It is the Prosecutor that tendered this document.  He should be allowed to respond to that question if the response is not correct.  I should beg leave to intervene, but I believe it is the Tribunal's investigators that prepared this document.  This is not my handwriting, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was the point.  So that was not your handwriting. Thank you very much.  This clarifies the matter.
@MR. BESNIER:

$BY MR. BESNIER:
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, I will have two or three questions, so I will try to finish this up.  Now tell me, when did these meetings with the investigators cease, and for what reason did they stop?
@A.
We held troubled times in the course of all of that.  At times the person that I mentioned on that piece of paper did take the floor to level out - - to iron out differences between us so that for the two years I was with them they were times at which personally I decided to go away from them because you would bear with me, Mr. President, they were honest with me because the commitments they made, they did not honour and when they did not honour their commitments, they looked for ways and means to compel me to leave.  They started by threatening me.  In 1998, I do not have the precise date; it was in 1998 that they started threatening me.  They told me that I could be arrested, that they could get me arrested that - - well, that is it so that they threatened me, they threatened me that they could get me arrested, Mr. President.
@MR. BESNIER:
You are talking about commitments on their part.  What commitments did they make to you?
@A.
Well the commitments are initially, they said to me that I had taken refuge there, "Your family is not in security.  If you accept to work with us the first thing by the way, is that we put your family in a safe place. Tell us a country of your choice that is safe where we can send your family immediately?"  
The second thing because I did talk to them about the security of my family that was back in Rwanda and was my brother and they told me that they worked in Rwanda and they would ensure the security of those people that remained in Rwanda and that therefore there was no problem.
The third thing they said that, "Well as far as we are concerned, investigators are paid, and you are not going to work free of charge.  We are not going to ask you to work free of charge we have salaries as investigators."  And they told us that for that purpose that they needed a written contract which they said they were preparing.  So that were the promises that they made to me and each and every time I reminded them, they told me, "Well, please wait, we are waiting for the person who was responsible to finish what he was doing".  So they asked me all the time to wait.  
Now when the time came for them to ask me where the, "The trouble, well, Mr. Ndindabahizi you are no longer too useful to us because we have people that can tell us what you can't tell us."  So that I changed, they said that we want a statement from you according to which Bagosora appointed you as minister, "We want that statement from you," so that I understood that things have started changing since they wanted me to state that it was Bagosora that appointed me as a minister.  I said to myself, "Well, I do not understand."  I went back to my friend who was the go-between and said, "Well, what is happening?"  
He went to see them and they said that there was no problem but he had a concrete agreement with them and that they were even doing something in Rwanda.  And that they would call to talk about the problems so that we can continue working but at the end of it all, it didn't work out.  Then they told me, "Look, Mr. Ndindabahizi that is all.  You didn't want to sign the statements according to which it was Bagosora that appointed you minister.  You know, by the way that the Rwanda government is looking for, you know that the Tribunal is looking for you.  You know that the government of Kenya has not given you asylum.  You should therefore look for protection.  If you do not want to be protected by signing this statement according to which Bagosora appointed you minister, well, it is up to you.  And moreover the Tribunal has no money to pay for these things so that if you do not want to fulfil the conditions, we are laying down, we have other people that are more interesting than you and that is the end of it."
I saw that that was the end of the road with those threats and finally they came out and said before leaving, it was on the 12th floor of that hotel in Nairobi.  We were six that was presided over by Gilbert Morrissete and they told, "Look Mr. Ndindabahizi you should know that they had just arrested people in Nairobi that they call 'Operation Naki'".  They said to me, "Mr. Ndindabahizi we arrested some people in Nairobi.  Now, on the next list, your name will be there.  Get ready full stop."  
Then I reacted rather badly because I told them, "Look, I am with you here.  Why don't you arrest me now?  I have been with you why should you wait if I am a criminal?"  And they asked me to go away from their office.  And, and that was the last difficult moment I had with them apart from the fact that they called from the telephone.  Later on they called again to say, "Could you sign this paper and bring it back to us according to which paper Bagosora appointed you as a minister?"
I did not do so.  Prosecutor is here but I do not remembering signing any such document.  It was at time that I told my friend, "Look things were all wrong.  And that the people I was dealing were not honest with me."  I talked at length because you asked me to explain.
@MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. Ndindabahizi, I think we have spent a lot of time of this issue.  Now, following those contacts with the investigators, did you remain in Nairobi?
@A.
Following those contacts, Gilbert had told me, was that what he was going to do was to see me in prison for the rest of my life.  He said, "For the rest of your life, you will be in jail because you did not want to corroborate".  So I stayed in Nairobi, and later on, I went to Belgium to seek asylum.
@MR. BESNIER:
Why did you take refuge in Belgium?
@A.
Now, I followed my wife who had gone there to seek political asylum.  She left in 1999 and in the year 2001, first of all, I waited for Shereha to come and jail me for the rest of my life, and it was four years '98, '99, 2000,. I said to myself, "Well, I must move on, I must go to Europe. And in Europe and in Belgium, I will not be in hiding.  I would not go to Europe to hide myself. I went in seeking asylum."  And I sought asylum and I was on verge of seeking asylum because I was arrested in my house just as I had obtained provisional documents to stay in Belgium, at least provisionally.
@MR. BESNIER:
This is all the for the examination-in-chief, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  
Mr. Ndindabahizi, so the period with the investigators went from September 1996 until - - until when you stopped cooperating, or when they stopped cooperating? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
The first contacts were in September 1996 and it ended in 1998, 1998 it was not all the time that we talked, sometimes they would call me over the telephone, but it was during that period that it was between 1996 and 1998 when it all ended.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And apart from the trip outside Rwanda, in 1994 from the 11th to the 17th of May, did you travel outside Rwanda apart from those six days? 
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Outside the country, Mr. President, it was only from the 11th to the 17th of May 1994, Mr.  President. As for the rest of the year, I remained; that is up to the month of July 1994, I remained in the country, sir.

Mr. President, I am quite surprised because I filed this motion through the registry on the 27th of October 2003, and was recorded by the registry.  The stamp of the registry is dated 27th October of the year 2003, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
This document exists only in French for the time being. 
@MR. BESNIER:
To my knowledge, sir, yes, Mr. President, unless it was translated in the meantime.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's in the document, no one of us recalls seeing this document.  It's in French anyway, so it could have gone somewhere else.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So if the registry could just double check a little bit what happened to this document to which it was -- to whom it was distributed the channels it followed et cetera.  The Prosecution will look into the Prosecution files, and, I think, Mr. Phillips, if you could ask your French-speaking colleagues in the Prosecution to glance through it all night and that would be helpful.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then, and we can clarify the matter tomorrow, maybe.  That's good, and we know that this is a pending issue.  
Coming now to D. 64, D. 63, and D. 62, these are very legible copies they are not difficult to read at all.  But do you have the original of these documents, Defence, maybe in particular the passport.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. I served to the registry the originals of these copies apart from the passport that are in the document of the Prosecutor that is the original.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So if then the Prosecution could bring to the courtroom and to the Bench the original of D. 63 if that is where the passport is now, and the registry will show as D. 62, and D.64, at a certain time, I see it's here.  Thank you very much.  That was helpful
Well it is almost 5:00 we could go on for five, ten, fifteen minutes.  Do you want to start with the first fifteen minutes of cross-examination, Prosecution?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
As the Court pleases, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
Thank you, Defence.

Good evening, Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  Microphone, please.  
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let me start off by asking you some questions concerning your bio data as you testified in the Court yesterday.  Do you understand me, sir?
@A.
Yes, I do.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We recorded the name of your father, that of your mother, and the fact that you have four sisters and two brothers; is that correct?
@A.
I believe that is correct, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In the course of your testimony yesterday, whilst talking about your sister who is known as Mukayeze, you testified that she had two sons; didn't you, sir?
@A.
Yes, I did say so.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
One of them was in indeed a witness for the Defence in this case, and the other person who you described as Boniface, do you recall saying that, sir?
@A.
That is correct, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, I didn't catch the family name or the second name of the person whom you described as Boniface.  Can you help me with that, sir?
@A.
I gave his name.  I wonder why it was not noted.  I said it was Ngabo, Boniface, N-G-A-B-O, Ngabo, N-G-A-B-O, and Boniface.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Pardon me for not having taken due note of that.  Sir, if I asked the document to be handed over to you and the Court, can I --.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Can I have some assistance from the registry please because this will probably be the only thing we are able to get through today because it's substantial?  I have enough copies for everyone.  If you just give that to the Defence and Their Honours.  And the translators, there is enough to go around.  
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have been, as you can see, Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have been doing some, some sort of design work trying to configure how indeed your immediate family is constituted.  Now, I want to start with that list and I want to take you through this list and this is something that I have been drawing myself.  So if I have anything wrong, please feel free to correct me.  
Now, you testified that your father had one brother and two sisters.  Is that a correct recollection of your testimony, yesterday?
@A.
Well I don't know whether you properly noted; who are the two sisters?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, let ask you?
@A.
Referring to my father's sisters or the sisters, my own sisters.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you just listen to my question, sir?  It's very easy; we have a diagram before us there.  Now how many siblings did your own father have?  Start with that, please.  
@A.
I said that he had one brother and two sisters.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, your father is the man I describe there as Hanyurwa; isn't it, sir?
@A.
That is correct, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, let me describe how that diagram works with you, was to you sir; now those four people under the word "grandparents" are the children from those grandparents.  Okay?  So your father and his brother, the daughter and the last person there, Nyirakaje are all the children of the people upstairs as grandparents.  Do we agree on that, sir?  So your father's parents had four children, your father and three others?  Are we agreed so far, sir?  Can you just look at what I am talking about and not the whole document, sir, otherwise we won't go home?
@A.
Yes, I clearly see.  Well, I am the one who told you that my grandfather had two -- had two daughters and two sons including my father.  I told you that.  There are -- I don't see any complications or do you see any complications, sir?  Or what do you want?  Just tell me what you want.  If not I can see the family tree.  First you have --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, you are not very terrible to either me or this courtroom, if you don't take time to answer my questions.  I'm not asking you for a commentary.  I am asking you for a simple question.  Now, do you agree, sir, that your father had a brother and two sisters as it is indicated on the first row, yes or no?
@A.
That is what I told you since yesterday.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Ndindabahizi, Mr. Ndindabahizi, everything is easy and fine so far.  We have realised what you said yesterday and Mr. Phillips is simply starting his overview by making sure that you are on the same document and the same line.  So there is agreement on the first line.  What is the next question?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Mr. President, is there a copy of this in French?  I have an English version.  Can I have a copy in French of the same document? 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
These names, Mr. Ndindabahizi and if you listen to me, we would go through that document and I would give you a copy in French when I come here the next time.  Now, your father married --
@A.
But, pardon me, Counsel, but the trial has to be in a language that I understand.  So I would like to have a copy of this in French.  This - - the difficulty in this is that I have a copy in English a language I do not understand.  Please give me a copy in French.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.
@A.
Otherwise, my grandfather, my grandfather had two sons and two daughters.  That is what I said, but please give me a copy in French, please. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What I think would be the smartest way to proceed now is that we ask one of the interpreters to kindly to assist Mr. Ndindabahizi at the close of this session.  You will see that there are not very much to translate.  There are only some words like son, daughter, grand parents and so far, but if one of the English translators could just go through the document and give Mr. Ndindabahizi a document with a handwritten French explanation of the few words in English which are not Kinyarwandan names and then he can look at this overnight and feel comfortable with the document. 
@THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, your father then married your mother Nyiramuruta; is that correct, sir?
@A.
Yes, yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And between that union, they were blessed with four children; were they not sir, your parents, sir?
@A.
I said seven.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Seven children, and of the seven children, I have mentioned four of them on that list and they are as follows: Yourself, sir, your humble self, your brother Seyeze, your sister, Mukayeze,  and your other sister whose name I wouldn't even venture to pronounce, but is on there.  Are we agreed so far sir, so I haven't mentioned three names, three bodies?  Are we agreed?
@A.
We agree.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir. Now you are married, your humble self, you are married and you have been blessed with five children.  We agree there also, sir?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your brother, Seyeze, sir, he is also married.  Is he not, sir?
@A.
Yes, he got married. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Unfortunately, I do not know the name of his wife, but would I be correct in saying that his wife has a brother by the name Elie? 
@A.
Elie, I am not sure.  You have to look at the other second name.  Elie might be a different person, but you have to look for the other name, the second name.  But, it is a fact he is married.  I won't confirm Elie because you didn't give his second name.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But you could at least confirm, sir, *************************************, wouldn't you, sir?
@A.
If it was accepted when you asked me questions.  It's in the transcript we shall see that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, we agreed with that part of the events.  Now let's go on to your sister, Mukayeze.  Now she has at least two sons, does she not, sir?
@A.
Yes, yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Those sons are fathered by two different men, are they not sir?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And Witness DG's father is the name that I would not venture to pronounce but which I have also written there, sir and indicated as being the father of DG in English, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
@A.
Yes, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), that is correct.

My assistant has just done a translation for me, and you can have this, to help you through this tedious process.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for the one doing this quickly.  Wasn't there a witness protection issue there, Defence, in connection with the name of a Witness DG.  Don't you think you should strike that, Mr. Phillips? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, the issue really is that it doesn't become a witness protection issue unless attention is drawn to it.  On is own -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you see you just said the father of DG and then you told the name and that is the problem.  So we will have to strike that.

$CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, I'm going to continue asking you questions.  
Sir, is it your testimony, sir, that you, between 1976 and 1981, never visited the TRAFIPRO offices or shop in Kibuye préfecture?  Is that your testimony, sir?
@A.
Well, I said that from '76 to '81, I was head of the financial services at TRAFIPRO, but that I was not in charge of the stores, so that I therefore didn't go to the TRAFIPRO stories.  I did not go to those stores in Kibuye, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And can you tell me how many TRAFIPRO stores there were in Rwanda, sir?
@A.
I know that in each préfecture, there was at least one TRAFIPRO store, but I did not count, so I cannot give you a figure as such.  But in every préfecture, you had at least one store, sir, but there are other préfectures that had two stores.  Some even had three, especially the Kigali préfecture.  There was one at Kigali, one at Yamata (phonetic), one at Kabuga, so that it all depended on the level of activities of TRAFIPRO, in terms of its branch network.  I did not count.  Each year, one store would be opened here and there.  I did, really, not count.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you visit any other branches in any other préfectures apart from Kibuye or is it your answer that did you not visit any stores at all in the entire network?  Just yes or no, sir.
@A.
I'm saying that, perhaps except for the opening of one or the other stores, because one opened stores and there were inaugural ceremonies for the new stores that opened, and to those inaugural stores, everybody was invited.  But I did not go into any store for work.  I attended inaugural ceremonies for certain stores.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So did you attend the inaugural ceremony for the opening of the Kibuye store, sir?
@A.
No, sir, I didn't attend the inaugural ceremony of the Kibuye branch, because that was before I got to TRAFIPRO.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  When you were an intern at TRAFIPRO, what, in a nutshell, did your functions include, sir?
@A.
Well, I said that -- I did say so several times that I was an intern in the accountant's section of TRAFIPRO at Kabwaye (phonetic), so that my duties were to familiarise myself with the financial management of the company, that is, TRAFIPRO.  
I was studying management.  It was the university that had arranged my internship, just as for other students.  Mine was arranged with TRAFIPRO, and TRAFIPRO accepted me as an intern, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, moving on to the time when you worked for the Auditco (phonetic) firm, the think-tank consultant group, as you describe it, would I be correct in saying that you were primarily involved in auditing the accounts of companies whilst you embarked on these activities, sir?
@A.
Which companies are you referring to, Prosecutor?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm more interested in the firm that you worked for, Auditco.  Would I be correct in saying, sir, that your functions at that firm involved in auditing parastatals and companies, private companies, sir, auditing the accounts -- I'm sorry, of companies?
@A.
Yes, we were sent out to audit accounts, and we went out to the headquarters of the firm to audit the account books and then prepare reports.  And that was our main task, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Such activities, sir, of going out on to the field to various companies to audit their accounts, with a view to preparing a report, would last for how long, sir, a few weeks, a few months?  Can you help me with the time frame?
@A.
Well, it all depended on the magnitude of the work to be done.  When it was a big company, the accounts were quite sizeable and the operations were -- the accounts operations were many and multifarious, and it would require time, and we stayed for the time required.  But for a small company, for example, one could be there for one, two weeks, because we were a team of four to five people.  So that it all depended on the size and the magnitude and the volume of the accounting books that we had to peruse, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, sir, during your -- during the time you audited these companies, would I be correct in saying that you audited the accounts of a company called BRALIRWA?
@A.
No, we didn't work there.  Had we worked there at BRALIRWA, we would have reported on it.  But I know we didn't audit the accounts of BRALIRWA.  We did not audit that company's accounts.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, your decision to leave the civil service in 1991, you have described to us, was for personal reasons.  Would I be correct in saying that you had to resign your appointment with the Rwandan civil service because you had political ambitions and you couldn't combine your political ambitions with your position in the Rwandan civil service?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
@A.
That would not be correct, sir, what you are saying, because in '91, we didn't have any political ambitions as such.  In the country, as the parties were not there -- we were still under a single-party system; that was MRND.  And I left when the parties had not yet been created.  I left for personal reasons.  I was working at the ministry of planning, and at a certain time I realised that I had to leave the civil service to go into the private sector.  But it was not for political reasons, because there were no politics as such in the country, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it, therefore, a coincidence, sir, that you resigned your appointment in 1991, just around the time the multipartyism was introduced in the country?  Is that a coincidence, sir?  
@A.
Well, I resigned before the creation of the political parties in the country.  You want to talk about coincidence, sir, I really don't understand.  It was before that.  I didn't know what was going to come about, sir.  But when the political parties were created, everybody was interested.  But at the time I left the civil service, it was not the case.  It was for the purpose of moving into the private sector, for work in the private sector.  That is all, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And your work in the private sector, sir, lasted a few months, at most a year, sir, didn't it?
@A.
Not a month, because I left in '91 and I went back to the civil service by the end of '92, so that it was not a matter of one month or several months, at all.  It was a matter of approximately two years, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you say two years, sir?
@A.
I say I left in '91 and I went back into the civil service in '92.  It was around September '92, so that it was not a question of several months, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In actual fact, sir, when you returned to the ministry, you didn't return to the civil service, did you, sir?  You had a political appointment, which is not the same as returning to the civil service; is it, sir?
@A.
Because it was a question of decree that assigned me to the ministry of finance.  I believe that the decree was adopted within that framework of the civil service. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you also agree with me, sir, that you were there in your capacity as a member of the PSD, were you not, sir?
@A.
That is true, but it is all the same.  There was a decree that assigned me to that ministry.  Even if I was there as a representative of a party, it was in the service of state.  It was not the private sector.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, I want to talk to you now about your activities in the early part of May 1994.  And would I be correct in saying, sir, that you were not a member of the political bureau of the PSD party in April 1994?  Would I be correct in saying that?  Just yes or no.
@A.
That is correct, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I also be correct in saying that the PSD party had a reputation in April, before the events of 6th of April 1994, for being a moderate party; was it not, sir?
@A.
Even after that, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your own words, sir, you testified that the position of the PSD was to share power with other parties and not to discriminate against people based on different ethnic groups.  Do you recall telling us that, sir?
@A.
I said that there was no discrimination within the PSD party, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I see. 
@A.
I was referring to ethnic discrimination, of course.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And can you help me with this, just as a general matter.  How many Tutsi members of the National Congress became ministers in 1994, sir, to your knowledge?
@A.
Could you kindly repeat your question, Prosecutor?  You wanted to know how many Tutsi ministers were there?  How many people -- how many Tutsi became ministers in 1994?  What dates are you referring to?  Are you referring to the interim government or something else?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My question to you, sir, was how many Tutsi members of the National Congress became members of the interim government in 1994, in April of 1994, sir?
@A.
None, sir, none that I know of.  The three persons that joined the government, as far as I am concerned, were Hutu, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Several of your witnesses, sir, have testified in this courtroom that there was no split amongst the membership of the PSD party prior to the genocide.  Do you confirm that, sir?
@A.
I do confirm that, because I didn't see any splinter groups.  I do confirm that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, if I look at the discussions and interviews you had with investigators from my office, from 1997 -- 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In there, sir -- and I just want to very briefly refer to it because we have a lot to get through -- you say there that at certain moments -- you start off by telling us the PSD was in opposition.  But then you say that, "At certain moments, there were problems within our parties, and in other parties certain members were accused of being too-RPF, whilst others were accused of rapprochement with the MRND."  Do you see that there, sir?  
And then you carry on --
@A.
Yes, I do see it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Skip two lines.  And then you state there that, "Our party was affected by the problem of division."  Do you see that there, sir?  And then you go on to the people who were killed.  Do you still maintain your position, sir, that all was well within the PSD, sir?
@A.
Mr. President, I did say that I did not recognise the entire content of the document, because those that prepared this document never allowed me the opportunity of reading the document for possible correction of things I did not say.  I cannot, therefore, take it that this was my point of view at the time we had the interviews with the investigators.  
The investigators worked with us for two, three years, 1996, '97, '98, but at no time did they afford me the opportunity of reviewing their recordings or their manuscripts, if there were any.  So that I do not know whether I did say -- I did make such utterances.  
I know it was a question of opposition parties, but to say that there was a division into two, MRND or PR (sic), it would be tantamount to my making a mistake.  If I were to state that that party had been divided into two, whereas that was not the case -- I know that ministers were proposed to serve in the government from that party.  There was no other group from that party that proposed other members, as was the case for the MR -- MDR or PR.  So that I cannot say that I made such an utterance, because I had no grounds for that in view of the fact that there was no division at all, as far as I was concerned, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have to make a representation to the Court, Your Honour.  I seek the Court's indulgence.  I'm sure the witness can answer my question in a lot more concise manner than he currently is doing.  I have a lot to get through.  If he doesn't agree with the document, he simply has to tell me he doesn't agree, and we move on.  This long speech business is not doing us any good, and it is certainly obstructing his cross-examination, Your Honour.  If he kindly could take note.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, I listened to you also during the examination-in-chief that your answers were sometimes eloquent and long.  So this is nothing new; this is the way you respond to questions.  But if you could bear that in mind, please.  If you could be a little bit briefer in your answers, please. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, thank you for that. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, in your speech on the 3rd of May 1994 -- that's Prosecution Exhibit 30, if the registry has it to hand to you.  I'm going to read you a sentence there, on page 13 of the English version.  And it is just one line.  
You stated, or you are reported to have stated, referring to the RPF, "They secured accomplices in the main political parties and caused these parties to split."  
Do you recall mentioning that in your speech, sir?  Just yes or no. 
@A.
I do not even recognise such utterances.  I do not recognise them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Let's move on, then, to something entirely different.  
Sir, we're now in April 1994, the beginning of it.  You testified that you were in hiding, sir, because you belonged to a party that was pro-RPF, didn't you, sir?  Do you recall saying that in this courtroom, sir?
@A.
Yes, I remember saying that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And is it your testimony that you were indeed a threat despite the fact that you did not feature in the political bureau of the PSD at the time, sir?
@A.
You said that I have to be brief and not give lengthy explanations.  But practically all the members of the PSD at that time, throughout the entire country, were threatened.  Some were killed.  Many were killed.  I wasn't the only under threat.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you were in constant telephone contact, weren't you not, sir, with your friend Rafiki Nsengiyumva, on the 6th, 7th of April, sir?
@A.
The 6th and 7th of April, yes, indeed, I was in contact with him.  I was in touch with him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And Rafiki Nsengiyumva was friends with Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, wasn't he, sir?
@A.
I don't know.  I have no idea.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that despite everything that had happened, or that was happening in Kigali on the 7th of April, Colonel Bagosora just happened to find his way to Nsengiyumva's house, without any prior knowledge of either Rafiki or, indeed, that resident, sir?
@A.
I don't know.  I don't know whether or not he knew about Rafiki's house.  I never said that.  I have no idea.  But as I said here, he did indeed come to Rafiki's house.  But I didn't say whether or not they knew each other.  I don't know where you are getting that information from.  I don't know whether or not they knew each other.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it not the case, sir, that you were aware that Colonel Bagosora would turn up at Rafiki's house, hence the reason why you positioned yourself at that location, sir?
@A.
No, I didn't know that Bagosora was going to go to Rafiki's.  I had no idea.  I went to Rafiki's house seeking shelter.  There was no other reason.  I didn't know if someone was supposed to go there.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You and Rafiki, sir, held exactly the same position in the government at that time.  Why was Rafiki more better protected than you were, sir, if it wasn't his relationship with Bagosora?
@A.
I don't know how to answer that question.  I told you I went to Rafiki's house.  The neighbourhood where I was, was the theatre of combat.  Rafiki, who lived on another hilltop in front of mine, he was in a place that was safer, and I went there for safety reasons.  I don't know how you're saying he was better protected than I.  I didn't see him benefiting from any special protection.  I went for safety reasons, but there were still security fears.  I was fleeing as I was on my way to his house.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir.  Now let's move on to something slightly different.  
Sir, how much contact did you have with your then immediate boss, Mark Muganera, on the 7th of April?  How much contact did you have with this man, sir?
@A.
You are speaking of the minister; is that correct?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct, sir.
@A.
What type of contact do you mean?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, you happen to have phoned everybody else.  I just wondered whether you phoned him too, sir.  Telephone contact, physical contact, did you find out where your boss was?  That sort of thing, sir. 
@A.
Okay, I understand.  No, I did not call him.  I didn't call him.  I called Rafiki, but I did not call the minister.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Why not, sir?  He was your boss, after all, sir.
@A.
It's not an issue of whether or not he was my boss to ask for help.  I asked for help from someone who was closer to me, and Rafiki was closer. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I didn't ask you to make any reference to help, sir.  I just wanted to know whether you cared enough about his welfare, sir.  I would do that for my boss. 
@A.
I didn't do it.  I thought of calling someone who would accept to take me in and protect me.  I didn't think of all these hierarchy issues or the fact that he was my boss.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, what position -- sorry, who was Rafiki's boss at the time, sir, at the ministry of public works, on the 7th of April 1994?
@A.
Rafiki was the director of cabinet of the ministry of public works.  He didn't have a boss at that time.  The minister of public works, Félicien Gatabazi, had been killed in February of that same year.  He had been assassinated, and a replacement had not yet at that time been appointed.  Rafiki was the interim minister.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Would I be correct in saying that, having arrived at the MINADEF building, the meeting that was convened was to enable party leaders to elect from amongst themselves those who would represent those political parties in the interim government?  Is that a fair assumption as to the purpose of the first meeting at MINADEF on the 8th of April, sir?
@A.
The meeting I knew of was that which was held on the 8th, the 8th of April.  The purpose of that meeting was to set up an interim government. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the question I asked you, sir, was a little bit more pointed.  Wasn't it the case that it was to enable party leaders to select members of that government?
@A.
That is what we found.  When we arrived, we found the leaders of the political parties there.  They were convened to set up the interim government.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But if you were not a national leader of the PSD, how come you were allowed to accompany Bagosora and Rafiki to the meeting, sir?
@A.
Why did I go with Bagosora and Rafiki?  Well, I told this Chamber that Rafiki asked me to go with him, and that he had spoken about that with Bagosora.  That is what I stated before this Chamber.  That is very clear.  Rafiki asked me to go with him.  He told me that he had just been invited to participate in a meeting, a meeting convening the political parties, so he asked me to accompany him.  Nobody else did.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So is it your testimony, sir, that Rafiki had, on the 7th or 8th of April, conferred on you some status within the PSD party that was over and above what you actually had, by asking you to go to that meeting, sir?  You were not a member of the politburo, were you, sir?
@A.
I was not a member of the politburo.  I confirm that.  But Rafiki asked me to go with him, with him to the ministry of defence.  He was told that a meeting of the political parties was being held there.  
I don't see why questions should arise out of this.  Perhaps you can invite Rafiki before this Chamber to tell you why.  "Why Ndindabahizi?  Since he wasn't a member of the politburo, why did you ask him to go with you?"  That is for him to answer.  
At any rate, you asked me to be brief.  And I even said before this Chamber, Rafiki had closed up his house.  Even if he hadn't told me to come with him, I don't know how I could have gone out of Kigali, because it was a difficult situation there, and when he asked me to go with him, I accepted his invitation.  Whether or not I committed an error in doing so, that is an entirely different question.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, isn't it the case, sir, that as far as the -- as far as occupying the three positions, the three ministerial positions that were allocated to the PSD was concerned, there wasn't much of a choice of candidates, was there, sir?  The entire hierarchy of the party had been eliminated, sir, and you knew that, didn't you, sir?
@A.
Counsel, which hierarchy are you speaking of?  Which hierarchy?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Those who should have been attending that meeting, members of the politburo other than yourself.  They were dead, were they not, sir?  Party chairman, first secretary, general-secretary, second secretary, they were all dead, were they not, sir?
@A.
That is correct.  They would have been the ones who would have gone to that meeting had it not been for their death.  Normally, the politburo, or the committee of the politburo, composed of three persons, had those persons been there, they would have been at that meeting, because they are the spokesmen of the party. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you were aware that they had all been killed before you went to that meeting, sir, or fled?
@A.
I didn't know.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So is it your testimony, sir, that the first time you found out that most of the members of the politburo had been assassinated or had fled was when you arrived at MINADEF on the 8th of April at 
three o'clock?
@A.
That is indeed what I said before this Chamber, yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
But is that the truth, sir?
@A.
Yes, it's the truth.  That is where we learned that either they had been killed or that they couldn't be found; they disappeared.  At the ministry of defence we learned that.  That is where I learned it, at least, and those who were around me learned it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it was Mugenzi who told you that, not Bagosora, sir; is that your testimony?
@A.
Bagosora did not go inside the ministry.  It was the people who were inside the ministry.  Bagosora was not in that meeting, inside.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, let me ask you this.  If Bagosora had felt that you were a threat or indeed an RPF sympathiser, do you think he would have agreed that you accompanied himself and Rafiki to that location at MINADEF?  If he had any doubt as to where your loyalties were at that time, would he be so willing to take a risk, sir?
@A.
I won't speculate, Counsel.  You want me to speculate what -- you want me to speculate about what Bagosora thinks of me.  I went to the meeting.  I accompanied Rafiki because he asked me to, and I did so.  But asking me what Bagosora thinks of people, that is entirely different, Counsel.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Let's move on.  Now, you had subsequently on the 8th of -- actually, before we go to 
that -- when you arrived at the MINADEF at three o'clock on the 8th of April, you found some people there, didn't you, sir?
@A.
Yes, that is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In fact, when I look at page 2, tab 4, of Prosecution Exhibit 25, you listed for those interviewing you the names of some party representatives who you claim you saw at that location.  Do you still have Prosecution Exhibit 25 with you, sir?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you please make sure he has it.  It is on page 2 of the English.  It is just a list of names.

@A.
Yes, I saw him there.

Karamira, for the record, is spelt K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
All right. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, I'm not going to -- I just want to refer the Court to this page.  And rather than read everything that is there, I would represent to you, sir, that as at 1993, the man Karamira was a well-known extremist, a proponent of Hutu Power; was he not, sir?  Just a yes or no for now, sir. 
@A.
I have the document in French.  What page is it on, Counsel?  Which page in the French version of the report -- of Alison Des Forges's report?  Which page in French? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We'll come to pages in a minute, sir.  For now I am asking you a very general question about the man Karamira.  Now, would I be correct in saying that as of October 1993, Karamira had made several -- had made several pronouncements on his views of the concept of Hutu Power, the well-known concept, on the radio, in newspapers?  Would you agree with me that he was known for his stand?
@A.
I would say I'm a member of the PSD; I don't think it is necessary for you to ask me questions about what was going on in other parties.  Ask me questions that regard myself.  Don't ask me to speculate about what was going on elsewhere in other parties.  I don't know on which date, or starting on which date, or up until which date Karamira was or wasn't an extremist.  I don't know.  
What do you want to know?  Counsel, I'm accused of having committed crimes in the préfecture of Kibuye.  You are asking me questions regarding politics within the Rwandan political parties in 1994.  Please ask me questions about the subjects for which I am here.  Thank you, Counsel.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Karamira refers to Hutu moderates, like Twagiramungu, as puppets of the RPF.  He talks about unifying into one effective Hutu mass -- stand up, take appropriate action; help look for what is within us, the concept of Hutu solidarity and the need to avoid fighting one another.  Now, this is a man who was seated in a meeting where you turned up and agreed to be part of the government; was he not, sir?  Just yes or no. 
@A.
There is no need to answer yes or no to that question.  I was brought here to explain myself.  I was not a member of the MDR.  And I told you that I could not answer questions about that party, on behalf of that party.  I will not speculate here.  I don't know.  I don't know about how those people behaved.  I don't even know if Karamira was a Hutu.  Some people even said he was a Tutsi.  That you can verify, but I don't want to speculate here.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Donat Murego, Edouard Karemera, Justin Mugenzi, what did you know about these men before you went into that meeting, sir?  Is it not the case that these were Hutu hard-liners, and you knew that, sir; didn't you, sir?  
@A.
Listen, let me say the same thing again, the same answer.  Please do not push me into characterising the leaders of the other parties that were at the PSD.  I have no adjectives to tag on these people.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Let's move on.  The next day -- but before that, you went to another meeting, didn't you, sir, the crisis committee?  You had a meeting with them at the military academy; did you not, sir?
@A.
In the afternoon, yes, that is towards the evening when we left the ministry of defence.  I believe we met at the military academy, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
A "yes" would have done very nicely to my question.  Who chaired that meeting?
@A.
There was -- there were two high-ranking military officers, General Ndindiliyimana and Colonel Bagosora, and then there was also Ngirumpatse, Mathieu.  Those were the most high-ranking personalities.  But who chaired, it was Ndindiliyimana or Bagosora.  I don't remember precisely who chaired.  It was one of them, at any rate.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it a well-established fact that Bagosora chaired the crisis committee?  I mean, isn't it?  And you know it too, don't you, sir?
@A.
Yes, but at that meeting there was also General Ndindiliyimana.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Let's go to the 9th of April, sir.  The morning of the 9th, you were sworn in as a minister.  You say you were the last to be sworn in; that's correct, isn't it, sir?
@A.
This is what I did say if my recollection is correct, yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, can the witness be shown Prosecution Exhibit No. 2, and can the Court turn with me now to Prosecution Exhibit No. 2.  On the back of Prosecution Exhibit No. 2 is the constitution of the Republic of Rwanda, which I need to refer to, and I am particularly interested in Article 56 of that constitution, Article 56 of the Constitution of Rwanda. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, sir, the oath that you took on the morning of the 9th of April was the following, was it not, something to the effect of, "I pledge to loyally carry out my duties and be faithful to the Republic of Rwanda, the head of state and, most importantly, to promote the interest of the Rwandan people."  You must have said something to that effect, didn't you, sir, following the provisions of Article 56?

Now, whilst we still have the constitution open, can everyone flip with me to Article 35 of that constitution, which is perhaps some two or three pages before.  No, it is six pages on the reverse, to the back, Article 35.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Isn't it the case, sir, that by virtue of Article 35 of the Constitution of Rwanda, on the 10th July 1991, which was in operation at the time, sir, executive power was exercised by the president of the republic, who was then assisted by the government, and the government is described as being composed as the prime minister and the minister.  Is that not what Article 35 says, sir?
@A.
C'est ça.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  The head of state at the time was Sindikubwabo, was he not, sir, after the 9th of April?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is this the same man that your witness, Witness DN, Delta, November, would later testify in this courtroom, came to the préfecture of Kibuye in May 1994, to thank and congratulate the population of Kibuye for the crimes that had taken place? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And I refer to page 17 of the transcripts of 4th November 2003 in this courtroom.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Well, I was not at that hearing.  That was chaired by the president in Kibuye.  I cannot, therefore, tell you that he made any utterances to the people of Kibuye.  I'm not in a position to do so, because I do not have the speech you are referring to before me.  I was not at that gathering.  Well, I know that the president of the republic did go to Kibuye.  That I do know.  But for commending people -- I was not with him.  I do not know the circumstances under which he spoke.  I cannot interpret the statement you have just made. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, I never asked you to interpret his statement.  I just asked you if it was the same man, Sindikubwabo, who was the president of the country at the time.  Just a simple yes-or-no answer would have done.  I knew you went there.  I would have never asked to you comment on it.
@A.
Between April and July there was no president.  We did not have any president. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sindikubwabo was who, then?  Who was he?
@A.
He was president of the republic.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So was it a different Sindikubwabo who made the speech in Kibuye, sir, in May 1994, or was it the same president of the republic?  Just yes or no, sir.
@A.
Listen, I have answered that I was not in attendance at that meeting.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, let's talk about the activities of the government which you had become a member of on the 9th of April 1994.  Are you with me, sir?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, one of the goals of that government had to be the need to fight the common enemy, the RPF; wasn't it, sir?
@A.
Where are you reading that from?  Could you give me that document, because I know that there was a document that was signed by the political parties that established that government.  There was a document.  There was a document spelling out the purpose of the government.  Could you serve me with that document?  Because what you have just said, I do not know whether it does appear in that document as one of the objectives of that government.  There were three objectives.  I should like to know whether the objective that you just mentioned is in that document, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Why don't you tell me what the objectives were.  You were there, I wasn't.  You tell us, then, what were the three objectives of the government.  Let's deal with this that way, sir.
@A.
Yes, because you asked me.  You yourself quoted me one of the objectives, and I was asking you to point out in what part of the document that objective appeared, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  At least we agree that there was a need to fight the common enemy.  
Now, from the 9th of April, in light of the provisions of Article 35 that I just read out to you, would you agree with me, sir, that it was the job of the prime minister to determine the nature and scope and the duties of the ministers and their departments?  That role was the obligation of the prime minister at the time.  He would determine the duties of the ministers, as well as the scope and nature of their government department, under the authority of those ministers; wasn't it, sir?
@A.
I did not -- I do not have before me a document that has the attributions of the prime minister.  If you have that document, may I see it, so I can make a response.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you refusing to answer my question, sir?
@A.
No, I am not refusing to answer your question.  But you seem to be reading out certain things from a document that I do not have, and you want me to endorse what you are saying.  And as I do not know the document by heart, or the attributions of the prime minister, and how many ministers were there, and how many attributions were there of the prime minister, I wanted you to share the information with me so that we could shed light on this issue for the purposes of the Tribunal.  Let us do so knowledgably.  How can I make an explanation without a document?  May I have the document, because when I came to this stand, I did not come with any documents, myself.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You were the minister, sir, not me, sir.  Are you refusing to tell us what the goals of the government you served in was without a document, sir?  Is that what you say? 
@A.
That is not the question that you put to me.  You told me what you believe was one of the objectives of the government; that is, to fight what you've called the "common enemy".  I am saying that I am not aware of that objective, that I know that there were objectives.  
Now, if you may, one of the objectives that was, I believe, the first objective, the primary objective, was to establish contact, rather, with the RPF for the purpose of restoring peace in the country.  It was not to gang up, to fight the enemy.  We, rather, wanted to approach the RPF so that altogether the government and the RPF restore peace in the country.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, for --
@A.
That was one of the objectives. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What was the second objective, sir?
@A.
There were also problems of hunger and famine in the country.  And it was one of the objectives of the government.  Of course, there was also the question of the management of the country, the management of the government and the country.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right, sir, let's go to the 9th and 10th of April very quickly.  You had council of ministers meetings, is that not correct, to obtain information on the security situation?  Yes or no, sir.
@A.
Which dates are you referring to?  You are talking about the 9th and the 10th.  Which particular date, Prosecutor?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Both dates.  On the 9th and 10th you had meetings.  Just a yes or no.
@A.
Yes, yes, we did hold a meeting or meetings in which the purpose of the exercise consisted in trying to restore security in the country because there was violence, especially in the city of Kigali.  And it was required, I do remember, of the minister responsible for law and order -- that's the home affairs minister -- the defence minister, and the minister of justice, were required, were required to -- especially those two ministers, they were required to endeavour to restore safety and security, especially in the city of Kigali, sir.

Thank you.  Did the government issue any directives to stop the massacres at that meeting, sir, to the best of your recollection?  Just yes or no.
@A.
We were talking about the 10th.  We were talking about the 11th, so that the 9th, the 10th -- I think on the 10th, the préfets of the various préfectures who were summoned, they came Kigali on the 11th and were instructed to go back and ensure that security is restored and kept in their various préfecture.  So that there was a meeting between the préfet and the government on the 11th of April to discuss the situation of security that had obtained in the country, and, of course, the trouble that was rife at the same time in the country.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it your testimony, sir, that a directive was issued to those préfets to go back to stop the killing, sir, on the 11th?
@A.
On the 11th at that meeting, yes, if the minutes of that meeting do exist.  I do not have such minutes, but I know that verbal directives were made and the prime minister promised to produce written directives subsequently, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your interview on the 30th of November, you briefly say, "The matters for discussion were the exchange of information and the measures to be put in place." 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You will find that on page 3 of tab 4.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, since you are convinced that there was a directive issued to stop the killings, then, I take it that the killings stopped, did they, sir?
@A.
Well, listen, I cannot tell you that the killing stopped.  I was not there; I was not in the country to be able to say where the killings took place.  I don't know.  All I know is that instructions were issued at the end of the month of April.  They were distributed to all préfectures.  But my duties as minister of finance did not enable me to visit the various préfectures to know what was happening in the various préfectures and how the various instructions were being carried out.  I know that as far as Kigali is concerned, when we left on the 12th of April, there was fire and brimstone in the city.  The RPF came out as early as the 7th of April in the afternoon, and fighting was rife throughout the country.  So that we went out to Gitarama to settle down there.  
How can I tell you that the killing stopped?  Whereas there was fighting all around in Ruhengeri, Byumba, Kigoma préfectures.  I do not know.  Ask me about something that I can answer to.  Could you be more precise, more accurate, more pointed?  
Perhaps the minister for home affairs could give you more adequate answers -- he's here -- or the minister of justice or the minister of defence.  But the minister of finance, I'm afraid it is difficult for him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Is it true, sir, that some préfets were accused of inactivity at the meeting of 11th April 1994?
@A.
I don't know.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, do you have any knowledge whether or not the préfet of Butare, who did not attend the meeting, as you say in your interview, was ever dismissed from his position, sir, in April 1994, by the government?
@A.
Well, I was in at the meeting which dismissed him.  He was dismissed, but he was not dismissed because he did not come to the meeting.  That was not what we were told. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I didn't say because you didn't come to the meeting.  I asked you if he was dismissed for his inactivity.  Is that not the case?
@A.
No, that is not what we were told.  I was at the meeting and that was not what we were told as being the reason for his dismissal.  That is the reason given to us by his political party, because the préfets were appointed, or nominated, by the political parties.  The political parties -- I mean, the préfets couldn't just be dismissed like that.  It is the political parties that nominate their préfets.  And if a political party doesn't nominate you, it is up to the political party.  That is the decision of the political party, not the government.  The government applies or carries out the decisions of the party, as far as préfets are concerned, at any rate, ever since the first multiparty government, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very quickly, Mr. Ndindabahizi, let's move now to your journey to Gitarama.  Now, is it your testimony, sir, that you had to find your own means to travel from Kigali to Gitarama on the 12th of April, sir?  You were left to your own devices?
@A.
Yes.  Not my own means, actually, because a vehicle did not belong to me.  The vehicle I used did not belong to me.  You should, rather, say that I did not have any means, and I had to sort out some means.  I said so here.  That was the case.  I was left to sort myself out.  Who said so?  
When I got to the Hôtel des Diplomates, everybody had left.  Nobody said, "Look, we should meet for this or that purpose."  I fended for myself.  I tried to sort myself out, even to go and get my wife -- fetch my wife, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So what, then, was the point of keeping all the ministers at the Hôtel des Diplomates from the 8th, if people were free to walk about on their own on the 9th -- or the 12th, rather?  Why keep you at the Hôtel des Diplomates?  Why afford you that security, sir?
@A.
Did I talk about the night?  Did I say that we left during the night?  I did not say we left during the night.  It was in the morning at about nine, ten o'clock in the morning of the 12th that we left.  It was in the morning.  And the reason given to us -- that is when we left Kigali.  At the Hôtel des Diplomates, we were told that the city of Kigali was surrounded by RPF troops, and that the danger was that we would be trapped in the city.  And this is what was explained to us when we got to Gitarama.  But to say that the ministers stayed at the Hôtel des Diplomates, I do not know how many ministers spent the night at the Hôtel des Diplomates, because some of them had gone elsewhere and fled elsewhere.  They had come for the swearing-in exercise, but they were not there at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 9th of April.  When we left, we left on the 12th for Gitarama, and that was during the day, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Having arrived at Gitarama, sir, how regular or how often did the cabinet meet, sir?  Every week?  Every day?  Could you help me with that sort of number, sir?
@A.
When we arrived at Gitarama, we went to Murambi for accommodation.  We used the premises of Murambi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
$Microphone inactivated) when the government met.  Very straightforward question, sir.  Cabinet meetings. 
@A.
It was almost every day.  Almost every day, if not every day.  Everyday there was a meeting.  If it was not for everybody, it was for some people, because at one given time some of them had left the country.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you very much.  Now, would I be correct in saying that at those meetings, at least once a month, the cabinet received reports from the préfectures in relation to the security situation at the préfecture. Through the minister of interior? 
@A.
Well, listen, at that time, there was no minister for home affairs.  The minister for home affairs was appointed on the 25th of May 1994, I believe.  It was the prime minister who was responsible for that ministry, as far as I could recollect.  If there were any reports that were to be prepared, despite the -- should have been despite (sic) to the prime minister, there was no minister for home affairs at that time.  He did not want to return to the country following the death of President Habyarimana.  He was abroad, but he did not come home, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, there was a director of cabinet in charge of the minister of interior, was there not, sir, at the time?
@A.
Well, the director of cabinet doesn't sit at cabinet meetings.  The director of cabinet, even if he was there, was responsible for communicating information to the prime minister, who ran that particular ministry, who had no minister at the time, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's precisely what I said.  I said, were those reports not transmitted to the prime minister through the ministry of interior?  Is that not the case, sir?  Forget about the personalities, now.  
I take that as a "yes". 
@A.
What is your precise question?  I don't see your question clearly.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let's take it again.  The cabinet met every day, you said.  Now, during those meetings, did there come a time when cabinet members, council of ministers, received reports from the various préfectures in the country; yes or no?
@A.
I would not say yes or no, sir.  Let me explain to you.  Now, those reports, if there were any, were not discussed at the cabinet meetings.  The prime minister had appointed a committee, a committee of ministers, certain ministers responsible for overseeing or studying those reports whenever those reports were sent in.  So that there was a group of ministers, appointed by the prime minister, who were responsible for the study of such reports.  That committee was chaired by Kambanda himself, and there was his intelligence service; there was the minister of justice; there was the minister of defence, among other ministers.  So that those ministers were responsible for those reports.  There was no discussion in cabinet.  There was a special committee chaired by Kambanda.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
All you seek to do in all your answers to my questions, sir, you are so preoccupied, sir, are you not, with removing yourself from the activities of the cabinet, that even what you should give me a very simple answer to, you go on telling us how other people were involved.  I just wanted to know whether or not security reports were delivered to the cabinet meetings; yes or no. 
@A.
I told you that I did not see, and that there were other people dealing with it.  I was involved with my own activities, my own responsibilities.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  That would suffice.  Now, there were, in the month of April and May, certain changes to the administrative structure and personnel, administrative personnel in Rwanda, to the administrative and to the military personnel.  Now, do you know why the interim chief of staff of the armed forces was replaced by Augustin Bizimungu, a man called Marcel Gatsinzi?  Why was that man replaced on 
April 16th 1994 by the government?
@A.
Yes, I was at that meeting.  The ministry of defence made proposals.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, would I be correct in saying that at the time the ministry of defence thought that Bizimungu was much harsher in his attitude towards Tutsi than Gatsinzi was?  Would I be correct in saying that?  Just you either agree or you don't, sir.  No long speeches, please.
@A.
That I cannot know.  That is the only way I can answer that, Counsel.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, administrative changes.  The préfet of Butare, we've talked about him, a man called Jean-Baptist Habyarimana, H-A-B-Y-A-R-I-M-A-N-A, and another man, Ruzindana, Godfrey Ruzindana of  Kibungo, they were also replaced by the government on the 17th of April, whilst you were in Gitarama.  Do you know why those officials were replaced, sir?  Can you help us with that?
@A.
I can explain, because I was in that meeting when the decision was made to replace them.  I'd say that the préfets represent political parties.  So if someone is a préfet, his party puts his name forward.  In April 1994, the PL party requested that the préfecture -- that the préfet in its préfecture be transferred, that its préfet represented should be transferred.  It was in Butare.  The PL party wanted, instead of Butare, Kibungo.  
The préfet in Kibungo was a PSD.  The president -- or the chairman, rather, of the PL party explained that he had agreed with the chairman of PSD, François Ndungutse, to change, to swap préfectures.  Kibungo would go to the PL and Butare to the PSD.  The reason for that was that Butare had many PSD members.  The PL chairman believed that most of his members were in Kibungo préfecture, so he asked for that swap to be made.  He presented the case to the government, and the government did not object.  
So the préfet -- well, Kibungo, the préfet of Kibungo, was not chased out, but préfets have to be 
from -- a native of that préfecture.  They needed someone native to Kibungo.  The PSD needed to look for someone from Butare to replace Habyarimana.  So, Kibungo, it was automatic, there was no problem.  He left his post, and there was another person from Kibungo who was just appointed.  That is what I know, and that is how things happened.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So to your mind, it had nothing to do with the fact that these two men were protecting Tutsi in their préfecture?  Simple yes or no.
@A.
Listen, I'm telling you about the reasons that were put forth during the government meetings.  But I'm not in people's heads to know what is going on, to know what they are thinking.  The official reasons advanced were the ones I have just explained.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The situation in Gitarama, sir, let's move on very quickly now.  Gitarama, where the government was at the time, Préfet Fidele, that you saw in Kibuye, now, he was having problems, was he not, and he brought those problems to the attention of the government, did he not?  Was the government able to help him, to your knowledge, and if so, why did he flee to Kibuye and was subsequently replaced?  Can you help me with that, sir?
@A.
Yes, I will do so very willingly.  I knew the préfet very well, because he welcomed my family whilst the government was in Gitarama.  I told you that he gave his children over for me to watch, in June.  So I do know what kind of problems he was having.  That préfet had political problems, mostly problems of competition between the parties.  Gitarama was a majority of MDR supporters.  The MRND, which was at the heart of his problems, wanted to take advantage of an opportunity to recuperate that préfecture.  There was a list of persons who had to be replaced.  That was during the meeting of 
17th April 1994, when the Butare and Kibungo préfets were replaced.  It did not succeed.  
That préfet continued to be préfet of Gitarama, but people were accusing him of belonging to the MDR wing that was pro-RPF, and those people were saying that he had to go. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, let me stop you.  I'm sure you are being terribly helpful to the Court, but let me ask my question in another way.  To your mind, to the best of your knowledge, was the préfet of Gitarama, who had requested assistance from the interim government, was he assisted in the way he had expected?  Did he get the reinforcements that he requested for, and did the killing of Tutsis stop, as he had requested?  Just a simple yes or no, to the best of your knowledge. 
@A.
I was not aware of his request for assistance to the government.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, you have talked about certain directives that were issued by the government to stop the massacres.  Can you tell me what those directives were?
@A.
There's the directive of the 27th of April, made by the prime minister.  It was published.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let me stop you there.  Now, is this the directive on pacification?  Are we talking about the same thing?
@A.
Yes.  There's no other.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, in your interview of 30th November, you talk about having embarked on some public awareness campaigns.  Is this the same thing as the pacification meeting -- just need clarification on that -- or did you mean something else?
@A.
On which page, Counsel?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In English --
@A.
The 13th? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you look at Prosecution Exhibit 25, page 4 in English, tab 4, you talk about some -- in the first paragraph there.  Well, if you just tell me, do you recall saying that you embarked on some public awareness campaigns to Kibuye and Gikongoro?  Do you recall saying that?
@A.
On which page, Counsel?  I'm not sure where you are referring to.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Page 4, tab 4. 
@A.
This is in English, Counsel. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, if you look at page 3 of the French, in the middle.  Sir, it is a very simple question I've asked you.  You either went on these missions or you didn't.
@A.
Where?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you go to Kibuye and Gikongoro in April or May 1994, sir?  Let us deal with this matter this way.
@A.
Yes, I went to Gikongoro and I went to Kibuye.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Maybe I actually confused you to look at the notes.  
Now, let's talk about the directive itself, the directive issued on the 27th of April.  Now, why was this directive needed, very briefly, if you know?
@A.
It's because of the disturbances that existed in the country.  There were disturbances.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And to the best of your knowledge, was this directive issued as a follow-up to the meeting with the préfets on the 11th of April, sir?  Or did the directive have nothing to do with the meeting with the préfets on the 11th, as far as you know?
@A.
I remember the prime minister promised to put out that directive, after consultation with the préfets on the 11th of April.  He promised to put out that directive.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, did the directive, the publication of the directive, did it reduce the massacres, to your knowledge?  Did it have that effect, sir?  Just yes or no. 
@A.
It would be difficult for me to say yes or no.  There was no evaluation or assessment in the field of what happened before or after that directive was published.  The fact remains, when that directive came out, and when the missions were sent out to the préfectures, the massacres diminished.  
I'll give you an example.  When we were in Kibuye, the bourgmestre of Mabanza, when he returned, he had the instructions, he held meetings with the population, and it seems that after that the results were good.  This is Bagilishema.  I read that information in the documents from the Tribunal.  And according to what he says and what happened in his commune, it worked.  There was a positive result.

$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So what was the use of issuing a document for classification at the end of the month of April when most of the massacres had occurred within the first two weeks of April?  What was the point of doing that, to your mind?
@A.
Counsel, I'll answer that in the following manner.  The prime minister had promised that document on the 11th of April.  That document was supposed to be published that day.  That is when he promised to do so.  Why did it come out two weeks later?  It's because Kambanda had to explain -- his office and himself had to develop and sign that document.  So, that tardiness should be explained by the person who was to sign and develop that document.  That is the only explanation that I can give you, Counsel.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, you, yourself, then went on -- you led the first delegation to Gikongoro.  When did you embark on that mission, sir, and why?
@A.
Who told you that I led the delegation to Gikongoro?  Kambanda himself led the delegation.  He led the mission.  I was not in charge of the mission in Gikongoro, nor was I in Kibuye.  I was a member of the delegation.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You were a member of the delegation.  What qualified you to be a member of the delegation, the classification delegation to Gikongoro?  Were you from Gikongoro?
@A.
I am not a native of Gikongoro.  However, the government had planned the missions trying to assign people to different areas, and I was assigned.  That is all.  I wasn't the only one.  There were other people, natives of other préfectures.  One was from Ruhengeri.  That is how it was done.  We were told, "You will be going to such and such a place with such and such a team.  You will be going to Kibuye.  You will go to Gikongoro, et cetera."  We had no choice.  People didn't have a choice as to where they would go on those missions.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You were being too loyal to cause and contrary, were you not, sir?  A fair assumption to make?
@A.
I don't understand what you mean, counsel, I don't understand what you mean.  What do you mean, "loyal"?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We'll go on, sir.  Now, the PSD is very heavily represented in Gikongoro, is it not, sir?  It has a substantial reputation, four or five communes there, sir? 
@A.
I know that the chairman of the PSD is a native of that préfecture; that is to say Gikongoro, but I don't know how many bourgmestres from the PSD were in that region.  I know that there were elections in the communal committees amongst the population, and the PSD had won some of those elections, but I don't know whether or not it was four or five.  That, I don't know.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Wasn't it the case that it was your compatriots that you had stopped to pick on the 7th of April?  A man called François Ndungutse that later became the chairman of the PSD party; is that not correct, sir?  The man that you picked up with Rafiki?
@A.
That is correct.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And he is the one that came from Gikongoro; is that not the case, sir?
@A.
No, he's a native of Butare.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right.  Now, if you look at Prosecution Exhibit 23.  You may not -- if you have it to hand, but if not, it's not terribly important.  It is a little map, it has colours on it.  There are four areas there that show that the PSD's  represented in 30 per cent of that préfecture, some four communes?  Would that be accurate, in your recollection?
@A.
Thirty per cent of what, Counsel?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thirty per cent of the préfecture, or 20 per cent, 25 per cent.
@A.
Do you mean 30 per cent of the bourgmestres?  Thirty per cent of the bourgmestres, not of the population.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I stand corrected.  Yes, it is the map concerning bourgmestres.  That's correct, yes, the bourgmestres.  30 per cent of the communes are represented by bourgmestres from the PSD; is that not so?  Four communes, anyway, on our map?  It's not terribly important if you don't agree.  Do you see that, sir?  Can we move on if you have doubts about it?
@A.
No, I've got the map before me.  Now that I've got it before me, what is your exact question, Counsel?  What is your question about this map?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm actually trying to find out whether or not the areas we've indicated as having bourgmestres from the PSD in that préfecture was, indeed, the case, to your knowledge.  And if you don't know, just say so?
@A.
Well, listen, I don't know how many bourgmestres there were in Gikongoro, but if the person who made this map knows that these communes were headed by the PSD, perhaps that person might be able to tell you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let's look over that map, to the left of the map, now, where it says "Kibuye".  Can you see Gitesi commune there, sir?
@A.
Yes, I can see Gitesi commune.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Please remember that we once -- we know -- we all know, at the time, the bourgmestre was from the PSD, do we not, sir?
@A.
That is why this colour was put on the map.  The colour shows that the bourgmestre is from the PSD, but not the population in that commune is from the PSD.  That is the explanation I can give you, Counsel.  That is even the explanation that the expert gave before this Court.  But saying that the population is from the PSD, cannot be deduced from this map.  It doesn't say anything about that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I agree with you, sir?
@A.
The bourgmestres are (sic) even explained that they were not elected.  What do you want from this, Counsel?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Kibuye préfecture was your next stop during the classification trip, was it not, sir?  And whilst you were there you attended the classification meeting on the 3rd of May in the company of Jean Kambanda and other persons who originated from Kibuye; did you not, sir?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  Now, during that meeting there were some speeches and presentations made?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I represent to you that the meeting of 3rd of May 1994, in Kibuye, represented the priorities of the government at the time; did it not, sir?  Did matters that were discussed at that meeting were the matters that were of priority to the government in power at the time?  Is that a fair assumption to make having read those documents?  And I don't really want to go into each and every one of them right now.  Would you agree with me, sir, that the things said, the representations made and the various speeches were concerned matters that were of importance to the government as at the 3rd of May, "yes" or "no"?
@A.
First I should tell you, I'm not certain if this document is complete, nor am I certain if it is correct; it is a summary.  It can only be a summary.  I don't know if what was said was correctly put down.  I don't know when this document was produced.  I don't know.  I don't know necessarily agree with the content in this document.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I know you want to pre-empt the questions I'm going to ask you and you've well rehearsed your answers, but I haven't even referred to any document.  I'm just asking you on the basis of someone who was present at the third main meeting, whether the matters discussed at that meeting were indicative of the priorities of the government at the time?  Forget about documents, you were there, were you not, sir?
@A.
Yes, I was present at that meeting.  I told you that the document that was presented at that meeting was a pre-established document by the prime minister.  He himself spoke of that document.  I don't know whether --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I want to refer to not my document -- are you with me -- but the document that was actually introduced by your own Counsel.  I'm sure you're happier with that.  I'll use his document, first, to be fair to you, sir.  Is that okay.  
Now, can we refer to Defence Exhibit 17(B), in English.  This is what is indicated as a contemporaneous record of a radio broadcast, on a 60-minute tape, of the meeting of 3rd May, 60 minutes. 
Right, that's your document, sir.  There's nothing to worry about.  Would I be correct in saying that one of the issues that was raised, the topics of importance at the third main meeting, the classification meeting, was loyalty; loyalty to the cause; loyalty to the country?  Would you agree with me so far, sir?
@A.
What "cause" are you talking about, counsel?  Loyalty to what cause?  Could you kindly explain that?  You are saying we were loyal to a cause, what is it about, what cause?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, let's just call it loyalty until we look at the transcripts and then we will find out which cause it was from the transcripts.  Shall we do it that way, sir?  Would you agree with me that one of the issues that were discussed was the issue of loyalty, was it not, sir?  Just "yes" or "no"?
@A.
Well, when I say that I don't understand the word "loyalty", you should agree with me and explain it.  Its loyalty to what?  Do you understand -- would you understand somebody telling you about loyalty just off the cuff, just like that?  You can be loyal to many things.  Loyalty to what?  Please explain that and I shall respond? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Come with me then, to get your answer on page 4 and 5 of the English part of that document, and I'm going to read it to you?
@A.
Page in French, sir?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, idea.  When I read it, you'll probably find it.  The paragraph starts at the beginning I told you.  On the French, you should be, at least, on page 4.  Start from there.  You've seen it.  See the paragraph that starts "At the beginning I told you..."  Do you see that, sir?  I don't have a French copy, so I couldn't help you, but I'll read the part that I'm interest in to use, sir, if you listen carefully.  
This is a speech attributed to the prime minister who was, at the time, your boss and it says as follows: 
"Today, if you are an Inkotanyi, you must understand that you'll be considered an enemy of this country and of the Rwandan people.  You must know that we will fight you.  You must take precaution.  You should pack up and join the other Inkotanyi while there is still time, otherwise you must mend your ways.  That should be made clear.  Let it be known that unless the RPF joins the government, we cannot work for them in the administration or at the cellule or secteur level.  We shall not work for them at the lowest or highest level of government."
Now, let's pause there for a while, sir.  Now, what, to your mind, would this message have conveyed to the audience, the people who were seated, people like yourself?
@A.
Well, I don't know.  I cannot talk about what others understood.  But as I understand the message, the prime minister is talking to people to impress upon them that if they belonged to the RPF, they had no place, and the administration of the country, the running of the country, because the RPF must first of all join the government or -- the RPF must join the government in order to be able to nominate anybody.  At a time when RPF was fighting the government this person is saying, "Look if you support the RPF, you will have no place.  You cannot have any place in the government."  He is talking to people, trying to impress that upon them.  It was a fact that the RPF was not yet in the government, and that it was not possible for one to work for an organisation that was not a member of the government.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you just testified in this courtroom that you and the government spent the better part of April negotiating or trying to negotiate to bring the RPF back into forward; did you not sir, "yes" or "no"?
@A.
I said that one of the objectives of the government was to negotiate with the RPF in order to -- in an endeavour to restore peace.  This is what I said.  The first actual negotiations were concerned -- I know that such negotiations did take place.  The government did send emissaries to the RPF in a drive to bring the latter.  
How do I explain this?  Now, so that -- in April, certain persons, certain soldiers were sent out to talk to the RPF leaders at the CNT in a bid to negotiate for peace.  Colonel Gatsinzi was a member of a delegation sent out by the government.  And I do know that he reported back to the government as to what he was able to garner from the meeting with the RPF so that there was a contact between the government and the RPF when the government was in Gitarama, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Then he goes on to say on the other page, halfway through, "Préfets, bourgmestres and conseillers who have resolved to work for the RPF must wait for us to share power before they join their ranks."  
Now, at that moment, it is it not the case, sir, that the RPF was not in Rwanda?  At least, not in Kibuye and therefore not joined the ranks of the government.  The RPF had not joined the government, had it?
@A.
The RPF hadn't joined the government, I did tell you --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So the message there was "you're either with us, or you're against us", was it not?
@A.
Listen, I told you that that was the reason why I am.  This is one of the reasons why I had to react at the Kibuye meeting.  It was subsequent messages such as these, because they were people who when they misunderstood the message, blamed other people.  And that was why I had to take the floor to say, "Gentlemen, we must be careful."  When you talk about the RPF and accomplices you must be very careful, because I know that that would have serious repercussions, especially on members of our party, sir.  I wanted my message to be very clear.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, Prosecution Exhibit 30, on page 6 of the English version.  The prime minister is quoted as saying, Rwanda is for Rwandans and those who wish to support the RPF should join it at Murindi and come with it when it accepts to join the Broad-Based Transitional Government, which has been paraphrased from the broadcast that I just read to you.  
Sir, on page 12 of Prosecution Exhibit 30, in English, page 11 and 12.  The MDR representative takes the floor.  A man called Donat Murego.  And his message is a little bit clearer, isn't it, sir?  Have you found it?  Whilst you are looking for it, I'll read it to you.  This is a message from the MDR supporters or members at that meeting where you were.
"Party members' who are silent should come out.  They should make their stand clear and defend the people's interests or if they support the RPF, they still have time."  
However, he says something very important: "They should know that you reap what you sew.  Therefore they should work."
Now, this is another message that says "you're either with us, or you're against us", isn't it, sir?  You're either with us or you're against us.  You can't have it both ways, could you, sir?  That was the first message that was contained in the meeting that you have participated in on 3rd May, wasn't it? 
@A.
Well, I should respond to that?  Are you through with your question?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
$Microphone not activated)... question, I just put a proposition to you.  I wondered whether you agreed with me, or not.
@A.
As I initially said to you, I am not sure whether this document is reflective of the reality as established there.  I do not know when this document was prepared.  This is the first time that this document is being tendered in a courtroom so that -- I cannot say that the contents of this document are complete and comprehensive.  But the interpretation I would make of what you have just said concerning the statement of the MDR representative, is that it was well-known that within the MDR, there were blocks.  Now, if Dr. Murego was talking to one of those groups in his party, he was entitled to it.  But I believe that he was not talking to the PSD party, he was talking to the members of his party.  He can tell them -- he can tell the members of his party what he wanted to tell them and what he had told them or tell them is binding only upon him and those that will give sustenance to this message.  He did not represent anyone in that meeting apart from those of his party.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On page 12 to 14 of the document Prosecution Exhibit 30, you are quoted there as having given a speech on behalf of the PSD party.  
Now, this was a speech, was it not Mr. Ndindabahizi, these were not remarks to queries raised by anyone.  You gave a speech like everybody else had done: like Donat Murego had done; like Karamera had done; like Kayishema had done; like Kambanda had done.  There was nothing different about your speech, was there?  You gave a speech, didn't you, sir?
@A.
I did say something, yes.  I did say something subsequent to what Kambanda had just said, and then later you would see what one of the members of the MDR party -- you would see what his reaction would be in the part that is recorded of the speech.  Look at Rwabukwizi's reaction following my own statement so that I reacted following Murego who said that there are no longer -- shall be accomplices within the Rwandan government.  I had just returned the day before so that my speech was between two other speeches or two other statements and my speech was targeted at the protection of members of my party.  
And once again, I am saying, I am putting it to you that the rest of my speech, the rest of my speech reflects the unthinkable things that are attributed to me, unspeakable things indeed.  I have to say that in our party there were accomplices.  In their parties, there were many accomplices.  This is what I said in Kibuye.  Let us be clear so this is not a manipulation.  But it's this document which has been produced so late.  Mr. Prosecutor, when you amended my indictment, when you amended my indictment, was the Kibuye meeting mentioned?  If you had this document in your possession, why didn't you spell it out so far as that particular meeting was concerned?  When did you receive this document?  I do not want an answer from you now.  I do not have any right to question you here, but I protest because I've been given a document which was prepared beforehand, I don't know by whom, I don't know by where.  I told you that I was with your people from 1996 to 1998.  Were your people with this document when they came to ask me to work with them as an investigator in your service?  They had the document -- did they have this document, because this is a serious document?  The allegations are very serious.  When did you get this document?  How? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi you must stop now, okay.  This is becoming too long-winded.  Next question.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In fact, isn't it the case, Mr. Ndindabahizi that throughout your speech you distanced your party, the PSD party, from the RPF?  You betrayed the very objective of that party.  You stood in front of a couple of hundred people and betrayed the goals and objective of that party, didn't you, sir?  And that's why you get so worked up when you see these transcripts, isn't it?  You betrayed the PSD party, didn't you?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I did not betray my party.  I'm saying that you attributing things to me and I explain -- I explained how your offices were putting things in my mouth that I have not said.  So I am not worked up, I am not worked up at all.  Do you believe that you can prove that I am a criminal?
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
One of the other objectives that came out from this meeting, sir, which has nothing to do with the PSD party, who would be glad to know, but what had to do with your position as the minister of finance attending that meeting, was the subject of the payment of salaries.  
In that regard on page 4 of Prosecution Exhibit 30, the préfecture Kayishema had listed 7 issues that he was facing difficulties with.  Item number 7, and closely related to that were items number 5 and 6.  So item numbers 5, 6, and 7 concerned you directly, did it not?  And this was the issue of paying salaries and carrying on the activities of the government.  Do you agree?  Nothing now to do with the PSD, but more to do with your functions?  Do you see item number 5, 6 and 7 there, sir?
@A.
5, 6 and 7, yes, I see them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, also in Karamera's speech on page 8 of that, he had also, at the bottom of page 8, he had stated that the government had accepted to pay cellule leaders their wages, but then he says something very interesting on page 8: "The government had accepted to pay cellule leaders their wages, but these in turn had to double their efforts in carrying out their duties and ensuring security."  So, we then see a link between your office, the ministry of finance, which is meant to provide funding to pay the salaries and the incentive for local authorities to kill Tutsis; do we not, sir?
@A.
I do not see any linkage anywhere here between the payment of salaries and the killing of Tutsi.  
Firstly, it is not the minister of finance that pays out salaries, and secondly, I do know that no salaries were paid to members of the various cellules.  Before that, after the inception of the cellules, those people were not paid.  At the given time, they claimed salaries, but in 1994 I do not remember but I know that they were not paid.  The payments I made out were two civil servants, and those people were not civil servants.  We pay through the ministries, they found managers at the ministries, paid out the salaries, but I do not remember -- come across anything to do with the payment of salaries for cellule leaders.  I did pay out salaries, but to civil servants, yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On page 15 of that same document, the prime minister responds to Kayishema's request.  And in relation to the requests that he made -- item number 5, 6 and 7 -- he says in paragraph 6, "There is indeed scarcity of equipment, but the finance minister should distribute evenly whatever is available in a way that Kibuye may get its share."  He goes on about fuel and other things which I'm not interested.  
In paragraph 7, however, he talks about the salaries for civil servants in March which were available, but that the war had broken out and the papers had not reached the back, so civil servants were not paid, and there again you come in.
Now, he then pleaded with people to be patient and there was hope that the matter was being worked upon and that civil servants would get their money soon.  The minutes say as follows that in relation to this matter, he then turned to you, or you actually then showed the participants, rather, that the salaries for April would be paid and you required the heads of departments to inform the relevant authorities of staff who were still in the posts.  
Now, there is something very significant here, you see, because when we turn to your own interview, sir, top 4, page 4.  Your interview of 30 November 1996, top 4, page 4, Prosecution Exhibit 25, you say there, second to the last paragraph in English.  "After ensuring the safety of the funds, my first duty was to pay out staff salaries based on lists and then the release of operations funds for ministries."  Now, sir, the payment of salaries to civil servants at this time was a necessary consequent to the (inaudible), wasn't it, sir?  If you didn't pay your civil servants, they wouldn't support your government, would they?
@A.
Well, I am telling you that we paid out civil servant salaries in March, in April, in May and in June, we paid out salaries.  We did not pay out salaries for civil servants to come and support the government.  We paid out the salaries of civil servants because they were entitled to their salaries.  The government of the day had to pay the salaries of the civil servants, and this is what we did.  We had no other purpose -- you think that we did have other purposes.  You are saying that we stopped payment of salaries, and it doesn't mean that we were sentencing them to death simply because killings were going on in the country.  We must punish our civil servants because of problems caused by others; is this what you're saying? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, let's move on to another aspect of the classification program which came out during this wonderful meeting.  The classification, sir, was also meant to change the tactics in the killing of Tutsis from what was previously a very open killing with bodies all over the place, to a less public attack on those persons, was it not, sir?
@A.
I will not speculate, Counsel.  You understand things as you understand them.  Des Forges interprets things as she sees fit.  I see things as I see them.  I shall not speculate.  When I went to those meetings, I knew what we were being told was the truth.  But when you say that this was a way to change tactics, this is your own opinion, and it's not mine.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Turn to me then to Defence Exhibit 17, page 7 of the English, which is the only one I have.  17(D), I'm sorry.  If you look at the English -- I will read it out to you so you get a translation in French.  
Let's start from the page before, so it makes sense, the last line.  "The administration is not there to kill people.  It is there to protect the entire population regardless of ethnicity, religion or regional background, but enemies must be treated said as such, and must be fought like enemies, but that must be clear.  People must stop playing hide and seek.  They must stop receiving one another.  That reminds me of a question that I was asked by the bourgmestre of Gishyita because I find that question disturbing" Kambanda says.  "We must find evidence to show that those people -- what those people are doing in the forests so that measures can be taken in a timely fashion instead of saying every so often that 300 persons or 200 persons have been killed.  That would tarnish our image in the eyes of the international community.  We must avoid doing anything that requires us to justify ourselves vis-à-vis those foreigners by asking them to come and monitor how we protect our population.  Rather, they will see for themselves.  We will know for sure whether it is the ordinary members of the general public who are taking refuge there".  
Sir, this is your prime minister speaking at a meeting, a public meeting that you were at.  And I put it to you that part of what you call participation was informing the population that it was time to change the way they did their business, wasn't it, sir?  This is not the minutes, this is the transcript, your document, Defence Exhibit 17(B).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Page reference? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Seven -- English, 17(B) of the English one, anyway. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you have no comments I'll move on to the second or the third.
@A.
Please don't move on.  I think you must give me this document so that I can read it.  Please, give me the document. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I've read it to you from the document, you can have a copy for your reference, but we have to move on to other things.  Sir, another issue that came up from the classification meeting.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Mr. President.  I have an objection.  If Counsel doesn't hear the Accused's response, he should just ask this question.  Since this started, we have never stopped objecting the political background of this Accused.  Can the Prosecutor move on to something else?  Did he ask for a modification of the indictment?  We've already dealt with these issues.  Now, here, where we are -- we've been here for two and a half hours.  The Prosecutor started his cross-examination.  We still haven't begun to look at the facts.  I don't want to make a general objection against the Prosecutor's questions, but I believe that the Prosecutor should have the courtesy to wait, at least, for the Accused's response.  And if he's not satisfied with those responses, he should just deal with that.  He's going somewhere where we have nowhere belonging.  He must ask questions regarding the facts levied against the Accused and at least, the very minimum, give the Accused an opportunity to answer the questions that are put to him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the document D.17 in French before you?  Do you have the document leaving aside the page reference?  Do you have a document there, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Which document is it?  You didn't mark the number, D. 17(C).
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if Mr. Phillips could kindly give us the French page reference to what was just read out?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't actually have a French copy of that document, but it's the paragraph that starts, "The administration is not there to kill the people, it's there to protect the entire population regardless of ethnicity..."
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The English page again?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Seven, Your Honour.  I started at the bottom of 6, but it's really seven.  
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, can you help us Defence?  I am sure you know where we are at.  At the English version, the last sentence on page 6.  What is the French page reference, please, so that we can speed up a little bit now because this is getting terribly slow. 
@MR. BESNIER:
We have no French version of that document.  That is where the difficulty that arises.  This is a document that was only tendered by the Defence to draw the Chamber's attention to the fact that several versions of the document or the summary of that meeting of 3rd May exists, and it's just to show that nobody knows which version is the correct one.  That is what Mr. Ndindabahizi is saying.  We don't have any clues as to which document is the most reliable.  There is no French version of this transcript.  Perhaps, given that Mr. Ndindabahizi should hear it read to me again so that he can clearly understand the questions that are being put to him, and be in a position to answer them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
One issue is whether there is confusion about what was actually said at the meeting.  That's one issue.  What we are interested in now is simply to ensure that Mr. Ndindabahizi has the possibility to respond to a question asked.  
Now, Mr. Phillips, can you just single out the five crucial lines of what you want to put to him and read it slowly again, but not more than five lines.  
And then Mr. Ndindabahizi, please listen carefully to the French translation.  And the purpose is, once you've heard these five lines, "What you say to this", that's a question.
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Witness, I had asked you -- my question to you was whether or not you would agree that one of the reasons, one of the many reasons for the classification speeches and visits was to inform the population that it was time to change their tactics from a more -- to a less open way of attacking Tutsis from a more public way.  That is how we started this, and you said that you did not agree with me.  
Now, I then read a passage from Defence Exhibit 17(B) to you, which is a transcript of the tape recording of the broadcast of Kambanda's speech at that meeting.  And I'm going to read a small portion of it to you so that I can give you a chance to comment. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
"We must find", maybe.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I was just going to do that.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.

"We must find evidence to show that those people what they are doing in the forests so that measures can be taken in a timely fashion instead of saying every so often that 300 persons or 200 persons have been killed."  Then it goes on to say "That would tarnish the image in the eyes of the international community.  We must avoid doing anything that requires us to justify ourselves vis-à-vis those foreigners by asking them to come and monitor how we protect the population.  Rather, they will see for themselves, they will know for sure whether it is the ordinary members of the general public who are taking refuge there."  And it goes on. 
Now, this is the passage that I based my question on when I asked you if you would agree with me that one of the functions and purposes of those classification meetings, which you participated in was to change, to inform the population that it was time to change from a more open way of killing to a less open way; do you agree, sir?
@A.
Very well.  I'll answer that question as follows:  I'm seeing that Kambanda is answering a question put to him by bourgmestre Sikubwabo from Gishyita who spoke of 200 or 300 persons killed.  Kambanda reacted by saying, "Listen, sir, you are saying that these are infiltrators that you killed.  We believe that you must be prudent.  People must not go and kill Tutsis who are taking refuge in the bush and then come and tell us that they were killing members of the RPF or infiltrators."  That was the remark or response that he gave to Sikubwabo, that Kambanda gave to him.  So he's asking people to be prudent, to not come and make up stories and lies when in fact they were committing real crimes.  That is what I heard, that is all.  The remarks he made to Sikubwabo who was bourgmestre of Gishyita and the member of the MDR party like Kambanda was saying, "Listen, be prudent.  Don't tell us that these are infiltrators when, in fact, it's just ordinary Tutsis so that tomorrow, people come to tell us 'We've killed, we've killed Tutsis' while you're saying something entirely different."  Those were the remarks he made and that is what I understood from them.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The last thing that every speaker at that meeting mentioned was the need to have able bodied young men to join a civil defence program.  Do you recall them mentioning that?  Just a simple "yes" or "no" would do.
@A.
Who was looking for those young people for the civil defence?  Did we speak of that at the meeting, the meeting of 3 May.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, you did, sir, including yourself.  To encouraged people to join the civil defence program; do you recall that, sir?
@A.
I'm telling you that is false.  That document is a forgery.  The speeches that were made are as if people were putting words into my mouth.  I didn't say that the PSD youth wing had to join the ranks of other parties for the civil defence.  I never said such a thing.  This is, perhaps, the last paragraph in this document you're referring to, but I'm telling you that I did not say those things.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Forget about what you said.  I want to ask you some general questions about that issue of civil defence.  Now, there was a directive issued by the government, was there not, on the 25th of May 1994 establishing the civil defence program, was there not, "yes" or "no"?
@A.
I saw that document which was signed by the minister of interior.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In fact, that directive was issued on the 12th of April, but was not publicised until the 25th of May; is that not the case, sir?
@A.
I don't know if in the meantime whose hands it's fallen into.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  So, do you agree that the civil defence program was a call upon young men, civilians to help protect the country at this time alongside the armed forces, "yes" or "no"?
@A.
I will tell you that when the civil defence, as it was officially called, was set up, I was not in Rwanda.  Therefore, I did not participate in any meetings that set up that program.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your understanding of the concept of civil defence.  I never asked you if you participated in the meeting.  Did you understand it to encourage young civilians to fight alongside the armed forces, "yes" or "no", very simple question?
@A.
That is not how I see it.  The young people who had to fight with the army were recruited into the army, but what I told you is what motivated that program to exist or when it was set up.  It happened at a time when I was not in Rwanda.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Now, let's deal with a totally separate area.  You testified, Mr. Witness, that you did not visit Gasharu cellule until the 26th of June 1994; is that not the case, sir?
@A.
That's what you're saying, that's not what I said.  I didn't go to Gasharu on the 26th of June, you are saying that.  I said I went to Gasharu on the 26th of June or do you want to verify that, that I said that?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did you, or didn't you?
@A.
I went to Gasharu to my native area on the 26th of June, I confirmed that.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I thought you -- interesting.  Now, did you go to Gasharu before 26th of June?
@A.
Before that, no, not before that date.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We agree you went to Gasharu, on the 26th of June.  When you got to Gasharu on the 26th of June, this is the time when you tried to arrest a man you describe as Gatete, isn't it, sir, at the end of June?
@A.
On that day, I didn't deal with only Gatete, but Gatete was amongst a group of persons that we spoke about on that day.  Why do you only single out Gatete? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, I ask the questions here, not you.  Now, yesterday I showed you a family tree, two days ago, and you asked it to be translated in French.  I've had that done and I was asked that you be handed both a French and English copy.  Now, sir, do you have that French copy there with the little family tree, in French now?  Do you have it in English and in French?  Sir, is it your -- if I just point out, if we go through the family tree again, we did that already.  And under your brother Seyeze, I have actually indicated the name of his spouse because I actually saw it in one of the Defence exhibits, so I've indicated the name of the spouse.

So we've indicated, thereon now, the name of his spouse.  Before I had written Mrs. Seyeze, I've had some more time to reflect over it.  And I have now found the full name of Elier who is the wife's -- Seyeze's wife's brother.  Now, you had pointed out that you weren't sure who I was referring to the last time.  Now, do you confirm that this Elier is the same person that is the brother of Seyeze's wife?
@A.
Yes, I will answer your question, Counsel, but I must point out that this is not an Ndindabahizi family tree.  A family tree is something entirely different.  This is something else.  It's not a family tree.  A family tree, if you look in the dictionary, you will see that it's a list of ancestors.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, you are right, you are right.  You are absolutely right, this is not a family tree.  This is only a working tool to single out some family links here, but it is certainly not a real family tree.  The Prosecutor wants to use this to ask some questions.  Now, what is the question?

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I think it's more like half an hour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Half an hour.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It also depends on how my questions are answered.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Let's go on.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Half an hour more, sir?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not promising whether we will go on to 5 or 5.30, or maybe even longer.  It depends on how this develops.

Now, page 15 there, you see that name at the bottom against number 25, sir?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, No. 25.  Now that's your nephew?
@A.
Yes, yes, that's correct.  Yes, yes, I agree.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And this is a confession statement of someone who has claimed responsibility for a lot of the attacks in Gasharu testifying that your own nephew was involved in those attacks with him; is it not, sir? 
Sir, rather than looking at the document, can you answer my question, sir?  Is it or is it not, sir?
@A.
Very well.  I know that this is my nephew, this - - this boy.  I see that somebody is saying that he committed crimes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Somebody, your witness?
@A.
But, what's the problem there?  Where - - where is the problem?  If it's my witness, that is, say so. Where is the problem if my witness says so, because I am not denying that this that he committed crimes.  I did not deny it, quite the contrary, where is the problem?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You did not volunteer the information to this Court, did you - - when you mentioned his name having been examined by your counsel, you did not volunteer that information to this Court; did you, yes or no?
@A.
Are you sure that I was informed of this fact?  I was not informed.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, now let's go to Prosecution Exhibit 39, confession statement of your own brother, very quickly, sir, turn with me to page 3 in French, page 3 of the French, sir.  So, are we there, page 3?
@A.
Yes.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The name against number 3, same person, is it not so, sir?
@A.
Yes, the same person.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your own brother confesses to have been involved in crimes with your nephew and you don't arrest either your brother or your nephew when you go to Gasharu in June, you do, sir?
@A.
But I did not know that they committed crimes unless you can prove that I was informed.  I did not know and nobody told me.
Q. 	Yes.
@A.
Had they told me, I would have done the same thing as I did for Clara.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are you surprised at all, sir, that two members of your immediate family are accused of heinous crimes in your cellule of origin, Gasharu?  Are you surprised at all, sir?  That's the first time you are hearing it, is it not, sir.
@A.
Well, I don't know what you are driving at by using this document.  I don't see what you are driving at.  If these people committed crimes, what does that have - - what does the case have to do with mine here?  If they committed crimes, they must be made to pay just like anybody else.  You should not come and tell me here or ask me to explain why I did not arrest people, my brothers, as I was not in the know.  Those that learned that they committed crimes, I arrested them.  It is through here that I tried to protect them or ask for protection for them and ensure they are not arrested, I have to react to this.  You know, you say my brother allegedly committed crimes in Gasharu, if he committed crimes, he would just be considered and dealt with just as any of the criminals, full stop, but this is not evidence to be used against me in this Court.  What they have done cannot be used against me.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, now, what impression to your mind would it have conveyed to those Tutsis and Hutus who lived in Gasharu cellule if the brother of the minister of finance in the interim government and his nephew were busy killing people in his cellule of origin?  What impression would it have made, you tell us?
@MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  Objection, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor is asking Ndindabahizi to speculate about what Tutsis could have thought about what his brother could have done.  This is not in the frame work of the cross-examination.  We are totally against this. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The Defence have presented before this Court evidence of character, character of the Accused, character of his immediate family.  Now we have found out that there are two of his immediate family who are self-confessed criminals.  It has to have a bearing on the evidence in this case.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and you have drawn the Court's attention to these two names but the question, there we have to sustain the objection.

Your Honour, yes.

@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your witness, Witness DL, Witness DL, do you remember him, testified on the 20th of October, 2003 as follows --
@A.
Who -- who is that, DL, who is DL?  I don't have the list of witnesses.  Who was DL?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't know who it is, and I don't think that's necessary that - -.  We work with pseudonyms, 
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  I just wanted to draw your attention.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Registry, do you have this document for the witness?  
Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi has the Registry now shown you a document making the link between pseudonym DL and the name of the first?  Have you received that now so that you remember who that person was?  It's difficult to remember for all of us.  Have you identified him?
@THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
DL, yes, sir. 
$BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, when asked why you had wanted to arrest Gatete, when he was not involved in the killing of Karegeya, that was a question to the witness by Honourable Khan.  He answered as follows, and I regret I don't have the page number because it has gone off in the photocopy:  "You know a minister has authority over the entire territory.  No one can prevent him from doing what he wants to do.  He was somebody who was defending the entire population.  He was like a father to the entire population".  Do you - - did you understand this answer, yourself?
@A.
Yes, I do understand.  I do understand.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, sir, do you agree with Witness DL's representation of what you are and the powers that you had, sir, your own witness?
@A.
Yes, I do concur, sir.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And you also concur that you are indeed the father, like a father to the entire population of Gasharu cellule in the months of April, May, June, 1994, were you not, sir?
@A.
I was not in Gasharu.  In April and May, I was not in Gasharu. You would appreciate that a father that is not at home if something happens; at home, he could not be blamed for not having intervened.  I love the people of Gasharu, they are my brothers, sisters, my cousins.  You, yourself, spelt it out in this chart, but what should I have done if in April and May I was not in Gasharu and even in June.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, moving on, talking still about Gasharu, another of your witnesses, Witness DN, on page 38 of his transcripts of 4th November, 2003, DN, on response to a question from the President of the Tribunal and the Court, informed us about the cleansing-up operation in the middle of May 1994 in Gasharu cellule.  Do you recall him saying that, sir?  I thought I had the whole bundle of these papers sent up, 
page 38?
@A.
Thirty-eight?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Page 38 of the English.
@A.
I don't see any numbering here.  Is it numbered?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I had to write it by hand, but if you bring it up , there is something wrong with the photocopy, and the numbers are -- whilst I do that - - thanks.  It's six pages from the back of document.  So from the back counting to reverse, it is six pages and that is where the part, I mean -- have you seen that, sir?
@A.
Well, say what you want to say.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Just to make sure it is the same page.  Now in response to questions from the Bench, Witness DN, told us how in May, there was a cleansing out operation and by cleansing out, he meant that a manhunt, he described it as a manhunt.  People were being looked for, individuals were being searched for and he said one would know, for example, that such and a such an individual by name was not killed.  So they were looking for them.  It was a manhunt, he said.  In May, houses were searched, and hiding places were also searched and went on to June until their departure to Zaire. 
Sir, isn't it the case that you played a major role in Gasharu cellule in the middle of May, towards the end of May in such a manhunt, especially in relation to Cyprien Karegeya?
@A.
Here, here you really surprise me, Prosecutor.  I - - I believe that had I brought Karegeya's children here probably one may not have understood that what the Prosecutor is saying about Ndindabahizi concerning these events in Gasharu it is not true.  Did -- Karegeya's children were contacted by you before you got me arrested.  One of the children of Karegeya did say so here that the Prosecutor's services visited him and he told them exactly when you asked him. I told him exactly what I told the Court.  
Mr. President, Your Honour, Judge Khan who put some questions through the Prosecution's witness that she was talking about Gasharu, on several occasions, she  asked, "Why did Ndindabahizi want to call - - to kill Karegeya whilst Karegeya was his cousin?"  
Your witness said Ndindabahizi wanted to recover Karegeya's fields to distribute them to his sons.  But when Karegeya's people came here, they said it was thanks to my sister, thanks to my family that he survived and that even after 1994, he stayed at my house.  He stayed at my house during that time.  His sister stayed at my house during that time.  It was my sister who was responsible for their marriage.  
Now you are telling us a story, you are saying that your Witness GX and the other witnesses  came to tell stories are more credible than Karegeya, the more credible Karegeya's children did tell me that I was not responsible.  I even brought the killers here, the killers of Karegeya here to the Court, and they pleaded guilty.  And now what else do you want to tell this Court?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, let's come to our final area before we go home.  You have testified that it's been said on your behalf that you were trapped.  Do you recall your expert, Professor Lugan, from France telling us how trapped you were in this government from the 9th of April, sir?  And then we asked that you be shown Prosecution Exhibit 24, which is a document that we used some time ago and I want you in particular to look at the identity of the people who fled Rwanda, 24 please, Prosecution Exhibit 24, just a little sheet of paper with names on it.  I should have -- if you look at the bottom of that list, sir, the bottom of it, the few names, the last three names.  We have Mr. Ruganira there, we have Faustin and Gasana.  These were people in interesting positions in government who fled the country in April 1994.   Why didn't you do as they did?
@A.
My answer is as follows: Now, these people did not leave the country.  Faustin Munyenza, who was minister of interior was abroad at the time of the accident as it is called, of the presidential plane.  He was abroad.  He was in Dar-es- Salaam on  mission with the president.  He  remained there.  He didn't come back home so that he did not run away.
Gasana, Anastase, as well, they are abroad at the time, that is on the 6th of April, they were abroad.  They did come back.  
Now, Mr. Rugenera, the former minister of finance disappeared. He went to Mulindi at the headquarters of the RPF.  But the first two, that is No. 2 and 3, these people were not in the country.  Are you well informed? I don't think so.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is why  I asked you the question.  Faustin Twagiramungu, do you know him, sir?
@A.
I know Faustin Twagiramungu.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did he remain in Rwanda in 1994, sir?
@A.
Do you know how he left Rwanda?  Do you know how he fled? You don't know that he was in the vehicles of UNAMIR and in their motor vehicles, was I in there?  Who?  We should be clear.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, if go to Prosecution Exhibit 25, page 24 of the English, tab 2, whilst talking about your flight from Gitarama to Gisenyi in June 1994, tab 2, tab 2, page 24, and I think I am not going to read the French without you.  Question 37, so in French, if you look at question 37, yes question 37 in the French.  
If I am not wrong, the question goes: "The government made transfers on the 2nd and 3rd June from Gitarama to Mayumbu in Gisenyi Préfecture, who took that decision?  You reported to have answered, we entered the room 9:00, the message was sent on a piece of paper to Kambanda who read it and said, 'Gentlemen, those who are afraid can already leave, for the RPF is in Mayaramoze". We moved forward and got closer.  There was panic, we stood up.  Everybody was running.  We needed to see how they fled.  It was total chaos. We went towards Gisenyi panicky. I passed through Kibuye, the population fled."  Is it your testimony, sir, that there came a stage on the 2nd or 3rd of June where Prime Minister Kamuhanda, actually asked those members of his cabinet who wanted to leave to do so?
@A.
Well, Prosecutor, it was to leave Gitarama, not leave the government.  We were told, Kambanda told us, "The RPF is in the vicinity of Kabuye.  Now those that - - those that can do so, leave."  It was not for the purpose of asking them to leave the government, it was to leave Gitarama that was almost taken.  It was being attacked. It was at that time that the government went to Gisenyi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So you yourself left the country as you testified, for a period of a week.  You were in Nairobi Kenya, you left the country through Goma and you returned.  Why did you return, after all, there were several people as you have identified in Prosecution Exhibit 24 who were already abroad and chose not to return?  Why did you return to Rwanda? 
@A.
When I went to Nairobi, I left my family at Uwizera's house in Gitarama, that is his préfecture, my family, that is my wife and our five children.  They stayed in Gitarama.  Gitarama is very near Murambi where the government was.  So that's what you are trying to suggest to me is that I should have stayed in Nairobi and apply as a refugee and leave my children to die out there in the country.  This is what it means, a member of a government who is abroad, who stays abroad, a member of the government, that is from a party that was unpopular, the leaders of that party were murdered because people thought that they were pro-PRF, I am in Nairobi and I stayed in Nairobi so that my children, my wife are abandoned and left to die.  This is what you are suggesting?  This is what Mr. Kapaya has tried to suggest when he was saying that I went to fetch them.  Why did I go to fetch them?  You want me to abandon my family, why should I leave my family to die?  You are asking me the reason why?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, you remained a minister until the 1st of November 1994, long after the government fled into exile by your admission.  Is it not true, sir, that several members of that government either fled following the government's move to Zaire or shortly thereafter? Is that not true and particularly true of 
Casmir Bizimungu and Gasper Ruhumulia spelt, R-U-H-U-M-U-L-I-A?  Isn't it true, sir, that even after the government arrived in Zaire, there were several ministers that left that cabinet?  You remained; did you not, sir?
@A.
It is true I remained there in Goma and it is true, when I arrived in Goma, several members of government knew where they were going but others didn't know where to go, so they remained.  
Why did I stay in Goma? I had special duties.  Money had been taken out and deposited in a Zairian bank in Goma and it was frozen.  
The population continued to believe that the minister of finance may unfreeze that money.  He must deal with that situation.  The civil servants who had not been paid continued to believe that the minister of defence should do something. On several occasions, I approached the Zairian authorities to find a remedy to that situation for a long time.  I then left Goma to Bukavu and I continued to be in touch with the Zairian authorities up to the time I left.  
If you are the minister of finance, you always must try to deal with money problems.  I am not talking about money because I took some, I did not want to leave, I wanted to help people.  I wanted, I wanted that situation to be cleared up before my departure.  The person who was minister of tourism or health, you talked about the minister of tourism, did he still have things to do in Goma?  Was there Rwandan tourism in Goma?
The minister of health, were there hospitals for him in Goma?  Those who didn't have any problems left.  I waited a bit and I never said this before, but there were people in the RPF who approached me and told me to come back to the country. The negotiations I had with them took some time.  There were people in the RPF who wanted me to come back.  And all of these made me remain a bit longer, but it is not far story about money.  I wasn't considered as someone who was dishonest.  I left after another minister was nominated.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In fact, wasn't it the case that you were actually fired?  There was a cabinet reshuffle and you were fired, were you not, sir, the position was then given to the then governor of the bank of Rwanda; is that not the case, sir?  You even remained until you were fired.
@A.
Call it what you will, but in the new government, only Bicamupaka was still in that government.  Everybody was let go.  Bicamupaka was the only one who stayed. You said that everybody - - you said Ndindabahizi was fired, everybody was.  We had problems.  We couldn't have a minister of interior in Zaire, the minister of public works in Zaire, to do what, for what purpose?  Minister of tourism in Zaire, for what purpose?  What should they do?  I think Kambanda wanted to diminish the number of ministers.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well, sir, I have one final question or two or three final questions to you:  I am having a document given to you.  I want to ask you one or two questions in relation to this.  My learned friends may not object but certainly if their objection cannot go to the admissibility of this document or indeed, the use of it as a matter of what the Chamber chooses to make of it in the deliberation.  I have had handed to you the clear argument between the Office of the Prosecutor and the former prime minister of Rwanda Jean Kambanda.  Also attached there is the judgment of this Tribunal and the judgment of the appeals court upholding the judgment at first instance, of court of first instance.
There is only two questions that I need to ask you.  If you look at the pre-agreement, sir, paragraph 27 of that pre-agreement, paragraph 27 of the pre-agreement.  It is only in English and I want to read it to you.  Jean Kambanda acknowledges that he was involved in the decision of the government to attribute to designated ministers préfectures to visit as part of the government security effort and in order to call on the civilian population to be vigilant in detecting the enemy and its accomplices.
Now that is the visit that you made, sir, to Kibuye and to Gikongoro and as you say, other people made to other parts of Rwanda.  Before you comment, let me also draw your attention to paragraph 29 of the same document.  It is a matter that I asked you earlier on in your testimony.  Jean Kambanda as prime minister, of course, acknowledges he issued the directive on the civil defence addressed to all préfets on the 25th of May, 1994.  Jean Kambanda, of course, in his capacity as prime minister, further admitted that this directive encouraged and reinforced the Interahamwe who were committing massacres of the Tutsi civilian population in the préfectures, but what interestingly, Jean Kambanda acknowledges, is that by this directive, the government assumes the responsibility for the actions for the Interahamwe.  
Sir, this is confession of the prime minister of Rwanda, a man who under Article 35 of the constitution of Rwanda that I read to you earlier as contained in Prosecution Exhibit 2, was tasked with directing people like yourselves and their respective ministries.  He says, sir, that the purpose of your pacification missions in Kibuye and Gikongoro was to encourage people to kill Tutsis; is that not the case, sir?
@A.
The contract the police signed between Kambanda and the Prosecutor has nothing to do with me.  That's what I must tell you.  The Kambanda trial has nothing to do with me.  I have an indictment and I have to answer to the charges levelled against me in that indictment.  Anything else that you want to try to introduce into my trial in these hearings, is not of interest to me.  My answer to you, therefore, is, Kambanda is Kambanda and no one else; it has nothing to do with me, it has only to do with him.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, sir.  Now, finally, let me put the following to you, sir:  So I put it to you that in 1991, you had political ambitions following the advent of multipartyism, that based on those ambitions, you resigned your position on the Rwandan civil service, joined the PSD party and was subsequently appointed as   director in the ministry finance, chef de cabinet, or second-in-command, whatever you call him. I also put it to you that having held that second position in the ministry of finance, you aspired like every human being to greater heights. Politically, sir, you had no power having not been a member of the political bureau of your party.  You represented that party at regional level only, sir. 
But an opportunity presented itself to you, sir.  On the 7th of April 1994, through no fault of your own, the president is killed and you, and then an opportunity to realise the political ambition and aspire to greater things politically and you grabbed it.  You grabbed the opportunity, sir, you agreed to join the interim government on the 8th of April 1994, with the full knowledge of those who are composed and were part of that government.  
I put it to you also, sir, that you had a choice, the choice was either to remain and conform or to run away and you exercised that choice.  You did exercise that choice voluntarily and you exercised it  knowingly what the risks involved were.  Is that not true, sir?
@A.
I would be very brief in my response.  I told this Chamber how I became a member of that government.  I told this Chamber how I worked within that government.  I told everything, I hid nothing and the Tribunal will assess that.  If it finds that I took advantage of an opportunity to become minister, they would decide the consequences, but that is my answer to you, Counsel.  
I didn't ask for a closed session.  I wanted for everyone to understand that I have nothing absolutely, nothing to hide.  Thank you.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I thank you, sir, for answering my questions today.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Any re-examination?  
There is a pending issue about a motion under 92 bis.  Prosecution, you remember that before 
Mr. Besnier re-examines, there was this issue about Witness DX.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, we have responded to that motion in writing.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I haven't received that.  Could you just tell us briefly whether you accepted it or not?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would let Mr. Kapaya do that.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, good evening, Your Honours.  Having gone through the motion, we have  found that there are two aspects to the statement of that witness.  There is the aspect which deals with the --  his - - with matters which we consider to be entirely based on opinion and  the witness was supposed to come and testify as a witness of fact. So being a layman, he cannot testify to matters which are entirely within the domain of experts.  So the greater part of the testimony from pages 5 to around 20 is based on speculation, is based on opinion on matters which are subject to various interpretations.  We have had various -- of the history of Rwanda from various leanings depending on the background of each person, who would say, talk about it.  
And then there is the second aspect which relates to the meeting to the introduction by that witness to the Accused either - - and the investigators of the Tribunal.
In that aspect of the testimony of the witness statement which is from pages 21 to 26, the statement appears to attribute the arrest of the Accused person to the fact that he did not want to cooperate with the investigators and that is why they sort of framed him for the crimes for which he stands charged here.  So we think that if anything, then the witness should be called to come and testify here under Rule 92(B)(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  And that witness, if the Chamber thinks that there is fact or which may call the person testify on a specific aspect of this statement then it can act under those Rules.  So in conclusion, Your Honours --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the last thing that you said now, that if the Chamber - - could you repeat that last sentence, please?
@MR. KAPAYA:
If the Chamber for some reason decides to rely on that aspect of the testimony, I mean on the aspect of the introduction of the accused person to -- because that is a factual evidence, you know, the witness saw these things and took part in them.  So if the Chamber decides to rely on them, then the Prosecution requests that the witness be called to be cross-examined on the basis of that because those are matters which touch on his culpability actually in relation to the charges which are laid before, before him.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you filed this response today with the registry?
@MR. KAPAYA: 
Yes, we did, Your Honour.  We have filed the response.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Thank you for briefing us on the substance.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have understood, I have understood, the Prosecutor's position.   But first is the question of procedure.  This motion was filed on the 27th of October 2003, according to Rules 92 bis, it gives the prosecutor one week to response to that motion.  It is time-bound.  Consequently, the Prosecutor's respond is not, cannot be accepted.  I can refer to the jurisprudence, the Kayishema and Ruzindana case in the appeals decision regarding time limits.  These are fundamental under pending of the trial and they must be respected at any - - in any case at the Appeals Chamber.  So first, there is the issue of procedure.  Can the Prosecutor today object to the tendering of that document and the Defence says, "No, it certainly may not."  According to what the Tribunal then decides, we can then decide if it is relevant and we looked at the faults or qualities and we can, at that point, see whether or not DX's statement can be tendered.  But first, we must deal with the procedural issues, Mr. President, in our opinion.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you address that issue in your motion, Mr. Kapaya, in your written response?  Sorry, which are the words which Mr. Besnier is referring to Rule 92 bis (E)?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, from our discussion yesterday, we understood that that issue is mute because it is quite apparent that the motion was not brought to the attention of the attorneys before the -- in the team and that you said that, Your Honour, you expected us to go through the motions that they be translated by one of us and that we file our response today.  So we didn't address that issue - - motion in the motion because we thought it has been decided upon by implication, yesterday that we -- 
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no.  Well, if you are implicating me in this, all I wanted you to do is do since you looked surprised when reference was made to this document, I asked you kindly to look into the matter and report back today and that is exactly what you have done.  So nothing flows from what the Chamber has said.
Now, let's now look at this.  Did you actually receive this document in French?  I leave aside whether it was found in French, it may well have been, but did the Prosecution's Office actually receive that motion on the date indicated by the Defence?  That's the issue now.
@MR. KAPAYA:
I personally did not see it, Your Honour, neither did Mr. Phillips did see it.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's possible.  Now, according the proof of service from the Registry, someone has signed out for the trial attorney in charge of the case as receiving this document on the 27th of October 2003, do you have a copy of this receipt here?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, we saw it yesterday, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is your comment to that please?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Our comment, Your Honour, is that it was not brought to the attention of Mr. Phillips or myself, and particularly in the language in which it was received.  Actually, we went for it in the language section and found out that even the translation was just finished, it had just been finished.  And actually, we took a draft, if you look at the English translation, it is in --  there are some handwritten marks in it , it is still being processed.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
But the signature on the document comes from someone in the Prosecution's team, is it, is that correct?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, yeah, it is possible, Your Honour, because of told the Prosecutor is quite large and wide, you know, it was not brought to the people who are supposed to work on it as such.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, you are then arguing, I assume, that Rule 92 (E), even if there is no explicit wording in Rule 92 (B), it must be interpreted to the effect that the document has not been really given notice to the opposing party, that is the thinking now. Or are you saying that actually the Prosecution got this and the Prosecuting is the opposing party but because of some exceptional circumstances, the time limit cannot apply?  What is your position?
@MR. KAPAYA:
We are relying on both limbs, Your Honour, on the alternative.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, this is not serious business.  The Office of the Prosecutor is represented collectively among its collaborators, if we want judicial stability and certainty, we have to respect the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and all the provisions that are in them.  I can remind you of the Appeals Chamber and the fundamental decision in Kayishema and Ruzindana, 1st of June 2001, 1st of June 2001, paragraph 46 of that decision, the Chamber, the Appeals Chamber says that the prescribed time limit must be respected and may be indispensable to the proper functioning of the Tribunal and then, the -- and it's mission to render justice.  Anything outside of these Rules cannot be tolerated.  
The Appeals Chamber says that if a problem arises, any party can move the Chamber for an additional time.  This was not respected and I think that we have to deal with the judicial consequences of what happened, given that the Prosecution did not respond in due time, it follows that this document should be accepted.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  In view of the fact -- I had actually hoped that we would finish today, I had hoped that the cross-examination, the re-examination, questions from Judges, plus the status conference could finish today. That was my plan. 
And there is still some to go, but in view of this issue that has been brought up now and since we have not seen the Kayishema-Ruzindana decision, we have not read Mr. Kapaya's decision.  I think it is a little bit difficult to close the case this evening without having rendered a decision based on the arguments on both sides.  So we will probably then have to close this tomorrow.
I think therefore, I would wish to re-hold the issue on this admissibility question on Rule 92 bis  until we have read Mr. Kapaya's motion and reflected upon it in view of what both have said.
What about re-examination, please?
@MR. BESNIER:
There is no re-examination, Mr. President.  Thank you.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The best - - thank you very much for that clarification.  The best procedure now seems to be instead of having the Judges questions and then go into the 92 bis issue tomorrow in open session and then have the status conference.  I think we could stop for tonight now, it is 6:00 and then the Judges may have a few questions tomorrow to you, Mr. Ndindabahizi at 2:00, a very short afternoon session, very, very short and we have to finish this week.  And we will rule on the Rule 92 motion but the expectation is that tomorrow afternoon, will then be the end of the evidence in the present case and that we will then immediately go to a status conference to discuss the dates for the closing arguments.  That will be the method to be followed and in some issues should not take more than one and half hours, I think tomorrow on Friday.
So it is agreeable to the parties.  We will then adjourn for tonight and we will see you again tomorrow afternoon at 2:00, Mr. Ndindabahizi.
Yes, please, Mr. Marçais?  Oh, you just -- thank you very much.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We were just about to finish your testimony, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Good afternoon.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the Judges may have a few questions to you at the end.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Good afternoon, Mr. Ndindabahizi.
@THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
My first question to you relates to a cabinet meeting.  Your testimony was that there was a meeting every day except for those who were outside the country.  My question is:  How often did you attend these meetings?  I mean, except for the period you were outside the country.
@THE WITNESS:
Well, I attended meetings.  I had been attending meetings since the very beginning, that is from the time of the swearing in, that was on the 9th of April 1994; and the 10th, that is the next day; the 11th there must have been a meeting; and on the 12th, we left to go to Gitarama.  And upon arrival at Gitarama, cabinet meetings continued almost every day.  I do remember that we had a meeting even on the 14th; the 15th; the 16th, there was a very important meeting that we had; and on the 17th, as well, there was a meeting.  After the end of the month of April, indeed, there were meetings frequently, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th.  The 30th, we went to Gikongoro, and started May with a meeting at Kibuye; so that there were frequent meetings; and I did take part in almost all of them -- all of those meetings, because I did not leave Gitarama throughout the month of April.  I left Gitarama at around the 11th of May to go to Nairobi.  I came back at around the 20th.  In other words, Your Honour, there were meetings almost every day, Your Honour.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay, and you would go to Gitaka once a year, as you stated.  And did you leave your car at the Gitaka centre, every time you went there and walked up to your home?
@THE WITNESS:
That is correct, because the road ends at the Gitaka centre, and to get to my house there was no road, as such.  I, therefore, had to proceed on foot.  I went a little uphill for about 15 minutes.  It's not very far, the hill, and my house was on the top of the hill, so that when one is at the top of the hill, one sees the people who are at the Gitaka commercial centre very easily.  There is no obstacle for one's sight, Your Honour.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And you went to Gitaka in 1994, June, around 26th or thereabouts, according to your testimony, and you saw your sister, who told you about the children who were hiding in her place.  Then you went to Gitaka centre, you were told about Gasharu (phonetic) and how he killed ten people.  Did you enquire about your cousin Karegeya at any point during this visit?
@THE WITNESS:
Well, it was not a question of carrying out enquiries.  People simply informed me of what did take place on that hill.  Because when I arrived there, I found people at the Gitaka commercial centre, we talked.  And then I went up to the house to see my sister, who told me about the children she was hiding.  And when I went back down hill, I still found people in Gitaka and they told me about Gasharu, he was pointed out to me, and I was also told about Karara.  I was given information on what took place, including information regarding my cousin Karegeya yes, Your Honour.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And I believe he had already died by this date, had he?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  At the time, I was told that he had already died.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay, what were your responsibilities of executive secretary -- correct me if I'm wrong -- executive secretary in Kibuye of the PSD party?  Was that your designation, or was it some other designation?  And if it was, this or some other designation, what were your duties as such?
@THE WITNESS: 
Well, my duties were that I represented the party at the regional supreme body, so that I was in charge of parties (sic), as far as the Kibuye préfecture was concerned.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
What did this entail, being in charge of the party in Kibuye?
@THE WITNESS:
In terms of activities, I was to ensure that the party functioned properly in the préfecture.  In other words, I should be in the know as to what was happening in the various communes.  The chairmen at communal level should be in touch with me, or I should be in touch with them, and sometimes convene meetings of those communal leaders, if necessary.  And my duties were tantamount to coordinating the activities of the party in the region.  At times, there were some communes that had no bourgmestre, as was the case for the Gishyita commune, and at another time, the Kivumu commune.  When posts were vacant, that is the posts of the bourgmestre, it was my responsibility to organise elections for their replacement by a PSD candidate.  Sometimes we failed.  In Gishyita, that was the case.  We were not able to have somebody in Kivumu.  But these were some of the duties I was responsible for; in other words, try to win over people to our party, that they join us as members.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
And why did you go with Rafiki?  Was it because he had closed his house and you had nowhere else to go, or was it because he asked you to accompany him to the meeting at the Ministry of Defence?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes.  When Colonel Bagosora came, he talked to Rafiki.  I was outside the compound.  Now, Rafiki came inside the house and told me, in brief, what the Colonel had just told him.  So that he said, "The Colonel just told me that there is a meeting of political parties at the Ministry of Defence and that there was no PSD representative there," so he wanted to invite me to represent the PSD at the Ministry of Defence meeting.  He also stated, in his house "There was a person who was executive secretary of the party but for the préfecture of Kibuye called Ndindabahizi," and asked whether Ndindabahizi could go along with him.  Now he told me that, "I asked whether you can come with me, and the Colonel didn't have any objections, and the Colonel said, "Well, there is no problem."  "So you should please come with me," he said.  So I went along with him.  
In my testimony I did say that immediately he closed his house down and we took the lady, who was expecting a child, we took the lady along and I had to leave his house because he had closed down the house.  I think I said so in my testimony.  The gist of the matter is that he asked me to go along with him, Your Honour.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Then on the -- your interviews, which are contained in Exhibit P. 25, I wanted to refer to your statement, which appears on page K0217400.  I don't know what the French equivalent is of the page.  Page K0217400.
@THE WITNESS:
Could I also have, the French version, please indicate the page.  Does it have the French version?
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Well, the statement is the second-but-last paragraph in the English version.  Maybe I can read you the paragraph and then we'd like to have your comments on it.  It goes as follows:
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, you are aware that in this there are four tabs and this is not the last one but the penultimate one; in other words, the document which starts (Untranslated French).  Do you have that document in front of you?  The French is K0184935; that's the K-number.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I see number 31 in French:  "Having heard on this day of the 30th November 1996."  I think that's the sentence.  I am with you, yes. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you have to go towards the end of that document in order to find it.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
It is the paragraph which begins, "The massacres took place because. . ."
@THE WITNESS:
I do not see any mention of massacres taking place.  At the bottom of the page are the handwritten notes.  Are you referring to those handwritten notes?
@JUDGE BOSSA:
No, I'm referring to the paragraph that reads like this, "The massacres took place because of the attacks by the RPF."
@THE INTERPRETER:
As I don't see this passage also.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Look now at the same page.  Do you see at the bottom of to page, (Untranslated French)?  Do you see that?  You have to move on to the next page, that starts with (Untranslated French).  Do you see the first word on the next page?
@THE WITNESS:
Thirty-seven, that is schedule 184937, yes, I can follow you now.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if you go down a little bit, you will see first it's (Untranslated French) then (Untranslated French).  That's where you start.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do follow.  My explanation of the massacres is that RPF attacks were carried out because hard consultation (sic) was impossible...
@THE INTERPRETER:
Something like that; the interpreter doesn't have the document. 
@THE WITNESS:
I am with you here.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
You say here that, "The massacres took place because of the attacks by the RPF and their refusal to negotiate with the new government with a view to stopping the war," I believe", and you go on to say, "I believe that if there had been dialogue, the government would have mobilised sufficient security personnel to effectively stop the massacres."  So my question is:  Are you saying that the government did not mobilise sufficiently to stop the massacres because the RPF refused to negotiate?
@THE WITNESS:
Here there is the answer, but I do not see the question that was put to me here.  The question is not repeated here, but at one given time, I do remember that we were talking about the massacres, and I explained that there was a delegation of the government that had been to talk to the RPF to negotiate the cessation of hostilities, and that the RPF -- according to the explanations that were given to us by the emissary who went, the RPF were saying they were not in a position to put an end to the war for as long as the government did not resign.  This is what was told us.  So that we told them, "Look," they said, "we want to negotiate with the military but not with the government.  If you, the soldiers, want to talk to us, come and talk to us and don't say you are here to represent the government."  This is what I tried to explain.  And so far as the possibility of stopping the massacres is concerned, I did say that the government soldiers were concentrating on war against the RPF, that they were mainly concerned about war with the RPF, so that it was not possible to have any soldiers coming into the hills, because most of the work was in the battlefield.  This is what I did say:  Most of the soldiers were in the battlefield.  I was trying to say that if the RPF had wanted to work with us and the two sides were able to come to an agreement to desist from war, to desist from fighting, those soldiers, that is the RPF soldiers and the government soldiers, could have come together for the purpose of approaching the population, so that the disturbances would cease and calm would be restored.  I believe it was 1976 and that was what I wanted to say, it was an opinion of mine that I was offering.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
We are now roughly back to Karegeya.  By the time you went to Gitaka in June he had been killed with his two wives plus some of his children, and you almost arrested Gishayke (phonetic), you arrested Karara.  I'm just wondering:  Did you make any investigations regarding this matter?  Because this was your relative, in addition to being a native of your native cellule.
@THE WITNESS:
I did not arrest Gishayke, because he disappeared before he was arrested.  I was able to arrest Karara and took him to the commune.  I had entrusted that investigation to the bourgmestre, who was in charge of the commune, I had asked him to try and monitor the situation and ask Karara what happened.  So that was what I did.  So far as Gishyake was concerned -- as far as Gishyake was concerned, I was given information about what had happened.  There was no more work to be done.  People were killed, those people were killed, and those that were in charge were to offer the necessary explanations for the commune.  I was not in Gitaka, Your Honour, to carry out any investigations.  I did not even know what was happening there.  I just passed by to see my sister, and when I saw what was happening, to allay her fears, I tried to arrest Karara, so that he would go and justify whatever he may have done.  Because I thought I should ask the bourgmestre to monitor those developments, and I thought that my duty consisted in only that and that alone, because there was also a question of retribution.  There were authorities in that prefecture, the préfet, the bourgmestre, there were advisors. So it was not the responsibility of the minister to carry out investigation.  I did what I did in order to ensure that people are enlightened to the fact that they can't just kill and go scot free.
@JUDGE BOSSA:
Well, this was in a response to your admission yesterday that a minister had a lot of power and could do anything, and so I was wondering whether you couldn't have used those powers to go a little bit further than you did, and that's all.  Thank you.
@THE WITNESS:
Well, I believe that I was not the one that said that the minister had all the power.  It must have been a witness that must have made that statement here, not me, Your Honour.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have two short questions for you.  My first question, from the evidence we got so far we observed that the Hutus during the war could be categorised into three; ones who were against the government policy and managed to flee the country; then there was those who stood against the government and were killed; and the third category was those Hutus who supported the internal government policy and chose to join the government.  
Would I not be justified to presume that you belong to the latter category, the third category?
@THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, let me say, once again, that I did explain the manner in which I joined that government.  I did not join the government because I made an option.  There was no option.  There was no option, that was what I said, so far as I was concerned -- I don't know about the others that are concerned -- but as far as I was concerned, it was not an option.  It was not on the basis of an option that I joined the government.  I did explain how I left my house on the 7th in the morning.  I said how I went hiding at a neighbour's, even in the latrine behind the house.  I have said how my wife spent the night on the road with a child on her back.  I said how I was able to hide at Raffaki's and how Colonel Bagosora got there.  I said how Rafiki asked me to go along with him and how we arrived at the Ministry of Defence.  I have said that when we arrived, everything was over, the government had been set up and that we were faced with a fait accompli.  We were asked to join the government.  We had no choice.  It was a war situation.  The city had been surrounded.  I didn't have any option.  I didn't have anywhere to go.  This is what I explained.  So that the ministers that were abroad with the president, they were abroad; it was their luck, so to speak; and the others that were able to flee to join the RPF, it is probably because they were able to go towards the RPF.  I was probably unlucky enough to have fallen upon the government.  So it was not a matter of choice, so far as I'm concerned.  I cannot belong to the category, the latter category you referred to, having opted to join the interim government.

1445H
@JUDGE KHAN:
Your visit to the ministry of defence with Rifiki was not pre-planned?
@THE WITNESS:
I did not understand, Your Honour.  What plan are you referring to? 
@JUDGE KHAN:
You went to the ministry of defence with Rifiki?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I did.
@JUDGE KHAN:
That was not a pre-planned program?
@THE WITNESS:
Even if it had been pre-planned, I had no idea about it.  I went with Rifiki.  He told me there was a meeting.  He did not tell me that he was aware that that meeting had been planned.  He said, "Come with me."  We went and we found there was a meeting going on.  We didn't know who planned the meeting, or if it was planned.  We just got there and people were there.
@JUDGE KHAN:
No, I'm asking about your visit to the ministry of defence with Rifiki.  Your visit was not pre-planned?  Your going with Rifiki was not pre-planned; that's what you want to say?
@THE WITNESS:
It was not pre-planned.  The decision to accompany Rifiki came only after Bagosora came.  Bagosora spoke to Rifiki and Rifiki told me, thereafter, that he was informed by Bagosora that there was a meeting taking place at MINIDEF, at the ministry of defence, and that he had to go.  Bagosora had just invited him, and Rifiki said that I had to accompany him because I had spoken about that with Bagosora.  I had no idea Rifiki knew.
@JUDGE KHAN:
My second question is:  In your examination-in-chief, you posed RPF to the assailants who started attacking the Hutus and the presidential guards, after that (inaudible), but according to the investigations -- some of these investigations carried on.  It was the Tutsis who were victimised, and the Hutus who had started killing and massacring the Tutsis.  How would you justify your statement in light of the investigating reports which goes against your own testimony? 
@THE WITNESS:
Did I say that the RPF were assailants?  Did I say that?  I don't remember if I had mentioned that yesterday, if I said that.
@JUDGE KHAN:
You said, "Soon after the death of the president, we have to start attacking the Hutus." 
@THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I don't believe that was what I said.  I only said that in the beginning.  The first soldiers who were attacking the population was the presidential guards.  I left my house because of those attacks by presidential guard soldiers.  They were attacking the neighbourhood, and the RPF battalion which was based at the parliament, they started to attack the population, as well, just like the presidential guards were in the morning.  They started in the afternoon and at 2 o'clock, therefore, in the afternoon, I had to leave my first place of hiding because the RPF left its base.  So the RPF was not the first to attack.  It was the presidential guard soldiers who began attacking and the RPF soldiers reacted to those attacks, and that was in the afternoon.  That is what I remember saying, Your Honour.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If the Witness could be given P. 30.  I will just come back to the 3rd of May meeting, for a moment, Mr. Ndindabahizi even though you have dwelled on that for some time.  If you could look at the French version K-number K0246613, this will be in tab 2, and, again, the last three digits in French are "613".  
Now, have you found the page, the first words on that page are, "Ou ils s'appellerainet entre eux..."
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, I have.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, just at the middle there of the page, you come to a sentence.  It's not the first or the second, but the third dash and the third dash reads: "Ce n'est plus un secret..."  Have you seen that sentence?
@THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, I haven't found that yet.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are on the same page?  Let us first agree.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, I found it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you read that sentence, it reads in English: "It is no longer a secret as evidence by retrieved documents that the RPF had soldiers in each commune whose objective was to exterminate us one day".  Now, that particular passage, is that a sentence which you accept or have you been quoted incorrectly?
@THE WITNESS:
Those are not my words.  Those are the words of the prime minister.  The prime minister spoke those words that are contained in that document.  That was Jean Kambanda.  He spoke of the content of that document. 
@MR PRESIDENT:
Yes, page 612, the next page.  You, you see, it says "Minister, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi"?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I see it says, "Minister Emmanuel Ndindabahizi".
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So according to this summary, we are in the section recapitulating your words.  The prime minister's ministry may also have said this, but according to this document, which maybe right or wrong, this is you.  And I just want to make sure that -- what is your position on that sentence, please?
@THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, it's not only with this sentence that I have problems.  I have a problem with the entire document.  I don't know who drafted this document and how the summary was made.  I don't know how people were able to write these things, I don't know.  I said on several occasions that I was working with ICTR investigators from '96 to '98.  This interview took place in 1994.  Where was this document?  Could those people ask me to cooperate with them had I said such serious things?  And lastly in 2003, the Prosecution changed its indictment which dealt with charges regarding the meeting of 3 May.  The last thing that was struck from the indictment were charges levied against me relating to that meeting that was suppressed.  Did they do so whilst they had this document in their hands?  I don't know, but I have many issues, many problems with this document, Mr. President.  It's not just one phrase or sentence, but it's the entire document.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And that I am aware of, but I just want to draw your attention to this sentence.  And that one is also wrong according to you.  That's fair enough.  Thank you.  Now, I'm moving to another subject.  
Registry, do you have the binder containing the Prosecution witnesses?  This one, you know, the big one.  Is there an extra copy?  It is the one explaining or containing the witness statements.  It contains the witness statements.  I just want to show the witness the first page of that document.  Can someone help me now, kindly?  Index of Prosecution witness, with some pseudonyms.  If someone would give, kindly, a clean copy to the witness?  This is one of the main documents in the case.  Someone must have it available.  Can you make a copy of this page, please?  One copy for the witness.  I don't have a clean copy of that page. 
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I have it, I have it.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You have it, excellent.  Now, stop the press, will you.  Could someone please ask the gentleman to come back before he starts copying, and then we can start?  Do you have it in front of you?  Yes, that's exactly the one.  Yes, please, if that can be given to Mr. Ndindabahizi.  That was very helpful Mr. Marçais, thank you. 
Now, let's start with a general question while we are waiting for my copy to come back.  There have been Prosecution witnesses in this room, Mr. Ndindabahizi, and they have testified that they saw you there.  You say, "I wasn't there.  I wasn't in Kibuye except on a particular occasion and I certainly did not commit or participate in any massacres".  That is a firm view you hold.  Now, these witnesses have given a different story.  And my question to you, generally, now is: why would these witnesses come before this Court and tell untrue allegations?  Let's ask that general question first.
@THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I divided the Prosecution witnesses into two categories.  The Prosecution witnesses were ten in number.  Four of them speak of Gasharu, four speak of Gitwa and Bisesero.  Those four who speak of Bisesero and Gitwa, were witnesses CGV, CGN, CGY.  Those are three of them: CGN, CGY, CGV.  I would also add CGM to that same category.  Those four say that they saw Ndindabahizi in Gitwa.  When they were asked how they recognised Ndindabahizi, they said that Ndindabahizi worked at the TRAFIPRO store, that he managed it, the TRAFIPRO store, in Kibuye.  Their assertions were all concording, as regards to my profession as a manager in Kibuye where apparently they saw me on several occasions where they would go to TRAFIPRO to buy or sell their goods; those four.  Mr. President, I've demonstrated before the Chamber that I never worked in that store, that I was never manager in that store.  But it's surprising to see four people to come before this Chamber and say that Ndindabahizi worked as the manager of that TRAFIPRO store.  Who told them that when they were to testify here that they were going to say "Ndindabahizi was the manager of the TRAFIPRO store".  They asserted that on several occasions.  For those people, I don't know why they worked together to come here to lie as regards to my profession.  Perhaps, they did see the manager of the TRAFIPRO store in Kibuye, but it was never me.  But to tell you why they got together to come and tell stories before this Chamber, I have no idea why.  
As you heard in this Chamber, those people, most of the Prosecution witnesses, were recruited by one person called CGH.  You heard before this Chamber, and that witness stated that CGH recruited CGE and CGX and CGB, and recruited CGF, who is his brother-in-law, and recruited CGY who is his brother -- because they have the same father, they are brothers.  CGY told us here, in this room, that CGN is his friend, so these are family friends.  They have family relations, in some cases, these witnesses.  And since they were invited by one person -- perhaps one had reasons that I am not aware of -- CGH who hid at Karara's, I know him.  I know his mother and father.  These people are related.  They came together to come before this Chamber to lie.  
There's also the Gasharu group of witnesses, the people who came to tell stories before this Chamber include CGX, CGE, his son, CGB and CGF.  They are related.  CGX is the mother of CGE.  CGF is the brother-in-law of CGH, and CGH recruited them all.  The Tribunal investigators, I believe, contracted out their work to CGH.  What can I tell you though, Mr. President?  I was very astonished, astonished indeed when Karegeya's children came here.  The Prosecution investigators went to ask him how his father died, and they said that Ndindabahizi did not participate in his father's death.  Karegeya's child should have been the Prosecutor's best witness -- was not brought before this Chamber.  I had to bring him before this Chamber for the truth to bring out. **********.  He's in charge of Gasharu cellule.  The Prosecutor doesn't want to bring the victims, the children of Karegeya.  Why does he avoid bringing the real person, the real victims of the event?  But instead, they opt to bring someone given to them.  What can I tell you, Mr. President?  These people say that I studied with them.  CGH says that we studied that the primary school together.  But if you look closely at all his identification information, you will see that he was born in 1960.  I was in sixth grade in 1964.  At the time, he was only four years old, he was four and I was already leaving the primary school.  So he's inventing things by saying that I was with him, but I don't know what to tell you, Mr. President.  I don't know how these people were recruited, and I can't tell you why they did what they did, but it's very astonishing to me.  Each time they were asked, "Why did Ndindabahizi kill his cousin?"  Every time they said, "He wanted to get the fields back".  I think the Prosecutor - "he wanted to get the fields back".  I think the Prosecutor was going to react by saying, "If that's how it is, I was betrayed".  When I brought the children here they said that they were saved, in my own house.  They were in my own house, and they were even there for seven years.  
The Prosecutor should not have asked me questions about Karegeya's death in Gasharu.  When these witnesses say when Ndindabahizi arrived all the Tutsis, no Hutu children, asked what they looked like.  Defence witnesses, in their testimony -- you see that six of them, six Tutsi witnesses who are from Gasharu -- how could they have come to support me?  They accuse me of killing one of their own, of Nors.  Nors's daughter was here with the driver, with the person who killed him, they were here.  Mr. President, I have no idea and I can't explain to you how these people agreed to put me in a bad spot, to try to imprison me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Now, let us now look at the list in front of us and you see that as number one here, you have CGH.  Now, this one number, did you know that witness before you saw him in court?
@THE WITNESS:
Witness CGH lived on the same hill as I did.  I knew him since he was a child, I knew his parents. ******************one who gave birth to CGF's wife.  Yes, I knew them very well and I believe he's at the very origin of my difficulties.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now move to witness number three because number two was not called; that's GKH.  Did you know him before you saw him in the courtroom?
@THE WITNESS:
@GKH, yes, I knew him.  *********************.  And he even said that before this Chamber, I believe.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm just going through the list briefly to have your comment to each and every one.  I'm going to ask you these questions in relation to each of the witnesses.  That brings us to number CGK.  Did you know that person before you saw that person?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I did not know that witness.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did that -- alright.  CGM, number five?
@THE WITNESS:
I had never seen CGM in my life.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGW, number six?
@THE WITNESS:
The first time I saw that person was here in this courtroom.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGF, number seven?
@THE WITNESS:
No, I did not know that person.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGE, number eight?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know number eight, but I know him because I was told he was CGX's child, but physically, I didn't recognise him.  I was told he was the son of that woman, and I know that woman.  She was a neighbour and they live in Gasharu.  I know his mother, but not the child.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGX, you have just responded to that one.  You know that one.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Number 10 didn't come.  Number 11, CGC?
@THE WITNESS:
Ten did come, I think, Mr. President, number 10.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, CGB?
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, he came and yes, I know him.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGC, 11?
@THE WITNESS:
The first time I saw that person was here, Mr. President.  I had never seen that person before.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGM, number 12?
@THE WITNESS:
I did not know that person before seeing that person here, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't recall now, what about GMX?  Did GMX come? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGP, number 14?
@THE WITNESS:
He did not come.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGV, number 15? 
@THE WITNESS:
Number 15 did testify.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you say about him then? 
@THE WITNESS:
No, it was the first time here, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGO, number 16?
@THE WITNESS:
@CGL, CGL.  No, Mr. President, I did not know that witness.  I saw that witness for the first time here.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
@CGD, number 17?
@THE WITNESS:
He did not appear, Mr. President.  He did not testify, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the fact that you did not know some of these persons, does not exclude, of course, that they may still know you, and have seen you because you were a minister, a famous person.  Everyone knew you, I assume, at the local level.  What is your view to that suggestion?
@A.
At any rate, everybody said how they knew me.  Those four said they knew me as the manager of TRAFIPRO in Kibuye.  Can it be said that they knew me because I was never there?  I was never manager of TRAFIPRO in Kibuye.  But the people who knew me are those like GKH; **********************************.  But the others, they said how they knew me.  I say that I never worked at TRAFIPRO in Kibuye, so the information they give was false.  They did not know me.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the -- you are charged with what happened in Kibuye.  This is not an Article 6(3) case about what happened in the ministry in Kigali, but still a lot of questioning in this case has referred to your functions at the central level in that field.  Is it your view that from the 6th of April to the middle of July that there were massacres committed in Rwanda?  What is your position when it comes to that question?
@A.
Well, my position on this issue is that I was accused of what happened at the Kibuye préfecture, what I did at the roadblocks, and in Gasharu and Gitwa.  My indictment is very detailed because I was even shown certain dates and locations that I thought I should speak about and defend myself concerning the charges -- allegations against me.  And I saw that the Prosecutor didn't want to talk about the indictment, he wanted to talk about something else, whereas, I had the duty to defend myself upon the basis of the indictment.  Now, had the indictment had been -- that the indictment were to be changed -- it should be changed on the basis of the procedure.  How can I defend myself against charges that are not brought against me?  If not, I would have prepared myself accordingly.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, but these are still questions that are floating in the air, and that's why you are asked these questions, so let me repeat it then: were massacres committed in Rwanda from around the 7th of April to about the middle of July.  What is your view there?  Is it a "yes" or a "no", or what is your view?  You were there.
@THE WITNESS:
The massacres were committed, but I really removed from any (interpretation unintelligible) responsibility.  I did not, in any shape, way or form, take part in those massacres.  But everybody knows those massacres took place and that it was deplorable and should be deplored by one and all.  But as far as my own responsibilities are concerned, the Prosecutor puts them in Kibuye, and it is about Kibuye that I should defend myself.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So, it is your position that that were massacres against Tutsi during those 100 days and some moderate Hutu?  Is that undisputed, in your view?
@A.
Mr. President, when one reveals what happened in that country, one cannot say that the massacres that took place were only targeting the Tutsi because there were many Hutu that were killed.  The RPF -- (interpretation unintelligible)... since the 6th of April in Jumba (phonetic), Kibungo, Kigali, in all those locations, even in Gitarama and Butare the RPF was there.  I therefore do not know, and I cannot say, it was only the Tutsi that were targeted because the killers came from two ethnic groups: the Hutu killed; the Tutsi killed; the RPF killed; the government forces also killed.  So that -- it was complete chaos, and we know that Tutsi were killed.  Hutu were killed as well.  This is my position.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, that is perfectly a legitimate position.  Everyone killed, many killed, but is it correct that people were killed because they were Tutsi during those 100 days?  Is that a correct statement, leaving aside that also other people were killed?  Of course, we don't discuss that now.  I just want your view on that particular element of the case, please.
@THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, people were killed because they were Tutsi.  First, the case of RPF; they killed because they were Hutu.  It was the ethnic groups that confronted one another, some killing the others.  Tutsi were killed -- they were killed because they were Tutsi.  That is a regrettable fact and I cannot call it into question.  Nobody can call that fact into question.  One should not attempt to do so.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think I'll leave it at that, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  And that leads us to the end of your examination.  Thank you, very much, indeed.
@THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, very much.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
You may now resume your seat.
Now, there are some other issues.  One is Mr. Phillips' Rule 46 motion versus Mr. Marçais, approximately four or five weeks ago.  The Chamber has considered it, the motion is dismissed.  A written ruling will be communicated very shortly.  So that matter has been dealt with.  
More complicated is the Rule 92 bis motion which we decided to come back to today.  Now, we'll have the chance to look into the matter, and I think we may need to ask some questions to both parties before we rule on that Rule 92 bis motion.  
So, Mr. Besnier, I wonder whether you could assist us a little bit with that motion?  Maybe you would like to introduce it very briefly and in view of the Prosecution's arguments, which we have now acquainted ourselves with -- how you look at the matter in that perspective, because the Prosecution has submitted arguments which you didn't really address in your motion.  Please do. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President.  I'm very grateful to you.  Yes, we filed this motion on the basis of Rule 92 bis concerning the admission of a written testimony.  That written testimony which was served to me by Witness DX is composed of several portions.  
The first portion could be described as the historical background.  The witness who was in charge of RPF intelligence, tells us his opinions about the 1994 genocide and the preceding events.  Another section is concerning the moral character, the moral standing of the Accused.  And then the third section, which is also separate, is as regards to the contents between the Accused and an ICTR investigator from 1996.  
Now, these three distinct portions appear to me to be all of equal relevance and importance as far as this particular Ndindabahizi case is concerned.  The historical background has been discussed by the experts, but more precisely, therefore, it is in a conformity with the provisions of Rule 92 bis (A)(a).  These are the cumulative aspect.  As far as the moral character of our case is concerned, as well, I believe it is admissible pursuant to 92 bis (A)(e), and the section deeming with conducts between Mr. Ndindabahizi and ICTR agents is also relevant because it deals with the context; that is to say pursuant to 92 bis (A)(b), and this element in itself is important and quite relevant for the Defence because, Mr. President, earlier on you raised a question, you put it to Mr. Ndindabahizi, and the question was: why, according to you, the witnesses of the Prosecution came to testify against you?  Now, here we have an element of response which is basic as already been explained by Mr. Ndindabahizi during his testimony.  He explains that DX confirmed that contacts had taken place and that there was manipulation of Mr. Ndindabahizi by the ICTR investigators; that was manipulation.  It was subsequent to the failure of the discussions between Ndindabahizi and the ICTR investigators that finally an indictment was prepared.  
Now that is probably the only explanation.  There must be other explanations that we will discuss later on, but at this particular point, we believe this testimony is indispensable as a document.  As far as other points are concerned, we believe that it is important for us to talk about the moral standing of the Accused and the special circumstances in which he worked before and after the genocide.  There's a final point of relevance in this document, Mr. President.  It is the fact that the; that is the witness, Witness DX claims that Ndindabahizi may have been given a ministerial post -- could have been given a ministerial post after 1994 had he been in Rwanda, but you know Mr. President -- Your Honours, that most of our argument grounded on the fact that up to the year 2001 nobody -- the historians, we had the legal experts, the politicians -- nobody has called to question Ndindabahizi's activities during the genocide and that element is a corroboration of what we have just adduced.  
So that in a nut shell, my argument says that these elements are quite relevant, that they have capital importance and that they do, entirely with the provisions of Rule 92 bis.  And I would add that they are pursuant to the conditions laid down by 92 bis (B) and I pray that this Court admits them.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But this statement which is of a size, of about 25 pages.  It characterises Mr. Ndindabahizi as a moderate timid person.  It states that it's very difficult that he would have been envisaged to participate in what he's accused of.  It states, on page 15 of the English version, that "I have serious doubts that he was personally involved in the killings".  Now, there may be other elements as well.  Does this not bring this declaration in a doubtful relationship to Rule 92 bis? 
@MR. BESNIER:
Certain parts of this declaration, undoubtedly, the Court will make a ruling.  But as far as the gist is concerned, the important aspect; that is character -- there are very positive appreciations here and Ndindabahizi could not, on the basis of his character, or on the basis of what the witnesses knew, could not have taken part in the massacres.  That is part of his character, and must be taken into account by the Court.  In light of the credibility of the witness, and the possibility or otherwise of his having taken part in which -- in events or activities that he's charged with.  That element should also be taken into account, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem is, of course, the lack of cross-examination.  That is the problem.
@MR. BESNIER:
I do appreciate your concern, Mr. President.  I would have liked to get that witness here before this Court.  Unfortunately, that was not possible for practical reasons, for reasons pertaining to the activities of the witness which I shall not dwell upon.  But we did everything we could to bring him, and in default of that we thought that it was indispensable that his testimony be heard.  Of course, it is up to this Court to make a determination on the testimony considering what the witness said and considering also the fact that the Prosecutor cannot cross-examine.  This is, of course, the responsibility of the Bench.

1530H
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now assume that this document falls inside the field of application of Rule 92 (bis).  Then you have a document which is substantially in conformity with the provision.  You filed it within the necessary deadlines and, according to you, the Prosecutor did not respond within the deadline provided by 92(E).  
Now, on this procedural aspect, you kindly referred us to the Kayishema and Ruzindana decision of the 1st of June 2001, yesterday.  And now we have that document in front of us, and it's useful reading.  
Now, paragraph 47 of that document, first of all, maybe there are distinctions to be made between that case, on the one hand, and the 92 bis (E) situation, as indicated by the Prosecutor on the other, because the situation was different there.  It was the Prosecution that on two occasions decided not to send the documents, in spite of the deadlines fixed by the Appeals Chamber.  
Now, looking at paragraph 47, you will see that the third sentence there gives an opening-up.  It is stated that the Prosecutor did not demonstrate good cause for any of these failures, good cause.  So here is a popular loophole in relation to deadlines.  The question could be raised whether the situation, as argued by the Prosecution, is not a good cause.  It was slightly touched upon in one of my questions yesterday, but here it is more explicit.  It is a clear reference by the Appeals Chamber.  
May I have your view on that, please. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, Mr. President, I fully go along with you.  It is correct that this ruling of the Appeals Chamber does not specifically cover the issue at hand.  After all, at the time we were dealing with an appeal, a memorandum, here and the case is different.  In spite of that, paragraph 46, the penultimate sentence refers to note No. 53.  That note, 53, refers to several rulings in jurisprudence, not only concerning the appeal, but also concerning the general characteristics of time frame as far as criminal law is concerned.  I believe that the Appeals Chamber in the Kayishema case wanted to make a ruling in a general fashion, a ruling applicable to all litigation, as far as time frames are concerned, to ensure that the procedure is stable within the Tribunal.  This is number one.
Now, if we take it, and I believe just as you, Mr. President, that the Prosecution should be able to justify the reasons for his being time-barred, and probably justification may bring the Court to on the make a contrary ruling -- but what are the reasons by the Prosecution yesterday?  He admitted having received the documents.  He admitted having received the document on time.  He didn't give any explanations in default of -- because, however, did he not respond simply, because he said the document was in French.  
I do remember, Mr. President -- I do not have the decision here with me, but I do remember that a ruling of the first Trial Chamber, Trial Chamber I, had set aside a motion for time frame extension from the Prosecution, and I was told that the Prosecution should deal with information contained in documents, both in English and in French, so that because of the fact that the Prosecution is saying it couldn't respond to a motion because the document was in French, that is not a sufficient ground.  It is not good cause to allow the Trial Chamber to extend the time frame. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Mr. Kapaya, you have heard the Defence.  You have provided a written response.  Do you have anything you want to add in view of what you have written and in view of what we have heard?  Or Mr. Phillips. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'll make some representations, and Mr. Kapaya can roundup on the good cause issue.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do that.  
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the issue here is that the provisions of Rule 92 bis clearly states that you, as a Trial Chamber, may admit this document so long as it goes to the proof of a matter, other than acts which concern the conduct of the Accused as charged in the indictment.  Well, the fact here is that the entire indictment is being challenged.  The essence of the statement which my learned friend seeks to admit in evidence, challenges the entire indictment.  He says that that indictment was procured by fraud, at best.  And that is a matter which certainly is falls out of the ambit of Rule 92 (bis), regardless of the fact that there are other channels to challenge an indictment before the Tribunal.  But I leave that aside.  
But, in essence, if you look at the provisions of Rule 92 bis, if you are actually challenging the essence and the very legal basis of an indictment, and you are alleging that this indictment was procured by fraud, then it naturally falls outside the ambit of that Rule, in my respectful submission.  
Now, if you leave that aside and you look at the decision of the Appeals Chamber as out lined in paragraph 6, in the motion drafted by my learned colleague Wallace Kapaya, the Prosecutor vs. Galic, the ICTY case, it is stated by Mr. Kapaya that the Appeals Chamber interpreted the conduct, the phrase, the conduct, of the accused to encompass the state of mind, relevant state of mind, of the accused.  
Now, I note my learned friends, my learned colleague's submissions in his brief, but let's look at paragraph 7 of that brief.  I'm putting aside the state of the accused, or the state of mind of the accused.  But if you look at paragraph 71, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was a moderate and politically timid.  Well, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was appointed minister under the PSD ticket because there was no one else to fill the post.  
Now, if you run through a lot of these submissions in the summary of this Witness DX's statement, it challenges the Prosecution's case in its very essence, because we all know that for every crime that we have to prove in this Tribunal, especially that of genocide, there is the actus reus, and of course there is the mens rea.  And for the charge of genocide, the mens rea, the intent to destroy in whole or in part, is the very essence of that crime. 
Now, if you have a witness statement that then challenges the accused's state of mind at the time, you are essentially challenging a case as to whether or not he had the requisite mens rea.  And in essence, then, the contents of that statement clearly fall outside the ambit of Rule 92 bis because it's charged in the indictment.  The crime is charged, and the mens rea forms the very basis of the crime of genocide. 
Finally, as far as I am concerned, it's curious to observe that the Defence list of witnesses doesn't even contain any indication about Witness DX, not even to say that they had tried to procure his attendance in this court and had failed.  At a minimum, the Defence owes it, out of courtesy to the Prosecution or indeed to the Bench, to say that at a practical level we have been trying to procure the attendance of a particular witness.  For reasons best to him, he is unable to attend in anticipation of presenting this motion.  
Now, what we say in relation to good cause -- and Mr. Kapaya can carry on from here -- is that we don't say that we didn't respond to the motion because it was in French.  Our submission was simply this.  The proof of service of that motion shows that it wasn't received by either Mr. Kapaya or myself, and both of us form the trial team, in essence, until very recently when we were joined by younger colleagues.  And the explanation for that is simple.  The motion was received by the team's secretary.  Knowing that neither Mr. Kapaya nor myself speaks French, she kept it in her office and sent it off for translation.  The essence was not that we didn't respond because it was in French, but in essence it was not brought to our attention, and that is completely different.  We can only respond to something that is brought to our attention.
Now, being that neither Mr. Kapaya nor myself spoke French, she sent the document off for translation.  She would only have brought it to my attention when the English translation arrived.  Now, had I seen the document in French, I may have made a different judgment call.  I may have said, "Have it translated," or, "Do this with it," but it was never brought to my attention.  Neither was it brought to Mr. Kapaya's attention.
I will leave Mr. Kapaya to answer the rest of your queries.  I am grateful, Your Honour. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you Mr. Phillips. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  Just a few remarks, Your Honour.  In addition to the problem of notice with which Mr. Phillips has talked about, I think this Tribunal has discretion to say that substantive is done.  So we urge the Tribunal to not to allow issues of procedural justice to override substantive justice.  So for that reason, we request that the failure to respond in time not be considered as a serious matter not to consider our submissions. 
Now, the other issue relates to, as Mr. Besnier has said, to character.  He says that the witness statement talks about the character of the accused.  But before that is done, we think that's why we pray that the witness be called for cross-examination.  We should be able to ask that witness the background, the basis, for which he left Rwanda.  Why did he leave Rwanda?  We understand what he was doing between January '94 to August '95, when he suddenly fled.  Why?  The Chamber should be in a position to know the circumstances that led him to leave Rwanda before he can speak about the character of other people.  
And again, as regards the contacts with other people, the witness alleges in that statement that he was blackmailed, that he was manhandled, and that kind of thing.  So he implicates other people who were not before this Tribunal.  He implicates several investigators of the Tribunal as to what transpired.  So it's important, Your Honours, that if you think that you may wish to act on this statement, then the witness should be subpoenaed to come and testify here, at least for purposes of cross-examination.  It is submitted that he cannot make -- he has refused to come.  Why should he refuse to come?  I think the Chamber has powers, under Rule 54, to summon, to subpoena a witness to come and testify.  And I believe his security can be guaranteed.  There is no problem about that.  
And, again, it is not the function of the Prosecution, but the Defence may have considered exploring the provisions of Rule 71.  But they wish, for instance, to file a -- to ask for a deposition.  And we could have prepared our questions, or somebody could have represented us in the place where this witness is staying, then we could put our questions there.  Mr. Besnier could have put his questions there, and then we get a fair deal.  
So for those reasons, Your Honour, we request that the motion be dismissed, and if it is not dismissed, then we request that the witness be available for cross-examination by the Prosecution.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
@JUDGE KHAN:
What is the normal -- Mr. Prosecutor, what is the normal procedure for the service of the motion? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Essentially, Your Honour, it is for the registry, who accepts the motion, to actually ensure that that motion is translated into two official languages of the Tribunal.  That is the position I take.  As an office, we endeavour to have people who speak both languages in every trial team. We, for one, have not had that luxury until fairly recently, when Miss Lauriston joined us, and that was in the month of October.  So essentially, yes, there are two working languages.  We try to work as best in both.  But I would say it is the registry who should endeavour that I receive the document in both official languages, having been filed in either one of them. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything more to be said?  
I was a bit worried about the remark here, Mr. Besnier, because Mr. Phillips here pointed out, and he seems to be absolutely right, that Witness DX is not on the list of witnesses that we were provided with in this folder.  So are you not under an obligation, first, to apply under Rule 73 ter to vary your witnesses?  And you haven't done that.  So this is a last-minute witness of which we are being informed through a 92 bis motion. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, if the Prosecutor had responded within seven days to my motion, perhaps we would have had the time to modify our list.  Perhaps we would have had the time to ask the Court to hear the witness.  But today, very last day of my case, I'm obligated to explain myself, and we had three weeks, and perhaps a month, to do so.  Perhaps I could have done some things.  Consequently, this is sad to see the Prosecutor explain, through his own interns or staff, that he wasn't able to respond.  
If our motion is rejected, we'll have no other way of getting to listen to this witness.  It will be our last one.  That's all I can say for now, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Your witness refused to come? 
@MR. BESNIER:
To tell you the truth, he did, Mr. President. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
This is the last issue, possibly, in this trial.  The documents were received late.  The Judges will now simply take a break of about 10, 15 minutes, and then we come back and rule on the matter.  So you will have, both parties, clarity immediately, but we would wish to reflect a little bit upon this decision before we make a ruling.  So the Court is adjourned for 15 minutes.  
Yes, Mrs. Ben Salimo, please?
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Mr. President, the registry would like to underscore that Counsel Besnier filed the document on the 27th.  On that same day, the 27th, the Registry handed that document -- served the document on both the Bench and the Prosecution.  
The registry, if it does not hand the document on one of the parties, needs to inform the registry of failure of service.  The registry, therefore, does not accept the proposition that it failed in its duties.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think that has been argued by anyone.  The issue is the situation within the Prosecution team.  And thank you for that clarification, Mrs. Ben Salimo.  
Fifteen minutes, then.

@MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have taken a while to deliberate, and here follows the oral decision:  This Chamber is seized with a motion for admission of a witness statement under Rule 92 bis.  The motion relates to Witness DX,  which has reported difficulties due to his state of health, safety and professional obligations to testify in Arusha and he finally refused to travel to testify.  
This motion was filed on the 27th of October.  The Prosecution responded on the 27th of November, following a communication problem within the Prosecution and a need for translation.   
As well known the point of departure is of course that the evidence shall be given as oral testimony before the Court when it comes to witnesses, but there are exceptions and one of them of Rule 92 bis.  According to that provision, the Chamber may admit in, whole or in part, the evidence of a witness in the form of a written statement in lieu of oral testimony which goes to proof of a matter other than the acts and conduct of the Accused as charged in the indictment.  
So the first question that the Chamber has to decide on is whether the statement offered by the Defence from Witness DX follows within the scope of Rule 92 bis.  
It is a considerable statement.  It amounts to twenty-six pages in the English translations, and the Chamber has looked through it and in particular focused whether the evidence offered can be seen to go to the act and conduct of the Accused. 
The Chamber has found elements in this document which cause problems in relation to the admissibility under Rule 92 bis.   Let me draw the attention of the parties to those sections we find    particularly problematic.  There is the reference on page 9, last paragraph, to Mr. Ndindabahizi being a moderate a bit timid politically timid person of a high profile, activist, et cetera.  It is true that you could argue that this is character evidence which is something which is allowed under Rule 92 bis (E), but it could also well be argued that this goes to the heart of the case.  So it is too easy say that this is only character evidence.  
Page 15 of the English version contains a large paragraph about the interim government and a statement that the government included people who were not extremists, how they should have behaved et cetera and then comes again a reference to Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, where the witness states that he was politically too weak, very timid, fearful, and the witness has serious doubts that Mr. Ndindabahizi was personally involved in the killings.  
Thirdly, page 19 of the statement, there the witness says that, "Unless otherwise proven, I am convinced that he did not participate in any massacre," and then the witness starts discussing why 
Mr. Ndindabahizi did not denounce the massacres but at any rate he concludes that he is convinced that he was within the system like a hostage and "I am also convinced that he did not kill any person".
Now, these paragraphs are of such a character that they do not fall under the admission procedure of 92 bis.
Now, there are other parts of this document which points more to the background.  The problem is that some of the elements also, if they do not go to the act and conduct of the Accused, still raise problems in relation to Rule 92 bis, and here I come to the second problematic issue after having first discussed whether there are elements in this statement which cannot be reconciled with 92 bis.
The second issue which we are discussing now is the fact that the Trial Chamber may admit, in whole or in part the evidence of a witness in the form of a written statement.  What the Chamber is referring to here, is that when exercising its discretion, this main Rule under 92 (A), it will take into account the need for cross-examination and we have noted in this document several matters which calls for cross-examination, such as page 7, when it is a matter of how the witness left Rwanda; at page 18 and 20, about Mr. Ndindabahizi's relationships to colleagues in various governments and also the parts concerning the legitimacy of the investigation by ICTR employees and the assertion that the Accused was subjected to some kind of blackmail.  These are all elements where 
cross-examination would be feasible.  
There is still the possibility whether there are other parts of this document could be admitted but the -- and the Chamber has looked into that.  But our conclusion is that having now singled out both those which only with difficulty or which clearly cannot be reconciled with 92 bis and then the second group where we do not think that it would be proper for us under the main rule to admit it without cross-examination, seeing all this in context with the rest of the statement, we find it difficult to select remaining portions because everything is intertwined.  So it has been very difficult for us to split them into parts which we could admit. 
Therefore, under Rule 92 bis, we have reached the conclusion that we cannot accept this document.  In view of the discussion between the parties concerning this witness's late appearance, we have seen that, in fact, it was rather late that the witness stated that he could not travel to Arusha and that the Defence quickly tabled a motion under Rule 92 bis.  
Our point now is that it is true, it is true that in the Defence's list of witnesses, Witness DX does not appear, but we do not hold this against the Defence because when the Defence filed its document with the registry concerning the witnesses, it intended to call, it was already clear to the Defence that this witness in this particular country could not call and therefore the only road open to the Defence apparently must have been the Rule 92 bis option.  So we do not hold that against the Defence.  
With this conclusion, the question doesn't arise whether the Prosecution's response is timely under Rule 92 bis (E), and we do not have to decide that matter.  
So this is the decision of the Chamber. I don't think the significance of this decision one way or the other should be exaggerated, and the motion is then dismissed.  
Is there anything else to be said in the case?  If there is not, we are now awaiting a sentence from the Defence counsel.  
Do you have an announcement to make, Mr. Besnier?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  The Defence hereby closes its case.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
@MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  This implies that the trial of Mr. Ndindabahizi has now come to an end.  I would like to thank both parties, both the Prosecution and the Defence, for the efficiency and timeliness in producing evidence during this case.  We have heard a considerable of witnesses since the case started on the 1st of September, and it ends today.  
Thank you also to all staff who have contributed to the efficient functioning of the trial.  Thank you.  
We will now go into a closed status conference and discuss very briefly the calendar issues to be followed when it comes to the closing arguments, and the calendar will then be announced to be public as soon as this has been agreed upon between the Bench and the parties.  Thank you.  So we are now moving into a status conference.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.  We are now at the stage of closing arguments in the Ndindabahizi case.  I see that everyone is present. 
The Prosecution, you have the floor.  Please go ahead.  Do you have an estimate for your oral closing argument?  We have, of course, received the written documents from both parties which have also now been translated.
Mr. Phillips? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we probably will take some three hours.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Please go ahead.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon to everyone in the court.  Mr. Kapaya and I will be addressing Your Honours this afternoon in relation to the closing arguments.
I will be dealing with some very brief remarks in relation to the law as it applies to the counts, the three counts in the indictment.  I will then try, as best as possible, to discuss the factual allegations as adduced by Prosecution witnesses in line with the elements of the crimes and the general context in which the events occurred.
My learned friend and brother, Mr. Kapaya, will deal with the responses -- our responses to the matters raised by the Defence in their brief including, but certainly not limited to, matters concerning the various counts in the indictment and the factual allegations contained therein.
If I may start, Your Honours, the Defence do not dispute that genocide occurred in Rwanda between April, May, and June 1994.  Indeed, I would represent to Your Honours that it will be extremely surprising if they did because then one would be tempted to ask, why are we all here? 
In that regard, Your Honours, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, the former minister of finance in the interim government in Rwanda in 1994, is charged in Count 1 of the indictment with the crime of genocide, for the killing and causing of serious bodily and mental harm to members of the Tutsi population with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group.
In order for the Prosecution to prove that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi committed the crime of genocide, the Prosecution must establish that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi killed and caused serious bodily and mental harm to members of the Tutsi population with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, that group, Tutsi ethnic group.
Consequently, there are two elements to that crime of genocide.  First is the objective element, which in common law we would refer to as the actus reus, requiring more -- one or more genocidal acts to be committed.  Then the second is the subjective element requiring a particular mental state, which is the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part.
In that regard, Your Honours, it is not disputed, at least not as far as I am aware, that Tutsis were killed at many, if not all, the locations that are charged in the present indictment.  The issue in dispute as between the parties is whether or not the Accused participated in the said killings as outlined in the indictment.
Certainly we will consider the extent and degree of his participation when we discuss the allegations in the indictment vis-à-vis our submissions in chapter 3 of our closing brief, but I need to address you on the specific requirement for genocide which is indeed unique to that crime.  And in that regard, I represent to Your Honours that the special intent as required for the crime of genocide must require that the perpetrator intended the result charged.
I would also represent to Your Honours that the intent of an accused person in this regard can be inferred from a certain number of presumptions of fact, and it is hardly never specifically pleaded in an indictment.  To that end, I would also represent to Your Honours that it is possible for you to deduce the genocidal intent inherent in a particular act charged from the general context of the perpetration of all the culpable acts systematically directed against the same group, whether these acts were committed by the same offender or by others.
There are other factors, Your Honours, that would indicate genocidal intent.  These are the scale of the atrocities committed, their general nature, and the systematic targeting of victims on account of their membership of a particular group.
To that end, Your Honours, our submissions in chapter 4 of our closing brief seeks to do just that.  In what numbers 119 paragraphs, spread over 22 pages, the Prosecutor has painstakingly articulated the general context in which the Accused perpetrated the crimes alleged in the indictment.
By the time we're finished with the presentation of our argument at the end of today, Your Honours would find that the contents of chapter 4 are indeed a lot more than mere speculation or assertions as my learned friend for the Defence has alleged in his brief.  They are certainly not an unbridled exercise of intellectual speculation but, rather, the underlying context which form the basis for the many allegations in the indictment.
Chapter 4, therefore, of our brief, therefore, provides you as Judges with sufficient evidence that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi possessed the requisite intent to commit genocide.  The contents of that paragraph describe a pattern of purposeful action over a three-month period, and yes, it includes circumstantial evidence.
A few words about the charge of crime against humanity, murder and extermination, in Counts 2 and 3.  It is our case that there exists in this matter all the necessary elements to prove that crimes against humanity were committed by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Gitwa hill, Gasharu cellule and other areas in and around Kibuye préfecture between April and June 1994.  In this regard, Your Honours, it is the Prosecution's case that the allegations outlined at paragraphs 20, 21, 25, 27, and 28 of the indictment were committed in the context of widespread and systematic attacks on Tutsi in Rwanda generally and, in particular, within Kibuye préfecture during the periods alleged in the indictment.
It is also our case, Your Honours, that the attacks on Tutsi civilians were carried out in a systematic manner and as part of a prearranged, broader policy or plan instigated and directed by the central government and evidence of which consisted in the modus operandi set out in our pretrial brief.
It is also the Prosecution's case, Your Honours, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had knowledge that his conduct, as alleged in the paragraphs I outlined to you, formed part of that wider attack.
It is the Prosecution's case that the evidence that has been adduced by witnesses, Prosecution witnesses, indicates that the attacks in Rwanda, and in particular, those in Kibuye, were directed and aimed at a civilian population.  The evidence further adduced shows that most of the victims were indeed Tutsi civilians, and they consisted of ordinary peasant farmers and those seeking refuge from attacks.  They included the elderly, woman, and children.
Finally, it is our case, as far as crimes against humanity is concerned, that the attacks against Tutsi in Kibuye préfecture were carried out against Tutsi based on their ethnicity.
A few words about the individual responsibility of Mr. Ndindabahizi as charged in the indictment and our position on the modes of participation.  In relation to the offences outlined in the indictment, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is alleged to be individually responsible for the said crimes pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Statute by either having planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation, and execution of the said crimes.
I represent to Your Honours that despite the general characterisation of the Accused's conduct in the indictment, we have taken a view that for the most part, the appropriate legal characterisation of the Accused's conduct is that of instigation and aiding and abetting, and that is with the exception of one event at Gitwa hill between 17th and 20th April 1994.
Having said that, the Trial Chamber is free to depart from a particular theory of liability advanced by the Prosecution under Article 6(1) if the mode of liability that the Trial Chamber deems correct has been included in the indictment and is within the confines of Article 6(1) of the Statute.
The Prosecutor further submits that the responsibility of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as charged under Article 6(1) of the Statute can only be direct.  There is, therefore, in our view, no substantial difference as to his culpability under the diverse forms of participation envisaged by Article 6(1) as outlined above, but, rather, the degree of his participation in the alleged crimes may instead be considered by the Trial Chamber as a factor in determining the appropriate sentence following his conviction.
In adopting the position that I've outlined to Your Honours, we would represent that the Accused suffers no prejudice as he has been put on sufficient notice through the Prosecutor's pleading of Article 6(1) that any of the theories of direct responsibility could apply. 
Having represented to Your Honours that we have agreed on the appropriate legal characterisation as being one of instigation and aiding and abetting, for the most part, I will say a few words on the elements that Your Honours ought to be looking out for as you hear my summaries of the evidence of Prosecution witnesses adduced before this Court.
The mode of participation, of instigation, and indeed aiding and abetting, are both forms of accomplice liability.  In other words, they're forms of complicity.  Instigation itself would only give rise to liability in circumstances where a person, though not directly participating in the crime of genocide, gave instruction to commit genocide through gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority, and other ways and directly incited people to commit genocide.  In essence, instigation is that the accused caused another person or other persons to commit a crime.  In that regard, it need not be proved that the crime would not have been committed at all if the accused had not instigated it.  That's not a requirement.  It need only be proved that the instigation was a clear contributing factor to the commission of the crime.
It is further submitted, Your Honours, that where the elements of the actus reus of the crime is performed by more than one person, it is in our view unnecessary to prove that the Accused instigated the conduct of all the persons that perpetrated the crime.  It is, in our view, sufficient that the Accused instigated the conduct of only one of them.
To be criminally liable for instigating a crime, we would represent to Your Honours that it is not necessary to prove that any of the persons executing a plan -- executing the plan had the requisite mens rea.  In that regard, we would represent to Your Honours that a person can be criminally liable for instigating even though no one, no one is criminally liable in respect of its execution.
As we discuss the factual allegations, Your Honours will understand how this will play out in reality.  However, there must be a causal link and a causal connection between the instigation and the execution of the crime.  In terms of the various forms that instigations can take, we would represent to Your Honours that instigation could take a simple form of a persuasion, for instance, by appealing to another person's patriotic duty or by appealing to the other person's personal or family loyalty to the instigator.  Could be a promise, could be a reward.
A few words about aiding and abetting.  We would represent to Your Honours that to be guilty of participation under 6(1) for aiding and abetting, the Accused -- we would have to show that the Accused by his conduct directly and substantially contributed to the commission of an offence by another person.  Indeed, the mens rea of aiding and abetting is satisfied if we can show Your Honours that the Accused knew that his conduct would substantially contribute to the commission by another person of a crime, or at least that he was aware of the substantial likelihood that this would be an adequate consequence of his conduct.
It then follows from the above, Your Honours, that a person can only be responsible for aiding and abetting when a crime is actually committed.  So generally, to be liable for aiding and abetting, the conduct of the accused needs to materially assist, encourage, or support the perpetrator in the commission of the crime.
Now, provided the assistance is direct and substantial, Your Honours, the degree to which it aided in the commission of the crime would only be relevant to sentencing and not to the culpability of the accused.  In essence, there are two distinct concepts to aiding and abetting.  Aiding meaning giving assistance and abetting involving facilitation. 
Another concept that we would like to explore is the concept of presence at the scene of a crime as a part of our discussions in aiding and abetting.  Even though mere presence at the scene of a crime, Your Honours, is not per se sufficient to render an accused liable for aiding and abetting, presence during the commission of a crime can constitute abetting if it has an encouraging effect on the perpetrators or gives them moral support, psychological support, or has a significant legitimising or encouraging effect on the principals, in other words, those who are actually committing the offence.  And this is so even though the accused takes no active part and provides no material assistance.
Finally, Your Honours, aiding and abetting as a form of participation under 6(1) does not require a preexisting plan or arrangement to engage in the criminal conduct in question.  To be liable for aiding and abetting, the accused need not know precisely who the perpetrators of the crime will be or who the specific victims will be.
Turning now to the factual allegations, Your Honours, in the indictment, I will start discussing the roadblocks and then go on to the other events.  In that regard, Your Honours, there are four events concerning such roadblocks which have been specifically pleaded in support of the genocide charge at paragraphs 8 to 13 of the indictment and have also been pleaded at paragraphs 17 to 19 of our pretrial brief. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, before you go on to the specific parts, will you or Mr. Kapaya later on come back to chapter 4 of the brief, or have you dealt with that now, having stressed the need for the Chamber to look at the context?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would discuss it as part of the factual allegations, unless you want me to deal with it specifically here.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  I will wait until you get back to it.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
The four events concerning the roadblocks have been pleaded in those two documents, the indictment and in the pretrial brief, and we would represent that before you even start to appreciate the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses in this regard, you will first have to understand the context in which the Accused was present at the roadblock.  In that regard, we would refer you to paragraph 74 of part 4 of the closing brief, and the Prosecution in that regard would represent to the Trial Chamber that all the criminal activities of the Accused, as adduced by our witnesses and alleged in the indictment, during the months of April, May, and June 1994, can be directly tied with many of the transitional government policies at the time.
In considering the general issue concerning roadblocks, before you consider the evidence, the two issues arise for you as Judges to consider.  The first is this:  Consider what the use and general purpose of roadblocks were in 1994.  What was the purpose and content of the civil defence programme?  And in that regard, I would refer you again to paragraphs 38 to 43 and paragraph 53 of our pretrial brief.  I would also refer Your Honours to the introductory page of Prosecution Exhibit 
P. 21A and B, that is Madam Des Forges expert report, and also at page 21 of Prosecution Exhibit 
P. 21A and B.  In that regard, you will find that the expert relied on by the Prosecution in this case outlined in no small measure the various measures adopted by the interim government in executing the genocide.
Then there's a third document and that is Prosecution Exhibit P. 49.  That document, Your Honours, contains a plea agreement between Jean Kambanda and the office of the Prosecutor.  It also includes the judgement and sentence of this Trial Chamber following his plea of guilty.
In that document, Your Honours are specifically requested to refer to paragraphs 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 38, and 39 of the plea agreement itself, and paragraphs 39(ii), (iii), (v), (viii), and (xi) of the judgement.  Finally, Your Honours, we would also refer you to paragraphs 74 and -- 74 to 78 of chapter 4 of our closing brief.
A reading of all the references that I provided Your Honours with would give you a very clear indication of the context in which roadblocks were set up, the context in which such roadblocks were manned, and a general idea of the sort of activities that went on at such barriers during the time relevant to this indictment. 
Now, having read that as a background, Your Honours would then want to consider the specific allegations in this case that concern the Accused vis-à-vis the various roadblocks that he was seen at.  In that regard, can I start off by discussing the events at Fayer in Kayenzi secteur in May 1994 and point out, first of all, to Your Honours regrettably that we -- there's an -- there's an error in our brief, and it's rightly pointed out by my learned friend for the Defence, that if you turn to page 10 at the beginning of the Prosecution's case, the first heading on page 10 in the English version in paragraph 1 above, that should actually have referred to Fayer roadblock in May, because the discussion of that is Witness CGK, and she certainly was not at Gituku or Gasharu roadblock, and we apologise for this error.  Indeed, the discussion of the Gituku/Gasharu roadblock starts from paragraph 4 and the evidence of Witness CGB.  So we have included the summary of CGK but have labelled it wrongly, and we apologise for that. 
Considering the events at the Fayer roadblock in Kayenzi secteur in May, the Prosecutor relies on the evidence of witness CGK in support of the factual allegations made in paragraphs 13 and 25 of the indictment.  CGT was a Tutsi woman, and she testified to seeing the Accused at the roadblock at Fayer at the beginning of May 1994.
There are some striking elements to her testimony, and they are as follows:  She is close enough to the location where she sees the Accused.  And I'll deal with identification issues later, but the striking elements are this, which runs through all the testimony of Prosecution witnesses:  Witness saw two vehicles arrive at this location.  She describes one as a black vehicle and the other as a green Daihatsu.  She then sees the Accused and two other persons coming out of one of these vehicles or maybe both of them.  She testifies to seeing machetes in the Daihatsu, which is following the vehicle she describes as a black one. And what does the Accused do?  Well, the witness would have you believe and she testifies that she heard the Accused ask persons in charge of that roadblock if they had finished killing Tutsi, and that when they answered him that Tutsi women that had been married to Hutu men had been spared, the Accused gave the order to kill everyone.  She then saw machetes in the Daihatsu being off-loaded and distributed amongst those who manned the roadblock.  That's the essence of CGKs testimony.
Identification issues:  You will recall that CGK testified that she was five metres from the roadblock, approximately five metres from the Accused.  Now, let me address that.  Five metres is -- in our context might seem a bit bizarre, and indeed my learned friend for the Defence interrogated her at length over this.
I will draw Your Honours' attention to the cultural and educational background of Witness CGK.  Did she strike you as someone who knows what five metres was like?  Had she ever been to school?  Did she measure?  Ten years after the fact, how does she come to about five metres? 
These are factors that we would urge Your Honours, and we have done so in chapter 1 of our closing brief, to consider when you consider the evidence of a lot of the Prosecution witnesses.  She may well have been a witness of truth but may have been mistaken as to the length of the distance between herself and the Accused. 
What is important, however, is that Witness CGK testified that she had prior knowledge of the Accused.  She had no problem identifying the Accused at all because she knew him before 1994.  In fact, she testified that she used to see him in the 1990s when he used to visit his parents at Gitaka centre.  That's her evidence. 
In terms of the Defence case, to my mind, no witnesses have been called by the Defence to challenge the evidence of Witness CGK.  Rather, they have based their challenge on her credibility and the credibility of her testimony in view of the five metres' distance that she claimed was between herself and the Accused.  I have dealt with the issues of the educational and cultural background of this witness and indeed many other witnesses. 
With respect to the individual criminal responsibility of the Accused in relation to this event, we say that it is the Prosecution's case that by conveying machetes in a Daihatsu vehicle or in any vehicle at all to the Fayer roadblock, by distributing the said machetes to attackers at the Fayer roadblock to use in killing Tutsis at the beginning of May 1994, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi directly and substantially contributed to the killing of Tutsi civilians at the Fayer roadblock and, therefore, incurs liability for having aided in the commission of the offences in Count 1 of the indictment.
It is further submitted that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi knew, he had knowledge that by conveying machetes in a vehicle to the roadblock -- to the roadblock at Fayer, such conduct would materially assist the said attackers in the killing of Tutsis.  You don't convey machetes in a vehicle at a roadblock and not expect that they will be used in killing Tutsis if you consider the general context of the events in Rwanda in early May.
It is also the Prosecution's case that Ndindabahizi's presence amongst those manning Fayer roadblock before or during the evidence of Witness CGK in early May must have had a significant legitimising and encouraging effect on those persons, and he was aware that his presence as a minister of finance, or any minister at all in the interim government, was likely to have that effect.  You don't arrive at a roadblock in early May 1994 in a chauffeur-driven government vehicle, challenge those at the roadblock, distribute machetes to them, and not expect it to have an effect on them.  The elements of instigation do not require us to prove that he was present when those who he distributed machetes to used them.  It is enough that he instigated those at the roadblock.
We would further represent to Your Honours that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi incurs criminal responsibility for aiding in the execution of the crimes outlined in Count 1 of the indictment; and in relation to that, it is our case that whatever happened at Fayer roadblock after he distributed weapons there to Tutsis was done in the context of the widespread and systematic attack on Tutsi civilians.
Ndindabahizi is also guilty of instigating those who were manning the roadblock by telling them, once he was told that Tutsi woman married to Hutu men had been spared, to kill everyone.  That is tantamount to instigation.  He does not -- we do not have to prove that he was there when those attackers went ahead and killed Tutsi.  He instigated them in the knowledge that they were likely to react to his instigation.
This has to be seen -- his conduct at Fayer again has to be seen in the context of his position as a minister in the government.  He was recognised as such.  He was a minister in the government, and in that regard, we would ask you to cross-reference the evidence of Witness CGK on Fayer to that of the expert again and Witness DN, which is a -- who is a Defence witness.  And the particular paragraphs that we're interested in you considering goes back to chapter 4, paragraph 85 of chapter 4, 86 and 87 of chapter 4 of the closing brief.
In that regard, Your Honours, Ndindabahizi's comments about the need to get rid of Tutsi women married to Tutsi (sic) men has to be seen in context because Madam Des Forges told us, Your Honours, that at some stage during the genocide, Tutsi women married to Hutu men had been spared.  It's there in paragraph 85.  I won't repeat it.  She gives us the reason why they were spared.
Then in paragraph 86 of our closing brief in chapter 4, she says the policy changed.  The policy changed, and those who had not been killed were then hunted down.  When did the policy change, Your Honour?  Sometime around mid-May, she said, 1994.  "Kill all of them regardless of age or gender"; that was her testimony.
Interestingly enough, Witness DN, a Defence witness, corroborates our expert, and in response to a question from the Presiding Judge, he testified how in mid-May following the death of most Tutsis there was a manhunt and a cleaning-out operation where specific Tutsi were targeted, having escaped the killings as of that date.
So again, we see the criminal activities of the Accused at Fayer in the context of the overall government policy at the time. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But now you refer to the change of policy towards the end or mid-May.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And the utterance here is about the Tutsi women, and the utterance is done at Fayer roadblock at the beginning of May.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the -- I was going to address the issue as to timing.  Many of the submissions that we would make, and we will come across this on several occasions in this case, our submissions simply are this:  It is almost impossible for any human being ten years after the events to remember with any degree of specificity when an event occurred.  The best we can hope for is that someone can situate it, a month, at the beginning or the end.  Some people are better at recollecting more than others, but we would represent to Your Honours, and it is our case, that regardless of the fact that Witness CGK put this event at the beginning -- sorry, early May or beginning of May 1994, the activities of the Accused as outlined by her have to be seen in the context of the changing government policy at the time.  I wouldn't go as far as representing to Your Honours that Witness CGK was mistaken as to the date, but I would only ask that you have an open mind, considering her educational background and considering that she didn't have a diary or a Filofax or any particular reason to note the particular date.  She remembers the events, she remembers that it was in the month of May, and we would represent to Your Honours that that should suffice in relation to the matters we're dealing with here.
Can I then go on to the second roadblock event which I want to talk about, and that is the Gaseke roadblock, again in the month of May.  The Prosecutor relies on the evidence of Witness CGC in support of this factual allegation. 
And, actually, before I actually start talking about Gaseke, just to finish my submissions in relation to Witness CGK, I would represent to Your Honours that if you believe Witness CGK, if you believe her testimony in relation to what she heard and saw at Fayer, then you have to find that this Accused committed genocide by instigating and aiding and abetting those at Fayer roadblock at Kayenzi secteur in early May.  On the basis of one event, on the basis of a single event in the indictment, one single paragraph, based on the evidence of a single witness, you can find this Accused guilty of genocide.  There is no requirement in law for corroboration.
Going to Gaseke roadblock and the evidence of Witness CGC:  in support of the factual allegations that we have made in paragraphs 11 and 25 of the indictment, CGC has a better recollection than CGK in relation to dates, Your Honours will be pleased to find, and on the 20th of May he says at a roadblock at Gaseke, which is on the road from Kibuye to Kigali between Kayenzi, K-A-Y-E-N-Z-E (sic), and Ruragwe, R-U-R-A-G-W-E, Kayenzi and Ruragwe secteurs in Gitesi commune, this is where CGC says he saw the Accused.  The Accused arrived in a white vehicle from the direction of Kibuye heading in the direction of Kigali.  He saw three people aboard this vehicle but testified that only the chauffeur and Accused alighted from the vehicle at the roadblock.
What did CGC see the Accused do at Gaseke roadblock on the 20th of May?  He saw the Accused and the driver of that vehicle extract machetes from the vehicle, and he saw them distributed to those manning the roadblock.  Now, CGC testified that he was certain that the machetes that had been extracted from that vehicle were meant for the killing of Tutsis, and he came to this conclusion because he testified that he had heard the Accused ask why Tutsis were being allowed to go through the roadblock without being killed, 20th May 1994.  He then testified that he then saw the machetes being taken into a little structure below the road.  There were 20 men at that roadblock.  Of the 20, he identifies between five and six of them. 
Now, he puts the distribution of machetes in its proper context, Your Honours, and he says this:  "Before the Accused came to the roadblock, there was only one person armed with a spear."  Now, there's a clear causal link there between the machetes being distributed and the manning of the roadblock.  There's only one man with a spear prior to the Accused's arrival.  That's what CGC tells you, but then he says after the Accused left the roadblock, he saw that the machetes that were delivered had been distributed amongst all the attackers.  He testified that he saw the Accused give money to those persons manning the roadblock.  CGC also said that a number of Tutsis were killed at the roadblock after the Accused had passed there and mentions a man called Nors, says Nors was killed about five minutes after CGC himself left the roadblock.
Now, what was CGC doing at the roadblock?  He tells us.  He was -- had been apprehended somewhere else.  He had been taken to the roadblock, and whilst he was waiting for someone to pay a reward or some sort of bribe to secure his release, this incident happened.  And I wouldn't go into the specifics of that.
Let me deal with the circumstances of the identification because in cases of eyewitness testimony, one finds themselves having to home in on these issues.  The circumstances of the identification I represent to Your Honours were extremely good.  Like CGK, CGC was only two metres away from the Accused, two metres from where the Accused was standing, and he gives a plausible reason why that was the case.  He has been captured.  He was right there.  CGC also had prior knowledge of the Accused, and he tells us why:  some family relationship.  The Accused in 1991 and 1992 would always come and see his sister in Gasharu.  She wasn't feeling terribly well and would bring her medicines.  Again, I don't want to go into this detail.
Now, what would the Defence say in relation to CGC's testimony?  They call Witness DC.  Witness DC was called to challenge the Prosecution's case.  An analysis of the evidence of Witness DC can be found on pages 84 to 87 of the Prosecutor's closing brief and particularly paragraphs 176 to 179.
Now, to an extent, the Defence also rely on the evidence of Defence Witness DA, Delta Alpha, whose testimony would also be found at pages 107 to 110 of our closing brief, paragraphs 319 to 340; and they also rely on the evidence of Witness DB, Delta Bravo, whose evidence is summarized at pages 104 to 170 of the Prosecutor's closing brief and paragraphs 298 to 318 of the said brief.
What does Witness DC have to say about this event?  He says the following: Witness DC tells us that the Accused was not present at Gaseke roadblock because he was there.  He said he went past the roadblock in May, at the end of May 1994, as he and other attackers returned from Kibuye town where they had been busy killing Tutsis.  They had been to Gitwa hill.  He hadn't seen the Accused at Gitwa hill, but we'll come to that later.  But he says that he did not see the Accused at Gaseke because he was coming back from all the attacks in Kibuye at the end of May and he was present there and, therefore, did not see him.
Now, we would represent to Your Honours that it is simply untrue that Witness DC was present at that roadblock.  First of all, we have his confession.  It's not in his confession.  Secondly, he places himself at a roadblock in Gaseke at the end of May and says that he is returning from attacks that took place in Kibuye préfecture at Gitwa hill in Kibuye town, and we all know that those attacks took place in April.  So what was Witness DC doing in Kibuye between the end of the attacks in April and the end of May?  The Defence would have you believe that he was just waiting for the Accused to go past Gaseke roadblock. 
At paragraph 184 of our closing brief, we have outlined our reasoning in relation to Witness DC's testimony, and at paragraph 185 -- 184 to 188 we discuss it at length, but at paragraph 185, we outline there that, well, all the large-scale attacks in Kibuye préfecture had, in fact, occurred by the end of April.  So, in essence, what was he doing in Kibuye? 
Now, putting the time frame aside and other matters that go with it, at paragraph 186 we talk about the contradiction of Witness DC in relation to this matter.  DC tries to allude to the fact that he was present at that roadblock when Nors -- he was present at the roadblock when Nors was killed.  So at 186 we say here that DC says that when he arrived at the Gaseke roadblock, he found that they had killed a white man at the roadblock.  That's what he says.  The reference is there, page 14, transcripts of 30th of October.  In other words, he implied that the white man Nors had been killed prior to his arrival there.  Then later in his testimony he changed his mind and said, well, in fact, he was waiting at the roadblock for the arrival of the white man and that, in fact, Nors had been killed in his presence, even though he took no part in this killing.
What he now says was that when he arrived at the roadblock, those manning the roadblock said to him, "Wait, there's a white man that has gone past and we're sure he's coming back."  So he testified that he waited for three hours and that after three hours, Nors drove back and the attack happened.
But if you cross-reference the testimony of Witness DC to that of Nors's driver, DB, a man who claims he was the driver of Nors, you will see from paragraph 189 of our brief that we point out what the contradiction is there.  The evidence of the driver was that there were -- there was a disparity of a few days between the time they made the outward journey and they made the inward journey.  Witness DC would, however, have you believe that this was just a matter of hours.  Now, if there were -- if there was a distance of days between the outward journey and the inward journey, how then did those who were manning the roadblock know to -- when to expect the return of Nors? 
There are many other issues that Witness DC has testified about, and in summary, we would represent to Your Honours that Witness DC is not a credible witness.  In paragraph 198 we say that he's currently serving a term of life imprisonment, he said, and therefore, he stands to lose nothing by incriminating himself in crimes charged in the indictment even though he played no part in them.
So if Witness DC's evidence, we say, does not challenge the evidence of CGC, then the Accused has to be liable for what happened at Gaseke roadblock.  In that regard, we would represent to Your Honours that he, by conveying machetes in the white vehicle to Gaseke roadblock and distributing those machetes to those manning that roadblock to use in killing Tutsi civilians on 20th May 1994, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi directly and substantially contributed to the killing of Tutsis at Gaseke roadblock and, therefore, incurs liability for having aided in the commission of those offences as outlined in Count 1 of the indictment. 
He knew that by conveying machetes in a vehicle to the roadblock at Gaseke, such conduct would materially assist the attackers in the killing of Tutsi.  We say his presence there had an encouraging effect on those at the roadblock because they knew he was a minister in the government, and he knew that his presence was likely to have that effect.
We also say, Your Honours, that the events at Gaseke on the 20th of May 1994 was done in the context of widespread and systematic attack on Tutsi.  Apart from aiding and abetting under 6(1), we also would argue that he instigated those at Gaseke roadblock to kill Tutsi civilians by offering them monetary inducements.  That's Witness CG's (sic) testimony.  He offered them money.  We say that that inducement -- by virtue of that inducement, he is guilty of instigating them to kill Tutsis.
If you believe the evidence of Witness CGC, then you have to find the Accused guilty of genocide by having aided and abetted and instigated those manning Gaseke roadblock, between Kayenzi and Ruragwe secteurs of Gitesi commune, on his sole accounts.  Even if it's just this event that you find -- you believe this witness on, he goes down for genocide.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
For having killed Nors?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm sorry?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
For having killed Nors? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Not necessarily for having killed Nors, just by virtue of the instigation.  Our argument is -- Nors is not a part of our case.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Because Nors was not necessarily Tutsi.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.  We would never argue that Nors was part of our case, Your Honour, but the act of instigation was not limited to Nors.  Nors just happened to have passed by the roadblock.
Therefore, if you believe CGC, the Accused has to be found guilty of genocide just on the basis of that event and nothing else.
Third event, Nyabahanga bridge roadblock is in May.  We rely on the evidence of Witness CGM in support of the factual allegations made at paragraph 12 and 25 of our indictment, and in that regard, Witness CGM, again a sole witness on this event, testified that at the end of May, he saw the Accused arrive at the Nyabahanga bridge roadblock.  And I should spell that for the record.  It's 
N-Y-A-B-A-H-A-N-G-A, Nyabahanga bridge roadblock.  He arrived there in two vehicles.  He describes the vehicles as a green Daihatsu, loaded with machetes, and a white car, which I probably imagine was a sedan, but he says a white car.  He describes the green vehicle as that which was similar to those used by communal administrators and that it was of a Daihatsu make.  So we now have two people telling us about this Daihatsu. 
He saw the Accused alight from one of these vehicles.  What did the Accused do at the Nyabahanga bridge?  Witness CGM identified those at the roadblock, and he mentions them in his evidence.  I wouldn't go over them.  One of them was Witness DR, Defence Witness DR.  And the essence of Witness CGM's testimony is that he heard the Accused say to Witness DR that, and I quote, "As for Tutsi women married to Hutus, have you killed them?  Kill them because otherwise they will poison you."  That's what he heard. 
Now, he then puts it in context and says as far as he was concerned, the Accused came to Nyabahanga bridge at a time when practically everybody had been exterminated and that there were only Tutsi women who had married Tutsi men left.  Again, we urge you to place it in the context of the general events in the country at the time.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
And you meant Hutu men, of course.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, obviously.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Phillips, is the case of the Defence that the Accused had a Tutsi wife?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't recall that specifically, Your Honour.
@JUDGE KHAN:
He didn't say that he had a Tutsi wife? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't recall.  I don't think so.  She was from Gitarama.  I don't think there were that many Tutsis from Gitarama.  I recall her being from Gitarama, Your Honour.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Okay. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful. 
So those are the instructions.  There are only Tutsi women who had married Hutu men left.  And then he testified that Tutsi women married to Hutu men had been protected and says pretty much the same thing that our expert says at paragraph 85, 86, and 87 of chapter 4. 
Now, he witnesses those at the roadblock, including Witness DR, off-loading machetes from the green Daihatsu vehicle, and the weapons are distributed.  Again, consistent pattern of conduct.  The same thing as Witness CGK and Witness CGC at the roadblock, pretty much the same sort of evidence.  
Identification:  The witness -- the event happened in daylight.  He had a clear view of the Accused, and he testified that he had known the Accused well before this event.
How does the Defence challenge this?  They rely on the evidence of Witness DR, the man himself who the witness says the weapons were distributed to.  An analysis of his evidence can be found at paragraphs 249 to 266 of the Prosecutor's closing brief, pages 96 to 99 of the said brief.
What does DR say?  And I don't intend to spend terribly long on his testimony, other than to say that GL's testimony in relation to this event was such that he sought to corroborate the evidence of witness CGM in all material respects, but then sought to distance himself somewhat from some of the allegations.  And what are the corroborating facts?  He admits that he was at the Nyabahanga bridge, but he admits that he was -- but he claims that he was there at a different time.  He says he was -- the roadblock was established at the end of May or early June.  He gives a very interesting reason for why this roadblock was established, and I wouldn't go into that.  It's at page -- it's at paragraph 250 of our brief. 
But he accepts that not only was he present manning that roadblock with others, that he had a grenade, which is exactly what Witness CGM says.  He accepts that, but then he diminishes his role completely and says, "The purpose of this roadblock was not to intercept Tutsis, as Witness CGM says, but rather to intercept Hutu refugees on their way to Cyangugu and Kibuye fleeing from RPF soldiers."  Without a doubt some of the -- one of the most bizarre explanations I've ever heard a witness give in this Tribunal.
We would represent to Your Honours that those who were manning the roadblock at Nyabahanga were civilians.  They were handed traditional weapons, and of course they were ill-equipped to intercept any RPF soldiers.  Witness DR simply has just diminished his role so that he can contradict the evidence of Witness CGM.  And I wouldn't say much else about his testimony because it's there in the brief.
So what does that leave us with?  If you believe Witness CGM, then you have to find that on the basis of this event at the end of May at the Nyabahanga bridge, the Accused was guilty of aiding and abetting by virtue of the conveying of machetes to that roadblock, and that he knew that by doing so he would materially assist the attackers, including DR.  We would also argue and represent to Your Honours that just his mere presence at that roadblock had a legitimising and encouraging effect on people like Witness DR. 
He also instigated those manning the roadblock by urging them to kill Tutsi women married to Hutu men.  Again, we draw your attention to the general context and to paragraphs 85, 86, and 87 of chapter 4 of our closing brief to understand why this was important.  If you believe Witness CGM, then the Accused goes down for genocide based on this sole event on the sole testimony of CGM.  There is no requirement for corroboration. 
That brings me to the fourth event and dealing with the testimony of four witnesses, and this is the Gitaka/Gasharu event.  We rely on the evidence of four Prosecution witnesses in support of the allegations in paragraph 1 to 5, 8, 9, 10 for genocide, for the count of genocide, that's Count 1, and paragraphs 25, 27, and 28 for crimes against humanity, murder. 
What is our case in relation to this event?  It is the Prosecution's case that the evidence of Witnesses CGB, Charlie Golf Bravo, CGX, CGF, CGE occurred on the same day.  That is our case.  It's not four different days.  They're not talking about four different events.  They're talking about the same event, occurred on the same day.  It occurred at the same location, concerned the same victims and, without a doubt, involved the same perpetrators.  That's the Prosecution's case.  It's not two, three, four events.  It's just one.  One event, four witnesses.
In other words, the evidence is that the Accused, during a visit to his native cellule at the end of May, instigated the killing of Tutsi civilians and, in particular, that of a man called Cyprien Karegeya and Helen Mukantabana.  There are a maze of issues, a whole variety of issues in relation to the allegations surrounding this, and I wouldn't touch on them.  I'll leave them to Mr. Kapaya as to what allegations are made in the indictments, what is contained in the witness statements, and so on and so forth.  But he will deal with that.  What I'm going to do is just outline simply what our case is on this site.
@CGB in the -- in that respect testified that at the end of May, she saw the Accused arrive -- or he saw the Accused, I don't know whether it was male or female, arrive in a white vehicle at the roadblock in Gasharu, around the roadblock, in and around that area.  A white vehicle.  Two people disembark from this vehicle, which included the Accused.  The witness testified that the Accused, following his arrival at Gasharu -- which of course is his home cellule.  That's where his parents and family are, so they know him very well.  Identification is not an issue.  A number of people came up to him and they spoke with him.  They included a man called Joel Ndabukiye -- Ndabukiye is spelled 
N-D-A-B-U-K-I-Y-E -- and his son called Emmanuel.  Another man called Karara and a man called Rukundakuvuga was present.  Rukunda (sic) is spelled R-U-K-U-N-D-A-K-U-V-U-G-A, Rukundakuvuga.  These are the people present at that location.  Some were in a bar, but ultimately, they were -- they all gathered around the Accused at some stage and spoke with him.  Time period, end of May. 
What did the Accused do at his home cellule that day?  CGB testified that she heard the Accused say to Joel Ndabukiye and his son that he had just come from Kigali where all Tutsis had been killed.  He then asked for Cyprien Karegeya and Mukantabana.  He asked, "Are they still alive?"  That sort of thing.  They answered him that they were still alive, and he ordered Ndabukiye to kill Mukantabana and Karegeya, kill the two people who are the subject of crimes against humanity charge and the genocide charge. 
Now, CGB, apart from that, heard the Accused make certain promises to those he was speaking with, and it's very important what he says next.  He promised Ndabukiye that he would make him the préfet.  Ndabukiye's son was to become the bourgmestre.  Then he said to them, "Now I'm leaving, but when I come back, I don't want to hear about Tutsi in our locality.  Make sure you do everything, and I will appoint you to those positions as a way of rewarding you, to contribute to the progress of our locality and region."  That's CGB's evidence.  Now, CGB then testifies he then saw Karegeya being killed by Joel Ndabukiye and his son using a club, so that's the first person gone. 
In relation to the second person, he testifies or she testifies that he saw Rukunda, the witness saw Rukunda bring Mukantabana's body which had been dumped in a pit near a roadblock.  So the first is actual killing of Karegeya.  He sees that.  That's what he says.  The second is bringing the lady's body back, which he -- he says somebody else did.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, does it make sense that this promise is being made that Ndabukiye will be préfet?  The point is taken in relation to the other one who would become parliamentarian.  But what's your comment on that, please.
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My most likely comment on that, Your Honour, is to say that I would not like to speculate on the witness's behalf.  That would be my first comment, and really, that's as far as I can go, Your Honour.  Whether or not it makes sense is actually very difficult for me to -- to comment on at this stage, but I mean -- without the witness being here, but that's his evidence.
The -- to answer Your Honour's question in another way, we would represent to Your Honours that it's perhaps not the content of the -- of the promise or the reward, but the consistent pattern which various witnesses at various locations hear the Accused making promises or rewards.  And as you will find out later, this is something that reoccurs and reoccurs and reoccurs.  It's a consistent pattern of conduct.  Why Ndabukiye would be made a préfet is really a matter to -- for Witness CGB.
In relation to the timing of Karegeya's death, he says they were not killed at the same time and place.  They were killed -- they were killed on the same day, approximately four days after the Accused was at the roadblock.  He says -- let me take that again.  He stated that, "Although Karegeya and Mukantabana were not killed at the same time and place, they were killed on the same day," and he puts that day at approximately four days after the Accused visited the roadblock.  That's his evidence.
He goes into very great detail as to the process that led to Mukantabana's death involving the man called Rukunda, Ndabukiye and his son, and how they gone to her residence.  And I will represent to Your Honours that this evidence is very similar to that we've heard from other witnesses in this case, including Witness DL, and that has to go to the credibility of Witness CGB.
Issues concerning identification:  Witness CGB testified that he was 20 metres from where the Accused was and -- the Accused and others were and that he had observed the Accused for about 15 minutes.  We would represent that that is not an unusually long distance to have observed what he observed.  It is not an unusually long distance to have heard what he heard, and that 15 minutes is enough time for him to actually form an impression of the events that were going on and unfolding before his eyes.  In any event, we would always add the caveat that 20 metres was just a mere approximation and, again, the cultural and educational background of these witnesses and, in any event, the length of time from 1994 to now all has to be taken into consideration, but that is his evidence. 
How did he identify the Accused?  He realised when Karara and other people called up and asked people to come and greet the Accused, the occupants.  He said the Accused was a minister who had come from Kigali and indicated that, you know, it would have been most unusual for people not to know that he was there.  We would represent, Your Honours, that that is very good eyewitness evidence. 
Then we have Witness CGX, a very elderly Hutu lady.  This was the lady who was so convinced about her identification of the Accused that she even volunteered to touch him in the courtroom.  She testified that she saw the Accused more than four weeks after the death of the president.  The Prosecution would argue that this could have been any time from early, mid, to end of May.  We would represent that based on the evidence of the four witnesses that we are calling, since they're testifying on the same event, this event must have been at the end of May. 
The witness testified that --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say four to five weeks?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
She said more than four weeks after the death of the president.  That's her testimony, more than four weeks.  That's what I have in my summary anyway. 
So she testified that there was a roadblock which was manned or mounted by Interahamwe located in a certain location in Gasharu cellule.  She saw the Accused in the presence of Joel Ndabukiye and a man called Karara.  There's no mention of his son here, but that's her evidence. 
She then goes on to say that there were people who were manning this roadblock, and she recognised Rukundakuvuga again and a man called Sendiragora.  Sendiragora is spelled 
S-E-N-D-I-R-A-G-O-R-A.  So those were the people she identified at the roadblock. 
What did she see the Accused do?  She heard the Accused order Karara, Joel Ndabukiye and his son to kill Helen Mukantabana and Cyprien Karegeya.  That's what she heard, and she tells us how she heard this.  She further testified that she knew that Helen Mukantabana had died, although she could not tell who killed her. 
If you believe the evidence of this witness, we would represent to you here and now that it is not a requirement for -- to find him guilty by having instigated that she identifies who the perpetrator of the crime was.  It's enough that she heard him instigate those who were present and that the witness died and that there's a causal link between the time frame when she heard these instructions and the time and location where the victim eventually died.
Witness CGX testified that her son had been killed at the same roadblock and blames Rukundakuvuga for this.  We've pointed out in our brief that that person has assumed responsibility for this crime, which goes -- which has to go to Witness CGX's credibility.
What were the circumstances of identification?  She was 500 centimetres, my notes say, standing at the roadblock.  She was standing at an elevated area near the road to Kirambo when she saw the Accused.  This elderly woman also testified that the Accused was her neighbour from her native village, and she was, therefore, very familiar with him. 
$Pages 1 to 21 by Sherri Knox)
1530H
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very good circumstances of identification, we would say. 
She was Hutu, by the way, and that's very important.  It means that she had freedom to roam around.  She wasn't hiding.  She wasn't looking at him from any disadvantaged position.  She probably was standing right next to him.  It wasn't an issue.
Witness CGF is the third witness on this point, another elderly Hutu man who saw the Accused -- sorry.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But coming back to this time issue, what do you do with the four to five months?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We would argue that that -- the witness's evidence is that -- sorry.  We would argue that the events that the witness talks about is at the end of May, because it's our position that they're all talking about the same thing. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
It's simply an old lady making a mistake. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.  I use that word with great caution.
We have another old witness, Witness CGF, who is an elderly Hutu man, and he also testifies that he was at the roadblock around towards the end of May, he says, and that's as best as he could put it.  He gives the same physical attributes as to the location of the roadblock as Witness CGX, between X and X house; and he also testifies about the same people who were seen manning the roadblock, a man called Rukundakuvuga, seen killing the people at the roadblock. 
Whilst he was at the roadblock -- and he gives a reason why he was at the roadblock -- the Accused is seen arriving in a white vehicle accompanied by a driver and a soldier.  What is striking about the evidence here is that most people tend to see the Accused with three people in his vehicle, and this is yet another witness that sees that.
What did the Accused do when Witness CGF saw him on that day?  He also testified that he heard the Accused ask Karara and Ndabukiye, same people, if Karegeya was dead.  And when the response came that Karegeya was still alive, the Accused wondered why. 
He also inquired about the whereabouts of Mukantabana, the same lady as well, and Witness CGF says that he heard the Accused say to Ndabukiye that he knew or he was aware that this lady was hiding at Ndabukiye's house because she had paid Ndabukiye with some cows to guarantee her protection.  In any event, CGF says that he heard the Accused order Ndabukiye to kill her all the same.  We have quoted the words used by the Accused according to CGF, and I'm not going to repeat that.  It's in our brief.
The witness then says that he became aware Karegeya and Mukantabana, also known as Nyiramaritete, were eventually killed.  Nyiramaritete is spelled N-Y-I-R-A-M-A-T-E-T-E (sic).  Nyiramaritete was a nickname that Mukantabana was known by in the locality of Gasharu. 
Then, another thing:  Apart from hearing the specific instructions concerning Mukantabana and Karegeya, Witness CGF also testified that he heard the Accused give the order to kill all Tutsi and get rewards by sharing the land and cattle of those who had killed -- who had been killed.  So again we find a reoccurring issue of rewards being offered, rewards offered, cattle and positions and things like that.
Identification:  Witness CFG was an old man who was a Hutu.  He was free to move around.  He was not in hiding.  He testified that there was hardly 8 metres between himself and the Accused, and quite rightly, too.  He had no reason to be further away from him.  Although he had not seen the Accused before -- now, this was his first sighting of the Accused, never seen the Accused before -- he testified that he was able to recognise the Accused because he had heard others refer to him as Ndindabahizi, which, again, is not unusual.  Ndindabahizi at the time was a minister, and there were very few people in that locality who drove cars.  So it is not unusual that he would have heard reference being made to him.
In any event, Witness CGF was able to positively identify the man he had seen in 1994 in this courtroom, regardless of what representations the Defence have made as to the positioning of this courtroom.
Final witness on this point is Witness CGE, a witness, I believe, who's Tutsi, hiding in a bush in late May.  He saw the Accused at this roadblock at Gasharu, same location, between X and X house and Ndabukiye's house; pretty much consistent with all the others witnesses in relation to where this roadblock was situated. 
He testified that he noticed that Karara and Ndabukiye were controlling the roadblock and Rukundakuvuga and Sendiragora were also part of the group manning the roadblock.  Again, he corroborates Witness CGF's evidence in that regard.
The Accused arrived in a white car, also accompanied by a soldier and a driver.  CGE saw Karara and Ndabukiye and other Interahamwe welcome the Accused.  Consistent evidence again.
What did CGE see the Accused do?  He asked -- he testified, rather, that he heard the Accused ask Karegeya -- ask Ndabukiye whether Karegeya was dead.  When he was answered that Karegeya was still alive, he asked why people were not doing their job.  We would argue that that comment was instigation.  He told people to kill Tutsi and so that Tutsi children in the future would ask what a Tutsi looks like.  This is an appeal to the patriotism at the time.   We would recommend -- we would argue that that is a form of instigation:  Kill Tutsi so children in future would ask what a Tutsi looks like.  He was talking to Hutus.
Now, the witness testified that he heard the Accused tell people that after they'd killed the Tutsis, they would share their land.  Now, again, another bit of evidence that is consistent with that of Witness CGF: rewards being offered.  Being a resident of Gasharu, the witness testified he was aware that Ndabukiye and another man called Seyeze, S-E-Y-E-Z-Z-E (sic), were rewarded with land of people who had been killed.
Now, in relation to the killing of -- or the death of Karegeya and Mukantabana, the witness testifies that Karegeya was killed after the Accused had departed.  He confirms that Mukantabana had sought refuge at Joel Ndabukiye's house, and also confirms that the lady was killed around the same period of Karegeya, but he did not know who killed them.
Now, he also talks about Tutsis generally being killed at the roadblock in Gasharu  after -- before and after the Accused had visited that locality.
Going to the identification of -- the evidence of identification supporting the evidence of Witness CGE, he was approximately 8 metres away hiding in a bush when he saw the Accused at Gasharu.  However, he testified that he was well acquainted with the Accused as both of them hail from Gasharu in Gitesi commune.
Now, when we look at the evidence of all four witnesses that I've just gone through, with the exception of CGX, all witnesses place these events at the end of May.  Those who indicate dates that are different from -- sorry, those who indicate dates during the oral testimony that are different from their written testimony have given reasons why they did so, and I have no reason to doubt it 'cause I wasn't there.
Now, many witnesses support -- many Defence witnesses support the Prosecution's case and claim that the Accused visited Gasharu towards the end of May, although some of them put it at the very beginning of June.  So even their own witnesses are saying, well, the end of May, possibly beginning of June.  Such a witness is Witness DJ.  She says end of May, beginning of June; paragraph 32 of chapter 5 of our closing brief.  Witness DL, another Defence witness, end of May, beginning of June; paragraph 118 of chapter 5.  DI, beginning of June; paragraph 94.  DH, early June; paragraph 56.  And they go on like that.
It's the Defence case that the Accused did not visit Gasharu until the end of June, and in that regard, the Accused himself testified that he only visited Gasharu at the end of June.  He is supported, I might add, in relation to that by Witness DM, Delta Mother, who says he visited at the end of June.  See paragraph 103, chapter 4 -- sorry, chapter 5, not chapter 4.  One-oh-three, chapter 5.  And Witness DU also seems to suggest that the Accused visited at the end of June.
If you accept that the Accused visited at the end of June then, in essence, he contradicts about seven of his own witnesses who are native to Gasharu, which is something.  Seven of his own witnesses and relatives who are native to Gasharu, he actually contradicts their evidence because they actually say that he came at end of May, at the very, very beginning of June.  But then again, these are dates that give or take a few weeks here and there.
Apart from the location of the -- the date of the event, the Defence challenge that Karegeya and Mukantabana were actually killed in May.  They argue that they were killed in April and not May, but even that fact is contradicted by their own witnesses.  They can't even agree amongst themselves as to when Karegeya and Mukantabana were killed.  So they can't agree on when the Accused visited, and then they can't even agree on when these two people were killed, and I'll tell you why in due course.
In relation to their defence on this matter, the Defence rely on the evidence of detained Witness DO, and his evidence can be found on pages 91 to 96 of our closing brief, all in English of course, and paragraph 223 and 248 of our closing brief; and another detained witness, Witness DM, whose evidence can be found on pages 88 to 91 of our closing brief, and paragraphs 200 to 222 of the same brief.  Those are the witnesses that they rely on in relation to, to the killing, and the reason why they do is that Witness DO tends to accept responsibility for killing Mukantabana.  Witness DM, the Defence tell us, killed Karegeya, even though Witness DM seems to diminish his responsibility in that regard.
Now, apart from these two witnesses, we have the Gasharu witnesses, the witnesses that were native to that locality.  Most of their evidence, I might add, is based on hearsay, but I'll outline who they are anyway: Witness DJ, Witness DH, Witness DI, Witness DL, Witness DU, and Witness DV.  Collectively, an analysis of their evidence can be found at paragraphs 32 to 167 of our closing brief, on pages 58 to 82.  So paragraphs 32 to 167 collectively deals with all these six witnesses that I have alluded to, on pages 58 to 82 of our brief.
In essence, what these six people have told us, and they're all native to that locality, is that these two people were -- first of all, they were killed before the Accused even visited Gasharu.  So, you know, the two of them had been killed.  It had nothing to do with his instructions or his instigation, whatever.  So they'd been killed before; they were killed in April.  Secondly, they were killed for reasons other than being Tutsi.  In fact, one of their witnesses said that Mukantabana had been killed because she poisoned somebody in 1985.  So they had other reasons for killing them.  It had nothing to do with the prevailing events at the time, but that in any event, these witnesses were not killed -- these victims, Ndabukiye and Mukantabana, were not killed by Joel Ntabukiye and his son; rather, they were killed by Witness DO and Witness DM; finally, that Witness DO and Witness DM did not receive instructions from the Accused to kill these people. 
So that's essentially the way they fall back on the Prosecution's case, and we would go through it, in essence, to show you that they don't actually have a defence in that regard.
Now, the evidence -- talking about Witness DM, Witness DM, according to the Defence, is the sole eyewitness to the killing of Cyprien Karegeya.  They say that he, he killed the guy.  He killed him himself.  And even Witness DI and Witness DH, who are in a position to know who killed Karegeya, actually tell us that Witness DM did it.  Witness DL tells us Witness DM did it.  They tell us that Witness DM confessed.  Not only did they see him do it, he actually has confessed to doing it, so one would expect that once Witness DM comes into the witness box, he's going to assume responsibility for killing Cyprien Karegeya.  Lo and behold, that was not to be the case.  In that regard, Witness DM claimed that he was present during the attack on Karegeya, but he denied killing him.  He actually, at the end of his testimony, reduced himself to a mere observer. 
Now, because something cannot be white and blue at the same time, there has to be an explanation, and the explanation has to be this:  Witness DM, at some stage, must have indicated that he was willing to assume responsibility for Karegeya's death.  At some stage between the time he came to this courtroom he changed his mind, and slowly throughout his testimony he diminished his responsibility, and in the end he said as follows, and I've written this at paragraph 216 of our closing brief, page 90:  "I consider myself an observer.  I was not with them in the beginning.  We met along the way somewhere, and I joined the group.  We did not discuss the plan together." 
Now, this is the evidence of a man that the Defence tells us killed Cyprien Karegeya.  Well, it goes without saying that Witness DM does not accept any liability for it.  Therefore, any other witness that tells you that Witness DM did it is not credible because the man himself says, "I didn't do it.  I didn't do it." 
In any event, Witness DM himself places this event at the end of April.  That's for the timing.
Now, Witness DO, who presumably would also know about this event, says that Cyprien Karegeya was killed seven or so days after the killing of Mukantabana, which according to him took place at the beginning of May.  So we have a situation whereby the man who the Defence say killed Mukantabana doesn't say it's in April.  He actually says, "I did this in May."  And if you look at his confession statement, it supports that allegation that he did it in May.  So in terms of the timing, Witness DO doesn't really help us, either.
Now, Witness DV is not an eyewitness -- was not an eyewitness to the killing of Karegeya but says that he heard that he was killed at the beginning of May 1994. 
Witness DL:  Now, Witness DL is important because Witness DI relied on Witness DL to make her submissions before you in this courtroom.  So Witness DL himself turns out not to be an eyewitness to the killing of Karegeya, but he felt that Witness DM was responsible because he saw Witness DM taking him away in mid-April 1994, but Witness DM denies that.  Witness DM says, "Oh, I met them along the way as they were going somewhere."  So, Witness DL is not credible.
Then you have Witness DI who, presumably for reasons known to all of us, should know how this man died.  She says, "Well, I base my information on the evidence of Witness DL.  Witness DL told me that DM killed you -- killed Karegeya."  But Witness DM denies this.
So, then we have Witness DH.  Witness DH, who also should be in a position to know who killed Karegeya for reasons known to all of us, says that he relied on information from Witness DL.  Well, Witness DL blames Witness DM, and Witness DM says, "I didn't do it."  So where does that leave us? 
Finally, Witness DG says, "It was reported to me that Witness DM and two others killed Cyprien Karegeya in the month of May 1994."  Well, again, hearsay evidence which is neither here nor there.
So, what you basically have is a situation whereby the Defence did not effectively challenge the Prosecution's case on the killing of either Karegeya or Mukantabana.  They can't actually make up their mind what happened, and they claim to know. 
Our evidence is based on Witness CGB.  CGB says, "I actually saw X and X going to kill Karegeya, and I saw them coming back with the body of Mukantabana."  If you believe CGB, then you convict him (sic) for the killing of these two people.
Witness CGB's evidence is particularly damaging because she claims -- or he claims to have seen Joel Ndabukiye and his son using a club to kill Karegeya.  It is so damaging that basically the Defence try to destroy the credibility of Witness CGB, and that's why Witness DJ, Delta Jackie, at paragraph 45 to 50 of our closing brief, says to you that, "I actually know this witness, and this witness was not where he or she claimed to be."  In our respectful submission, that is just an attempt by the Defence to destroy the credibility of the only witness who saw what happened to Cyprien Karegeya. 
Why should we believe Witness DG, anyway?  Well, you shouldn't, because we tell you that she has no direct knowledge of any matter which she seeks to testify upon, and we say that in paragraph 51.  Her evidence, for the most part, was contradictory.  She has expressed her gratitude on how she is especially grateful to her extended family and the Accused for having saved her life, and we say that her testimony is biased. 
We deal with her challenge of Witness CGB's evidence in paragraph 46 to 50, and we show there that the matters that she testifies on, in an attempt to destroy CBG's testimony, is not credible.
The Defence also try to destroy the evidence of Witness CGX and CGF, the two Hutus.  So, you see the persistent pattern of conduct.  First they tried to destroy the evidence of the only eyewitness to Cyprien Karegeya, the credible witness.  Then they go to the Hutu, the two old people, probably in their 70s or 80s.  Why would they want to give false testimony?  They've come here to say it as they saw it.  And then they rely on Witness DV who says, "Well, I happened to be in Gasharu around the same time that the Accused visited at the end of June, and I certainly did not see Witness CGX and Witness CGF present."  Well, how in God's name would Witness DV have been looking out for Witness CGX and Witness CG -- CGX or CGF?  Presumably he knew ten years ago that he was coming here to testify as a witness, so he wrote it down somewhere in his memory so that he could come and tell us that they were not there. 
Again, the evidence of Witness CGB is dealt with in our closing brief, and I would only represent to Your Honours as a summary, in the interests of time, that he is not credible for the reasons that we have already stated in his -- in our closing brief.
So, we are left with our summary of what happened at Gasharu.  In that regard, we refer you to chapter 4, paragraph 96 to 102 of our closing brief. 
Now, once we throw out the evidence of all the Defence witnesses for inconsistency, we are left with this, and this is what we say:  What we have in Gasharu, after we've dealt with all these witnesses, is that we have the evidence of Witness DL, who was a local authority in Gasharu.  The Defence case is that, as a measure of good faith and in response to the things that happened in Gasharu, the Accused arrested some individuals, including DL himself.  DL says that the man that the Accused arrested had no hand in the killing of Karegeya, so why did he arrest him?  Why?  Why arrest a man that has no hand in the killing of Karegeya?  Your own witness.
Now, if you look at all the confession statements that we have adduced in this court, there is no mention of any Gatete, but rather, what we have is a situation whereby in his own home cellule, his nephew, his own brother, and Joel Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel Ndagijimana, who the Prosecution say were responsible for the death of Mukantabana, are named and implicated either as principal perpetrators or accomplices.  In all the confession statements, one or the other names the other.  "He was there.  He saw me do this."  Including Witness DL himself, witness to crimes in Gasharu.
If you read 96 to 102, we now have a situation whereby in Gasharu we have the brother and the nephew of the minister of finance are seen committing genocide in his own cellule, under the watchful eyes of law enforcement agents like Witness DL, the minister himself, and members of his immediate family; license to kill.  And then he comes here and he tells you that he is innocent, and you should disregard all we say in chapter 4.  Why?  In his own cellule.  These are the people who are the principal perpetrators of crimes in his own cellule.
That brings us to his individual responsibility for Gasharu.  We would say that by instigating Witness DL, Joel Ndabukiye, his son Emmanuel, Rukundakuvuga and others, in and around the roadblock at Gitaka centre in Gasharu to kill Tutsis, in particular Cyprien Karegeya and Helen Mukantabana, as charged in the indictment, the Accused is guilty of genocide by having instigated those persons to kill them.
If you believe any one of the four witnesses that I have just gone through, then you have to find him guilty on Count 1 and Count 3, crimes against humanity, murder, for the instigation of the killing of these people during the month of May 1994.
I now want to go on to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune.  The Prosecution relies on the evidence of three witnesses in support of the allegations in paragraph 15 and 16 for genocide, and paragraphs 20 and 21 for crimes against humanity; three witnesses, Witness CGV, CGN, and CGY.
We would argue, Your Honours, as opposed to Gasharu, that the events at Gitwa hill were three separate events, three separate events as testified to by these witnesses.  And we would also represent to Your Honours that the events occurred on the following dates:  The first event occurred between the 17th and the 20th of April.  That's Witness CGV, and I will tell you why when I come back to deal with his or her testimony.  Then the second event, April 20th, and the third event, April 23rd, 1994.  So in -- for this location, Gitwa hill, we have three events.
@CGV sought refuge at Gitwa hill on the 15th of April.  Two days after his arrival at Gitwa hill, around two days he says, he saw the Accused there, and that's why we've said it's the 17th because he said, "I sought refuge there on or about the 15th."  So give or take two days here and there, it has to be between the 17th and the 20th.  So we have a broad -- we've given ourselves some latitude in relation to the dates, and that's how come we've arrived at that.
First event, CGV:  Accused in a white vehicle accompanied by another green Daihatsu.  Again, we see the Daihatsu.  Inside the Daihatsu were Interahamwe, soldiers, and weapons.  CGV saw those weapons off-loaded from the green vehicle. 
Now, CGV noticed the Accused, Your Honours, holding a grenade in his hand, and he saw the Accused throw the grenade at a group of refugees on Gitwa hill.  He -- his evidence is somewhat telling in that he explains how he came to the conclusion that the Accused was the leader of the attacks.  He said that the Accused was the most influential personality there.  He was a minister, and he was a leader; he was leading.  He was like an assistant to Habyarimana, who is dead.  And when he came to his native préfecture, he was like an assistant to Habyarimana, who is dead, when he came to his native préfecture to lead the attacks.  That's how CGV saw it. 
Now, CGB is the only witness that gives evidence that indicates a more direct involvement other than the passive conduct, which by no means is little or less culpable but, yet again, passive.  His evidence is slightly different.  Here we see the Accused throwing a grenade into a crowd as a signal to start off the attack.  Perhaps the -- a signal to others to start off. 
The identification is always a problem in areas where there are numerous attackers, but listen to what CGV says.  He had known the Accused before 1994 when he used to work at TRAFIPRO, and he further testified that he hadn't seen the Accused since 1980s 'cause the Accused was living in Kigali, but that he was able to recognise him during the war.  He gives a description as to how -- the location where he saw the Accused on the day of the attack and that he distinguished -- he distinguishes the Accused as having been the only one who arrived in the white vehicle with his driver, as opposed to the others who were on the, on the green -- on the green vehicle.  He testified that he observed the Accused for a few minutes before the attackers started chasing the refugees. 
So here you have a witness who has had some time.  He knows him, saw him arrive.  He's able to identify the vehicle in which he arrives.  He identifies the occupants of the vehicles.  The attack does not start immediately.  He has time to observe him, he tells you that.  And then he says, "Once the attack started, I fled."  To my mind, is very strong evidence of identification, considering it was daytime.
The second event is on the 20th of April, and that's Witness CGN.  He says he saw the Accused arriving at Gitwa hill on the 20th of April in a white Daihatsu -- in a white vehicle, I'm sorry, accompanied by a blue vehicle and a green Daihatsu.  The green Daihatsu had machetes in it.  He also testifies that there were Interahamwe and civilians in the Daihatsu who un -- off-loaded the machetes and distributed them as they disembarked from the vehicles.
What did he see the Accused do?  He would describe the Accused's role that day as supervising the operation, and he says he gave the order to go to the hills and kill Tutsi.  Again, a more direct form of participation than at the roadblocks where he was passive.  He heard and saw that this order to kill Tutsi from the Accused came after the machetes were distributed and says the Accused just disappeared after that.  He just left; the entourage left.   Later that day, he testified that there was an attack on Gitwa hill where several Tutsis were unfortunately killed. 
Approximate distance in terms of his identification?  Twenty-five to thirty metres from the Accused.  I would say in the circumstances, very good identification; very good distance to be able to make an effective identification.
Third event at Gitwa hill, 23rd April 1994.  Witness CGY now testifying that around 11 o'clock in the morning he saw the Accused, again in a white vehicle, accompanied by a blue Daihatsu and a beige Toyota pick-up.  So we're having variations on the colours of this Daihatsu, but the Daihatsu is consistent.  Some say it's blue; some say it's green.  Some say the Accused's car is white.  The majority say it's white; one or two people have said it is black.  And I will deal with the issues of colours later.
Inside the Daihatsu, again, were Interahamwe and civilians.  Machetes are off-loaded from the Daihatsu and distributed; consistent.  He now heard the Accused direct the machetes to be used in implementing a plan that had been drawn up, and he understood that to mean that the weapons were to be used to kill Tutsi.  CGY testifies that on the following days, there were attacks.  So he saw the Accused on the 23rd.  He describes a major attack on the 26th, and he says, "I would never forget that day because many people died.  The 26th is a day that I will never forget." 
So we see how machetes that are distributed on the 23rd are now used in a huge attack on the 26th, and there's a causal link between the distribution, the aiding and abetting in terms of the supplying of weapons, and the eventual attacks that takes place.  So, it lends a substantial hand to whatever happened.
Identification:  Witness CGY was 20 metres from the Accused when he saw and heard him speak, but he had known him before, also.  And he says that from 1990, he used to see the Accused from time to time when he was visiting Kibuye in connection with political rallies.  There is no doubt that the Accused did at some stage have political involvement, and that's what got him to the position that he held in 1994.  So again, that evidence is not exactly inconsistent with the rest of what we're heard.
How do the Defence seek to challenge our evidence?  They rely on the evidence of DC, and his analysis can be found at paragraph 168 to 199 of our closing brief, pages 82 -- on pages 82 to 87, at pages 82 to 87 of our brief.
Witness DC is a very interesting man.  He's a man we've talked about before that likes to assume responsibilities for things that he didn't do.  This is a man that, his confession statement, his indictment before the Rwandan authorities, charges him and 69 other people for activities in Rutsiro commune.  And ten years after the fact or nine years after the fact, he claims that, "Actually, not only was I at Rutsiro, but I was also at Gitwa hill."
We find his evidence incredible.  We have dealt with it at length at the pages we've described, but there's some things about his testimony that are striking.  First of all, he accepts that the attacks at Gitwa hill were conducted over five days, so it pretty much supports the Prosecution's case that there were actually -- they were actually perpetrated over a period of time.
He then claims that he was only there for two of those five days.  So if you were there for two out of five days, how can you testify that the Accused was not there?  Because he can't actually tell us the two days out of the five days that he was there, so really, that doesn't really tell us anything.
And then he says something that is very curious.  He says, "Look, had the Accused been there, I would have known."
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We are getting small signals that the speed is too high. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Oh, I'm --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could slow down a little bit. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So Witness C -- DC says that had the Accused been present -- or if the Accused was present at Gitwa hill, he would have known because the Accused would not have left without providing him some monetary incentive to kill Tutsi.  So in other words, we argue that, so if the Accused did not provide that incentive, then it is very unlikely that Witness DC would have known that he was there.  That's -- that goes without saying. 
So the first thing is, the attacks were over five days.  How do you know he was not there on day three, four, five?  Secondly, if he didn't give you money, then you wouldn't have known he was there.  Thirdly, there were -- by his own testimony, Witness DC was one of a thousand men who came from Kibuye, and he was one of 15,000 attackers at Gitwa hill.  How, then, would he have been able to tell whether or not the Accused was present? 
So, that pretty much deals with the defence in relation to evidence on Gitwa hill.
What is his responsibility?  Well, it's for instigating; instigating on the 17th, on the 20th, and on the 23rd, people to kill civilians.  He aided and abetted by leading the convoy, by conveying attackers and machetes.  He did that, and he did so knowing that his contribution would materially assist the attackers in the killing of Tutsi. 
He was a government minister, Your Honours, and he was identified as such.  And we would argue in relation to this, like we've done for other events, that that in itself had an encouraging effect on the perpetrators, seeing a government minister whilst the Tutsis are being chased up the hill.
He committed, based on the evidence of the witness that saw him throw a grenade, Witness CGV, the only -- like I said at the beginning, the form of participation that's slightly different from the others that we've relied on, committing and basically using the attack -- using the grenade to attack Tutsis gathered on Gitwa hill between the 17th and 20th of April.
If you believe any of these witnesses, any one of them, you have to find the Accused guilty on Count 1, genocide, and Count 2, crimes against humanity, for committing, instigating, and aiding and abetting others to kill Tutsis gathered on Gitwa hill.
That leaves us with the events at Gitesi commune -- well, one event at Gitesi commune and Kibirizi market.  Very quickly, the events at Gitesi commune is based on the evidence of Witness CGH, and it's recorded to have occurred at the end of May -- sorry.  I'm sorry, it's recorded to have occurred at the end of April 1994. 
We have some preliminary remarks to make in relation to Witness CGH's evidence.  We would represent to Your Honours that the evidence of Witness CGH, based on its contents, could not have occurred at the end of April.  It's more likely to have occurred at the end of May, which is precisely what Witness CGH said in his witness statement. 
He gives an explanation as to why he thinks or he thought it was at the end of April, and he says that was in connection with the visit of the prime minister to Kibuye on the 3rd of May.  But if you look at the evidence of Witness CGH, it becomes apparent that Witness CGH is talking about events that occurred in Gasharu.  In essence, he says the Accused said "I'm just coming from Gasharu.  This is what happened there."  So it couldn't have been at the end of April.  It just can't.
There are other things that indicate that to us, but it would suffice to say that Witness CGH is being relied on in support of the allegation in paragraph 19 of our indictment. 
There are certain things that are not disputed by the Defence.  CGH is a Tutsi who is married to the sister of Witness DN.  That's not disputed.  The Defence don't dispute that.  
@CGH testifies that he sought refuge at the home of Witness DN, along with his wife and other members of his family, and stayed there until the 25th of May, 1994, before he fled to Idjwi island in Congo.  Again, that is not disputed by the Defence.  
@CGH testified that whilst he was at Witness DN's home, some local authorities, including the Accused, came there to visit Witness DN.  Again, that is not disputed.  The only bone of contention is that it happened in June or, as Witness CGH says in his evidence, it happened at the end of April.  Well, we would actually further complicate that matter and suggest to Your Honours that actually, it didn't happen in June; it didn't happen at the end of April.  It actually happened at the end of May because, it goes without saying, when you read what transpired during the visit, there are things that had transpired before the Accused went there.  It just follows from the evidence.
What did Witness CGH see?  Well, he testified that whilst he was at that location, Witness DN's house, he heard the Accused say that he had just come from Kigali where they had killed all the Tutsi, including Tutsi women married to Hutu men.  He urged Witness DN to do the same.
Now, again we have to put that in perspective.  When was it that Tutsi women that had been married to Hutu men were now being targeted?  Well, the evidence in the case tells us that this happened sometime in May.
Now, in essence, the essence of CGH's testimony is corroborated by CGK, CGM, and CGL, who heard the Accused say a similar thing at different locations and times in Kibuye between a three-month period.  Different times, different locations, they hear the same thing.  So, that part of his testimony is consistent with the evidence adduced in this case.
Then, he then testifies that he heard the Accused say that he had just come from his native cellule where he had been looking for Charles Munyankindi and his family -- Munyankindi is spelled
M-U-N-Y-A-N-K-I-N-D-I -- and that he had instructed Joel Ndabukiye to kill Munyankindi and his family.  Now, this part of CGH's evidence or testimony is corroborated in all material respects by Witness CGB, CGX, CGF, and CGE. 
The third part of his evidence goes as follows:  He testifies that he heard the Accused in this case promise Witness DN that if Witness DN accomplished the task as outlined earlier, that of killing Tutsis, he, the Accused, would appoint him member of parliament.  Now, that evidence is corroborated by Witness DN himself who accepts that he was appointed by the Accused as member of parliament.  It is also corroborated by Witness GKH who says, "Well, I relinquished my position, and this is the person who assumed that position."  So, so far everything CGH has said is corroborated.
One last aspect of his testimony:  They all leave Witness DN's house and go out.  They go to a trading centre where people are gathered.  Witness DN -- sorry, Witness CGH sees two vehicles.  He describes them as a dark sedan and a greenish Daihatsu.  He saw the Accused hold a meeting at the trading centre below Kibuye prison.  He saw machetes on the ground.  He testified that those machetes had been transported in the greenish Daihatsu.
Now, the essence of Witness CGH's testimony, in my respectful submission, is that the Accused conveyed and distributed weapons at Gitesi.  Now, that, again, is corroborated by many witnesses who saw him do the same thing. 
It is in reliance of such strong corroboration that I am able to stand here and represent to you that if Witness CGH testified that the event occurred at the end of April, then he must have been mistaken as to the dates, because the essence of everything he said has corroboration.  There's nothing that he has said in his testimony that we haven't heard from somebody else in all material respects.  We represent to you that if he testified, which he did, that this event occurred at the end of April, then he was mistaken.
In terms of the identification, CGH, I don't think there's much dispute as to whether or not CGH and the Accused are known to each other.  Even the Accused pretty much says that that is his biggest bone of contention.  CGH is a man who has been particularly troubling for the Defence in this case, and there's no doubt that they've known each other in Gasharu cellule for several years.
When the off-loading of materials and weapons was being done from the Daihatsu, he testified that he was less than 200 metres from where the Accused stood.  It would seem like a terribly long distance, but again, I would only represent that he is credible.  He may have been mistaken as to the length of the distance, and 200 metres, well, I wouldn't see anything 200 metres, but that is not to say that he did not mean a distance that was substantially less, but people do run off figures as to distances without actually appreciating what 200 metres is like.  So, that is my submission in relation to that.
The Defence have sought to challenge the evidence we have adduced in relation to this event by relying on the evidence of Witness DN.  Witness DN's testimony is dealt with at length in our closing brief, and I'm not going to dwell on it any longer but just to say that it's on pages 99 to 104 of our closing brief at paragraphs 267 to 297.  In essence, our view is that Witness DN, whilst he's credible in relation to certain things, has sought to diminish his role and that of the Accused in relation to others, and I will leave the matter at that and leave his credibility to Your Honours to decide.
Therefore, we would represent to you that if you accept the evidence of Witness CGH, then you have to find, clearly, that the Accused aided and abetted in the distribution of weapons to civilians at Gitesi and instigated Witness DN, by offering him an inducement, to kill Tutsi women that were married to Hutu men.  Again, it's a sole testimony, and on the basis of this single event, you can convict the Accused for genocide.
The last event is at Kibirizi market, Rubengera, in Mubanza commune, which is slightly out of the scope of everything we've talked about being in Gitesi commune but is still in Kibuye préfecture. 
The evidence is that of Witness CGL who's testified to a single event: seeing the Accused at Kibirizi market.  The paragraph in the indictment that we would rely on, basically, would be paragraph 1 to 5 of our indictment in support of the genocide count. 
And the evidence of CGL is, is interesting in that at the end of May, she testifies to seeing the Accused at Kibirizi market -- which is spelled K-I-B-I-R-I-Z-I (sic) -- making a speech instigating people to kill Tutsis.  He then distributed weapons and he left.  But she also heard the Accused say the following to people, say this to the people gathered:  "In Kigali, Tutsi have already been killed, including Tutsi women married to Hutu men."  Now, this is perhaps the sixth, seventh witness in this case who is going to say the same thing.  Situate the comments to the time, end of May.  Makes a lot of sense.  She then heard the Accused instruct the Interahamwe to off-load machetes from a Daihatsu vehicle and distribute them amongst a civilian Hutu population. 
We would represent to Your Honours that the conduct of the Accused at Kibirizi is consistent with his conduct at various other places in Kibuye as reflected in this indictment.  His instigation for people to kill Tutsi women that are married to Hutu men should be placed in its proper context, because they had previously been spared.  This is the end of May. 
How do the Defence deal with our case?  They challenge it by calling Witness DF, a very interesting witness, indeed.  Witness DF is a fairly old, reverent gentleman who seems to be all over the place and cannot really explain why he moves around so much.  But what is so interesting about Witness DF's testimony is that -- which you will find on pages 110 to 113 and paragraphs 341 to 355, is that Witness DN has an axe to grind with everybody.  He was an axe to grind with Ibuka.  He claims our witnesses are all members of Ibuka.  He claims the Accused can do no wrong, and all these charges are trumped-up charges.  But what is most fascinating about him is that he claims that the Kibirizi market was closed throughout the entire period, so that even Hutus didn't have to eat. 
Well, we find his testimony very interesting, and we have dealt with his credibility and his -- the matters affecting his credibility at the -- in the closing brief, as I've indicated.
Consequently, Your Honours, if you find that you believe Witness CGL, we would say that the Accused is responsible for genocide by having aided and abetted, by conveying those machetes in the Daihatsu vehicle to Kibirizi market, by distributing the machetes to Hutu civilians and militia to use in the killing of Tutsi civilians, and that he's also guilty of genocide by having instigated those present at Kibirizi market to kill Tutsi civilians, especially Tutsi women that were married to Hutu men, at the end of May. 
Again, we draw your Chamber's attention -- Your Honours' attention, rather, to the general context in which several of these matters were taking place in the country.
If you believe Witness CGL, then please return a verdict of guilty for genocide, as I have pointed out.
There are certain things that are consistent throughout the testimony:  the number of cars used, usually more than one; the colour of the cars, mostly white; the greenish Daihatsu following behind; the fact that the greenish Daihatsu always had weapons in it; weapons were often off-loaded and distributed.  These are striking similarities that indicate a consistent pattern of conduct. 
At paragraph 93 of our closing brief in chapter 4 at page 47, we have indicated that the relatively passive conduct of the Accused often involved instigating or aiding and abetting others to carry out crimes in furtherance of the genocidal policy of the government of which he had actual and constructive notice of.  Now, if he was part of the government and he sat at those cabinet meetings, he obviously had constructive notice of what the policy of the government was.  If you hold the policies of the government in one hand and you hold our indictment in your other hand, you would see striking similarities in the Accused's conduct in Gitesi commune at this time.
Working hand in hand with the local authorities like Witness DN -- and we've gone to great length in chapter 4 to outline why the Accused's relationship with Witness DN was particularly important.  So working hand in hand with the local authorities, we say that the Accused provided the enabling environment by which the crimes were committed at various locations in his commune and cellule of origin.  He failed to investigate these crimes, and we've given you an example of the steps he said he took to investigate.  Even though it must have been obvious to him that the perpetrators of these crimes were known to him -- some of them were his close relatives; some of them were his close relatives -- and we say that his failure to investigate or apprehend or condemn those massacres in his home commune -- or cellule, rather, and commune, constituted his tacit approval that those crimes were to be committed therein.
Your Honours -- Your Honour asked me a question in relation to chapter 4 earlier.  I did promise that I would deal with it in the course of my arguments.  I hope I have, and if I haven't, I'm willing to answer any questions you might have. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Phillips.  On chapter 4, that chapter contains some arguments that are based on guilty pleas, previous judgements, testimony by an expert witness in the present case; in other words, criteria that are there.  But you also have some points that seem to be a little bit more vague.  You talk about the Accused's political ambitions, how he strategically positioned himself on two occasions, and thirdly, how he was known to be opposed to power sharing.
Now, I mentioned three elements.  Where do you find the evidence for those three points, please? 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Those issues were inferred from conduct, Your Honour.  The issue in relation to his strategic position was inferred from his conduct, based on his own admission of his activities in -- on the -- on April 8th 
-- on April 7th and April 8th.  We don't accept his explanation, that his arrival at Rifiki Nsengiyumva's house was accidental.  It's inferred from his conduct. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
So it's more a matter of disputing him, disputing what he's saying?  Because Defence is arguing that his conduct was as he explained in his testimony, and that's what we have. 
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We don't accept that. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fair enough. 
There is a reference to four Kibuye ministers in your brief.  I don't recall, who were those four Kibuye ministers?  Can you help me with that, please?
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I know there was the minister of justice, Agnes.  I know there was Niyitegeka for information.  I know there was Ndindabahizi for finance, and Edouard Karemera towards the end of May became the minister of interior.  Prior to that, it had been the permanent secretary in the ministry that headed that ministry.  So there were four of them at the end of the events. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you so far, Mr. Phillips.  Was that the --
@MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
This is the end of my part, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And now we are moving on to Mr. Kapaya.  Is that so, Mr. Kapaya? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Please go ahead.  What is your estimated length, just to plan a little bit our schedule this afternoon? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah.  In view of my -- in view of the able submission by my learned friend, who has touched almost all the issues that have been raised, I don't think I'll take more than an hour.  I'll just deal with a few issues that have not been addressed.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What's the estimated time for the Defence, please?  Just to plan these two days. 
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, it will also depend on the submissions made by Mr. Kapaya, because I understood that Mr. Kapaya was going to deal specifically with our final brief, and therefore I do not know how much I will have to speak about that, but I believe that approximately, it should take us between three and three and a half hours to make our final submissions. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we would prefer to hear you now, Mr. Kapaya, since you're taking about one hour, and then we can probably stop for the day, and then we can take the Defence for tomorrow.  And you have indicated about three, three and a half hours, and that will still give us a couple of hours for the second round, if needed, for tomorrow. 
Yes.  Please go ahead, please. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  As admitted earlier on, I will address the Defence closing brief on basically three issues:  One, that will be in relation to the defects in the indictment; the other aspect will relate to problems that Defence have pointed out in relation to their inability to prepare the alibi; and finally, I'll deal with certain evidentiary matters the Defence have alleged that they fall outside of the scope of the indictment.  And our questions on the assessment of Prosecution case, on all the seven massacre sites in which we charge the Accused person with, and the assessment of the Defence credibility on the Defence witnesses have, I think, been ably dealt with by my learned colleague.
Now, let me start by saying, Your Honours, that your role in this case was to hear and assess the evidence and, based on that assessment, determine if the Prosecutor has proven his case beyond reasonable doubt.  Now, this standard is very high.  It is designed to ensure that an accused is only convicted if the only credible explanation for the evidence presented is that he is responsible for the crimes for which he is charged.
Now, if, after evaluating the evidence on record, you have a doubt to any of the three counts the Accused stands charged with, you must acquit him of that count or counts.  On the contrary, if, after evaluating the evidence, you find that the Prosecutor has proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the counts, all the counts, you have a duty to convict him on all of them.
I submit to Your Honours that after evaluating the evidence led by the Prosecution in support of the charges, you will conclude that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, he is guilty as charged of all the three counts laid at his door in the indictment and proceed to convict him accordingly.
Now, let me now turn to the Defence brief.  In paragraphs 22 to 24, the Defence contend that the testimony of Prosecution witnesses is not credible because it's riddled with inconsistencies, errors, or that it's simply implausible.  As I said, my colleague has dealt with, with this question at length, and it is discussed, in part, in our closing brief in paragraph 6 to 16.  All I can say here is that when you have alleged inconsistencies and errors such as the ones raised by the Defence, you have, Your Honours, a duty to evaluate them.  You have to look at them and determine if they're significant or not.  You have to look at them and determine why they occurred.  Is it -- is that of a number of things in a different way, or is it a cultural problem, or perhaps the problem is that of passage of time, or trauma, or could it be a problem of translation, or it could be -- could it be the result of an intentional untruth?  These are pointers Your Honours will have to take into account in assessing the -- in determining the credibility of the witnesses.
Your Honours, I submit that the alleged errors and inconsistencies are a result of trauma and passage of time.  The witnesses are reliving these harrowing events, some like Witness CGV, for the third time.  You will recall, Your Honours, CGV testified in the Musema case, he testified in Ntakirutimana case, and he testified in this case as well.
Now, these events conjure up memories of death, sometimes of loved ones, under the most horrific circumstances.  Witnesses testify to events that occurred over nine years ago.  We all know that with the passage of time, memories tend to fade, and in the premises (sic), they're bound to be inconsistencies of some sort which, as we submit, are attributable to human frailties.  What is important, Your Honours, is that alleged errors and inconsistencies are not intentional untruths.
Let me turn to the problem of exclusion of evidence.  In paragraphs 109 to 111 of the Defence closing brief, the Defence have requested that the testimony relating to the Kibuye 3rd of May meeting, the participation of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in the interim government, and events which occurred at the Kibirizi market be excluded from the record.
Now, it's our submission, as intimated to by my learned brother, that the Kibuye meeting and the participation of the Accused in the government are relevant to the case as they form the contextual background within which we have shown the Accused persons (sic) committed the crimes as alleged in the indictment.  They are the circumstances under which we invite Your Honours to say that it is on the basis of these things that the Accused person formed the necessary genocidal intent to commit the genocide and the necessary requisite intent to commit the crimes against humanity and murder.  And in this regard, the Kibuye meeting and the question of participation of the Accused in the interim government are evidence of the background of the case in terms of Article 17(4) of the Statute and Rule 47(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
The Kibirizi incident, Your Honour, is relevant as forming a consistent pattern of conduct under 
Rule 93 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, as explained in paragraph 73, chapter 3, of the Prosecutor's closing brief.  As intimated earlier on, the event -- the seven events the Accused is charge with in Kibuye start with Kibirizi.  Kibirizi is right at the border between Kibuye préfecture and Gitarama, and that is where we say the Accused started his escapades, as far as the indictment is concerned. 
It is here that we say that he stopped, made some instigation remarks, distributed weapons, went to Fayer, did the same; and then Nyabahanga, he did the same; to Gasharu, and did the same; and Gitwa as well, where in addition to instigation and distribution of weapons, he participated in the attacks on Tutsi civilians.
So it's the Prosecutor's contention, Your Honours, that events at he Kibirizi market form a part of the pattern that is consistent with the, with the conduct of the Accused person, and this is important, Your Honours, in assessing the culpability of the Accused for the crimes for which he stands charged.
In paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Defence brief --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you refer to 109 and 111, didn't you, of the Defence closing brief?  That was what you addressed now.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That is what I said first.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, exactly. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, are you coming back to 112 later on.
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, I didn't arrange it in that sequence, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
But may I just ask you now, or the Prosecution generally, is it accepted that there was no evidence in relation to Bisesero, in other words, paragraph 22 to 24 in the indictment? 
@MR. KAPAYA:
I'll come to those issues, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that part three of your address?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Coming back to that, thank you. 
@MR. KAPAYA:
All right.
Now I come to the testimony of Defence Witness DN.  There is a contention in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Defence closing brief that the Prosecution, we say in one breath that DN is a credible witness, and in another breath we say that DN is not a credible witness.  And Your Honour, that is exactly the position we hold as regards this particular witness.
Now, it's our humble submission, Your Honours, that it is possible for the Trial Chamber to dichotomise the testimony of a witness in two parts, the credible -- the credible part and the not credible part.  Now, this is a phenomenon which has occurred previously in the Trial Chambers before this Tribunal.  I will recall Your Honour in the Bagilishema case where this very Trial Chamber had to grapple with that kind of problem.  There was the question of Witnesses YY and ZZ.  These are witnesses who manned a certain roadblock referred to as TRAFIPRO in Mabanza commune, Kibuye préfecture. 
Now, when it came to assessing the credibility of these witnesses, the Trial Chamber said, quite specifically, that they would believe anything the witness said that implicated him and they would disbelieve anything the witness said that implicated Bagilishema.  So there was this particular approach whereby the testimony of a witness is divided into parts -- into two parts, the credible and the not credible part, and we urge Your Honours to apply the ratio decidendi in that decision to the -- when assessing the testimony of Witness DN in this matter.
Now I turn to the allegations of defects in the indictment.  The Defence contend, in paragraph 48 to 43 and 1141 to 1147 of their brief, that the indictment is defective on two fronts.  They say that it's wrong -- firstly, it's wrong to rely on the same set of facts to prove genocide and crimes against humanity; and two, they claim that the indictment, as it stands, is vague. 
I start with the last one, the same set of facts to prove genocide and crimes against humanity.  Now, the Defence based their claim on the basis that the elements of the three crimes, that is, genocide, murder, and extermination, are the same.  That is what they say in paragraph 48 to 60 of their brief.  They also say that the victims, namely Tutsi, are the same.  In this regard, they give an example that we used the same set of evidence, namely the matters of Mukantabana and Karegeya, to prove genocide and crimes against humanity, murder, and events at Gitwa hill in April 1994 to support genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity.
Now, the Prosecutor submits that it's legally tenable to charge an Accused person with multiple offences based on the same set of facts.  It is tenable particularly where the offences, like in the present case, that is genocide and crimes against humanity, have different elements and aim to protect different societal or -- societal interests or societal values. 
Now, the use of the same set of facts to prove the offenses is intended to reflect the totality of the Accused person's culpability, and if found guilty of the offences, the sentences imposed for the various offences are usually ordered to run concurrently.  In the circumstances, what is punishable is the culpable conduct.  
The ICTY and ICTR have consistently opined that the issue of cumulative charges should be addressed at the stage of sentencing, that is, by sentencing the Accused concurrently for the established crimes when they are supported by the same culpable conduct.  This has been the practice in the Kayesu, Rutaganda, Ntakirutimana, Musema, Niyitegeka, and I actually can't think of a case decided by this Tribunal where this principle -- where the Kayishema decision has been followed.
Now, Your Honour, we have said that the practice of cumulative charging is accepted in this Tribunal where the offences have different elements and where the laws in question protect the different societal interests.  Whereas the Kayishema judgement correctly stated that the test to be applied -- whereas the Kayishema judgement correctly stated the test to be applied, it misapplied it on the facts of that case, and that decision has not, as I said, been followed in any subsequent decisions by this Tribunal.
Now, let's look at the elements criteria.  We submit to Your Honours that genocide and crimes against humanity have different elements and are not the same offence, as implied by the Defence.  Whereas genocide requires special intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a social group, crimes against humanity require that the crimes be committed on a widespread or systematic manner.  Now, in this respect, a single item of evidence may be used to prove two or more completely different facts.  For instance, the same evidence might be used to prove the existence of widespread or systematic attack, an element of crimes against humanity, and to prove the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, an element of genocide.
This would not mean that a widespread or a systematic attack is the same thing as an intent to destroy a group in whole or in part.  Furthermore, it would not mean that genocide and crimes against humanity have the same elements.  The Defence argument appears to proceed on the premise that the counts of extermination, in all manner, are subsumed fully by the counts of genocide.  Now, and this was part of the finding in Kayishema.  The Prosecution submits that there is no legal basis for that finding. 
Now, as Judge Khan's dissenting opinion points out in that judgement, that is, paragraph 32 of the sentencing judgement, "Such a view defeats the very scheme and object of the law."
Now, as regards the second element, that's the societal value or interest for which the crimes protect, the Prosecution submits that it's erroneous to say that genocide and extermination or murder protect the same values or social interest, that's the lives of Tutsi civilians.  The fact that all three crimes were perpetrated against the same victim, that is Tutsi, all of whom had the same status, that is civilians, does not mean that the three crimes protect the same values or same interests.
Genocide with its requirement of any intent to destroy an ethnic group, in whole or in part, serves to protect the Tutsi victims as an ethnic group, as such.  The criminalisation of genocide protects defined groups against acts aimed at their destruction, in whole or in part.  The interest which this provision is designed to protect is the right of such groups to exist as such, and not be subjected to attacks against their existence.
Unlike war crimes or genocide, crimes against humanity require, as a matter of law, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population.  In general, the prohibition of crimes against humanity seeks to protect civilian populations from large-scale or repetitive patterns of persecution or inhumane acts.  The prohibition of crimes against humanity thus serves to protect the victims from widespread or systematic attacks in their capacity as a civilian population, and not in their capacity as an ethnic group.
The rules proscribing crimes against humanity are designed to protect populations against 
large-scaled, organised attacks against them, and thus address the perpetrators' conduct, not only towards an immediate victim but also towards the whole of mankind.  The fact that each Tutsi --

@MR. KAPAYA:
The fact that each Tutsi victim had, in common, the status of a civilian does not mean that they lost their collective identity or status as an ethnic group.  For these reasons, Your Honour, it's our humble submission that genocide and crimes against humanity are different crimes; they have different elements; and they protect different societal interests, contrary to what the Defence have asserted in their brief in the paragraphs we have referred to.
The Defence also contend in pages 60 to 64, that the indictment is defective, does not comply with the provision of 7(C) (sic), in that, we used phrases like "during May", or "on or about", or "during April, May and June".  Now, the provision of Rule 17(4) of the Statute of Rule 47(C) of the Rules provide that an indictment, apart from the name and particulars of the suspect, shall set forth a concise statement of the facts of the case and of --
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, for the interruption, Mr. President, same problem.  Thank you, sir.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the problem?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Same problem, Mr. President: since the interpreters do not have the text, we kindly request --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Kapaya, you are not reading a text, are you; you are just arguing?
@MR. KAPAYA:
I'm reading some portions and then expanding them.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  What are you reading from?  Are you reading from any explicit text now?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, just from notes.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.  So that's why, dear interpreters: there is no text; he is arguing; he is simply making his submissions.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
Your Honour, it's our submission that the provisions of Rule 17(4) and Rule 47(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence have to be read in conjunction with the provisions of Article 20(2), subrule 4(a) and (b), of the same Statute.  Now, these provisions provide, in effect, that in the determination of any charges against an accused person, he is entitled a fair hearing and, more particularly, to be informed of the nature and cause of the charges against him and to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence.
Now, in the jurisprudence of the ad hoc Tribunals -- that's the ICTY and this Tribunal -- these provisions translate into an obligation on the part of the Prosecution to state the material facts underpinning the charges, but not the evidence by which such material facts can be proven.
Now, the question whether an indictment -- the indictment in the present case is defective depends on a concrete assessment of each allegation and involves a comparison of the material that was available to the Prosecution before the trial and evidence that was adduced at trial.  Your Honour, it's our humble submission that, even if an indictment appears defective on the face of it, it may be cured by provision to the Defence of timely, clear and consistent information, detailing the factual basis of the charges.  In the Kupreskic case, which the Defence have cited, it will say that in order to assess whether the Accused was sufficiently informed of the charges, the Appeals Chamber considered disclosed evidence, the information conveyed in the Prosecution's pre-trial brief and the knowledge acquired during trial, and we submit that a similar approach should be adopted in this case.
Now, paragraphs 1 to 5 of the indictment, which contain the words the Defence complain of, should not be read in isolation of the other provisions of the indictment.  These appear to be introductory paragraphs and, as we say, they support the allegations for genocide.  And, as you progress from the subsequent paragraphs in the indictment, you see that what is contained in paragraphs 1 to 5 is narrowed down and specified with more particulars in the subsequent paragraphs where we submit, Your Honours, that the Prosecutor's pre-trial disclosure; in particular, the witness statements as detailed in paragraphs 11 to 15 of the pre-trial brief.  Their request to admit referred to paragraph 14 of the pre-trial brief and knowledge acquired during the trial put the Defence on sufficient notice of all their allegations levelled against the Accused in this indictment.
Your Honours will recall the Kupreskic requirements were raised in the Ntakirutimana case, as against the so-called "Bisesero" indictment.  In paragraph 59 of the trial judgment, this Trial Chamber found that the pre-trial disclosure did cure the apparent defects that appeared in that Bisesero indictment.  We urge Your Honours to apply the same test and look at the matters we have referred to, to show whether the matters complained to by -- complained of by the Defence are not curable by the disclosures that we made in the course of this trial.
Paragraphs 69 to 73 of the Defence brief raise an issue relating to confusion as to the identity of certain victims.  When you read paragraphs 6 to 9 and 26 to 28 of the indictment there appears to be a confusion as to whether Tatiane Nyiramaritete and Helen Mukantabana are two different people, and whether Tatiane Nyiramaritete is a man or a woman.  The Prosecution submits that this should not have come as surprise to the Defence as they were aware of it well before the trial started.  That question is clarified in paragraphs 139 and 146 of the pre-trial brief, where it is stated clearly that Tatiane Nyiramaritete and Helen Mukantabana are one and the same person and that this person is, in fact, a woman.
Now, the pre-trial brief was filed on the 1st of August 2003, which was a month before the trial started.  Needless to say, the matter was clarified further by Witness CGB who testified to that issue in the course of the trial.  The Defence cannot, therefore, on this account be said to have been prejudiced in the way -- by that apparent confusion.
As regards the dates, they also say in paragraph -- in the same paragraphs the Defence complain about the vagueness as to dates in the indictment.  Paragraphs 7 and 26 of the indictment allege that Mukantabana and Karegeya were murdered in April; whereas, paragraphs 8, 27 and 28 of the indictment allege that the same persons were killed in May.
Now, the indictment was drafted on the basis of witness statements at a time when the Prosecutor did not know about the true identities of the two individuals; that's one.  Following reconfirmation of the witnesses and subsequent trial, the Prosecution was well apprised of the matter and, in the interests of fairness to both the parties and the Prosecution, we are not relying now on the paragraphs 6, 7 and 28 of the indictment to prove the -- to prove the wrong -- the indictment; in other words, Your Honours, we shall not be offering any evidence on paragraphs 6, 7 and 26 of the indictment.  These are the paragraphs that state that the two people, Mukantabana and Karegeya, were killed in April '94.  And this leaves us with paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 27 and 28, which said -- which say that the two people -- that is, Mukantabana and Karegeya -- were killed in early May.  Now, on the basis --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's clear now.  But I understand that the Defence's point is that this wasn't clear when the case started.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  Our submission is that there is no prejudice now because we have withdrawn the paragraphs which brought the confusion.  So, we are not saying anymore that Mukantabana and Karegeya were killed in April; what we are saying is that they were killed toward the end of May '94.  That's the basis of the case we are proceeding on against the accused person.
The Defence go further and say that in paragraphs 8, 9, 27 and 28 of the indictment.  We say that the Accused instigated the matter of Karegeya and Mukantabana in early May '94; whereas, all the witnesses we called in support of this event testified that the instigation occurred in late May '94.  They claim, therefore, that there is a contradiction between what is alleged in the indictment and what the witnesses testified to.
Now, when you look at the testimony of the witnesses, you will find, Your Honours, that Witness CGB testified in court that the Accused instigated the death of Karegeya and Mukantabana in early May, that is, paragraph 22, chapter 3 of the closing brief; CGX said it was the end of May, paragraph 10 of the closing brief; CGE said it was late May, paragraph 18, chapter 3 of the closing brief; whereas, CGF also said that it was towards the end of May '94.  As we said earlier, Your Honour, the indictment was -- the apparent confusion came about because the indictment was drafted on the basis of witness statements.  When you look at those witness statements, you will find, Your Honours, that Witness CGB -- the Witness CGB places the incident in early May.  The statement of Witness CGE placed the incident in May -- they don't say early, middle or late May; whereas, the statement of CGX and CGF do not give any dates at all.  So, it is not correct, as the Defence contend, that the witness statements speak of a different date; whereas, the witnesses came to court and spoke of a different date.  So it was a question of construction, and the witnesses give their reasons why they specified the period as late May and not at any other time.
The fact remains, Your Honours, that the incident occurred in May and that, as we said, each of the three witnesses explained why they gave the date as early May.  And we say, Your Honours, that, considering the contents of the witness statements as to the dates of the incident and the oral testimony of the witnesses in court, no prejudice whatsoever was occasioned to the Defence.  At any rate, the date referred to by the witnesses does not, Your Honours, fall between the 11th and 17th of May, the period the Prosecution concedes on the basis of the passport -- that's the Defence Exhibit D. 63 -- that the Accused had an almost watertight alibi.  It falls in a period where the Accused, as my learned brother has argued, has no alibi at all.  Had it fallen between these dates and then the witnesses had testified to something different, then one could have implied the witnesses could have had an ill motive in testifying to what they did.
Your Honours, in paragraph 15 and 16 of the indictment, it is averred that the Accused instigated -- conveyed attackers and participated in attacks on Tutsi civilian at Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune between 13th and 26th of April 1994.  The Defence complained, in paragraph 77, that the witness statements of CGY, CGN and CGV, who testified about this incident, show that it occurred between the 20th and 25th of April 1994.  The Prosecution submits, Your Honours, that the assertion is simply incorrect.
Witness CGN's statement says it was around 14th April in one statement, and 20th to 25 of April in another statement; while Witness CGV gave the date as 13th or 14th of April; and the statement of CGY places it on the 23rd of April 1994.  Again, there is no contradiction whatsoever as the dates, 20th and 25th April, fall within the period covered by the paragraphs 15 and 16 of the indictment; that is, 13th to 26 of April 1994.  And, finally, Your Honour, this period is well supported by testimony in court.  CGV testified that he saw the Accused at Gitwa hill twice: that is, on April 14th at noon throwing a grenade at refugees -- you see that at paragraph 51 of our closing brief; and he saw him again on the 17th of April.  This is referred to in paragraphs 48 and 48 (sic) of the brief.  CGN testified he saw the Accused at Gitwa hill on 20th April, paragraph 40 of the closing brief; and CGY saw him on the 23rd of April.  So, it is our submission, Your Honours, that there is no vagueness or any incorrectness as to dates regarding the incidents at Gitwa hill.
There is also -- we also -- I move to the question concerning the alibi of the Accused.  Your Honours, as we all recall, Defence raised their defence of alibi.   Basically, Your Honours, what the Accused was telling you is that he was not where we say he was.  During the time and place, as we say, he was instigating genocide in Gasharu, or distributing weapons at roadblocks, or throwing grenades at Tutsi civilians in Gitwa.  He says that we are not speaking the truth.  He claims he was not doing any of these things, and he tries to explain why.
Now, we discuss his alibi at length in paragraphs 30 to 31 of chapter 5 (sic) of the brief.  Now, in this regard the Defence claim, in paragraphs 841 -- or 6 of the brief, that it was difficult, therefore, to prepare the defence of alibi for two reasons: one, that indictment is vague; and, two, that witnesses kept on shifting dates in the course of trial.  We have already, Your Honours, dealt with the issue relating to the indictment and the shifting of dates.  We submit that, in no way, did these matters prejudice the Accused in the preparation of his alibi defence.
The Accused produced only one alibi witness, Defence Witness DP.  His testimony is analysed in paragraphs 15 to 31, part 5, of the Prosecution closing brief.  And the passport, Defence Exhibit 63, and the hotel bills that the Accused produced as Defence Exhibit 62 provide the Accused with an alibi for the period 11th to 17th of May.
In the Defence closing brief, they have set three periods in which they say that they had problems with the preparation of the alibi.  The first period runs from 8th to 9th of April, that is Kigali.  In paragraph 89 of the Defence (sic) they say that -- the Accused says that on the 8th and the 9th of April 1994 he was in Kigali - that was the date when he was sworn in; whereas, in paragraphs 6 and 26 of the indictment, we tend to say that he was somewhere doing some other things.  We have already stated, Your Honours, that the Prosecution has abandoned the allegation in paragraphs 6 and 26 of the indictment and, therefore, this complaint is moot.
Then there is period 12th, 13th and 14th of April, Gitarama.  This period relates to activities of the Accused in Gitwa hill and is the subject of paragraphs 15 and 16 of the indictment.  The Defence claim that the Accused was in Gitarama during this period, and DP purports to support this.  Now, our analysis of the testimony of DP shows that alibi was not watertight.  In paragraph 102 of the Defence brief, DP is quoted as saying the Accused could not have travelled to Kibuye from Gitarama on account of the distance.  Now, our investigator Mr. Baghel testified and produced evidence, Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, to show that Gitarama and Kibuye actually are hardly 76 kilometres apart -- these are préfectures which border one another -- and that the condition of the road in 1994 was good, such that one could make the journey in an hour and a half, and back.  So -- and there was no evidence led by the Defence to rebut that.
The other period is between 11th and 18th May '94 when the Accused says he was in Nairobi.  Now, the Prosecution accepts that the Accused was out of the country in this period and does not wish to attribute any wrongdoing to him for this period and, in this regard, the Prosecution is offering no evidence as regards paragraphs 17, 18, 22, 23 and 24 of the indictment.  Your Honour --
@MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the answer to the Bisesero question I asked?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, that is the answer to the Bisesero question, that we are not offering any evidence as regards to the allegations to the Bisesero things.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
@MR. KAPAYA:
The other period referred to is 19th May to 30th of May, and our contention, Your Honours, is that this relates to the activities at seven crimes scenes; that is Gasharu, Fayer, Nayabahanga, Gaseke, Gitesi and Kibirizi market.  The Defence have claimed that they could overstretch the 11th to 18th of May alibi to cover this period.  In our humble submission, Your Honours, it does not, and for this period it is our contention and our case that the Accused does not have an alibi for the events which we say he did at these seven massacre -- these seven crime scenes.  So, Your Honours, save for the eight paragraphs -- that is, paragraph 6, 7, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24 and 26 -- where the Prosecution offers no evidence, we urge the Trial Chamber to find the rest of the paragraphs proved beyond sane doubt, and to proceed to convict the Accused accordingly.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And to avoid any lack of clarity there, if you could kindly repeat that enumeration; will you do that?
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, it is paragraphs 6, 7, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24 and 26.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's eight paragraphs.
@MR. KAPAYA:
Yes , that's right, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
@MR. KAPAYA:
It is in these paragraphs, and we offer no evidence.  As for the rest, Your Honour, we submit that we have proved our case beyond any sane doubt against the accused person.
I have no further submission.
@JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Kapaya, did you say para 9, para 9(2)?
@MR. KAPAYA:
No, 9 is not mentioned; 6, 7, 17, 22, 23, 24 and 26.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  That's noted.
@MR. KAPAYA:
That's all, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
That's all.  All right.  Thank you very much indeed.
I don't see that we will get into time problems if we stop now, because we have one full afternoon left.  So that would seem to be quite fine, wouldn't it?
Yes, all right.  Thank you very much.  So far, Prosecution; and we will then start again tomorrow at two o'clock.  And one of the reasons why we have to stop is there is another meeting scheduled in a few minutes which we have to be present at.  Thank you.
Court is adjourned until tomorrow.

@MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.  
Defence, you have the floor.
@MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, if I'm allowed at this juncture of the trial to put -- set out my personal opinion, I'll say that we on the Defence are totally convinced of the innocence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  The Prosecutor's closing arguments has not weakened our conviction.  On the contrary, masks have fallen down; issues which have been in suspense for a long time have received the answers.  Yesterday we were surprised by the fact that half of the indictment fell through -- collapsed during the hearing, and this is spectacular and rare.  The other half of the indictment is still there, but it's too late, Your Honours, to find makeshift solutions, because truth keeps going forward and no one can stop it.  
Today we will see how the indictment was set out, and it was done blindly, so to speak.  Yesterday, at 4:30 p.m., the Prosecutor confessed that the indictment had been drafted on the basis of witness statements; whereas, the Prosecutor was not aware of the identity of the victims.  I'd like to add that he was not informed about the dates; he was not informed about the venues, the localities or even about the presence of the Accused on those sites.  So all those fanciful statements made at the beginning of the trial are done with.  Today we have to take into account the social - cultural context.  This signifies that, according to the Prosecutor, 200 metres for a witness can be ten to 20 metres; or 9th of April 1994 is transported miraculously to the 30th of May 1994.  
Mr. President, Your Honours, we agree on only one point in respect of the Prosecution's closing arguments which were made yesterday, and that point is that, before this Tribunal, the standard of evidence is very high, and those standards have not been achieved by the Prosecutor at all.  I'm convinced, Mr. President, Your Honours, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is innocent of the crimes with which he's charged.  And I've had this conviction since my trip to Rwanda in Kibuye in the Gasharu préfecture in 2002.  I have to talk to -- tell you about the Kibuye préfecture but, particularly, the Gasharu cellule because I believe that I'm the only one here who had the opportunity to go there.  I don't want to make a submission of our -- the Defence brief.  I think that we have submitted 175 pages of legal explanation, matters concerning witnesses, so I'm trying, really, to broaden the scope and moving on to something else.  Gasharu is a small cellule which is reached when you leave Gitarama going towards Kibuye.  You come to that cellule, and the distance is about 66, 70 kilometres.  The road now is good, but in 1994 the road was not good.  
The Prosecutor told you, Your Honours, yes, they said - and, yesterday, too, at five past 5:00 with regard to Prosecution Exhibit 2, the expert -- that is, the investigator of the Tribunal -- showed that the distance between Gitarama and Kibuye is not more than 66 kilometres and that the state of road in 1994 -- in nineteen -- was good, so much so that you could reach -- you could travel between the two points in 90 minutes.  This is important, Mr. President, Your Honours, in view of the alibi defence of the Accused.  
And if we are to look at the statement made by that investigator on the 1st of September nine -- 2003, and I have before me the statement, page 19, that is, the transcript, the Defence asked the investigator: "With regard to the portion of the road between Gitarama and Kibuye, can you describe to us the state of the road and its quality at the time -- the surface quality at that time?"  And the answer of that investigator was: "In fact, I took that road on several occasions, and within the context of my report, I took that road on the days which I mentioned during 2003; that is, from the 11th to the 18th.  At that time, the road was tarmacked; that is, between Gitarama and Kibuye."  
Question by Defence: "Do you know about the state of that road in 1994?"
"No, I don't have information about the state of that road in 1994."
"Didn't you ask the authorities what was the state of the road in 1994, because that's of interest to us?"
Answer of the investigator: "No, I didn't ask this specific question.  I didn't put it to the authorities, that is, in respect of the state of road in 1994."  
Mr. President, Your Honours, people who travel lid on that road before the year 2000 know that it's a dirt road and one need not one and a half hours only to cover the distance between Gitarama and Kibuye, but one needed double that time.  When you go towards Kibuye you have to turn left, approximately at a place named Kayenzi, and there you take a real dirt road.  And you somehow travel for about 45 minutes, one hour in order to reach the Gitaka centre.  The Gitaka centre is not a market.  It's not a village square either; there's no church.  They are not real traders; there's just something put up, which you know, Mr. President, because during the trial mention was made of it on several occasions.  
Now, in Gitaka you have about 15, 20 houses, and when you are there, you still not -- have not reached Gasharu.  You have to park the vehicle there and walk through a path going up towards the mountain -- or, rather, on the hills up to the Gasharu cellule.  And when you get to Gasharu cellule, you don't know where you are because there's nothing to indicate to you where you are because the Gasharu cellule has about 15 wooden and mud earthern houses grouped on a hill, and in that cellule you have ten, 12, maximum of 15 families.  It is there in that cellule where the Accused hails from: that is where he was born; that is where he grew up; that is where he had a relationship with members of his family as well as his neighbours when growing up.  The Gasharu cellule has the specificity of being inhabited by as many Tutsis as Hutus.  And between the 1950s and 1994, that cellule was not mentioned when it came to ethnic confrontation.  Even in 1994 the genocide did not strike Gasharu that hard because there weren't many people to be eliminated there.  Genocide in Kibuye took place on -- when you talk of the 18th of April 1994, when you had more than 10,000 people dead at the Home Saint-Jean, at the church, at the stadium in that Bisesero area; 200,000 Tutsis perished in the course of April and beginning of May in 1994 in Kibuye.  But this does not mean that other Tutsis were not killed in their areas of inhabitation and areas of birth.  Indeed, some Tutsis, those who were not lucky or who did not have the opportunity to escape, were murdered in Gasharu and its environs.  But today, when 2002 Defence teams went to Gasharu, they were not expected and the population were there to see who are these muzungu who had come to see them and to ask -- seek information from them.  
I would like to assure you, Mr. President, Your Honours, that no one, no one, said a word against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, either in Gasharu or anywhere else.  This is one of the strengths of the conviction of the Defence, and which is my conviction as well.  The Prosecutor has his certainty and we have our certainties, and our certainties are not based on my personal opinion; our certainties are based on elements which constitute the pillar on which, later, I'll ask for the acquittal of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  
The first element is the weakness or shortcoming in the indictment.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you move on to that -- before you move on to that, Mr. Besnier, you have provided information now and, in particular, you stress that it is of importance that you can't travel from Gitarama to Kibuye in one and a half hours; it takes double.  That would lead us to three hours.  Do you have any further references, in your brief or, now, when it comes to evidence for the travelling time during that period?
@MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President.  The answer arises from my personal experience, which is not admissible before this Court.  We also drew it from the transcript which I read out to you.  I highlighted the fact that that investigator, who claimed that he travelled between the two points in one and a half hours, did not come to check to see that that road was in a bad state in 1994.  So these are the elements on which I base my assertion.  So now I'd like to go to the elements which I'll use as the basis for our seeking the Emmanuel Ndindabahizi acquittal.  
Firstly, I said shortcoming of the indictment.  Secondly, we'll talk about the fact that the Accused was totally unknown in Kibuye in Rwanda and even here in this International Criminal Tribunal and -- its investigators up to July 2000.  We'll also raise the issue about the weakness and the lack of credibility of Prosecution witnesses.  Lastly, we'll talk about the strength and the credibility of Defence witnesses.  
Now, with regard to the shortcoming or the weakness in the indictment, to be brief, we can first mention the various indictments which were set out successively in this case.  You had the indictment of the 5th of July 2001, which included direct incitement to genocide as one of the counts.  And then you had the indictment of the 5th of October 2001, which added to the first count, rape, and command responsibility.  And then there was the indictment, on which we're still working, which came out on the 30th of June 2003, which withdrew from the previous indictment incitement, rape, and responsibility, pursuant to Article 6(3) of the Statute. 
What is more surprising in this case, Mr. President, Your Honours, is that, in spite of the considerable streamlining of the indictment from 2003, the Prosecutor has persisted trying the Accused for political reasons.  With regard to the facts remaining in the indictment, we think that more than two-thirds of the indictment were not touched upon by Prosecution witnesses.  It's obvious that, to our great surprise, yesterday evening the Prosecutor abandoned a major part of the paragraphs of the indictment.  But just to mention a few examples: what can we do with paragraph 14 of the indictment, for instance?  Paragraph 14 talks about the Karongi site.  What happened to that charge, to that accusation?  Where and when did witnesses come here or go anywhere to talk about criminal activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at that particular site?  So will the Prosecutor look at that -- those accusations?  Will they look for witnesses, or simply they leave this accusation to go to oblivion?  Mr. President, what can also one talk about charges which are still in the indictment, but which have gone through a variation of dates and places, so much so that no one can recognise the indictment?  
Finally, this indictment, even in its amended form, has repetitive legal defects which can only lead the Court to declare it null and void totally.  I'll come back to that in a few moments' time.  
Second relevant point, which is the basis of the Defence conviction regarding the innocence of the Accused, is that Ndindabahizi was totally unknown to Rwandans, to investigators of the Tribunal, and to anyone up to June 2001; that is, when the indictment was confirmed by Judge Dolenc.  The Accused, Ndindabahizi, between 1994 and 2001, never had -- he was a refugee in Nairobi in 1995 where he stayed up to 2001.  Even when the operation, NAKI, took place in 1998, even in 1996 the Accused was in regular contact with the Prosecutor's investigators in 1996-97, the Accused met the investigators to provide them with information regarding the mode of functioning of the interim government, and this information he gave to the investigators of the Prosecutor.  Naturally, in 1996-1997 investigators continued at this Tribunal; the investigations continued in Rwanda, in Belgium and in Arusha.  There were cases in progress; there were reports; documents.  Entire books on Rwanda were published.  Judgements were rendered by the Tribunal, but none of such information, document, mentioned the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, none of them.  
Third element on which we base our conviction is that there is -- there are shortcomings and inconsistencies among the Prosecution witnesses -- on the part of the Prosecution witnesses.  We raised the participation -- the issue of the participation of the Accused in investigations, his cooperation with ICTR investigators in Nairobi.  
In 2001, the hostilities against our accused person was -- were opened.  We think that those hostilities were opened by Witness CGH, and from the outset, we should bear in mind that Defence Witness DF testified that CGH had publicly stated in 2001 that he had made false statements against the Accused.  We can link such assertion made by that witness before this Tribunal to the assertions made by Witness DC who asserted that he was offered $50 in order to testify against the Accused.  What a method, Mr. President, Your Honours, what a method when it comes to investigation?  CGH is the witness who claimed that he survived the massacres at the Gatwaro stadium in April 1994.  But today we know that -- in view of his own statements before members of the Rwandan police force and the Rwandan public prosecutor, we now know that nothing of that kind happened.  
During their testimonies before the Tribunal, Witnesses CGE, CGX and CGB admitted that they were recruited by CGH, who himself had gave -- had given a written statement to the investigators of the Prosecutor.  CGX is the mother of CGE.  CGS is the brother-in-law of CGF.  So, as we can see, this is a family affair.  Another group of witnesses testified against the Accused with regard to events which took place in Gitwa, in Gitesi commune; those were witnesses CGN, CGY and CGV.  To that group, I'd like to add CGM, who testified in respect of the subject of the alleged presence of Ndindabahizi at the roadblock at the Nyabahanga bridge during their testimonies before the Court.  
The four witnesses showed that they did not know the Accused and that they had never known him prior to that; therefore, they could not have identified him in 1994.  Witnesses CGN, CGV and CGM asserted they knew Ndindabahizi as being a manager of the TRAFIPRO store in Kibuye.  They insisted on the fact that Ndindabahizi was permanently at the TRAFIPRO office in Kibuye and that he was the manager of the store.  In any event, they said that he was there at all times and that they knew him at that store in the 1980s.  With exhibit to support the case provided by TRAFIPRO which did not -- which was not contested by the Prosecutor, Ndindabahizi managed to show to this Court that he never worked at the TRAFIPRO Kibuye, store.  
Witnesses called by the Prosecution -- this is the Defence opinion and I'm sure this is your opinion, too, Your Honours.  The Prosecution witnesses consulted one another in order to identify a person whom they did not know.  With regard to CGY, whom I mentioned earlier, his case was worse because it claims that he knew the Accused because he had met him 25 years earlier in a school.  
The last group of Prosecution witnesses is made up of two people; namely, CGK, who claimed he had spent 15 days five metres away from a roadblock, permanently manned by a significant group of Interahamwe, in Fayer in May 1994.  
We also have Witness CGC, who is extraordinary because he is a Tutsi, but who is being charged with genocide and he is detained in a prison because of the accusations made against him.  
Before moving on to another subject, I would like to take note of the fact that almost all Prosecution witnesses said that investigators of the Tribunal noted -- did not write properly their statements during investigation.  This is the case, in particular, of Witnesses CGH, CGL, CGC, CGF, CGY, CGK, CGE, CGB and CGX.  The investigators of the Tribunal maybe didn't do their job properly, Mr. President; but can one blame the Defence, which -- the Defence has to cross-check and verify the statements of the witnesses and, at the very least, ensure that there is consistency between written statement and oral testimony.  Can you blame the Defence for the bad work done by the investigators of the Tribunal, or can we, as we do, believe that this is a method which has been used by the investigators in order to try and sort out for a long time their contradictions before this Court?
Credibility of Defence witnesses: the Defence called 16 witnesses of facts.  You will recall, Mr. President, Your Honours, that amongst those Defence witnesses, five of them were Tutsis and were genocide survivors; three other witnesses were Hutu, and were guilty of having participated in the genocide, have been convicted and detained in prisons in Rwanda; two witnesses were also detained in Rwanda, but those witnesses had -- have pleaded not guilty.  Witness DP was an alibi witness.  Witness DA was none other but the daughter of one of the victims mentioned in the indictment.  As to Witness DF, he brought -- he brought into question the credibility of one of the Prosecutor's witnesses.  Finally, Witnesses DL, DV and DB were Hutus that were eyewitnesses of the events in which the Accused was alleged to have been involved in.  Our seventeenth witness, Witness DQ, is a Tutsi who was a genocide victim who had come to testify about the character of the Accused and who had come to talk about his visits to genocide sites immediately after the events took place; he came to testify that no one at the time felt that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was involved in those events.  The Defence also called an expert witness, Professor Lugan, and as well as the Accused himself.  
Madam President (sic), Your Honours, during your deliberations I hope that you will recall when assessing the credibility of our witnesses that two Defence witnesses, Witnesses DN and DQ, had testified for the Prosecution in other files -- in other cases, that have come before the ICTR.  Notably, Witness DN had been considered so credible by the Tribunal in the Niyitegeka case that the prosecutor congratulated him at -- during -- in court and said, "Please refer to the Niyitegeka judgement because the Court felt that you were more credible than even an expert."  And after reminding this -- you of this incident, I would like to tell you that in the closing brief the Prosecutor concluded by saying that Witness DN gave false testimony.  In fact, all of the witnesses have a direct -- all of the Defence witnesses have a direct link with what -- with the events that took place.  And it is also true that the persons who were there when the events took place, or who know -- because these are persons who have a detailed knowledge of events that took place at the time.  
As to the events in Gasharu, four witnesses lived in the cellule in 1994.  Four witnesses were close relatives of the victims of acts attributed to the Accused.  One -- two of the witness as are, the son and the daughter of a victim, and the Accused has been accused of having killed this person.  The Defence would like to respectfully submit that these witnesses must be considered extraordinarily credible.  
You will also have to weigh the testimony of (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).  With respect to these persons, it goes without saying, Madam President (sic), Your Honours, that they had a particularly good reason to look into the identity of the person who killed their parents and the events that took place in Gasharu.  
Mr. President, am I going too fast?
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Just the right speed; thank you very much. 
@MR. BESNIER:
The Defence would like to ask the Trial Chamber to take note of the fact that testimony coming from Tutsis, and from persons who were related to the victims, have a higher probative value than other witnesses when they spoke in favour of the Accused.  One cannot find any reason whatsoever that might push someone to come and testify for someone who might be responsible for the death of his mother or father, regardless of the circumstances.  What can lead (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) to come and testify in Ndindabahizi's favour if he had any doubt whatsoever that (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) in the death of (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal)?  Money, most likely; that would be impossible.  
Similarly, testimony given by the killers, those who appeared before the Trial Chamber and who have pleaded guilty before Rwandan authorities, are very credible.  Indeed, these detainees have already spoken the whole truth and they have testified; they have confessed; they have been sentenced; they have been convicted to life imprisonment.  What do they have to lose by coming to testify for Ndindabahizi -- or what do they have to lose?  But, more importantly, what do they have to win?  Mr. President, Your Honours, do you think that coming to testify today for a former member of the interim government might improve the conditions of detention?  I don't think so.  Moreover, the testimony of these detained witnesses are all corroborated by the other witnesses who were eyewitnesses to the events.  
Finally, the Defence called on Professor Lugan and, in the Defence's view, he was very useful in bringing to light the conditions in which the interim government had been formed and to show in which manner, ultimately, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was hostage of this government, rather than being a servant of this government.  
These -- not that I have dealt with these preliminary matters -- I would now like to draw your attention, Madam President (sic), Your Honours, to the legal issues raised by the indictment.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, before you move on to the leading issues Maître -- you have learned -- stressed that CGH is a driving force here, and it's also stated that CGH, according to three witnesses, recruited these witnesses.  Could you give me the reference in your brief when it comes to the recruitment admissions of these three witnesses, either now or at some later stage?
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President; it's not CGE, but actually CGH.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and CGH was what I said in English.  So I said CGH, and the question is: could you assist me with the references here?  It's only a translation problem when you heard another name.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, this will come up subsequently.  Initially, I wanted to deal with more general matters, but we shall go into these matters in details in the minutes that follow.  
With your leave, I would now like to deal with the legal issues that -- there are two of them.  I'm going to go fast, specifically with the first one which is a concurrence of crimes.  And in our motions and in our closing brief, we have already dealt with this matter.  In its decision of the 20th -- or, rather, the 30th of May 2002, the Trial Chamber was of the view that the trial Judge -- that is you, Madam President (sic) and Your Honours -- should deal with this.  I think that the Trial Chamber was right in taking this decision at the time because now we can pay more attention to the facts that, in fact, underlie this concurrence of crimes.  The Trial Chamber is in a better position to verify that the Prosecutor used exactly the same elements, the same evidence, to prove genocide and crime against humanity.  
The murders that are being indirectly attributed to Ndindabahizi and, specifically, that of Mukandabana and Karegeya, are presented cumulatively to support genocide and crimes against humanity, murder; moreover, the events in Gitwa are cumulatively presented to support genocide and crimes against humanity, extermination.  
In that case, we submit that what we have is the same set of acts constituting several offences and so, basically what we have -- the Defence submits is that we have one set of evidence that is being used to qualify several crimes.  The elements constituting these three offences are identical: first degree murder which is required -- murder with premeditation, which is required to qualify the crime of genocide, is being mixed up with extermination and murder.  The specific intent that is required in both cases is exactly the same.  In one case and in the other, what was being prosecuted, is the destruction or the extermination of an ethnic group.  With respect to the interest that society must protect, they are exactly the same; the victims are the same.  They are the members of the Tutsi population and, more specifically, the members of the Tutsi population in Kibuye and, even more specifically, the Tutsi population of Gitesi and, even more specifically, individuals who have been named.  And, finally, the elements used by the Prosecutor for these three offences are identical; the same witnesses appeared in each case.  
Mr. President, Madam -- Your Honours, this will come as no surprise to you that I am using the only judgement at the ICTR that deals with that, and that is the Kayishema-Ruzindana -- the Kayishema-Ruzindana judgement stated: "It is only acceptable to convict an accused of two or more offences in relation to the same set of facts in the following circumstances:  No. 1, where offences have differing elements; or, No. 2, were the laws in question protect deferring social interests".  
We do not have the decision of the Appeals Chamber.  I know what I am talking about because I was Defence counsel at the time and the Prosecutor was -- the appeal was dismissed, and the Appeals Chamber was not given the opportunity to stature on this.  I know that there is case law on both sides, but I believe that in the Kayishema-Ruzindana case, the Tribunal -- the Trial Chamber analysed perfectly well the legal consequences of these events, and that is why I am using that case law as a reference, and the additional explanations that I provided in my closing brief to ask the Tribunal -- to ask the Trial Chamber, rather, that, in fact, genocide included crimes against humanity and that the Accused, therefore, cannot be convicted twice for the same facts.  
There is a defect in the indictments that, as far as I'm concerned, is even more serious than that of the one I have just mentioned, and that is the vagueness of the indictment.  The indictment, even in its formal form, or is it final?  Really -- I mean, last night the Prosecutor sought to amend the indictment further.  Not only is the indictment vague, lacking in precision, but it has errors with respect to acts that are being attributed to the Accused.  And, more specifically, the indictment is, generally speaking, vague, which causes prejudice to the Accused.  In the description of the facts, the Prosecutor mentions various events that took place in May, or around that date, or around the end of May, or during the months of April, May and June 1994.  
Another circumstance: the Accused -- the manner in which the Accused is alleged to have participated in the event is vague and fully defined in paragraphs 15 and 20 of the indictment.  Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is accused of having being in charge of a series of attacks; he lead or participated; he -- either he discharged the firearm or directed attackers.  We don't know if the Accused actually was an accomplice, whether he incited, whether he supervised or whether he actually executed those acts.  
In paragraph 13 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that, in late May 1994 in Kayenzi secteur at or near Fayer, Ndindabahizi supervised attacks upon the Tutsi, or participated in the attacks.  And then in his final closing arguments, these events that, in fact, are described only by Witness CGK, are suddenly moved to Gitaka; they no longer took place in Fayer.  And in the closing arguments that we heard last night, in another miraculous manner, the site of Fayer reappears as an autonomous element of an offence.  
You will recall, Madam President (sic), Your Honours, that in any case the Prosecutor failed to prove that these acts took place.  Because, regardless of the circumstances, the question is not -- he did not supervise the attacks or, at the very best, he might have giving a speech.  
Let us refer to paragraph 14 with respect to Karongi hill which should no longer exist.  And then what should be say about paragraph 16 of the indictment in which Ndindabahizi is accused of having -- throwing an explosive grenade on Gitwa on the 14th of April, on that date or about that date?  Whereas the Prosecutor announces in the hearing that actually these events took place around the 17th, perhaps the 18th, or the 19th, or the 20th but, in any case, between the 17th and the 20th of April.  
Finally, paragraph 11 of the indictment was so vague that it was the Defence who was able to identify the victim who appeared in the indictment.  First of all, this is a man of mixed race and, in the words of the witness -- this is a man whose name is Nturuso and, ultimately, it was the Defence, by bringing (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).  And I should like to add to that: as Nors was not a Tutsi, we do not see how this paragraph in the indictment would be relevant with respect to the crime of genocide that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi stands accused of.  
I would like to come to an end of this seemingly endless list by referring to paragraph 25 of the indictment that, again, is not supported by any evidence.  During mid-April 1994 Emmanuel Ndindabahizi instigated an order by the persons at a roadblock; which persons, which roadblock?  This indictment is a list of vague and imprecise accusations that cannot be used in proper form and cannot serve as the basis of a conviction.  In law, the Defence submits that this indictment does not follow -- or does not abide by Rule 47(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Most recent case law by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda confirmed this.  The Semanza judgement which was rendered on -- in May 2003, says that, "As the primary accusatory instrument, an indictment must contain a concise statement of the facts dealing with the crime or crimes with which an accused is charged.  The Accused also has a right to be promptly informed in detail of the nature of the charges against him."  Still, I will read further from Semanza: "The fundamental question in determining whether an indictment was pleaded with sufficient particularity is whether an accused had enough detail to prepare his defence"; "Whether an accused had enough detail to prepare his defence", and that is the important part of the sentence.  
It is under the Rules seeking to protect the defence that the judges must take into consideration when they're going to look at the indictment and determine whether it is vague or whether it was specific or not.  But the Defence firmly submits that, in the instant case, the rights of the Defence were infringed upon, more specifically, with preparing the -- an alibi defence; more specifically, when they came to investigate specific events that should have been described in an indictment which should be the backbone of the Prosecutor's case. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to remind you that Trial Chamber II of the ICTR on the 25th of February 2004 gave an order, and in paragraph 32 of this decision it is said that, "When the prosecutor submits that an accused was involved in crimes, then the indictments must provide details of the identity of the victims, including the places, the dates in which these crimes were committed."
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That was a free translation as the interpreter.  
@MR. BESNIER:
We do not expect that, in view of the scope of the crimes and the time that has gone by, that the Prosecutor is expected to fulfil a mission impossible, however, if a specific date cannot be provided, at least they should provide an interval of time.  If the victims cannot be individually identified, at least you should give us their position within a group.  Finally, the Ntagerura judgement states that, "When the prosecutor cannot provide additional details than those provided in the indictment, then the indictment should clearly indicate that that is the best information available to the defence."  
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is again a free translation of that specific passage of the judgement.  
@MR. BESNIER:
The violations of the rights of the Accused do not stop there when it comes to the drafting of the indictment.  In fact, in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 26 and 28 of the indictment -- let me repeat because I made a mistake.  In paragraphs 6, 7, 26 and 28 of the amended indictment mention is made of the death of a teacher called Tatiane Nyiramaritete.  The death occurred in the cellule of the Accused; that is, the Gasharu cellule and not the Gisharu cellule as the indictment sets out.  In paragraphs 8, 9, 27 and 28 of the indictment, mention is made of a man called Mukantabana also in Gasharu where it is alleged -- where it is mentioned that he was killed.  And this is absolutely unbelievable, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor had to wait for the case in court and the testimony of CGB in order to realise that, in reality, Nyiramaritete and Mukantabana were one and the same person; that Mukantabana was not a man but, rather, Mukantabana was a -- Nyiramaritete was the nickname of Mukantabana.  And this is confirmed by the Prosecutor; that is, Nyiramaritete was the nickname of Mukantabana.  But we don't know what was the origin of this mistake.  We did not hear from the Prosecutor any explanation regarding the consequences of this mistake.  The Prosecutor, it's true, yesterday said Nyiramaritete, Mukantabana were one and the same person.  It's obvious that the indictment does not reflect reality; therefore, we withdraw a part of the indictment."  But will the Court accept such an explanation?  We can say that, "Oh, look, Prosecutor, you've committed sins and you've accused Ndindabahizi of the deaths of Nyiramaritete, Mukantabana, but then we forgive you."  Today, Nyiramaritete is no longer Tatiane, but we are told now this is Helen; this is again a third name which just pops up out of nothing.  
In truth, Mr. President, the consequences of this mistake are considerable for the Defence because, as if to further mislead the Defence team, Mukantabana and Nyiramaritete were killed on two different dates; the first on the 9th of April 1994, and the second in May 1994.  Therefore, the Defence should start from the outset to carry out its investigations on totally erroneous premises.  And, once again, this should actually deepen the pitfall on the part of the Defence because the indictment does not end there as far as errors are made.  All the dates given to the Defence in the indictment are false. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday the Prosecution withdrew paragraphs 6 and 7 and said that they are now relying on paragraph 8 of the indictment.  Now, in paragraph 8 there is the reference to the two men known as Karegeya and Mukantabana.  So what is the position of the Defence now, based on the fact that it is paragraph 8 of the indictment which is still being maintained by the Prosecutor?  Can I just have your comment on that, please? 
@MR. BESNIER:
I have two answers to that question, Mr. President.  My first answer is that it's too late.  The mistake corrected yesterday in this Court by the Prosecutor has already created consequences and has -- is prejudicial to the Defence, so the Defence could not carry out in its investigations on specific elements regarding the death of two different people.  It's too late.  The prejudice caused to the Defence is that -- the Defence was not allowed to take advantage of having investigations and find a possible defence of alibi, as we would have liked.  
Secondly, I think that paragraph 8 of the indictment as maintained is not more acceptable as presented as paragraph 6 and 7, because in this paragraph 8 we have the following words: "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi thanked the people, who were present, for their efforts, but warned them that two men known as Karegeya and Mukantabana were still alive."  And if you look at the beginning of paragraph 8, the date of the event is in early May 1994; yet, all the Prosecution witnesses who came here, as well as the Prosecutor himself yesterday, said that this was at the end of May 1994.  Now, on the basis of the witness statements, on the investigations on the ground, was the Defence able to verify that at the beginning of May in 1994 -- were murdered?  If -- this would have allowed us to have equality of arms and respond to the Prosecutor's allegations, and this was not the case.  We think that this paragraph still has all the shortcomings mentioned.  
And another comment I'd like to make before to this Court concerning some legal issues: I'd like to draw, firstly, the attention of the Court to the fact that the mistake related to the confusion of people comes on top of the mistake related to dates in the indictment, and this is very serious as far as the situation is concerned.  
Prosecution witnesses obviously mentioned facts which resemble those mentioned in the indictment, but which are not really identical, and at any rate, those events took place on dates which are far from the dates mentioned in the indictment; for example, Witness CGF testified to the events which occurred, according to his oral testimony, at the end of May 1994, but the indictment situates the events on the 9th and 10th of April 1994.  Witnesses CGB, CGX and CGE testified on events which occurred at the end of May 1994, according to their oral testimony, but those events in the indictment, particularly in paragraph 8, are placed at the beginning of the month of May.  Same thing applies to the events in Gitwa whereby the indictment situates such events between the 13th and the 26th of April, 1994 on the one hand, and on the 14th of April 1994, on the other hand.  However, according to testimonies before this Court, those events actually took place between the 20th and 25th of April 1994.  
The Defence was not -- could not have been informed of the serious mistakes before these testimonies of the witnesses because their written statements confirmed the dates mentioned in the indictment, and this is prejudicial to the Defence.  It's only during the testimony of the witnesses before the Court that the Defence realised the dates did not tally with the dates mentioned in the indictment, and at that time it was too late to conduct investigations because investigations were over.  The Defence, therefore, submits that it is particularly unfair to mislead the Accused in respect of dates of events by amending, during the trial, testimony in favour of Prosecution witnesses.  The Accused cannot start all over again the preparation of his trial when witnesses come here to testify for the Prosecution.  
On a legal level, the situation is a bit special because it's different from the situation prevailing in Tadic at ICTY and Kayishema-Ruzindana at ICTR in 1999.  At that time, the Prosecution was blamed for providing allegations which were too vague but, here, it's the opposite.  There was specificity -- there was (undecipherable) specificity and a lot of errors which mislead the Defence.  However, there are some legal elements which have to be taken into account in order to take into account this fact.  I think that the Appeals Chamber had the last word in the Kupreskic case because the Appeals Chamber on the 23rd of October 2001 ruled that, "A decisive factor in determining the degree of specificity with which the Prosecution is required to particularise the facts of its case in the indictment is the nature of the alleged criminal conduct charged to the accused; for example, in a case where the prosecution alleges that an accused personally committed a criminal act, the material facts, such as the identity of the victim, the time and place of the events, and the means by which the acts were committed have to be pleaded in detail.  The Appeals Chamber continued. 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
We have, of course, paragraph 82 in front of us, so we will read paragraph 82.  We note that you have quoted these two elements in your brief and we are aware of that.  May I ask you, because now I notice that you are on the point of leading the legal issues in the indictment: quite frequently in your brief you refer to the indictment of 20th August 2003, but there is no dispute that they are talking about the one of 1st September, of course, in the latest version, just for the record.
@MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, Mr. President.  It's simply a technical issue of technical modification, but the comments are valid for both cases.  And, indeed, Mr. President, I'll conclude with the legal matter to highlight the significant consequences which the Appeals Chamber placed on the indictment.  And if an indictment is vitiated in such a manner, then the Court may annul a verdict of -- may reverse a conviction.  
We're not leaving totally legal matters, Mr. President, because now I'd like to talk about what the Prosecutor called in his closing arguments "contextual questions".  This is, in a way, the third legal issue.  I don't know whether this is a legal issue, as such, because we have to put a name on this strange paragraph, on this unidentified object, which the Prosecutor calls contextual matters -- he calls, in his brief, the "general context" under which crimes are committed.  Is he talking about the social political context of Rwanda?  No.  Is he talking about specific context regarding the Accused; that is, some elements of biographic natures as well as allegations related to the presence of the Accused in the government?  What is legal nature of the section of the Prosecution's brief titled "General Context"?  Is it as the Prosecutor said, intended to define the mens rea?  I mean, not because the elements presented by the Prosecutor are not linked to the charges against the Accused but, rather, it talks about different elements, like the meeting of 3rd of May in Kibuye.  Moreover, we know that mens rea in genocide is different from mens rea in crimes against humanity.  And in the Prosecution's closing brief there is no distinction between the two.  Therefore, is it something to do with the consistent pattern of conduct pursuant under Rule 93(A) the Rules of Procedure?  The Prosecutor doesn't say so.  It is not acceptable for the Prosecution to refer to 93 of the Rules in order to have admitted a significant amount of information which has nothing at all to do with facts, and without giving the Accused the chance of defending himself, and of carrying out investigations on those specific points.  
I think that this is an issue which should be ruled upon by the Court because Rule 93 always poses problems for defence teams.  Firstly, there are problems going beyond the limits of Rule 93(A), and I don't know of any decision which has dealt with this issue.  We also need to know the amount of information that can be brought into evidence pursuant to Rule 93(A) and what amount of information can actually be linked to the information contained in the indictment.  I'll even, myself, say that the Defence -- as far as this contextual element, as far as we're concerned, this is an ULO -- an unidentified legal object -- because it presents in the Prosecution's closing arguments more voluminous documentation than the presentation of evidence; that is, 23 pages against 30.  So what is in this part of the closing arguments is that the Prosecutor omitted the acts mentioned in the 2001 indictment, and he's using the back door.  
The meeting of 3rd May was in the June 2001 indictment.  The participation of the Accused in the government is in the indictment of 2001, so much so that today we can ask the question: why did the Prosecutor amend his initial indictment and why during trial he did not file a motion seeking a new amendment to the indictment?  Now, given to over-hesitation in this case between individual responsibility and command responsibility, the Prosecutor has failed in the final analysis to prove either; yet the Prosecutor had the necessary time to conduct its investigations, and when the Prosecutor and its teams were talking with the Accused in 1996 and in 1997, there were teams on the ground carrying out investigations in order to prepare for five trials which -- whose setting are the Kibuye préfecture, and these are the trials of Kayishema, Musema, Niyitegeka, Ntakirutimana, father and son; and the trial of Mr. Bagilishema as well. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, and particularly you, Your Honours, the two lady Judges, because Mr. President took part in some of the decisions which I have mentioned, but I have to inform you that between 1997 and 2003 there were 209 people who testified before ICTR to speak to the massacres against Tutsis which took place between April and July 1994, before this Tribunal.  One hundred and twenty-five people appeared for the Prosecution; whereas, 84 people appeared for the Defence as Defence witnesses.  The Defence looked at each of those testimonies, read each of the judgements.  The name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi does not appear anywhere in the testimonies of those 209 people and in judgements relating to crimes committed in Kibuye, whereas, other names including names of people of a lower station in life than Ndindabahizi -- small traders; small cell leaders; minor cell leaders -- are mentioned; their names are mentioned in those testimonies and judgements.  How can one explain that the Prosecutor in 2001, all of a sudden, remembered that Ndindabahizi was an instigator of genocide committed in Kibuye?  Why didn't the Prosecutor think about Ndindabahizi in 1996 and 1997 when they had him, when they took tea together in a hotel in Nairobi?  Ndindabahizi explained in his testimony before the Tribunal how the Prosecutor contacted him and how the contacts were eventually ended.  Why didn't the Prosecutor take that opportunity to conduct investigations against a former minister in the interim government?  How did the Prosecutor not find at that time witnesses; whereas, in June 2001 the Prosecutor, all of a sudden, found all those witnesses?  During all those years the Tribunal had a complete document and dossiers which were reliable, tendered by -- tendered in the court.  This is the preliminary report of the identification of sites of genocide committed in April to July 1994.  That document was tendered -- I don't remember its name -- but it was -- my systems will find it, but that document is dated February 1996, and it is an important evidence for Ndindabahizi's defence because he's accused of having been involved in the massacres and murders of Tutsis in Gitesi commune.  The information contained in the document on the Gitesi commune, in particular, clearly show that the name of the Accused does not appear either among the perpetrators or the masterminds of the genocide in that area.  The name of a minister who is alleged to have taken part in such crimes -- I mean, his name, would it really have escaped the people who had drafted the document?  And I have to tell you, the person who wrote that document, Ignace Bayaga is a native of the commune from where Ndindabahizi comes, so, he must -- he should have known that such an important person, if that was the case, had been involved in the events.  
Now, along those lines, and I'll conclude, we have to remember the testimony of DQ.  DQ testified before this Chamber on the 6th of November 2003.  He's a special witness because he's a Tutsi and he lost his entire family during the genocide; his wife and four children.  He remained in Rwanda up to 2000.  He knows Ndindabahizi because he worked with him at the ministry of planning in Kigali.  He undertook several missions after the genocide, in 1995, within the context of reburial of bodies.  He was involved in the burial of Tutsis in that area who had been massacred in 1994.  And on those missions, when he was a member of parliament, he interviewed members of the population.  And we asked him, "Did you ever have any information regarding the responsibility of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as an instigator during the genocide?", and the answer is no.  Unless you are talking about the indictment, no mention was made of Ndindabahizi.  And this man lost his entire family.  He conducted the investigations himself in 1995.  He did not find the slightest trace of the presence of the Accused during the massacres at that place, at that time.  And I have to say that that particular person testified for the prosecution against Musema in 1999.  This is what we call the real contextual elements.  In summary and to conclude, the contextual elements are in favour of the Accused rather than the opposite, but the Prosecutor has refused to see so.  
And, Mr. President, before concluding, I'll very briefly like to make two comments because I have to answer two accusations made by the Prosecutor, but I'll be very brief on these points because it is in our brief, and this involves the meeting of 3rd May in Kibuye and the participation of Ndindabahizi in the interim government.  
I just want to illustrate two points of view which are actually two points of view of the Tribunal Chambers.  With regard to the participation of the interim government, I would like to simply underline that in the Bagilishema case the Tribunal underlined the fact that a person found to have knowingly been part of an organisation with criminal objectives will not necessarily incur responsibility; the person must have positively participated in the groups' crimes by substantially contributing to the crimes, or by influencing the course of related events.  But, in this case, the Prosecutor never showed that Ndindabahizi had any influence over the course of the events in Rwanda.  I will not go further on this point, Mr. President.  We have dealt with this issue at length in our brief.  With regard to the meeting of 3rd of May in Kibuye, I believe that we should recall, simply, that firstly the document on which the Prosecutor relies -- that is, the so-called transcript of that meeting in Kibuye -- is contested, challenged by the Defence because this is a document which was written well after the meeting had taken place.  We have no indication regarding the source or related to the drafting of that document.  When the only factual witness who attended that meeting was examined -- that was GKH -- when he was examined, he said he didn't remember whether the Accused had spoken at the meeting or, in any event, what he might have said.  And on this point, I'll briefly conclude, Mr. President, by saying that the meeting of 3rd May is not in the indictment, and the Accused participated at that meeting because the prime minister asked him to attend the meeting and if, indeed, he spoke at that meeting, no one speaks what he said at that meeting.  
Last point, because I see that I'm short of time: we would like to raise the issue of elements in the indictment and witnesses regarding Gitwa, Nyabahanga, Gisharu, and this is the defence of alibi.  And, once again, I'd like to shorten my explanation in this regard.  I'd like to underline that the errors made by the Prosecution in the indictment, the false information provided in the indictment, have had a negative influence on the search for alibi by the Accused.  We did not look for alibi regarding certain dates because those dates are not included in the indictment and we concentrated on the dates which are mentioned in the indictment.  Therefore, we found an alibi which was obvious concerning the period covering the 8th and the 9th of April 1994 because it was at that time that the Accused was a member of the government and had been sworn in -- and was sworn in.  We also produced an alibi which was not challenged covering the 11th to the 18th of May 1994 when Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi.  
I'll pause here briefly, Mr. President, on this point because the period 11 to 18 May 1994 is not an innocent period, if I dare say so; this was the time when the more serious crimes were committed in the Kibuye préfecture, particularly in Bisesero.  That is when a vast majority, not to say almost every Tutsi in Kibuye was massacred at Bisesero hills.  If we were to refer to the Musema judgement, as well as the Kayishema-Ruzindana judgements, then we note that the dates of 13th and 14th May are bloody dates in the history of Kibuye.

1530H
@MR. BESNIER:  (continuing)
Tutsis of Kibuye, who had escaped massacres at the stadium on the 18th of April and those who had escaped massacres at Home Saint-Jean, gathered at Bisesero hill named Gitwa -- at the Bisesero hills named Gitwa, and Muyira.  And on the 13th and the 14th of May an extraordinary, large attack was launched against the civilians who had sought refuge there.  Numerous testimonies testified to that.  Tens of thousands of people -- men, women, elderly and children -- were exterminated in the course of that attack.  All authorities who participated in those massacres were there.  And when you look at the judgement, you have the préfet, but you also have other personalities, but it's not up to me to reveal their names because their cases are still ongoing.  But no witnesses in that regard mentioned Ndindabahizi's name.  If Ndindabahizi had been an instigator of certain killings carried out in Kibuye, he would be there, no doubt, on the 13th and 14th at the Muyira hill.
The alibi covering the 12th, 13th and 14th of April 1994 was supported by Defence Witness DP.  Very briefly, I would like to recall that DP worked with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the ministry of finance.  Witness DP spoke not only to the 12th, 13th and 14th of April 1994, but he also testified to the period -- the subsequent period; that is, the rest of May.  And he also drew up a chart of Ndindabahizi's professional life and presence.  So I think we have to look at his testimony in a consistent manner.  He described a man who was amidst torment and chaos in the events of 1994 who, in spite of himself, was appointed the minister of finance in the interim government.  He worked as best as he could to, at least on the surface, make sure that the finances of the state worked; to see to it that civil servants were paid; to see to it that supplies got to where they were needed, and that witness, Mr. President, Your Honours, described all that.  And if you look at DP's testimony closely, he described the day-to-day activities of Ndindabahizi.  Of course, he did not see him for every second of every day, but he would see him at least every day twice because he would be at his office signing documents; he was trying to see how best he could deal with finances in view of the chaos that englobed Rwanda in April and May 1994.
In an attempt to minimise the testimony of Witness DP, the Prosecutor seeks to insinuate that in its closing brief he is related to the Accused.  This is speculation that was not supported by any evidence whatsoever.  The witness was asked, and he answered perfectly clearly, that he was not related in any way to Witness DP and that, in fact, he had been taken -- swept away by the events of 1994 and, somewhat despite himself, he had had to cooperate with the government.
In conclusion, I believe that this witness was sufficiently credible and well informed of the activities of the Accused so that his testimony would make it highly improbable that he -- that the Accused participated in any way in the massacres that took place in Kibuye between April and June 1994.
Mr. President, Your Honours, I am now coming to an end.  Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's alibi defence must be upheld not only because of the fact that it is reliable but, more specifically, because of the manner in which the rights of the Defence were infringed upon because of acts committed by the Prosecutor and because the Defence was not able to present in a timely manner an alibi defence that would have answered specifically the charges brought against the Accused.
We are not afraid to face those charges today, but in somewhat brief manner.
And now Counsel Marçais is going to go over the events that took place between April and June 1994 in Kibuye préfecture.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, Your Honours, as Pascal Besnier said in his opening words, deep in our heart we have a belief, and this belief, this certainty, is one that we would like to share with you.  You will have understood what this belief, what this certainty, is, and that is that when Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi working with the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor saw -- the situation turned against him and in just a few months, in an artificial manner, a case was prepared that we now have to deal with today.  Everywhere we went, including at the detention facilities -- this may seem somewhat paradoxical, because in European prisons counsel can usually only meet with their own clients -- we were told that, "It was a political case; Ndindabahizi is the most innocent amongst us but, you know, it will be difficult for you to deal with the Tribunal".  But we feel full of confidence because we know that the ICTR is an independent Tribunal and that you will apply virtue in the Roman sense of it, that is, courage when faced with these accusations; we know that you will be able to sift through them and find the truth and choose acquittal.
We are convinced that our witnesses are credible.  We want to be credible, and we even dare to think that the Trial Chamber will be even more credible in the eyes of the world, not necessarily in the eyes of Rwanda because we know the pressures take there, but in the eyes of the world you will be credible and will be prepared to acquit Mr. Ndindabahizi.
This is a somewhat unusual trial for an international tribunal.  When I arrived here at the request of Counsel Pascal Besnier I thought of the international tribunal in Nuremberg, of this tremendous trial that lasted a year, of those organisers of those terrible crimes in the genocide in Europe between '39 and '45.  But, here, I have a case of a single man who is accused of having participated in specific events.  And the accusations made against him may seem somewhat unusual.  And in these individual desire -- acts in that we don't know that there were individual acts, that is, it was inciting because he was a minister of the government; or whether it was just incitement, instigation, that we don't really understand.  The question that you have to deal with, Mr. President and Your Honours, is within this time when the devil was stronger than God, when violence dealt with the sacred, and where 800,000 Tutsis were massacred in the genocide.  But we should also like to say that 200,000 Hutu were also killed in the fighting with the RPF and, as they went through Rwanda and the former Zaire.  But the question is: did they really need this man, this small man to galvanise the population even though he was the former minister for finance and do we really need this man to distribute machetes?
I would now like to deal more with this point.  When we speak of the charges against Ndindabahizi in Rwanda in this terrible context -- sometimes smile when they hear of this.  And it is necessary to distribute machetes?  So the first point is that they are trying to make us believe that in this case fabricated by the Office of the Prosecutor at the end of the year 2000 that Ndindabahizi, the minister of finance, was not busy in his office in Gitarama in this government, that Professor Lugan considered this government similar to the fall of Saigon, than a strong government, that in his description at the end of this regime he described it as a distraction, some form of amusement.  He would take that car; he would get a few Interahamwe to accompany him and then he would go off to the roadblocks where he would encourage people to kill Tutsis, including the women -- female Tutsis who had married Hutus.  Judge Khan was saying -- reminded us yesterday that the origins, the ethnic origins of the wife of -- Mr. Ndindabahizi's wife, even though she has a Hutu identity card -- or she is of Tutsi parentage.
I would like to ask you to refer to the testimony of (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) that he, quite frankly, had different things to deal with.  I don't want to read too much  because we will not have enough time, and I would still like to give the floor to my learned friend Counsel Pascal Besnier who will deal with the conclusion and the events that took place in Gasharu, because I was going to deal with all the other events because -- but because they were very widely described in the Defence's brief, the Trial Chamber will accept that I sometimes go very fast and cover these matters briefly.
Now, do people really need machetes to kill?  I mean, who are they -- who are we dealing with?  Other witnesses, including Prosecution witnesses, like Witness DF, on page 35 of the French version of the 7th (sic) of November 2003: "Can you tell us --"
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry; counsel read too fast for the interpreter to get it.
Counsel takes note of the interpreter's request for him to slow down.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Question, page 35, Wednesday, 7 (sic) November 2003 of the French transcript, the question is put to Witness DF, and you will likely recall this is a man, a priest, and he was asked: "Can you tell us whether you heard of any machetes being distributed at the Kibirizi market?"
Answer: "Distribution?  Who would have distributed them?  I did not hear of any distribution.  I am a bit surprised by this distribution -- this alleged distribution, and this is my sociological comment, because in Rwanda each peasant has a machete.  This is an agricultural implement that we use to chop down banana trees, to cut down branches, or to go and collect firewood.  This is an agricultural tool that we have at home, normally speaking; therefore, I do not see how or why anybody would go around distributing machetes to people who already have them at home."
If you were to allow me to, I would say that it was almost as if I went to a building site and sought to distribute construction material or to try and give a pair of scissors to a seamstress; I mean, whose leg are they seeking to pull?
When Witness DC came to testify, what does this witness say: "We had traditional weapons."  You must understand what Witness DC means: "Some hard machetes; others had clubs, but only one person had a firearm".  That is, again, the transcript of November 3rd, 2003.
Let us now go to the 31st of October:  "Everyone had a machete at home because in Rwandan culture everyone has a machete at home, and women are not allowed to touch their husband's machete.  The children are not allowed to touch the machete belonging to the wife and when a young -- the first thing a young teenager purchases is a hoe and a machete.  It's -- in our culture a hoe and machete have become a sign of maturity.  The first thing you do is you go and buy a hoe and a machete."
Now a Prosecution witness goes to confirm this on the 9th of September, page 2, line 14 of the French transcript: "Yes, in Rwanda, regardless of whether you are a Tutsi or a Hutu, inhabitants have tools, notably machetes, but usually they are used to deal with fields."
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you please slow down a little bit when it comes to the reading please, because you see the body language of the court reporters and the interpreters?
@MR. MARÇAIS:
I will try, therefore, to be somewhat less Anglo-Saxon - somewhat more Anglo-Saxon and temper my Latin sensibilities.  Thank you for your comment, Mr. President.
In any case, I was seeking to deal -- read a testimony given by the Prosecution (sic) on the 9th of September: "Usually, in Rwanda, regardless of whether you are Tutsi or Hutu, local people have tools and, amongst others, machetes but, normally, they are used to deal with -- work in the fields."
What I was seeking to say, Mr. President, Your Honours, as I was saying a moment ago, was that this was a sociological comment.  The average Rwandan farmer -- and just as the Greek philosophers would say -- would have -- used syllogism the Rwandan farmer has a machete.  When he is an attacker at a roadblock and goes to the roadblock he will bring his machete; therefore, he has -- does not need the minister of finance to bring him a machete.  And that is the only element in the Prosecutor's indictment, with the exception of the alleged use of a grenade, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was never accused of having done anything else.
If we look at the events that took place at the roadblock at Fayer, I would like to begin with Defence witnesses.  And I will say a few words of Prosecution witnesses, but I think it will be -- we can proceed faster if we begin with Defence witnesses.  Two Defence witnesses were interviewed about activities that might have taken place at the Fayer roadblock.  Their testimony is in contradiction of testimony of Witness CGK.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I will refer you to paragraph 949 through 950.
"Were there any roadblocks in Fayer?"
And the answer is: "Fayer in -- the place called Fayer or the place in Gitesi?"
"This is actually a place that is called the small centre of Kayenzi."
"That's correct."
Answer: "There were no roadblocks in that place."
"How do you know?"  "I know it because it's on the road.  The roadblock was 200 or a hundred metres afterwards in Gaseke."
"Witness DC, do you know this place called Fayer?", a question was put to him.
And he says, "Yes, I know the place well."
"Do you know if there was a roadblock in Fayer?"
"No, the roadblock was slightly before; therefore, there was no roadblock in a place called Fayer.  The roadblock was slightly before in Gaseke", and we shall return to that -- "in Kayenzi, and that is where the roadblock had been set up."
In order to support the charge that the roadblock existed, the Prosecution brought one witness, Witness CGK, and this witness says several things.  First of all, the Prosecutor explained to us that there was one element that followed; that is -- because the people had learned lessons properly -- the minister, Ndindabahizi, had a white vehicle.  Unfortunately for Fayer, they say that he had a small, black car.  Even though the witnesses have consulted one another, even though lessons have been taught to them, they must realise that in this case they are referring to a small black car.
With respect to the second point, I remember having done that first cross-examination and on several occasions, Mr. President, you had to draw my attention to this, and I thank you for doing this.  Taking into consideration the testimony of the witness, I sought to summarise what you said, because she had said, first, three weeks, then two weeks, which necessarily bought us up to mid-May, but in mid-May this date did not work for her and did not work for the Prosecutor, because we all know that in mid-May Mr. Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi.  Therefore, even though the mathematical and chronological accounting meant that the events took place in mid-May, the witness decided to say, well, actually it took place at the end of May.
The third point with respect to the testimony of Witness CGK which is very important, that is, the issue that comes back on many occasions in this file; that is, the identification of the witness -- or, rather, the identification of the Accused by the witness: in our closing brief we have stated that the witness can never -- without openly lying, a witness cannot seriously claim to know Ndindabahizi.  The witness claims to have met Ndindabahizi at a health centre where, in fact, he did not go.  She said that she only saw him on one occasion, and we believe that we have provided sufficient evidence, even though if it were up to us to provide evidence, even though the situation should be reversed where the Prosecutor should be adducing evidence, the witness cannot have recognised Ndindabahizi.
Amongst these inconsistencies, when I reread the file, one of them came to light.  The woman said, "I spent three weeks next to the Nyabahanga river.  Then I went to five -- a place located five metres away from the roadblock.  I stayed there two weeks without drinking or eating."  You don't need to be a physician to realise that if you can -- although you can go without eating for several days, you cannot go without drinking for several days because your kidneys become blocked and you die.  So, for this person to say that she remained for two weeks without eating or drinking is necessarily an obvious lie.  And, with respect to the identification of the Accused by this witness, our closing brief closes on this, and everything shows that in the testimony of Witness CGK that she could not have known him, and this is what he had to say.  She is even mistaken on the names of his father and mother, and this was a question that was put to her during her testimony.
There was a second point that I would like to ask, and it deals with the Gaseke roadblock and the death of Nors.  My learned friend, but nevertheless my friend, said that in this case -- in this matter of the death of Nors, the Defence had to -- was somewhat bound, because if one had sought to infringe upon the rights of Defence, one would not have proceeded otherwise.  The first question that comes to mind is from a legal prospective.  On the 28th of November 2003, Mr. President, when you asked Ndindabahizi were any Tutsi -- were Tutsi killed because they were Tutsis, and Ndindabahizi says yes.  He agrees that there was a genocide, because that is the definition of genocide.  Tutsis were killed because they were Tutsi.  But Nors is not Tutsi.  And we are told, "Through your distribution of machetes, you have contributed to the organisation of the genocide".  But if the organisation of the genocide is to kill a Tutsi -- or, rather, a man of mixed race, the Prosecution did not fulfil its role.  This is what we had to say.  That is the first question that comes to mind.
As Counsel Besnier said a moment ago, we have gone from a witness who was of mixed race; whereas, in the testimony of Witness CGC, a person called Nturusu -- and when our investigators go on the ground and they say the only person of mixed race who was killed was not Nturusu, but actually a person named Nors.  So we bring those who will allow us to identify Nors.  And in the Prosecutor's closing brief, I am absolutely amazed, astounded, with the manner in which he says "Nturusu alias Nors".  I must admit that I would rather have seen it as a somewhat more convincing explanation.  How we have gone from a man of mixed race whose name was Nturusu to a Tutsi named Nors is difficult.  We are -- our arms are bound.  I mean, we cannot -- it is very difficult for us to proceed in this manner with respect to this business with Nors, because we have finally agreed to the fact that the man of mixed race whose name was Nturusu, but actually Nors, whose relative were able to identify -- Witness CGC was the only witness who says that he saw a scene in May 1994, and he said that initially it occurred in around the 20th of May 1994, and then before the Trial Chamber he said, "Yes, this took place on the 20th of May 1994; I am certain of this".  In his written statement -- it was tendered as an exhibit before the Trial Chamber -- and the witness states that on the 20th of May 1994  at the Gaseke roadblock he saw Gaseke (sic) in a white vehicle this time; stop the vehicle; get out of the vehicle and then distribute machetes.
Am I going too fast?  Am I going too fast, Your Honour? 
@MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreter is nodding, a little bit too fast; isn't that the case?
@THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Just when counsel is reading, Your Honour.
@MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, only the reading; the talking speed is excellent.
@MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness CGC says that on the 20th May 1994 at the Gaseke roadblock saw -- the witness says that she saw Ndindabahizi who was in a white vehicle; the vehicle stopped; he got out of the vehicle and unloaded machetes and distributed moneys to the attackers so that they could drink, so that they could drink beer; and this distribution of machetes and money is the incitement to kill, incitement to kill the man of mixed race, Nors, with a vehicle driven by a person named (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal), and this vehicle later came through the Gaseke roadblock.
In this case the Defence did not just bring in Witness DA, who was (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal); we also brought another witness who is even more important and of which very little mention was made, and that is Witness DB.  This is the most important witness because this witness (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal). This is the person who was the most direct witness of the events.  And when I reread the Prosecutor's brief and when I listened to the closing arguments made by the Prosecutor, I realised that, in fact, they sought to contradict us on Witness DC and on Witness DA, but that, in fact, they had not sought to bring any light on any inconsistencies made by this witness.  I cannot give the name of this witness because he is a protected witness.  With respect to the Prosecution I take note of the fact that the witness waited some seven years to mention the facts -- the events that he witnessed indirectly on the 20th of May 1994.  You will also recall that the statement of this witness was collected in the Kibuye guest house, and we come to the realisation that, in fact, this place has become the Prosecutor's annex, and when Counsel Besnier asked: "When you were interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal you came to see him of your own volition, or did someone else ask you to come?"
"It was I who gave the statement".
Next question: "How do you know that the investigators were looking for information about Ndindabahizi?"
"I was in the position to know because someone spoke French where I was, and I heard that they were looking for information about this person, and I told them that I knew this person."
I would also like to draw your attention to the vagueness of the indictment with this respect, and I would also like to remind you that during his testimony, the statement -- the testimony, the witness said that, without any doubt, the date was the 20th of May 1994, and the witness even said, "I believe that that date is firmly engraved in my memories, my recollection".  And still on this matter of the machetes, I would like to say something further.  I'm not repeating what I have said earlier but, nevertheless, the distribution of bladed weapons, as opposed to firearms, to Rwandan peasants, especially when these are attackers posted at a roadblock -- Witness CGC does not question that -- the fact that the attackers were already armed.
Question: "Are you saying that before Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to the roadblock no one was armed with the exception of this person who had a spear?"
"That is correct", is the answer.
And, finally, the most obvious, blatant inconsistency is given to the investigators in -- on the 10th of October 2000 where the witness says, "I was present at the roadblock at the time of the events"; and during the testimony to the Trial Chamber, "I explained to you that this person was killed after I had already left."  That means that the person is saying something at the complete opposite of the statement.
"I don't know how the investigators were able to write my statement in that manner.  But, in any case, I was already gone when this person was killed."  Very often, when inconsistency comes to light between the witness statement and the oral testimony before the Court, the witness will say, "It is the fault of the investigators of the Prosecutor who did not properly take down my statement".  I was somewhat surprised by this.  I must admit that I thought to myself that the investigators, in general, including those of the Prosecutor, must carefully note what is being said by the witness, and that actually it is the witnesses who are changing their view -- the position of the events -- their view of the events.
Madam President (sic), Your Honours, I was the -- the witness said that he was present on the 10th of November 2000, and then he says, "I have explained to you that this person was killed after I had left", in their (sic) testimony.  And this was confirmed by Counsel Besnier: "The man of mixed race named Nors, is this the person named; Nturusu and Nors are one and the same person?"
"Yes, they are."
"But today you admit that you said you did not witness the killing, whereas, you told the investigators of the Tribunal otherwise?"
And he said, "Look, I think the investigators made a mistake."
Here, too, on this point, there's a problem of the acknowledgment by the Accused but, in particular, there is total inconsistency from the people who know about the death of Nors, and earlier mentioned the driver.  You will remember, obviously, that the driver -- he was a small man -- it was said that he left Kibuye; he met Nors and went to Rubengera to buy fuel for his vehicle, and on the way he met Nors and that, although Nors was still sick, he wanted to go back to work and, therefore, Nors got into the car and goes towards Kibuye.  But -- they were stopped but, nevertheless, they were able to get through the first time and, finally, the doctor, the physician, saw that he was still ill and, therefore, told him, "The best thing would be for you to go back home, and I don't know whether it was a vehicle -- ordinary vehicle or an ambulance".  But the witness -- the driver said under what circumstance he was forced to take back Nors to his house in Rubengera.  Nors was taken to be a Belgian, an accomplice of the Inkotanyis.  You will see the testimony of Witness DC who saw -- or participated from far, it's true, in the death of Nors, and talked about how he was taken from the vehicle, taken into the bush and murdered.  The motive of the crime is that (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) saw how Nors was taken into the bush, how he was killed, but that he did not see exactly how he died; but he saw how the armed attackers took him, took everything from him, took some of his clothes, and took him to the bush and killed him with clubs.
