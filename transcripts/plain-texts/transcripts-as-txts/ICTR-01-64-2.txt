MR. PRESIDENT:
The session is open.  Registry, could you please read the opening statements.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Madam President.
	
	Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andresia Vaz, presiding, Judge Jai Ram Reddy and Judge Sergey Ergorov, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 28 July 2003, for the hearing of the Defence motion for postponement of the date of commencement of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Case Number ICTR-2001-64-I.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, I would now like to ask the parties to introduce themselves, and we will begin with the Office of the Prosecutor.  Thank you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor this morning is represented by Melonie Warrett, Chief of Prosecutions; Andra Mobberley, trial attorney; and myself, Richard Karegyesa, trial attorney.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to thank you the Office of the Prosecutor.  And I would now like the Defence to please introduce themselves.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours, members of the court.  Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's Defence is composed today as Ms. Anne Ngatio Mbattang, who is co-counsel; and Counsel Kouengoua, lead counsel.  We will have Mr. Tharcisse Gatarama as our assistant with us today. Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We are now going to deliver a decision as to a motion that was filed by the Defence.  And I would now like to ask the Defence to present, very briefly, the reasons for their motion.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours, members of the court.  Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi has been detained in Arusha since the 21st of June 2001 -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry for this interruption, please, continue, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  As I was saying, Madam President, Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi has been detained in Arusha since June 2001, and we have been assigned to shoulder the heavy burden of his defence.  Madam President, as a result of this, we have called upon investigators and assistants, and thus, on the 3rd of November 2001, Mr. Aimable Sungura was assigned as the main investigator to our trial.  But as you know, investigators who work for the Tribunal are not professional investigators, well, at least, as far as the person whose name I have just mentioned is concerned, he conducted investigations on the ground and when faced with the difficulties, I asked and was able to obtain that he be assisted by another investigator who had more experience and who had just completed a case before the Tribunal.  And this person had a great deal of experience and thus, would be able to assist our team.  His name was Aloys Nyilingondo.  He was assigned on the 29th of October 2002.  

However, Madam President, even though my team has been -- although my team has been assigned, we have faced some difficulties.  We have not been able to go on mission.  I sent a work program on the 22nd of October in order to travel to Kigali and to see myself the site for which my client has been incriminated.  We filed a plan on the 22nd of October, where we've received no reaction, we received no response until January 2002 - or, rather, 2003, to receive a program for us to be able to travel to Kigali.  

On the 26th of May - or, rather, March 2002 -- or 2003, I wrote an order to relaunch this program of work, but that still has not been implemented.  In the meantime, I wrote to the section that deals with the processing of counsel's request, I said this situation is abnormal; my teams is blocked,  I do not understand what is happening.  By preventing us from travelling on mission and working does not allow us to proceed in a proper manner.  And therefore, I would like to request that we be allowed to go into the field and thus ensure Gacumbitsi's defence.  

Madam President, there was no follow-up, no response from them.  And it wasn't until the 27th of March 2003, that the work program for Kigali would be approved.  Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I fell ill just as I was about to travel to Kigali.  This is unfortunate, but I shall continue.  

I am now filing this motion to say that I am ill and that my client has complained because I have not been able to come and see him in Arusha because I was only allowed two trips.  I arrived here in May to meet with my client.  I am accompanied by my assistant and as soon as I arrived here on the 17th or 18th, I was told, "Oh it is for good, could you please participate in an informal status conference, your arrival is quite opportune."  I do not believe much in this type of informal meetings because I raised the problems that during the last 10 months, on the 23rd of May, and since October, we have not been able to go on mission.  

And the motion that you have received since the 22nd, and you have a copy in front of you, you will see that I have forgotten to mention a very important event.  Nyilingondo was assigned in October, and up until June of 2003 he would not have been able to go to mission.  Why?  I don't know. 

Once again, Madam President, I raise these problems during the meeting.  At that point after the meeting of the 23rd, my missions are approved for the 27th of May for my investigators to go out into the field on the 27th of May.  And because I have to take a ticket to make my reservations, I left on the 28th of May.  And I am convinced that as of the 1st, my two investigators would be able to go out into the field.  Unfortunately, once again they have to face difficulties in meeting this program.  

They have problems obtaining visas and transport and people have not been able since October 2002.  So, it wasn't until the 3rd and the 5th of July that they would be able to leave Arusha to go to travel initially to the refugee camps in Tanzania, then to Malawi.  Unfortunately, the persons contacted in 2001 have been repatriated, others have died and others still have moved for reasons of safety.  

In June 2003 my investigators, basically, are at the same point as we were at the beginning when I was first assigned in 2001.  And nevertheless, I come back here in June 2003 and at that point I hear that my presence is required on the 7th, but no one telephoned me; no one sent me a mail or a fax.  I come here on my own volition to deal with the work that I prepared myself.  I was meant to attend a meeting, and I attended the meeting --
MR. KAREGYESA:
I'd ask that counsel slow down for the interpreters and the court stenographers.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, I would like to ask you to slow down.  You are going very quickly.  I am following you in French, but it is difficult for the translation.  So, if you would be so kind as to speak in a more measured pace to allow everyone to follow the translation.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  Thank you for these comments.  Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, for your comments.  

As I was saying, Madam President, so I arrived in Arusha in June.  And when I arrived, there is a piece of paper stuck on the wall saying, "Counsel Kouengoua, we need you."  On the 7th, I was on the plane and arrived on the 8th, but I didn't know that I was expected to attend to meeting.  

In any case, it is decided that this other meeting will be held on the 10th.  And I participated in the meeting.  I lay out the problems that I have had to face.  And there seems to be a general consensus because it is said; "What do you think you can do to be ready by the 28th of July?  Do you need additional staff?  What do you need?"  
And I think, Madam President, that at the time, all of those who participated in the meeting agreed to the recommendations that were made by the President of the Tribunal.  He was assisted by other eminent Judges.  So we left the room.  On the 11th, I wrote a letter to my section stating that despite the problems we had to face, because I told you that the investigators still had not been able to move forward because when I sat in the meeting on the 10th, they still had not returned.  So I did not know what the results were going to be of their travels into the missions in the field. 

So I wrote on the 11th to say if that is the case and we had to have the trial on the 28th, I would like to request that I be assigned two assistants; one bi-lingual assistant, because during these different meetings, during the writing -- the documents that I sought to write, we always had to face the problem of translation with a short turn around.  It was a problem I would like to say.  You have seen this in the case.  I have had to call upon translators found here and there, untrained personnel in order to respond to the requirements of the proceedings.  

Madam President, up until the 22nd, which is the date on which I filed my motion, I have received no response. Therefore, I am in a position in which I have had to file a motion before the Trial Chamber, so that you will understand the facts.  I am not pointing a finger at anyone.  I am just stating the facts.  

I am trying to say, Madam President, Your Honours, this is the situation I am faced with.  These are the problems I have to deal with.  This is what we would like to submit to you as a solution so that there can be a perfect equality of arms during the trial of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  

Madam President, during these meetings we have also spoken of disclosure because - or, rather, of communication, Gacumbitsi speaks French; his counsel speaks French.  And I believe the person who chaired these meetings said, couldn't any efforts be undertaken by the Office of the Prosecutor so that we could receive priority translations or even communication in French, that all of the documents dealing with Gacumbitsi's trial be disclosed to us in French, even short correspondence.  The correspondence on the 24th of July, for example, is still in English.  We have yet to receive French copies of these documents.  

This is not all, Madam President, even though it had been promised to me that at the end of May that I would receive certain documents, I would only receive them on the 25th of June as a CD-rom.  And I was only able to view the CD-rom on the 15th of July.  And there are 2046 pages of documents that I am meant to review to be ready by the 28th of July.  I believe that is inhuman.  And the physicians here in Arusha can certify that this pace is unacceptable.  

This is why I requested, Madam President, Your Honours, very respectfully that the Honourable Trial Chamber that you preside would be able to allow me additional time; that is, to move the dates of opening of trial back so that we don't open the 28th of July.  This would allow me to provide an efficient and effective defence for Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  

These were the reasons why we presented this motion.  I wish to thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  Now, I believe the representative of the Defence Management and Witness and Victim Support Sections are here in the courtroom.  And I would, therefore, like to call on the representatives of those two sections to please take the floor in turn, to make their comments on this motion.  And thereafter, I will call on the Prosecutor to respond.  Thank you. 
MR. WASTLAIN:
Madam President, Your Honours, I work within the Defence Counsel Section.  My name is Laurent Wastelain.  I have been there for a number of months.  The person who is basically in charge of this section has been on leave for about a month.  I am going to give you a neutral and objective answer to the best of my ability as regards the situation of the Defence team; first, the investigators and the work program which was sent down, and then the two assistants who were appointed, one, on the 23rd of July, whereas the application had been put in on the 11th of July.  

Let me start off with what concerns me.  That is the appointment of the assistants.  Indeed, on the 11th of July, Counsel Kouengoua put in an application for the appointment of two assistants,                Mr. Gatamara (sic) and Mr. Tchoupou.  I took the documents.  And I believe it is important to underscore that communication from that point went on on a daily basis with Mr. Kouengoua.  I think we should not leave aside the fact that after the conference, the status conference, we communicated on a daily basis to make it possible for Counsel Kouengoua to be ready for the opening of the trial on the 28th of July.  

Now, as regards the appointment of Mr. Gatamara, there was a problem because Mr. Gatamara was an investigator for another accused person before this Tribunal, who is Mr. Karera, and for whom the lead counsel was Ms. Marchessault.  So, I informed Mr. Getamara, Tharcisse, that the section could not appoint an investigator - or, rather, an assistant without the approval of the counsel for whom he was working, taking into consideration the fact that there could be a conflict of interest and that the client of Counsel Marchessault might perhaps not agree with the appointment of Mr. Gatamara in the Gacumbitsi case.  

So on the 18th of July, I sent an e-mail to Counsel Marchessault asking if she agreed with the appointment of Mr. Gatamara.  He -- she, rather, replied and said that she did give her approval, but that she wanted also to have the approval of her client to the appointment of Mr. Gatamara as an assistant in her case.  

She also wanted, as included in her e-mail, that she would like to organise, along with the detention facility, a visit between Mr. Gatamara and her client, Karera.  The next day, I called the commander of the detention facility, who told me that he had reservations about the visit and that the lead counsel was instead suppose to call the client and inform him of the situation.  

So I got in touch with Madam Marchessault for her to get in touch with her client, so that the client could give his approval.  On the 22nd of July, since we had not received any reply from Counsel Marchessault, we communicated by phone and I told her what the situation was.  She told me that she was going to phone her client on the same day to obtain approval, and told me the next day that she contacted her client and the client approved the appointment of Mr. Gatamara in another case.  The following day on the 20th, Mr. Gatamara was appointed as legal assistant, and Mr. Kouengoua was informed on the very day.  

Now, as regard to the appointment of the second assistant proposed by Mr. Kouengoua, who is      Mr. Tchoupou, I examined Mr. Tchoupou's CV, and I recognised that he worked as an intern for the Office of the Prosecutor from September 2000 to February 2003.  On the very day I received the application for appointment, I sent an e-mail to the Office of the Prosecutor to know if, indeed, first of all, Mr. Tchoupou had worked in a case that might cause any prejudice to the present case, and to find out if there were any reservations regarding the appointment of Mr. Tchoupou as an assistant for the Defence team.  That was on the 18th of July.  On the same day I received a reply stating that the Office of the Prosecutor had reservations because a conflict of interest might arise.  I informed Counsel Kouengoua.  

I believe I tried to be as transparent as possible, as from the status conference I informed him of everything that I have just explained to you.  I believe he is aware of the entire proceedings on a daily basis.  So, the section decided not to appoint Mr. Tchoupou because that might lead to a conflict of interest.  That is the situation.  

Now talking about investigations, it is difficult for me to justify the fact that there was no communication.  And I note that Mr. Kouengoua did not receive a reply to many of the letters that he sent in.  I think that the section was understaffed, and we were not able to make sure that there was effective communication between Mr. Kouengoua and the section.  Nevertheless, I base myself on the requests for payments that were sent in for two investigators and assistants, Sungura and Aloys Nyilingondo.  These are just facts and comments which might enlighten the Chamber.  
What I could say is that up to this point in time, 215 witnesses have been contacted and 72 witnesses have been heard.  For Aloys Nyilingondo, the investigator, he has gone on three trips which were not necessarily authorized by the Defence Management Section, nevertheless, the missions were conducted.  And he was able to meet 11 witnesses from the 19th to the 22nd of January, 2001.  

As for Aimable Surgura, he conducted -- or he went on about 28 trips, not talking about visits.  And I would like to point out that all of these trips were not authorized.  However, he saw over 200 witnesses and interviewed a number of them himself.  

Now regarding the state of preparedness of the Defence team, without trying to pass any judgement and trying to avoid any prejudices, what I could say before this Chamber is that Counsel Kouengoua, since he was appointed, he has applied for 2619 hours.  For the entire Defence team up to 2000 -- May 2003, they have filed for 4900 hours.  And we have 7,500 hours of preparation that have been billed in our Defence section.  

That is the situation, Madam President.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would like to thank the representative of the Defence management.  And I would now like to give the floor to the Witness Victims and Support Section.
MS. CRAWFORD:
Good morning, Your Honour.  My name is Jacqueline Crawford.  I am the security and movement coordinator of WVSS-P, the section OIC, Mr. David Chappell is presently in Kigali on duty.  I wish to inform the Court of what is happening so far with the witness support section regarding the witnesses who are here.  

Already we have 11 witnesses from Kigali, which includes three children under the age of 18 months.  One of these witnesses has already committed himself to be here.  He has taken off from his busy schedule to be here in Arusha to give evidence.  If the hearing is delayed, these witnesses -- we can not guarantee these witnesses to return to Arusha again to give evidence.  Also, this matter will be printed in the press, and these witnesses are exposed to risk.  

Already we have arrangements made for five witnesses who have been -- who are under the 90bis order.  And they have already been scheduled to be here on Wednesday, the 30th of July.  Special arrangements were made for these witnesses to be here.  And it will be an embarrassment to the ICTR if these witnesses' schedule is cancelled.  Also, it will be an embarrassment to the ICTR staff in Kigali if these witnesses are returned to Kigali without giving evidence.  

Lastly, we must look at the logistics involved in bringing these witnesses to Arusha.  And they have to return to Rwanda without testifying.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I would now like to give the floor to a representative of the Office of the Prosecutor.  Thank you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I don't have much by way of a response, Your Honours.  Counsel for the Defence, in a meeting on the 23rd of May this year, in a meeting presided over by the President of this Tribunal, Judge Eric Møse, was asked when he would be ready for trial, suggested that he would be ready for commencement of trial on the 14th of July 2003.  At no point during the meeting, Your Honours, did Counsel raise the difficulties expressed in the current motion.  

In a subsequent meeting, Your Honours, presided over by Judge Møse, with Judges Egorov and Reddy in attendance, the only difficulty that Counsel expressed was that he would not be ready to commence the Defence case on the 6th of October, 2003.  Counsel told the meeting that he needed more time, not for the commencement of the Prosecution case, but the commencement of the Defence case.  At that point, Your Honours, Counsel was offered an extra investigator.  And at the conclusion of the meeting, it was agreed that the trial would commence on the 28th of July, as initially scheduled. 

It is understandable, Your Honours, that Counsel has difficulty with the English language, but the Office of the Prosecutor has endeavoured to communicate and/or disclose material in the working language of Counsel.  As of the 1st of July 2003, 22 witnesses' statements in unredacted form were filed with the registry for disclosure to the Accused and his Defence counsel.  

Contrary to what Counsel now alleges, Your Honours, subsequent to the 10th of July 2003, the Office of the Prosecutor had not disclosed any material.  There is one letter inviting Counsel to inspect the exhibits that the Prosecutor intends to rely on in trial, and that is the only letter written to Counsel subsequent to the status conference of 11th of July.  And in this letter we were only reminding Counsel of an earlier invitation to come and inspect Prosecutor's exhibits.  It is clear from the pretrial brief filed on the 16th of May 2003 that the said exhibits were available for inspection both on the 23rd of May 2003 and on the 10th of July 2003.  During the meetings presided over by Judge Møse, Counsel was reminded of the invitation to inspect. 

With regard, Your Honours, to the Prosecutor's 92bis motion for the admission onto the record of the testimony of Alison Des Forges in the Akayesu trial, contrary to what Counsel alleges, the testimony was disclosed to Counsel in both languages; that is, English and French.  And the transcript is only 900 pages.  And as you would have seen, Your Honours, it is 900 pages of double-spaced, 25-line a full sheet. 

Prosecutor wishes to note, Your Honours that Counsel was assigned and took instructions for this case in October 2001.  It is now almost two years since he accepted this brief.  We have learned from the Defence Counsel Management Section that 215 potential Defence witnesses have been contacted; 72 have been interviewed.  And that to date Counsel's billings stand at an aggregate of 15,000 hours.  We submit, Your Honours, that Counsel has had adequate time, has been given adequate facilities, and that he should, therefore, be ready to proceed with the trial. 

I wish to underscore, Your Honours, that the scheduling of this trial was done by consent of the parties.  Detailed logistics have been undertaken to ensure the presence in Arusha of witnesses.  As you have heard, there are currently 11 witnesses, 10 from Rwanda, one from the UK, who are ready to appear before Your Lordships to testify.  

Your Honours are also aware that the scheduling took into account the commitment of Your Lordships in other trials before this Tribunal.  That is why this case was allotted this window of four weeks, because the Judges had to attend to another trial in September.  If Counsel is granted the one-month adjournment he requests, we shall not be able to go to trial, because we shall not have a Chamber. 

Finally, Your Honours, the representative of the witness section has hinted at the grave risks we expose our witnesses to, should they have to return to Rwanda without testifying.  And she has also underscored difficulties that may be encountered in procuring attendance of these witnesses on another occasion if they do not testify on this occasion.  Should Your Lordships be inclined to grant this adjournment, the Prosecutor may well consider applying to have this case transferred to Rwanda for trial under the provisions of Rule 11bis(B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

We would, therefore, invite Your Honours to dismiss Counsel's motion and order that the trial proceed as scheduled.  Most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.
JUDGE REDDY:
My question to the learned Prosecutor, I didn't quite grasp the significance of the last statement you made, that if this application is granted you will consider making an application to transfer this case to the jurisdiction of the courts in Rwanda.  

Could you please tell me what is the point that you are making?

MR. KAREGYESA:
There are two points, Your Honour.  One, as you have heard from the Witness and Victim Support Section representative, there is no guarantee that we will be able to procure attendance of Prosecution witnesses from Rwanda if this matter is adjourned.  In the event that it is adjourned and we are unable to procure the attendance of witnesses, we shall have no option.  Most obliged, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to put a question to Counsel Kouengoua.  

	Counsel Kouengoua, have you received all of the statements for the witnesses?  There is no problem with that, you do not contest that you have received all Prosecution witnesses statements.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I have received the witness statements of 23 witnesses, Madam President.  And with your permission, I would like to add a few things with respect to what has just been said by my learned friend on the other side of the courtroom, with your permission, Madam President.  

Thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to proceed.  Well, with respect to the statements that were made by the Defence Management Section -- I'm sorry, I did not mention Laurent, because he knows that communication between him and our Defence team is excellent, perfect, there are no problems, but, Madam President, when I file an official document, there is a difference between an official friendship that I have with Laurent and the processing of the document, but that is not the point, Madam President.  

What I wanted to bring in before you today were the facts.  I am not asking for an interpretation of a point of law or the facts; I am speaking of the facts.  And when we speak of facts, I humbly believe that there are two solutions, either I am saying a falsehood or I am saying the truth.  And I will give you an example.  

On the 26th of June 2003, I wrote a letter to the Office of the Prosecutor.  And I will read to you the penultimate sentence:  "This recurring manner of disclosing --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Madam President, Counsel is reading too fast for the interpretation to proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETOR:
I'm sorry, Madam President, Counsel is proceeding too fast to allow me to proceed.  I'm sorry, Madam President, Counsel was reading too fast to allow the interpreters to read.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the interpreters cannot follow you if you proceed this quickly, and particularly when you read documents.  In any case, I would like you, Counsel, to be brief.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I was saying, Madam President, that the matter ceased by the Trial Chamber today is not unknown, and I have sent a correspondence on the 26th.  In this correspondence, I said that it was unfortunate that I was being able to respect the time deadlines and appear in court.  And I state in paragraph F of the letter of the 26th of June that we will have to notify the Trial Chamber to statutes on the matter.  

Madam President, when we filed our motion, we had not contacted the women in Witness and Victims Support Section, that is true, Madam President, we did not contact them.  It is true that there are logistical problems, we do not bring -- put this into consideration, but we just wish to present to you the facts and just the facts.  And I'm sorry to have to note that even though he did not write me -- or, no, he did not say that the Prosecutor said that, I never raised the problems that appear in this motion.  If I had not raised the problem, then why was I assigned an additional investigator, Madam President?  Why?

I did not just write to the Prosecutor with respect to this matter, I also wrote to the coordinator of the Trial Chamber on the 19th of May.  And when I wrote a letter on the 19th of May, I had not yet attended the informal meeting.  On the 12th of May, I also sent a letter to the chief of section and    Mr. Prosecutor.  

When we appear before the Trial Chamber, I have said I am speaking about the facts.  The Prosecutor began to investigate the matter in 1998; Gacumbitsi had not yet been arrested.  And as we speak about the amount of time available to each of the parties, I do not wish to mention the equality of arms, nevertheless, I think that it is important to observe the different times allotted to both parties.  And now it seems that the Prosecutor is ready to proceed, but this is not true.  We cannot proceed, even though the documents should have been disclosed to me spontaneously, he said that I should -- I was invited on the 16th of May to come and review them.  That is not possible, because the first meeting was not held until the 23rd of June.  The infamous invitation of the 16th of May was issued on the 24th of July, 2003.  The letter was given to me after I filed the motion to say that they had been invited previously.  And this is why I mention it in the motion, and this was to come and review the map of Rusumo and the video tape available in the Office of the Prosecutor.  

I'm sorry, but with all due respect, Madam President, this map, these videos are documents that I need to review with my client.  And I am saying that these two meetings, the two meetings were held between myself and the Office of the Prosecutor, the President of the Tribunal was there and other chiefs of section.  And he said that he sent it on the 16th of May, but I did not become aware of it until the 24th of July -- of May, rather.  And the Office of the Prosecutor has mentioned various matters that the Office of the Prosecutor was not able to review, because in view of the fact that I was not allowed to proceed on mission.  I think that Laurent can confirm this.  I financed the missions of my investigators for these short missions.  

	And that is why in January, it appears that one of the investigators was assigned -- was not able to go on mission, but actually did go because I paid for them, when in February and in March when I came. I came not so much to work but, rather, with my own money so that I could be ready.  And in February, I mention -- I can show you the letter, Madam President, if you would like to see it, I said that Mr. Gacumbitsi's trial did not impede the work of my investigators.  And when I wrote those letters, it was in 2002.  And now I am told that I had collected 2500 hours.  That is not true, Madam President.  In any case, I am asking once again the Trial Chamber to say that I have only stated the facts before you.  

I have receipts and supporting documents.  I have said, and Laurent responded, why didn't they respond to my correspondence, Madam President?  Is it lack of personnel?  But faxes, telephones, tools could have been used.  The additional means that I was requesting was assistants and investigators.  The Prosecutor said that, but I did not receive them.  

Why is it that in the middle of a meeting I am told that you are assigned additional investigators?   Why?  Because we were all aware of the fact that there was a problem, that things had not been done properly with respect to my Defence team, I deplore this.  

We can still proceed, but nevertheless the facts are there, the facts are there.  You have the power to review the facts that I have put before you.  I have only brought facts.  It is up to you to statute on the law.  I am here in good faith before you, Madam President, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber will deliberate on the motion and we will resume the deliberations in about half an hour.  Thank you.

(Pages 1 to 12 by Donna M. Lewis)

	(Court resumed at 1100H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We deliberated for little longer than we intended.  The Chamber was seized on the 22nd of July 2003 of a motion by the Defence to put off the trial date by one month in the Gacumbitsi case, which is supposed to start today, on the 28th of July 2003.  

The Chamber has heard the arguments of both parties and comments made by the Defence section and the Victim Support Section.  The Chamber having deliberated concludes as follows:  

First of all, the Defence states that it could not carry out all the field trips in Rwanda, which are necessary for the defence of the Accused person in this trial.  He therefore says that there was a serious delay in its preparation.  The Chamber notes that following the intervention or the statement from the responsible officer from the Defence section, the Defence recognised that some field trips had been conducted and a certain number of witnesses had already been contacted.  The Defence did not contradict the Defence system (sic), which talked about contacts with over 200 witnesses by the Defence.  The Chamber, therefore, concludes that the Defence carried out missions in preparation, and it will be possible to recall back Prosecution witnesses to interview or cross-examine them on specific issues if the Defence justify that before the Chamber.  

The delays in investigation by the Defence, does not justify the postponement of what the Prosecutor is saying.  When the time comes, the issue will be raised taking into account the time when the Defence case has to start.  

Further, the Defence states that it did not have the two assistants requested assigned.  The Chamber notes that an additional assistant was accepted by the President of the Tribunal during one of the meetings, and it considers that the Defence section validly explain the reasons why the second assistant has not been appointed up to this point, taking into account the possible conflict of interest of this assistant, which was raised by the Office of the Prosecutor since the assistant was a former worker with that office.  

The Chamber does not see in that enough reason to postpone the trial.  The Chamber asked that the Defence section should do all in its power to ensure that the assistant is appointed as soon as possible. 

Lastly, the Defence states that it did not receive the necessary translations in the language that the Accused person and the counsel used, which is French.  But after discussions it was clear that the Defence had received all the documents necessary for the preparation of the trial in the two working languages of the Tribunal, including the witness statements of Prosecution witnesses.  That is, therefore, dismissed.  

The Chamber further recalls that the Defence has, on two occasions, accepted to begin this trial on the 28th of July 2003, and that at no point in time did it talk -- say that the problems that have been raised could impede its preparation.  

Further, the Chamber underscores that a number of witnesses are here in Arusha, and any adjournment may undermine their security and their further appearance in the Court.  

For these reasons, the Chamber dismisses the motion.  

Now that that decision had been rendered, I would like to listen to both parties on the need of a status conference now.  As far as we, the Judges, are concerned, we think that we might perhaps start immediately with the Prosecutor's opening remarks.  But if you think that there are matters that should be dealt with before hand, we might as well organise this status conference.  

Prosecution?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Your Honours, when this matter was scheduled for commencement of trial, it was my understanding that prior to the Prosecutor's opening address, there would be a status conference -- a pretrial conference in terms of Rule 73bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which appeared to make it mandatory that a pretrial conference be held.  And I would read Rule 73bis (A).  I quote:  "The Trial Chamber shall hold a pretrial conference prior to the commencement of the trial".  

That notwithstanding, Your Honours, there are a couple of points -- housekeeping point that could appropriately be dealt with in the suggested pretrial conference.  

So I pray, Your Honours, that prior to my opening address, which I am ready to do this morning, we should first have a pretrial conference.  

Most obliged, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecution.  

Mr. Kouengoua? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I thank you.  

As far as the Defence for Gacumbitsi is concerned, we came here this morning to support our motion, and we did not think that after the decision you just rendered, things were going to continue. So all we did was prepare ourselves to support our motion and we, therefore, ask you very humbly to organise this pretrial conference at another time so that we can already prepare the arguments that we will have to raise on that occasion.  

I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, any comments?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the parties were notified in a letter addressed by the Court Management Section to Counsel Kouengoua that trial would proceed as scheduled in the event that the Defence motion was dismissed.  So counsel ought to be ready, Your Honours, to proceed with the pretrial conference. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you said that the pretrial conference is mandatory, and quite rightly, pointed to Rule 73bis (A), but the matters traverse in paragraph B of that Rule, are all matters that have been dealt with.  Have they not?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, these matters were dealt with in an informal status conference.  That's not on the record.  So just for the record, the Prosecutor wants to reiterate that it has complied with all its obligations arising out of paragraph B, for the record.  But there are also other matters of a housekeeping nature that could appropriately be dealt with in the pretrial conference.  

Most obliged, Your Honours. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
I would like to thank the Prosecutor.  

Very well, we are going to adjourn and we will hold a status conference to allow the parties to raise any issues that we need to deal with.  

The issues I have:  Are we going to start immediately thereafter, or do we need to put it off and start some time later, Prosecution? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, we are ready to start the pretrial conference right now, and I don't think it should take half an hour to address  -- for the parties to address any concern.  And immediately, thereafter, without an adjournment, the Prosecution would be ready to render its opening address and to call its first witness.  It's entirely to your discretion, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Defence, any comments?
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

For the Defence team, we think that the afternoon would be a better time for us.  If you want -- for the Tribunal to understand me, for the Chamber to understand me, I have a number of difficulties.  You see, Mr. Prosecutor, I need to have time to translate.  The invitation that was given to me a while ago, I could not understand it.  So as you would see, I need some time to be able to assess it. 
JUDGE REDDY: 
Can I just ask for some assistance from counsel, please.  This status conference, do we need to adjourn to hold the status conference?  My understanding is that we can hold it here and now; am I right?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Precisely, Your Honour, and that's what I have just said.  We are ready to go straight into the pretrial conference, and as I said, it shouldn't take us half an hour to dispose of the matters we intend to raise.  And immediately thereafter, we would be ready to proceed with the opening address and calling our first witness, but it's entirely at your discretion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So we are going to have the pretrial conference in half an hour.

(Court resumed at 1430H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor to present -- to make your opening statement.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Madam President, Your Honours.

Your Honours, on the evening of 6th of April 1994, the plane carrying President Juvénal Habyarimana crashed on its approach into Kanombe airport, killing all those on board.

In the hours, days and weeks that followed, the Central African Republic of Rwanda was convulsed by a kind of blood-letting on a scale unseen in the last century.  Massacres of civilians, mainly Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus, which started in Kigali within hours of the plane crash quickly spread throughout the country, and the next hundred days close to a million people lay dead.

In his book, "The Destruction of  European Jews," Raul Hilberg describes four stages in the process which led to their destruction.  The first: Classification as a Jew; second: expropriation of property;  the third: restrictions to Ghettos and camps, and the fourth: eventual extermination.  A process, he says, that took nine years.  Commenting on the speed and efficiency of the Rwandan genocide, Allan Dystaxia, former executive director ^Medicine Son Frontier, notes that by comparison the Hutu leaders in Rwanda went from stage one to stage four in a matter of few days.

It's the case for the Prosecution,Your Honours, that the massacres that characterised the blood-letting in Rwanda were orchestrated by extremists within the military and the interim government that usurped power following the death of Juvénal Habyarimana.  They depended, to a large extent, on the efficient, if not ruthless execution -- on the active participation of the territorial administrators, extremist militia, and the local Hutu population who had been mobilised and instigated by local government and extremist party leaders.  In what has been aptly described and now widely accepted by legal scholars, sociologists and historians alike, as the Rwandan genocide, the ethnic Tutsi segment of the Rwandan society was targeted for annihilation on the pretext that the Tutsi were accomplices of the RPF, then at war with the Rwandan government, and that "they" were responsible for the death of President Habyarimana.

Rusumo commune, which is remotely tucked away in the extreme southeastern corner of Rwanda where the Akagere River cascades over the Rusumo falls into Tanzania on its way to Lake Victoria, was not spared of this genocidal frenzy.  In the days following the death of
President Habyarimana, Tutsi women, men and children were attacked in their homesteads, in Rusumo and in the neighbouring communes of Rukira, Birenga, Sache and Mugesera, and relentlessly pursued over the hills with the demonic relish to the most sacred of havens, the churches.  Churches that had always sheltered thousands of Tutsis during a series of anti-Tutsi pogroms between 1959 and 1973, were transformed overnight into the very death-chambers in which countless Tutsi civilians met their macabre deaths.

So shocking were the outrageous committed on human dignity broadcast across the globe by satellite T.V., and so shaken was the conscious of humanity, that the international community quickly responded by establishing this Tribunal to bring to justice those responsible for these gross violations of international humanitarian law.  It is in this context,Your Honours, that we now appear before you to bring to trial the Accused Sylvestre Gacumbitsi for crimes alleged in the indictment.

Permit me to note, Your Honours, that the genocide which left up to a million dead in a short span of a hundred days, also witnessed the mass displacement of up to four million people either internally or to neighbouring countries.  Entire communities, therefore, had either been wiped out, displaced or both.  In numbers, this represents over half of the pre-April l994 national populations of about eight million inhabitants.  Police and judicial authorities had either been killed or were in flight, and the net result of this mayhem were conditions that did not lend themselves to the meticulous forensic inquiry often found in domestic jurisdictions during times of peace.

The Prosecution is confident, however, that from the ushers of this conflict it has been able to assemble and shall present to you credible evidence in order to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 

Who is Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?  To the inhabitants of Rusumo, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi needs little introduction.  A teacher by profession, Gacumbitsi was appointed bourgmestre of Rusumo commune by presidential decree dated the 2nd of August 1983.  By the time of the events alleged in the indictment, Gacumbitsi had been bourgmestre for 11 years.

It is worth noting, Your Honours, that during the first nine years as bourgmestre, he also doubled as head of the local MRND party.  As chief executive of the commune, a corporation sole, Gacumbitsi exercised de jure and defacto authority over the communal employees and wielded substantial power and influence over the local population in his community.

Gacumbisti, Your Honours, wasn't an ordinary criminal, not at all.  He was a family man, and is said to have lived in relative harmony with his neighbours and was even known to share drinks and exchange cows with some of his Tutsi subjects.  His only distinguishing feature, Your Honours, was the rapid zealotry with which he pursued his Tutsi victims in the execution of the genocidal plan subsequent to the 6th of April 1994.

Today, Your Honours, Gacumbisti stands charged with 5 counts:  The count of genocide, or complicity in genocide in the alternative.

He is also charged Your Honours with extermination, murder and rape, as crimes against humanity, all arising from culpable acts we allege he committed in concert with others as part of the common scheme whose singular objective was the total destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group.

I will not engage, Your Honours, in any discussion of the various elements of the crimes charged, and would add they are sufficiently addressed in the Prosecutor's pretrial brief.  Suffice to add, however, that in order to prove its case, the Prosecution will be relying on the evidence of several witnesses who fall into three broad categories.

Your Honours will hear the evidence of victims and survivors; innocent men and women who lost entire families, who were gang-raped or witnessed their loved ones being raped at the hands and instigation of Sylsvestre Gacumbitsi and his cohorts.  Men and women who lost everything it meant to be human.  Men and women traumatised for life whose erstwhile crime was to be born Tutsi.

You will also hear, Your Honours, the evidence of co-perpetrators, ordinary men who committed some of the crimes with which Gacumbitsi is charged., crimes which they have since been convicted of and sentenced in Rwanda.  

And, finally, Your Honours, you will hear the expert testimony of Alison Des Forges, whose duty it is to place the crimes charged in their proper context, the context of contemporary Rwandan history to show that the genocide and other crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda in 1994 were not a series of independent and spontaneous crimes committed by an angry Hutu population to avenge the death of President Habyarimana, but a meticulously planned and efficiently executed criminal campaign for the destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group.  

We allege, Your Honours, and shall prove by direct and circumstantial evidence, that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was no stranger to this diabolic plot and that in his commune he executed it with great efficiency in person and by proxy.

The evidence to be adduced over the coming weeks will show that within the days of the plane crash, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi embarked on a criminal course that initially involved mobilization of local authorities and political party extremists within Rusumo commune; liaising with the military establishment in Kibungo préfecture; the collection and distribution of weapons for use in the extermination campaign; the instigation of others to rape and kill Tutsi civilians, and finally, Your Honours, his own active participation in the numerous killings that rocked Rusumo in April l994. 
Your Honours, the evidence will show a leader in full control of events, rather than a reluctant or unwilling participant subdued by forces beyond his control.

You will hear, Your Honours, that on the 7th of April l994, shortly after receiving news of the death of President Habyarimana, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi visited the military camps at Rwanteru and Rusumo falls where he held extensive discussions with the military commanders and later met the notorious Lieutenant Colonel Rwagafirita.

You will hear, Your Honours that on the 8th of April l994, Gacumbisti attended a meeting in Kibungo presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Rwagafirita, at which the local leader of the Interahamwe militia, one Cyasa was authorised to commence the extermination of Tutsis throughout Kibungo Préfecture .

You will also hear, Your Honours, that on the 9th of April l994 Sylvester Gacumbisti as 'bourgmestre of Rusumo commune, presided over a meeting of conseilliers de secteur and responsables and political party leaders at the Rusumo Bureau communal where the plot to exterminate the Tutsi was elaborated.

Evidence will be led, Your Honours, that on the 10th of April 1994, Gacumbitsi, with communal policemen, aboard three communal pick-up trucks, went to the army camp in Kubungo and took delivery of over a 100 cartons of assorted weapons, including grenades, and machetes from Lieutenant Colonel Rwagafirita.  The said weapons were later distributed that same day throughout the secteurs in Rusumo commune.

You will hear, Your Honours, that on the 11th of April 1994, Gacumbisti held a meeting with the local Interahamwe militia leader Cyasa at the Rusumo bureau communal for two hours after which Gacumbitsi proceeded to the Rusumo Falls military detachment to confer with the military officers.

The evidence will further show,Your Honours, that on the 12th of April 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbisti visited the various secteurs in his commune, from Nyarubuye and Kankobwa in the northeast to Nyabitare and Gisenyi in the east and Kigarama in the south, during which he conferred with conseillers de secteurs. Later that day, Your Honours, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi attended a meeting with the military commander of the Rwanteru military camp.  It is alleged, Your Honours, that on the same day Sylvestre Gacumbitsi went to Gisenyi and instructed local Hutu boat owners and soldiers not to ferry any fleeing Tutsi across the lake to Tanzania.

The evidence will show, Your Honours, that Gacumbitsi attended the weekly market at Nyakarambi on Wednesday, 13th April, where he expected the Interahamwe militia of Kibungo to launch the massacres of Tutsis and asked the extremists party -- political party leaders to be on the alert.

Evidence will be led, Your Honours, that Gacumbitsi was seen travelling around the commune on the 14th of April 1994 instigating and superintending the murder and rape of Tutsi civilians, and that he personally shot and killed two Tutsi civilians near Nyabitare Catholic Centre, only after his victims had paid him for the bullets with which they were killed.

You will hear, Your Honours, that Gacumbitsi, in the company of communal policemen, Interahamwe militia armed with guns, grenades, cudgels, machetes, spears and swords, ordered and participated in the wholesale slaughter of Tutsi civilians who had sought refuge at Nyarubuye parish in an attack that lasted several hours; from 3:00 p.m. on Friday, 15th April 1994.

You will also hear, Your Honours, how Gacumbisti returned to Nyarubuye Parish between the 16th and 17th of April 1994 to supervise the killing of any survivors, women and children inclusive  so there that would be no one to live to tell the story.

Your Honours will hear eye-witness accounts that in the days that followed the massacre at Nyarubuye parish, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi travelled around the commune aboard a vehicle and using a megaphone to instigate the rape and murder of any Tutsi survivors.

Evidence will be led, Your Honours, of how he slit the belly of an ailing and pregnant woman and repeatedly stabbed  her and the two foetuses to death, in addition to stabbing to death the victim's mother in-law.

It doesn't injure the Prosecution case, Your Honours, to concede that Rwanda was at war with itself, but we submit that the massacres, rapes and murders alleged in the indictment were clearly not part of any war against the RPF.  Neither were they a result of an archaic Hutu psychosis following the death of President Habyarimana.

The killing, maiming and rape of noncombatant women and children is not war, Your Honours, nor does war provide any justification for the wholesale slaughter of innocent civilians.  In common parlance, Your Honours, this wasn't collateral damage.  The evidence will irresistibly point to a premeditated, calculated and efficiently coordinated effort by Gacumbitsi, in concert with others, to exterminate the Tutsi civilian  population in Rusumo commune.

Gacumbitsi is now before Your Honours today to answer for these crimes, and the Prosecution is ready to present its evidence.

I am most obliged, Your Honours.

(Pages 17 to 23 by Regina Limula)
































	1500H 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Mr. Keane, how long have you been a journalist?
A.	I have been a journalist since 1979.
Q.	And what does your occupation -- or what has your occupation involved over the last two decades?
A.	I have a spent a good deal over the last two decades covering situations of ethnic conflict, war zones, beginning in my own country, in Ireland, reporting on the troubles there and covering many conflicts in Africa and in Asia. And it has involved, as I say, extensive experience of not only war, but the human rights abuses which, in our time, have gone hand-in-hand with war.
Q.	And I believe you were a journalist during the months of April through July 1994, am I correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Where were you stationed in April 1994, Mr. Keane?
A.	I was based in South Africa -- Johannesburg, South Africa.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, please.  The interpreters are having some problems, Witness, because you are not marking a pause before you answer the question.  Once you have heard the question, if you can mark a pause for them -- the interpretation of the questions to take place and then for you to interpret (sic) then there would be no overlapping of question and answer.
THE WITNESS:
	Certainly, Madam President. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Mr. Keane, my last question was where you were during the month of April 1994.  If you could pause before you answer.
A.	I was based in Johannesburg, South Africa, as the southern Africa correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation.
Q.	Now, in 1994, did you ever have occasion to travel to Rwanda?
A.	I had occasion to travel to Rwanda.  Following the presidential election in South Africa, which I was reporting on for the BBC, I received a telephone call from my office in London, asking me to go to Rwanda to cover the events which were unfolding there.  This would have been, by my calculations, in about the third week of May 1994.
Q.	Now, did you fly into Rwanda or did you drive, Mr. Keane?
A.	At the time it was -- at that time, it was not possible for me to fly into Rwanda.  We drove into the country.  We first flew to Nairobi and from there to Kampala and then we drove by road to the Uganda border, passing through Kabale and we crossed the Ugandan border into Rwanda, on or about the 28th of May.
Q.	For the record, can you please tell us who you were with?
A.	I was accompanied on this journey by Mr. David Harrison, BBC producer, by Mr. Hamilton Wendy, a BBC technician, by Mr. Glen Middleton, a BBC cameraman.  We had two drivers whom we hired in Kampala, Uganda to make the journey.
Q.	And I believe -- since you had two drivers did you travel in two vehicles?
A.	That is correct.  It's a matter of security in war zones to, if possible, use two vehicles because if one vehicle should break down you then have a back-up.
Q.	Now, on arrival at the border between Uganda and Rwanda, were you met by any local hosts on the Rwandan side?
A.	In common with all of the other journalists seeking to enter Rwanda from Uganda at that time, we had contacted the RPF in advance so that we might secure safe passage through the border area.  When we arrived at the border, we contacted the officials at the post.  We informed them that we were from the BBC, that we had been in touch with their office in Brussels.  We waited for, I think it would have been approximately one hour, and were escorted to RPF offices at Mulindi, a short distance away.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Keane.  Can you just give us a brief description of what the atmosphere was like in Rwanda on arrival there, that is, between the border and the Mulindi post you've just mentioned?
A.	My recollection of that time is of being astonished at the difference between Uganda and Rwanda.  It was not so much a case of passing from one country to another, but from passing from one universe to another, because Uganda was, to my eyes at that time, a typical central Africa country.  It was bustling, there was much traffic on the roads, there were people working in the fields.  Entering Rwanda, first an overpowering image was of emptiness, the country emptied of people.  The only people we saw, in fact, were the soldiers of the RPF and I think I got a vague glimpse of some women standing on the hillside, but that was it.  The overpowering impression was of emptiness, a country that had -- if I can -- if I may use the comparison, it was as if someone had placed a giant hoover over the country and sucked all of the life out of it.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, you have put this at on or about the 28th of May 1994; am I correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, by the time you arrived in Rwanda on or about that date, did you have a clear itinerary of what you'd cover during your assignment to Rwanda?
A.	Normally, when making current affairs documentaries one likes to, for simple logistical reasons, have a very clear idea of what your itinerary is going to be.  And you're factoring in many things: how long you need to hire drivers and interpreters.  So we do generally try and stick to an itinerary; however, this was somewhat different because of the chaotic conditions which held in the country.  Because of our general uncertainty about what, if anything, we were going to find.  Those journalists coming out of Rwanda warned us that the conditions were the most difficult and dangerous that they had ever encountered.  And so this was playing on my mind when we entered the country. We had encounters with all of the other journalists by this stage in late May, and made aware of the reports of widespread massacres.  

It was mine and that of my colleagues' desire to visit the scenes of some massacres.  But I also made it clear to my colleague that I wanted to travel to the part of the country which was still in the hands of the government forces to be able to speak to people on that side about what was happening.  

Our first goal was to come safely across the border, stay somewhere safely for the night, which we did at Byumba.  We sought an RPF escort to take us down through the country because of the danger of potential ambush.  And I should add that on one occasion we almost became victims of an ambush in spite of having an escort.  So security was a primary consideration in asking for an escort.  

We met, close to Byumba, a group of Australian journalists who were leaving the country and it was they who told us about a massacre at a place called Nyarubuye, which they described to being close to the border of Tanzania.  We asked our guide and escort if they will take us to the site and they agreed.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did your RPF guide in any way dictate where you were supposed to go and what you were supposed to see?
A.	No, they did not.  I have worked, as you might have imagined, over 20 years in journalism in many, many situations where armies and guerilla forces have attempted to lay down strict guidelines about what I do.  This was not like that.  My overriding impression at the time was that the RPF was preoccupied with fighting the war and may have regarded, certainly from the initial conversations that we had with them at Byumba, having to assign two of their soldiers to protect us as somewhat of an encumbrance.  And the issue at hand with which we are dealing today, that is the question of Nyarubuye, I want to emphasise again that it was at the suggestion of two Australian journalists we decided to make that journey.  

I should also say that the massacre at Nyarubuye had been mentioned by other journalists in Nairobi on our journey through.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You have told Their Lordships that you spent a night in Byumba -- or your first night in Byumba.  Can you tell Their Lordships what your next stop was on the day after that?
A.	To the best of my recollection, Your Honours, we travelled from Byumba to the commune offices at Rusumo and decided to make our base there for the next 24 to 48 hours.  By the time we reached those offices, it was afternoon.  There were security concerns and we decided to camp down there rather than in one of the nearby towns.
Q.	Now, other than camping at Rusumo commune that night, did you visit any places of interest?
A.	Your Honours, we travelled from Rusumo compound -- Rusumo commune that afternoon in the direction of Nyarubuye, the parish church of Nyarubuye.  This involved travelling on a tarmac road for perhaps 15 to 20 minutes, as I recall, and then turning left off that road into the bush.  We then followed a very overgrown and rough bush track.  From what I estimate, it was about 35 to 40 minutes.  

The overpowering impression, again, on this track, was of emptiness, that and the fact that the bush seemed so overgrown.  There were no people in the banana plantations, no people working in the fields.  We passed empty cabins, houses where people had fled from.  There was no sign of life whatsoever.  

We travelled further along this path and then we became aware of a building in the distance.  I could see a red shape in the distance coming through the trees.  There were large trees to the left-hand side of the road, almost forming, if you like, an arch one passed along and it was along this final route that we came to the parish church at Nyarubuye.
Q.	Did can you tell Their Lordships during what time of the day you arrived at Nyarubuye parish?
A.	Your Honours, my estimate is that it would have been late afternoon when we arrived there because the sun was already setting; it was dusk.  And I do remember that we were all concerned for reasons of security that we would be able to visit the parish church compound and try to return safely before darkness.
Q.	Witness, can you tell Their Lordships what you saw, your first impression at arrival -- on arrival at Nyarubuye parish?
A.	My first impression was not of sight, but of smell, that when one opened the door of the car, the smell of decomposing corpses was very strong in the air.  So it was not a sight that was the first impression, but a smell.
Q.	And other than what you perceived by smell, Witness, can you give Their Lordships, in some graphic detail, what you saw or perceived with your eyes when you entered the parish complex?
A.	I got out of the car and walked across the forecourt of the church complex.  To my right I think I remember being aware of the body of a man on the -- although it was hard to say whether it was a man or a woman, it was so advanced in decomposition.  It was a human -- there were human remains on the steps of the church.  As we walked across there were more remains, perhaps three or four people and I passed around these and crossed through some open gates and followed along a pathway.  And as we entered through these gates, the smell of decomposition, of decomposing flesh became worse.  I have -- I had, prior to that period, seen dead bodies.  I was based in South Africa after all, and had covered conflicts in Angola, Eritrea, Ireland.  I had seen dead bodies and I had smelt decomposition, but the smell was unlike anything that I have ever experienced before or since.
Q.	Witness, how long did you spend at the Nyarubuye parish on that occasion?
A.	Your Honours, I estimate that it was an hour and a half to two hours, but I stress "estimate" because one of the things that happened when I was confronted with the scene was, if you like, a sense of timelessness.  I know that isn't a very exact definition, but that is what it felt like.
Q.	Can you tell Their Lordships how big the perimeter of Nyarubuye parish is?
A.	I can only describe it in terms of what it would take to walk.  And to walk from one end of the church compound to the other, under normal circumstances, would take a -- estimate, about 10 minutes.  

On that occasion, however, our progress was much slower because of the sights that we were encountering as we walked across the compound and these were bodies on either side of the pathway, most in an advanced stage of decomposition.  Bodies further into the centre of the compound near where what I understood to be the church offices were, these bodies were piled high outside one of the doors.  The impression I had of those bodies, where the people had been crowded together at the moment of death, was that they were melting into one another.
Q.	Now, Witness, during your stay at the parish for approximately one and a half hours, did you have occasion not only to walk around the open areas, but also to see what was in the building, in the various buildings in the parish?
A.	We entered into the church itself and by this time it had become dark and we had a single light on the camera which was able to pick out small areas of the church.  And through the light of the camera, we saw bodies lying in different parts of the church.  There were not as many bodies in the church complex itself.  Some of those bodies that we saw were schoolchildren because they were still wearing schoolchildren's uniform.  

We came out of the church and we also filmed a large room in which bodies lay and we filmed several classrooms in which there were bodies.  In one classroom there was the body of what I took to be a mother and her children.
Q.	Witness, please let me know if you need a moment to recompose.
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it --
THE WITNESS:
I can continue.  

There were other rooms in the church compound which we did not visit because it was getting dark and we were afraid, for reasons of security, to stay for very much longer, and I did not want to see any more bodies.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Now, during your tour of Nyarubuye parish did you meet anyone there?
A.	During our tour of the church compound, Your Honours, we did not meet anyone; there wasn't a living soul.
Q.	And were you throughout the stay there in the company of your RPF escort?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And were you with your colleagues with whom you travelled to Rwanda?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And would it be true, Witness, that during your stay at the parish you captured video footage of the scene?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, were you able, in the course of your filming, to capture each and every part of the parish you've just referred to?
A.	No, we were not for reasons of security and the time -- sorry, for reasons of security, our time was limited.  But I think also for the reasons that I have just stated, that I felt -- I felt personally that I could not look at any more of this.
Q.	Are you in a position, Mr. Keane, to tell Their Lordships an approximate number of the corpses you saw on that occasion?
A.	I could not do it with any accuracy, Your Honours, simply because of the state of decomposition, and as I used the phrase earlier, many of the bodies seemed to be -- in parts of the church, seemed to be melting into another.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Keane.  And at the end of your visit did you return to your base at Rusumo commune?
A.	Yes, we did.
Q.	Now, how many days did you spend in Rusumo on that occasion, Mr. Keane?
A.	According to my memory, we arrived at Rusumo in the afternoon, and by the afternoon of the following day we decided to leave and go to Tanzania.  And that would have been approximately a 24-hour period.
Q.	Now, prior to your departure for Tanzania, Mr. Keane, did you visit any other establishments within Rusumo?
A.	My memory is of coming back to Nyarubuye in the darkness and travelling along the main road to Rusumo.  The only encounter we had was with a group of Tutsi people who told us that they had been hiding in the bush and eating grass.  They were making their way to the commune for safety.  That was the only encounter that I can recall.
Q.	Did you meet any people at Rusumo commune where you had camped, either on that evening after the visit to the parish, or the next day prior to your departure for Tanzania?
A.	Yes, we did.  On the evening that we returned to the commune we noticed that were some wounded people, including some children, in a clinic at the commune.  They were looking for medicines, but we had no medicines to give them.  We gave them some panadol, some mild painkillers.  The following morning, the commune became quite busy and we met a number of people who said they had been survivors of the massacres in the area.  Some of these people had serious wounds and we spoke to them about what had happened.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What kind of wounds did these people have?  Can you tell their Lordships, please.
A.	Your Honours, the wounds they had were knife wounds or machete wounds.  I had seen machete wounds prior to this as a correspondent in South Africa covering the potential violence there.
Q.	And did you capture any video footage of the wounded people you are referring to, Mr. Keane?
A.	Yes, we did, Your Honours.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you've told Their Lordships that you proceeded to Tanzania within 24 hours of your arrival in Rusumo.  Where did you go to in Tanzania?
A.	Your Honours, we went to Benaco camp in Tanzania.
Q.	And what kind of an establishment is or was Benaco camp at the time?
A.	Benaco camp was a very large area catering to the needs of many tens of thousands of refugees who had left Rwanda in the preceding weeks.
Q.	And how long did you spend at Benaco camp?
A.	We, again according to my recollection, spent approximately 24 hours in Benaco camp.
Q.	Now, I'd like you to tell Their Lordships, was the visit to Benaco camp in Tanzania part of your original itinerary?
A.	No, it was not.
Q.	Now, having arrived at Banako camp, what did you do there?
A.	On arrival at Banako camp, we sought first somewhere to sleep from the United Nations people who were caring for the refugees.  The second thing we did was to ask after the whereabouts of 
Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  We were doing this because several of the people at Rusumo commune had told us that the man who led the massacre against them had fled to Tanzania.
Q.	Did you establish contact with Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	Yes, we did, Your Honours.
Q.	Now, Witness, this is nine years ago, I believe.  Would you be able to recognise Sylvestre Gacumbitsi if you met him?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Are you in a position to tell Their Lordships whether he is in this Chamber?
A.	Yes, Your Honours, I am.
Q.	Can you please tell Their Lordships where he is in this Chamber?
A.	Your Honours, he is sitting directly behind the counsel for the Defence.
Q.	I'm sure there are -- there is more than one person behind counsel for the Defence.  Could you please indicate clearly?
A.	Yes.  He is the man wearing a blue tie.  His face is somewhat obstructed from me now.
Q.	You can stand up.
A.	Thank you.  He is the man sitting next to the police officer, wearing the blue suit and the blue shirt.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, for how long did you interact with Sylvestre Gacumbitsi in Banako camp on that occasion?
A.	According to my memory, it would have been a period of around half an hour.
Q.	And did you capture video footage of your interaction with Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	Yes, Your Honours.
Q.	Now, you've told this Chamber that you spent approximately 24 hours in Tanzania.  Did you return to Rwanda?
A.	Yes, we did.
Q.	And as part of your itinerary, did you visit Kigali?
A.	The first thing that we did on return to Rwanda was to travel back to Rusumo and to show the survivors of the massacre the image of the man we had recorded in Banako camp.  This was because I was very determined, and in view of the gravity of the charges that they were making against him, that we had recorded the correct person.  After we had done this and several of the survivors had pointed him as the man who led the massacres, we went to Kigali and we entered the compound of UNAMIR.
Q.	And subsequent to your trip to Kigali, did you visit any areas under the control of the then Rwandan government?
A.	Yes, Your Honours, we did.
Q.	And did you eventually return to England, Mr. Keane?
A.	After spending some time in the town of Butare, which was at that point under the control of the interim government and of the Interahamwe, we left and travelled back into Burundi and returned to England.
Q.	And did you subsequently publish or broadcast the images you had taken on television?
A.	Yes, Your Honours, we did, in the form of a documentary for the BBC Panorama programme.
Q.	And what was the name of the documentary, Mr. Keane?
A.	The documentary was titled, "Journey into Darkness".
Q.	And do you recall when this documentary was first broadcast on the airwaves, Mr. Keane?
A.	My recollection is that the documentary was broadcast on or about the 27th of June.
Q.	And this would have been 1994, Mr. Keane?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And this would have been approximately three weeks after your visit to Rwanda?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did you also publish any other work relating to your mission to Rwanda, Mr. Keane?
A.	Yes, Your Honours.  I published a book entitled, "Season of Blood, a Rwandan Journey".
Q.	Mr. Keane, did you, subsequent to a request from the Prosecutor, avail her copies of the video shots you'd taken on your mission to Rwanda and Tanzania in late May and early June 1994?
A.	Your Honours, the BBC was approached by the Prosecution in this case and asked to supply video footage, and the British Broadcasting Corporation agreed to that request.
Q.	And subsequent to your arrival in Arusha, Mr. Keane, were you shown images from the video you'd taken?
A.	Yes, Your Honours.  On the day that I arrived in Arusha I was shown long portions of video footage, some of which I had not seen for nine years.
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours.  At this stage, the Prosecutor wishes to display on the screens, extracts from the videos taken by Mr. Keane on his journey to Rwanda in late May and early June 1994, and ask the witness to identify these extracts, subsequent to which, Your Honours, we should be moving this Chamber to admit them into evidence.  

May I ask the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think you are moving a bit too fast, Mr. Prosecutor.  We authorise these extracts to be played but you have also spoken of photographs.  You said there were videos and photographs, I believe.  I'm not sure if I followed.
(Pages 24 to 32 by Gifty C. Harding)

























	1545H
MR. KAREGYESA:
No, Your Honours.  It is video footage, and what we propose to do is to play the video footage on the screen, ask the witness to comment and identify the images as images he took while on his mission.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Let's play the video footage.  I'm sorry, I thought -- I initially understood that there were photographs as well. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Could I ask the audio-video booth to play file No. 1.
(Video footage shown)
  BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Mr. Keane, do you have a video image on your screen?
A.	That is correct, I do.
Q.	Can you just briefly tell this Chamber what that image represents?
A.	The image which you are now seeing is of the lead vehicle in our convoy travelling along the track towards Nyarubuye.  It is being filmed from the second vehicle.  There were two; one was an Isuzu, the other was a Mercedes.  They were driven by Ugandan drivers.  These were robust vehicles because of the nature of the track.  It was very rough and had become considerably overgrown.  The principal impression one had driving along here in these vehicles was the absence of human life; that, and the concern one felt that with such close vegetation, ambush was a possibility, because we knew we were close to the Tanzanian border across which many of the Interahamwe had fled.

This is an image taken of the second vehicle as it climbs an incline leading towards the parish church of Nyarubuye. 
Q.	And you confirm, Witness, that the images that have just been shown to the Chamber were taken during the mission you have just told Their Lordships about?
A.	I confirm that those images were recorded during that mission by Mr. Glen Middleton, BBC cameraman, in my presence. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the images that have just been shown were extracted from a larger video labelled KV00-0356 at video marker 0139 to 0245, and will be found on this CD that I will be putting into evidence after we are through with all the clippings.  And I will also be putting in evidence the log of video footage that will be identified by this witness during the course of this hearing.

Would the audio-visual booth please play file No. 2.
(Video footage shown)

THE WITNESS:
This is the last portion of the drive towards the parish church compound at Nyarubuye.  Again, the impression of one driving to it at that time was of the absence of life.  Here I came out of the car escorted by the guide towards the church complex.  We crossed the front of the church.  Other elements of human remains, and then several bodies scattered.

As a veteran of reporting a number of wars, the thing which struck me also quite strongly was the absence of khaki or green camouflage uniforms among the dead.  They were all, to me, unmistakenly civilian.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Is this still within the church compound, Mr. Keane?
A.	Your Honours, it is.  It is, as I recollect, along the pathway which led to some church offices. 
Q.	And what are these buildings in the foreground, Witness?
A.	My understanding at the time, Your Honours, was that they were some kind of church offices. 
Q.	And are those the corpses you referred to in your testimony, Witness?
A.	They are the corpses.  They are the dead. 
Q.	Can you tell us which building this is in the complex?
A.	These were more of the church offices.  Behind these bodies -- it is difficult to see it on the screen, but there were more bodies piled up next to the wall.  There was -- it was very difficult to count.  To be honest with you, I didn't try to count.

It was clear to us as well that the effect of the rains and the humid environment seemed to have speeded up the process of decomposition, though I am not -- I should add I am not a forensic pathologist.  It was just an impression one gained.

At this point we are moving back down the path that we had previously advanced along and towards the direction of the church itself.

People seemed to have died in small groups, slightly larger groups, and then a very large group that we saw near the church offices.  But I want to stress again that we did not see everything.

This was one of the bodies near the main church complex itself.  And this was a side door to the church, and it was in fact this door that I entered the church through.  This was the very front of the church.  There had recently been the Easter celebrations at the church and there was a banner hanging underneath.

And the offices just to the left there were another set of offices that we did not go into, but we did hear noises coming from those offices later, which one of our drivers believed to be either dogs or rats.  But by that stage it was dark and we did not want to investigate.
Q.	Mr. Keane, the video clip that has just been shown to you, do you confirm it is part of the video footage you took while you were in Nyarubuye?
A.	I do, Your Honours. 
Q.	And was that you walking along with the soldier in the parish complex?
A.	Yes, Your Honours, it was. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, for the record, file 2 which has just been shown to you is on CD reference KV00-0356, which is the same CD from which file No. 1 was extracted.  And as I intimated earlier, Your Honours, I will be moving this Chamber to admit into evidence all these CDs once we are through with the identification process.

Could audio-visual please play file No. 3, which is also extracts from the said CD, KV00-0356.
(Video footage shown)
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Mr. Keane, would you please tell the Chamber what the image on the screen depicts.
A.	Your Honours, I referred some moments ago to a room in one of the church compounds that our cameraman did stand at the door of and take some images, and this is that particular room.  It is, I guess, about 100 yards from the main church complex -- from the church itself.

These again are images of dead civilians.

This was a body which lay outside the room on the steps.  It seemed to -- to me, standing next to it, to have been the body of a child.

This is the doorway to the room in question.

Your Honours, I mentioned some moments ago a classroom or a series of classrooms.  These were images recorded in that classroom. 
Q.	In this classroom, were you able to establish the ages of the victims or the corpses you saw in that classroom?
A.	Looking in with the help of the camera light, I believed that what I saw in the corner there was a woman and some children.

Your Honours, these are images taken inside the church itself.  This is the uniform commonly worn by schoolchildren in Rwanda.
In parts of the church itself there were bones lying scattered around, as well as corpses.  This may have been as the result of animals, but I -- I cannot be certain of that.

This was close, as I -- quite close to the altar.
Q.	And what would that be that is seen in the foreground on the altar, Mr. Keane?
A.	The image that we have just seen is of what I took to be a schoolboy.

These, Your Honours, are the bones -- some of the bones to which I referred a few moments ago.
Q.	And these would have been skeletal remains, I believe?
A.	That is correct.
MR KAREGYSA:
Your Honours, for the record, that was file No. 3 from the same CD No. KV00-0356.

Would the audio-visual please play file No. 4.
(Video footage shown)
THE WITNESS:
These are the commune offices at Rusumo.

This was a shot taken by our cameraman walking along the short corridor coming into a room full of boxes of identity cards which were the various parishes, including the parish of Nyarubuye.  This was me at the time, describing how we had discovered the box with the names of the people from Nyarubuye.  These, Your Honours, are the passes, the identity cards, carried by every citizen of Rwanda in which they were ethnically labelled as Hutu, Tutsi or Twa.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR KAREGYESA:
That, Your Honour, file No. 4, is extracted from CD No. KV00-0364 and KV00-0355A.

Would the audio-visual please play file No. 6.
(Video footage shown)
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Mr. Keane, can you tell us what is depicted on the screens?
A.	This, Your Honours, is the image of one of the wounded whom we encountered at the offices at the Rusumo compound -- commune.
Q.	Did you establish how this young child got that wound --
A.	Yes.
Q.	-- on the right side of his head?
A.	Your Honours, we were told that he had been struck on the head with a machete.
MR KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours, that was file No. 6, an extract from CD No. KV00-0359.

And would audio-visual please play file No. 7.
(Video footage shown)
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Mr. Keane, would you please tell us what is depicted on the screens?
A.	Your Honours, this is an image of me encountering Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi at Benaco camp, introducing myself as a representative of the BBC and telling him, as I remember, that I wished to speak to him about the troubles in Rwanda.

During the course of that encounter -- which, as I recollect, took place over a period of 30 minutes, maybe somewhat slightly more -- I questioned him about his recollection of events in Nyarubuye, and I put to him the accusations made by survivors from Nyarubuye that he had led the massacre.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Keane.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, that was file No. 7, an excerpt from CD labelled KV00-0361.

At this stage, Your Honours, I am moving this Chamber for a brief three-minute closed session to show the witness a very short video excerpt which may divulge matters not desired to be in the public domain.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it not possible to take this to the end of the examination of this witness so that we do not go from the closed session to another open session?  Would it be possible to proceed in that manner if it does not, of course, disturb your case?  But if there is any problem then we could go into the closed session and then come back to an open session. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, you will note that I skipped file No. 5, and it is the last clip.  It is about a two-minute clip, and after that clip it is when I intend to move this Chamber to receive this collection into evidence.  So it is entirely at your discretion, Your Honours.  If you are inclined to receive the videos into evidence now, I'm happy to do it, and then we can go into closed session.  Alternatively, if the witness can be allowed to identify the short clip, then we can go back into open session for me to move the Chamber to receive the exhibits.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Prosecution.  We will continue in open session, and at the end you might tender the fifth CD, file No. 5, which will be presented at that time.  But you could tender these into evidence now or decide to do it at the same time with the others.  We will proceed as you'd like, but we would rather continue in open session and then come back to deal with file No. 5 in closed session subsequently. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours, the Prosecutor is moving this Chamber to admit into evidence the series of videos taken by this witness on his mission to Rwanda between the end of May and early June 1994.  The witness has identified the images that have been displayed on the screens and I'm applying that the videos be admitted and marked Prosecution Exhibit Nos. 1 through 8, and that a log of the video footage, the excerpts identified by the witness, be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. 9.  Registry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, what are your comments on the Prosecutor's desire to get these admitted into evidence? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, as concerns the footage we have just looked at, we took advantage of our break to look at it or watch it for a while, but the five, seven or eight -- I believe all those who watched them with me, I do not think that we did watch those other cassettes.

But as concerns the pictures or images that the witness has just commented on, we did see them, but for the others that are not included that we have not seen this afternoon, we did not see them either. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
If I may clarify on this anomaly, Your Honours, it is like if the Prosecutor was tendering into evidence a document or report of 100 pages but only sought to rely on two paragraphs.  What we have done is to tender into the evidence the entire footage comprising approximately more than three hours, but we have only relied on portions which the witness has identified, portions that are relevant to this trial.  There are portions that are not relevant about his journey to Kigali, his journey to Butare, but we are producing the entire video, and the video log will show the marker numbers for the excerpts for files Nos. 1 through 7.  Most obliged, Your Honours. 
JUDGE REDDY:
But the entire videos are going into evidence, and if there are material in those videos that are favourable to the Defence, you have no objection to them being introduced into evidence by them? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Not at all, Your Honours.  We have given them the entire context, and maybe, may I add, that over the lunch break we made arrangements and after the close of this session we shall give the same material for the Defence who, if they wish, may view it overnight and be ready for cross-examination tomorrow morning.
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kouengoua, you would like to make a comment? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Madam President.  I said that the parts on which the -- which the witness commented on, I beg your pardon, we watched them during the break.  The other parts that were announced, we did not see.  I am saying that under oath, and the Office of the Prosecutor can bear us out.  We ended up with the visit to the Benaco camp, and when we got there, it stopped.  That is what happened.

Now, what is being announced now includes portions that we did not see.  I believe that these anomalies could be avoided if they had been shown up to 13, 14, 15.  I think we have enough time.  Why do they try to surprise us at every turn?  We stayed here, my client, his security officers, we watched it all, and then we stopped at 8, and now we are talking about 15.  I believe that is not normal, Madam President, and I must state it.

I think and I believe, and I hope it appears on record, that parts of what has to be seen have to be chosen, and I believe that there is something there which is not proper.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thanks, Counsel.  I believe the Prosecutor did say earlier that for the time being he is only admitting into evidence what we watched here.  Consequently, as concerns file No. 5, we will come back to that file when we deal with it in closed session.  So, for the moment, that is not being admitted into evidence.  You have not seen it yet. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Madam President, and I would also wish that he makes me see it before the closed session.  That is important for us.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, could you then present the documents.  The registry will take due note, so you have to give us the numbers of the documents that are being proposed for admission into evidence.  We are going to start with file No. 1.  You don't have any English and French versions, as far as the numbering is concerned?  Is it just one document each time? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I have already handed to the registry eight compact discs, and I have also handed to the registry a three-page document, which I ask be marked Prosecution Exhibit No. 9, containing the video log of what we have shown in this Chamber, indicating on which CD the extracts are and the marker numbers, so that anybody reviewing the material we have just shown can go straight to those specific excerpts.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let me now turn to the registry.  Is there no problem about the documents that have been submitted for identification?
MR. JUMA:
Your Honours, we are now trying to put together the information in the KV00 and the log, so we are not in a position yet to tell you that there is a problem or not until after a few minutes.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I thank you too, Registry.  We may proceed.  Prosecution. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I heard you suggest that they be marked for identification.  Prosecutor had applied that they be admitted onto the record and be numbered Prosecution Exhibits 1 through 8 for the compact discs and Prosecution Exhibit No. 9 for the video log indicating the excerpts shown to Court.

If the record could indicate that they are so admitted, Your Honours, we would then proceed to the closed session to watch file No. 5 over which we have concerns, and if it pleases Your Lordships, we may proceed to closed session straightaway so that the formal admission onto the record is done subsequent to your viewing file No. 5, which is only about two minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, we accept your proposal.  What we are doing now is asking the registry if there are no difficulties.  The registry has indicated that in a few minutes it will be able to tell us if there are any problems or not.  That is why I am asking you if you would like to proceed, and in a few minutes the registry will get back to us and I will be able to tell you whether the documents have been accepted as exhibits numbers so, so and so.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  In which case Prosecutor moves that we go into closed session so that Your Lordships can view file No. 5, which is just about two minutes, and after that, after the witness has identified file No. 5, I will have no further questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The registry has indicated that everything is complete, so the documents are accepted as Prosecution Exhibits 1 to 8, and Exhibit 9 for the video log of what was projected.
(Prosecution Exhibit Nos. 1 to 8 admitted)
(Prosecution Exhibit No. 9 admitted)
MR. KAREGYESA:
Much obliged, Your Honours.  With your leave, may we now move into closed session to view file No. 5 for just about two minutes?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall now go into closed session, and we would like to ask the registry to do what is required, because the public cannot attend what is happening in this next session, we regret.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, please continue. 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
May it please Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Fergal Keane.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, so you have completed with this witness.  

I believe that we are now going to adjourn, in view of the fact that we had previously said that cross-examination would be held tomorrow morning.
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Thank you, Madam President.

I just wanted to take this opportunity, before cross-examination, to give to the Defence facsimile copies of exhibits tendered into evidence numbered 1 through 9, which is the videotapes and the video log.

Registry, could you please hand these over to the Defence?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If no one wishes to say anything else, then I would like to remind everyone that the proceedings will resume tomorrow morning at 8:45.  But we shall be -- sit in Trial Chamber I, in the Laïty Kama Courtroom at 8:45.  We shall resume in that courtroom because it's better for the public; it's more convenient for the public.  This courtroom is located on the fourth floor.  

I would also like to say that we shall begin at 8:45.  There shall be a break at 11:00.  The break will last from 11:00 to 11:15, and we shall sit until 1:00 p.m. and then we shall resume at 2:30 p.m. up until 5 p.m.  

If there are no further comments, we shall adjourn, and we shall resume tomorrow morning.  Thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1643H)
