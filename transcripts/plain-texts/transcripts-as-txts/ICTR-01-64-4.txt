MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Court is in session.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, there is a problem with the equipment, if you can just bear with me for one moment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  You are still under oath I remind you.  Yesterday the Defence conducted cross-examination and the Prosecution wishes to put questions to you in redirect this morning.  Mr. Prosecutor, the floor is yours. 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Just for the record, Your Honours.  Madam President, you made reference to Article 15, unfortunately, it was not translated into the English language.  If you could kindly repeat it, so that it's placed onto the record. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I will repeat.  We are sitting this morning; the Bench is composed of two persons this morning because Judge Reddy is not well.  We will probably sit in the same manner tomorrow and this is pursuant to Rule 15bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Madam President. 

Maybe, Your Honours, before I proceed with my re-examination, I'd like to bring to Your Lordships' attention, matters pertaining to the appearance -- order of appearance of the remaining witnesses.  Looking at the list, after TAK we should have led the evidence of TAS, TAP and TBC.  Unfortunately, however, Your Honours, we are advised that TAP is currently indisposed and may not be in a position to testify today.  We therefore propose, Your Honours, to proceed with the evidence of TAS and TBC today, and hopefully TAP should be much better tomorrow, in which case, we will hear her evidence tomorrow.  So that's the slight change that has been brought about by reasons beyond our control, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Prosecutor.  We have taken note.  You may proceed. 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Thank you.  Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS TAK
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness TAK, I just have three matters that require clarification this morning, which arose during cross-examination by learned counsel for the Defence yesterday afternoon.  
Now, Defence Counsel, yesterday afternoon, referred you to the statement you made to the Rwandan judicial authorities on April 8th, 1998, and referred to a paragraph or an answer in your statement in which you state that Kanyagote had with him three children on the occasion you met him.  Counsel, however, did not give you an opportunity to clarify why in your evidence on oath you said Kanyagote was with two children.  Would you please clarify to their Lordships why your statement refers to three children and your evidence-in-chief refers to two children?
A.	In my statement of April 8th 1998, I never said that Kanyagote was with his three children.  I remember, even though this took place a long time ago, that I said to the person who was interviewing me, in answer to their question which was, "How many people -- persons were with you on that day when we went to Gacumbitsi's", I said, "I was with three persons", and I was referring to Kanyagote and his two children.  I never said that there were three children.  I think the person who wrote down my statement either did not understand properly what I said or did not write my statement down properly.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Now, again during cross-examination by learned counsel for the Defence, he also referred to your statement concerning a driver by the name of Seduka who is now in Kibungo and did not give you an opportunity to clarify whether the said driver Seduka was the driver of Gacumbitsi.  Would you please clarify to their Lordships whether indeed this was the driver of Gacumbitsi or the driver of the Daihatsu?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Objection, Madam President if -- by your leave.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, in my cross-examination I never asked the witness yesterday if Seduka was Gacumbitsi's driver or of any other vehicle. In my cross-examination following examination-in-chief the witness stated that he noticed in the convoy -- he noticed that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was in the convoy.  During cross-examination I asked him, "Well, didn't you also see Seduka, since there were three vehicles in the convoy?"  He explained to the Prosecutor and myself saying that the vehicles went very quickly, and I never claimed that the driver was Gacumbitsi's.  

But the point was to determine how many people he had recognised in the convoy.  Examination-in-chief he said only Gacumbitsi; cross-examination he said only Gacumbitsi; and that is when I reminded him that in 1998 he mentioned the name of the driver Senduraka (sic) -- the Daihatsu driver.  If the Prosecution wants to ask questions, then he should not state incorrectly what I stated in cross-examination, because otherwise there would be no point really, it would be completely illogical.  The Prosecution said he wanted to know how many people he recognised in the convoy; he said one, because the convoy was moving too rapidly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, the record is very clear.  In fact, Madam President intervened and she said, and I quote, "Yes, Counsel, you are lengthening the debate by making clarifications that are not -- in fact, the driver you are referring to in the witness statement is the driver of the Daihatsu." There was confusion on this point created by Counsel for the Defence who was making comment and did not allow this witness, who is testifying, to put a clarification on the record.  And that is all I seek from this witness.  

If you look at the record, Counsel did not use the proper impeachment procedure, he just read something onto the record and made comment without allowing the witness to clarify.  And this is a very, very simple point, Your Honours, if I could be allowed to proceed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution, you may proceed.
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, in your statement to Rwandan judicial authorities dated 8th April 1998, did you tell the investigators that you recognised the driver of the Daihatsu named Seduka?
A.	Yes, that's what I said, but the investigator did not ask me in what circumstances I recognised Seduraka (sic).
Q.	Thank you.
A.	And if you want me to explain the circumstances under which I recognised Seduraka who was one of the drivers in the convoy, I will be happy to do so.
Q.	It's not necessary your -- Witness, Witness.  
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I have one question arising from cross-examination yesterday that merits a closed session because it may divulge the identity of this witness -- just one question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe this is your last question, Mr. Prosecutor.  Very well, we shall now sit in closed session for the last question of the Prosecutor.
MR. KAREGYESA: 
It is my last question, Your Honours.

	0912H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, who will your next witness be? 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
The next witness on the list, Your Honours, is Witness TAS, and her evidence will be led by my learned colleague, Andra Mobberley.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Ms. Mobberley. 
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Good morning, Madam President; good morning, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness TAS.  In a moment you are going to make your solemn declaration and you will be questioned by the Prosecutor, and then you will be cross-examined by Defence Counsel.  It is possible also that Judges put to you some questions for clarification.  

Since you're a protected witness, ensure that you do not provide in open session any information which may assist anyone in identifying you.  We are now going to take your solemn declaration.  

Can the Witness be assisted, please, by the court clerk.  

(Declaration made by Witness TAS in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank Witness TAS and the court officer.  

Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor for your examining -- examination-in-chief of this witness.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Thank you, Madam President.  There is one preliminary matter to attend to.  In respect of this witness, the Prosecutor will be seeking two closed sessions.  The initial closed session is to deal with the usual preliminaries, and in this case the proposal that we put a sufficient -- a form to the witness for her to read and confirm is not an appropriate procedure given her levels of literacy; she is unable to read Kinyarwanda sufficiently to be able to make an appropriate confirmation for the Court of the details.  

The second closed session that I will seek is at the conclusion of the witness's evidence.  The application is made on two grounds:  First is that part of the witness's evidence is extremely sensitive and personal in nature and relates to sexual assault; and, second, and probably a more concerning factor for the witness, is that one of the men involved in the event has been released from prison in Rwanda and is living in her community.  She's concerned that publicly revealing the circumstances of the event would have the natural consequence of leading that person to recognise the witness and thus may result in her identity being revealed, not only to him but more widely in her community.  The application is made in respect of both closed sessions under Articles -- under Article 21 of the Statute and Rule 75 and 79 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

In relation to the second closed session, the Prosecutor particularly relies on Rule 75(B)(iii) which provides for appropriate measures for the protection of vulnerable victims and witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall, therefore, move into a closed session.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
I am obliged, Your Honour.

	0927H
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, the Court is now in open session.  That means that the public is present and the information you are giving is being broadcast.  Please ensure that you don't give any information that might reveal your identity.  Do you understand me?
A.	Yes, I've understood.
Q.	You've told this Court that you knew Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  Did you see him in April 1994 after the death of the president?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Do you recall how many times you saw him?
A.	I saw him twice.
Q.	Do you remember the dates on which you saw him?
A.	Yes, I remember the dates.
Q.	What were they?
A.	I saw him on Wednesday, the 13th of April 1994, and I saw him again on the 16th, and that was a Saturday in the month of May in 1994.
Q.	Witness --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I beg your pardon, April.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness, I want to ask you some questions about the 13th of April 1994.  Where were you when you first saw Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	When I saw Sylvestre for the first time I saw him at Nyakarambi.  I had been asked to go Nyakarambi to buy him cigarettes, and when I got there I met Gacumbitsi who was in a double-cabin vehicle in the company of policemen.  Gacumbitsi was carrying a microphone.  He was asking us to assemble behind the shops where there was going to be a meeting.
Q.	Witness, who were you buying tobacco for?
A.	I was going to -- asked to buy cigarettes for my husband, ......Q.	Do you recall the time at which you sawSy  lvestre Gacumbitsi that morning?
A.	It was 10.  It was between 10 and 11.
Q.	What colour was the vehicle that you saw Sylvestre Gacumbitsi in?
A.	It was a vehicle whose colour was between yellow and khaki, and it was a double-cabin vehicle.
Q.	Was he driving the car -- the vehicle?
A.	No, he had a driver.
Q.	Did you recognise the driver?
A.	I didn't pay it much mind, and I didn't recognise the driver because when we went back I went between the shops and I didn't go close by the vehicle.
Q.	Was he accompanied by anybody else?
A.	There were policemen with him, and one of them came down from the vehicle and stood next to him.  His name was Kazoba.
Q.	Witness, at the time that you heard this announcement, where were you in Nyakarambi?  Were you at the shops -- the main shops, or were you at the market place?
A.	I was in front of the shops and he was asking us to go behind the shops where the market takes place, because the market is held behind the shop.  There was a tank, which was high, and we were standing next to the tank.
Q.	So, after you heard this announcement while you were in the Nyakarambi shops, what did you do?
A.	I obliged, and I went to that location for the meeting to see what was going to be said there.
Q.	Did you see Sylvestre Gacumbitsi again on that day after you'd arrived at the market?
A.	When we got to the place he had already come down from the vehicle and he was apart, to the back, with a megaphone in his hand, and it was the megaphone that he was using in order to speak to us.
Q.	What did he say?
A.	Even though I wasn't able to attend the meeting closely, I was able to know what was said.  He took his megaphone and he got onto the vehicle and he gave an example in reference to Rukira commune where houses were burnt down.  And he said to the people present to be vigilant so that no one can escape, and to follow Rukira's example so that no one can escape.
Q.	Did you see Sylvestre Gacumbitsi with your own eyes when he was making this announcement?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	What was your reaction?
A.	I was with another lady, Rugando's (phonetic) wife, and we were surprised because we felt that these words were meant for us in particular.  This lady's name was Patricia Myirabaja and we decided to leave.
Q.	Why did you think these words were meant for you?
A.	When I was going to the Nyakarambi market, I had met people who had sought refuge at the Gakobogo commune (sic) and their children, and they told us that those who had sought refuge in Birenga and Rukira commune as well as in Kigarama commune, and even people from Rusumo commune had already reached there because they were being pursued there by Gacumbitsi.  And when he said those words, we wondered a great deal about what he was saying, and we knew that we were also going to be sent away.
Q.	Witness, I need to ask you to repeat some of the names that you've given so that we can ask the interpreters to spell them for the record.  The first name that you gave sounded to me like Gakarogu commune; is that correct?  You said you met Gakarogu.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Interpreters, could we have the spelling, please?

THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
I said Gakobogo:  G-A-K-O-B-O-G-O, Gakobogo.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
The witness also gave the names Kigina, which is No. 105 on the list; Rusumo, which is No. 218 on the list. 
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, did you notice what the reaction of the crowd -- or what the reaction of the other people at the market were that day after they heard Sylvestre Gacumbitsi speaking over the megaphone?
A.	When we heard Gacumbitsi's words, myself and the other lady, when we looked at whom he was speaking, we realised that there were no Tutsis except one Murwanashyaka, so we decided to leave and we, therefore, didn't follow the meeting -- what took place in the meeting. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the witness spell that name or do you have this on your list?  And a moment ago she mentioned one Patricia Myirabaja, if she could also spell that name please for the record. 
THE WITNESS:
I did not quite understand what the Presiding Judge said. 
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Perhaps the interpreters could spell those names for us please.  We have one of those names, Myirabaja, which is 104 on the list, and the other was Murwanashyaka, which is not on the list.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Murwanashyaka is spelt M-U-R-W-A-N-A-S-H-Y-A-K-A, Murwanashyaka.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	What day is market usually held at Nyakarambi?
A.	The Nyakarambi market is held on Wednesdays. 
Q.	And on that day the 13th of April when you were at the market, what day of the week was it?
A.	It was the market day.
Q.	You've said that when you saw who Gacumbitsi was speaking to at the market, you were concerned.  Can you explain to us what you mean?  Who was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi speaking to?
A.	Those who were present and to whom he was speaking were Hutus and the Interahamwe from Nyakarambi.
Q.	Why did that concern you?  Why did it concern you that Gacumbitsi was speaking to Hutu and Interahamwe from Nyakarambi?
A.	We felt concerned because we had received the news, and even in Kirehe secteur I had been told that the Tutsis whom I knew had been killed the day before and that even in our home in Kigina killings had started.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Those are names 109 and 106 of the -- on the list.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, you've told this Court what your ethnic group is.  Why then were you concerned?
A.	I felt concerned because after the death of President Habyarimana there had been secret meetings and I was a....., I was married to a Tutsi, and they didn't want me to know their secrets.
Q.	Witness TAS, after you left the market, what did you do?
A.	When I left the market, I went back home and I told my husband and members of his family the story.  They thought of fleeing, but they remembered the fact that military roadblocks had been set up and they realised that they had no escape, no way out.
Q.	What did you do?
A.	We stayed at home until the evening.
Q.	What did you do that evening?
A.	In the evening we decided not to spend a night at home and we spent the night in some bushes.
Q.	Did anything happen while you were hiding that evening?
A.	That night, where we were hidden in the bushes, there was a road nearby leading to a built-up place, and a man called Kazoba passed.  We could hear him but we could not see him.  And as he was going down he was talking to someone called Ndangamyambi and was telling him that by noon Thursday the 14th there wouldn't be one Tutsi left alive because Gacumbitsi had given the order to kill, beginning with Marie and Patricia.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, the name Kazoba appears at No. 99 on the list, and if the Kinyarwanda interpreters could spell the other name that the witness gave.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Kazoba is spelt K-A-Z-O-B-A.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
And the other name given by the witness?
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witnes TAS, you said you heard Kazoba talking to somebody else.  Could you repeat the name of the other person please?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Ndangamyambi.  Ndangamyambi is spelt N-D-A-N-G-A-M-Y-A-M-B-I, Ndangamyambi.  Ndangamyambi, N-D-A-N-G-A-M-Y-A-M-B-I.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, you've said that you heard Kazoba speaking these words.  How far were you from Kazoba when you heard him?
A.	There was about 30 metres between he and I.
Q.	Were you able to see him or only to hear him?
A.	It was night; I could not see him, but we could hear him.
Q.	Witness TAS, I want you to come back briefly to earlier that day when you heard Gacumbitsi speaking at the market.  Was he accompanied by anybody?
A.	He was with some policemen.
Q.	Were they in civilian clothing or in uniforms?
A.	Gacumbitsi was in civilian clothes, but the policemen were in uniform.
Q.	Could you tell whether they were communal police or gendarmes?
A.	They were communal policemen.
Q.	Were they armed or unarmed?
A.	Kazoba is the only one who got down, and the only one we caught a glimpse of, and he had a weapon.  Those who stayed in the vehicle also had weapons -- had arms, but they did not get down from the vehicle.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAS.  I want to now take you to the second time you saw Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  You've said that was on the 16th of April 1994.  Where were you when you saw him?
A.	When I saw Gacumbitsi that day, I was in some bushes in Kavuzo cellule.  I didn't know where the pit was next to which they killed people.
Q.	Where was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi standing?
A.	Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was at Kavuso in Gafurama's compound, and that's where there was the pit where he threw the corpses of the Tutsi he killed, and that's where I found Gacumbitsi.
Q.	Could the interpreters please spell Gafurama?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
The witness said Gafurama.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Would you please spell that for the record.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Gafurama is spelt G-A-F-U-R-A-M-A.  G-A-F-U-R-A-M-A, Gafurama.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	What was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi doing?
A.	Next to the hole there was a man named Gasangwa, and a woman had been brought there with two children, of which one was a baby, and there was also a young girl standing there.  And Gacumbitsi told Gasangwa that none of those people should survive and that time should not be wasted on them.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, Gasangwa is No. 49 on the list.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, who was Gasangwa?
A.	He was the deputy to the conseiller of Kavuzo. 
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Your Honours, Kavuzo is No. 79 -- 97 on the list. 
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Do you know what his ethnic origin was?
A.	Gasangwa was Hutu.
Q.	You've told us that Gacumbitsi was standing next to a hole.  Can you describe the size of the hole?
A.	The hole wasn't very big -- very wide, but many people were put in it.
Q.	Do you know whether those people were alive or dead?
A.	The people who were piled in the pits had been killed:  Gafurama, Marie, who had been killed on the 14th and Sirkari, and the hole had not yet been filled in because other corpses were brought and piled on top of the corpses already in the pit.
Q.	Witness, you have given us the name of someone who was killed on the 14th.  Can you give us that name again, and then I'll get the Kinyarwanda interpreters to spell it for the record?
A.	He hadn't been killed on the 13th, he had been killed on the 14th.  There was Gafurama, Reverien and Sirkari. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Sirkari is spelt S-I-R-K-A-R-I.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Gafurama has already been spelt for the record.  

The witness gave a second name.  Are the interpreters able to spell that for the record?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
R-E-V-E-R-I-E-N.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, how were you able to observe Sylvestre Gacumbitsi standing by this hole filled with corpses?
A.	I was coming from some shrubs below the -- where the hole was and I wanted to cross the road to the other side to go to see someone, a man, to ask his help.
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court the ethnic group of the three people whose corpses you saw in that pit?
A.	They were Batutsi.
Q.	What happened to the woman who was with the children by the side of the pit after Gacumbitsi had spoken to Gasangwa?
A.	Gacumbitsi, as I told you, spoke to Gasangwa and Gacumbitsi himself pushed the woman who was still alive into the hole.  Gasangwa hit her with a stick, but she was already in the hole.  She fell into the hole with her children.  One child was pulled out, a girl.  And she was pulled out; they said she was Hutu, and she went away with a man from Ruhanga.
Q.	Now, apart from the child who was Hutu, what was the ethnic group of the woman and the other child or children she was pushed into the hole with?
A.	Those children were Tutsi and the woman, her name was Tassien Mukamwiza was also Tutsi.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Mukamwiza is spelt M-U-K-A-M-W-I-Z-A, M-U-K-A-M-W-I-Z-A.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	How many Tutsi children were pushed into that pit with her?
A.	There were two children and that woman who was the third one to be put -- who was the third one to be pushed into the hole.
Q.	At the time that the woman was pushed into the hole was she alive or was she dead?
A.	She was still alive.  She was still alive.
Q.	Did she say anything?
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
I haven't had an interpretation.

BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Did the woman say anything before she was pushed into that hole?
A.	She didn't say anything.
Q.	Do you know what happened to her after she was beaten with the stick?
A.	She was hit with a stick and Gacumbitsi went off down the road.  He got into a vehicle which was carrying many Interahamwe and they left.
Q.	Witness TAS, you've told this Court that you know Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  Would you be able to identify him if you saw him again?
A.	Yes, I would recognise him.
Q.	Can you please stand up and look around the courtroom and see if you can see Sylvestre Gacumbitsi in court today?
A.	I have just seen him.  He is sitting over there.  He's wearing glasses, spectacles, a jacket - dark-coloured jacket.  He is sitting alone.  To his right there is a policeman.
Q.	What colour shirt is he wearing?
A.	A sort of bluish shirt.
Q.	Which row is he sitting in?
A.	In the second row.
Q.	Your Honour, the Prosecutor applies for the record to reflect that the Witness TAS has identified the Accused Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let it be recorded that the witness has recognised the Accused.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, given that your husband was a Tutsi  --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- what ethnic group were your children?
A.	My children were Tutsi.
Q.	Were any members of your immediate family killed or injured in April 1994?
A.	I do not fully understand your question, please.
Q.	Were any of your children killed or injured in April 1994?
A.	One of my children was injured.  He didn't die then, but he died in 1997.
Q.	Can you describe for the Court, before we go into a closed session, how he was injured?
A.	He was an infant that I was carrying on my back, and I went to see the other children -- I only moved around with one child, the others were hidden at someone's place -- and I met some attackers, assailants, who tore the child away from me and told me to sit and put the child in my lap, on my knees.
Q.	Witness TAS, what happened -- what happened next?
A.	So I sat down and I took my child on my knees and one of the assailants hacked the child behind the head -- behind the ear, on the back of the head, and another one told him, "Stop, we've shed enough blood," and that's how the child was wounded but not killed.
Q.	Witness TAS, do you know the ethnic group of the people who attacked your children -- your child, rather?
A.	Yes, I know their ethnic group, but if I reveal their identity that could be a threat to my own safety and security.
Q.	Thank you Witness TAS.  Can you just tell us what their ethnic group is at this stage?  Don't reveal their names.
A.	They were Hutu.
Q.	Witness TAS, I'm going to ask the Court to go into closed session now for the completion of your evidence. 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, the Prosecutor requests a closed session at this point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam.  

Counsel, do you have any comments? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No comment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We will now go into closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We resume.  Counsel Kouengoua, could you continue with your cross-examination.  And I shall request you to be as precise and concise as possible, so that we can conclude in a reasonable time.  How much time do you think you still need for your cross-examination?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, welcome back.  I wish respectfully to indicate to the Chamber that if the cross-examination (sic) hadn't taken so much time, we wouldn't be here now.  I have tried as much as I can from yesterday, the day before yesterday to keep to the time allotted to me.  So as is my habit, I will do all possible to keep to the time allotted.  I thank you. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAS, you testified, "I saw him twice in 1994"; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And when you were saying twice, the Prosecutor said the following: "After the death of the president," which president was she referring to?
A.	The president which the Prosecutor was referring was Habyarimana.
Q.	And when did the president die, what date?
A.	He died on the 6th, in the night of the 6th.
Q.	And you answered the Prosecutor, "I saw him twice, the 13th of April and the 16th of April"; is that correct?
A.	The 13th and the 16th, yes, you are right.
Q.	Between the 6th, the night of the 6th and the 13th, where were you, TAS?
A.	From the 13th, I was in Nyakibande cellule, but I was in hiding so as not to be discovered by any group of attackers.
Q.	Witness TAS, between the death of the president, which you claim to have been on the 6th and the 13th, where were you?  That is my question?
A.	I was in Nyakibande cellule.
A.	Witness TAS, before the 13th of April 1994 were there any difficulties or problems in your area?
A.	Not that I know of.
Q.	Witness TAS, could you be more specific?  Were there any problems in your area?  Please answer my question.
A.	There weren't any problems in my area, nor in my commune.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAS.  And from the 6th to the 13th of April, did you see the bourgmestre?
A.	Yes, I saw him on the Wednesday.
Q.	Is he the one who announced the death of the president?
A.	No, it was between 5 and 6 in the morning on Thursday when we heard a radio announcement.
Q.	When you heard the announcement, what was your reaction to it?
A.	After the announcement we felt in a situation of insecurity.  We felt insecure because no one could move about -- no one was moving about apart from soldiers and their vehicles, and roadblocks had been set up by these same soldiers.
Q.	Witness TAS, the jug of water by your side is yours.  You can feel free to use it?
A.	Yes, I have seen it.
Q.	Thank you.  Where were the soldiers coming from?
A.	They were coming from their military camp.  We saw vehicles come to Rusumo but we didn't know where they came from.
Q.	Aside from the vehicles belonging to the military, did other people come to Rusumo?
A.	I couldn't know of any, given the fact that I wasn't actually living by the tarmacked road.
Q.	Were there any military camps in Rusumo commune?
A.	Military camps were set up after Habyarimana's death.
Q.	How many camps were there? 
A.	The one that I knew of was the Rugwaheru (phonetic) camp which was closest to where I lived because at the time one could not move about; one would remain at home.
Q.	You stated that on the 13th, you saw Gacumbitsi for the first time at the Nyamugali market; is that what you said?
A.	No, I spoke of Nyakarambi.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAS.  And what time was it?
A.	I testified that it was around 10 o'clock, between 10 and 11, but more towards 11.
Q.	Towards 11, very well.  What were you going to do at the market on that day?
A.	I testified that I was going to buy cigarettes, upon my husband's request.
Q.	Were these special cigarettes?
A.	They were cigarettes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Of what interest is the make or mark of the type of cigarettes that were being bought?  Is this a question which will make any significant contribution to the record?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, very respectfully, I did not ask for the type of cigarette.  I simply asked whether these cigarettes were special.  And the Chamber will realise what -- how important this question is to the case, Madam President.  Thank you.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	You stated that when you reached the market, you were in front of the shops and Gacumbitsi was in a vehicle -- asked people to assemble at the market behind the shops; is that correct?
A.	I testified that Gacumbitsi asked the population to go behind the shops at a location where the market was held, and that at that place we were to assemble so that he could communicate a message to us.
Q.	Can you please tell the Chamber in what language Gacumbitsi was speaking?
A.	The Rwanda population, even intellectuals, express themselves in Kinyarwanda because that is the language which is understood by everyone.  Intellectuals can use French, but when the population is being addressed, Kinyarwanda is used.
Q.	So, everything that happened at that point in time at the market, all of those people who were there could follow Gacumbitsi's speech, what he was saying and therefore go to the place identified for the meeting?
A.	After having said what he said, since he was bourgmestre, no one -- everyone respected his orders, his instructions.  And furthermore, not many shops were opened because most traders had been victims of the genocide and it was mainly the shop owners.
Q.	Where on the 13th at the Nyakarambi market, what was the conseiller or the responsables de cellule of that particular market; what was that person's name?
A.	It was the same official as the one for Nyakibande, he played the same role.  And his name was Rukomeza Karugendo.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Could the interpreter please spell those names?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Karugendo is spelt, K-A-R-U-G-E-N-D-O, Karugendo.  Rukomeza is spelt, R-U-K-O-M-E-Z-A, Rukomeza.
Q.	Witness TAS, was Karugendo Rukomeza with Gacumbitsi?
A.	No, Karugendo was not there.
Q.	Can you recall with whom Gacumbitsi was?
A.	I testified that the person that I was able to see and recognise was Kazoba because he was the one who came down from the vehicle and stood by Gacumbitsi.
Q.	You have just said that the shops had been burnt down; did I understand you correctly?
A.	No, I didn't say that, no.  I said that most of the shops were closed.
Q.	And for what reason?
A.	The reason was that the owners of the shops came from various places and some of them were being looked for, sought out.
Q.	They were being sought by whom; who was looking for them?
A.	The war had begun, the machete war.  And the businessmen -- the tradesmen could not continue their businesses, the circumstances were not capicious (sic) for it.
Q.	Witness TAS, you have just told us that from the 6th to the 13th everything was calm in that place; why are you now speaking of war?
A.	The military had come and set up roadblocks, but they didn't stop the massacres against the Tutsis.
Q.	Witness TAS, must I remind you that you just said until the 13th there was no problem in the place -- the locality where you were, why are you speaking now of massacres?  I do not understand.
A.	I told you that Kirehe secteur, massacres had begun.  And in Kigini which is the neighboring secteur to ours was where the meeting was being held of which we were speaking.
Q.	Can you approximately tell us how many people attended that meeting?
A.	It was market day, but there weren't many people at that meeting; not more than 100 people.  I would say about 90 to 100 people attended.
Q.	Were there people that you knew at that meeting, Witness TAS?
A.	I personally did not know any of the people there.  The people from Nyakarambi that I knew I knew only by sight, I didn't know their names, apart from the lady I mentioned, whose name was Myirabama, who died.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The lady's name was Myirabaja, the interpreter corrects himself.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAS, in answering the Prosecution this morning you said as follows:  "In looking at the attendance we only noticed one Tutsi."  Are you coming back on what you said or do you maintain what you said?
A.	I am not correcting myself.
Q.	You said, "That when we saw the bourgmestre making his speech, we thought that we were in danger and we left," the lady with whom you were and you left.  And the Prosecution asked, "Why".  And you said -- now I don't know whether I correctly understood, but I thought you said, "As I was going to Rukira market, there were people from Gakobogo who were being chased."  I didn't quite get that.  Could you please repeat for me?
A.	That is not what I said.  I never spoke of Rukira market, I spoke of Nyakarambi market, that is what I said.
Q.	Did you speak of Gakobogo or something like that?
A.	I spoke of Gakobogo in reference to Wednesday when I met him with his son, he came back from the commune he was being chased by Gacumbitsi who had also been chasing the people out of two places. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Two places, the interpreter has missed the name of the two places.  If she could repeat, please.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Madam President, the interpreter indicated in English that he missed the name of the two places mentioned by the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please repeat the names of the two places from which the people had been chased?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the booth would like you to either repeat the names or ask the witness to repeat the names. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Could you please repeat the names of the two places you mentioned for the interpretation booth, so they can get them correctly?
A.	I spoke of Gakobogo and as to his two names -- his two sons, I don't know their names because we weren't neighbours. 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, that is --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is spelt G-A-K-O-B-O-G-O, G-A-K-O-B-O-G-O.
MS MOBBERLEY:
Madam President, there were also -- there was also some other information that was lost in the translation and it may be appropriate for the question to be put again so that the witness can go slowly through her answer so the interpreters can pick up all of the names and places that she mentioned.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you please repeat your question because we did not get all of the answer?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, as I am prevented from making comments, the answer, I must apologise if I can't repeat the question because the answer had nothing to do with my question.  I was talking of people, and localities were mentioned to me.  That is the situation.  I am lost.  I asked one thing, I am told something else.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, the witness mentioned two places.  Please repeat the question; we will see what her answer is.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, when I was taking my notes rapidly this morning, in the course of         examination-in-chief, I noted a name Gakobogo and Kigarama which I thought were places.  And these places were in respect of refugees.  Now, when I asked the Witness TAS this morning,  "You mentioned Gakobogo and Kigarama, saying that people were being chased, what was that about?"  And she answered me, "Rather, I met Mr. Gakobogo and his children."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, could you please repeat what you said before, perhaps we shall see more clearly?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I said that I met a man called Gakobogo.  He was with his two sons.  I was going then on my way to the market, and they told me what was happening Nyakarambi -- what the situation was in Nyakarambi.  They told me that they had sought refuge at the commune office with people from Rukira commune, and people from Nyakarambi as well as people from Birenga.  

And they told me in addition that Gacumbitsi has just chased us and told us to go home.  And for those who live a bit far from the communal offices, he told them to scatter throughout the countryside, disperse themselves.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	At what time were you told these things?
A.	It was on the 13th that I was told these things.
Q.	At what time?
A.	I told you, I testified that I arrived in Nyakarambi between 11 a.m. and noon, but rather towards 11 a.m.  It is not far from -- I wasn't far from Nyakarambi when I met that man with his sons on their way back home -- they were on their way back home.
Q.	When you said that they were on their way back home, what does that mean; you are going towards the market and they are coming back from the market or vice versa?
A.	They were coming back from the communal offices and I was on my way to the market.  They were returning from the communal offices to their home and I was coming from my home to the market, the communal market -- the communal offices are a bit farther than the market.
Q.	Witness TAS, in view of the bourgmestre, who found who at the market?
A.	I met him at the moment when I arrived in Nyakarambi, at that same moment.
Q.	That is to say the bourgmestre had already parked his vehicle when you arrived?
A.	As soon as I arrived, the bourgmestre's vehicle was returning from his house, where the women were living, including Beatrice that I've already mentioned.  And he turned and spoke to the people -- or addressed the crowd to tell them to go to the meeting.  I can't tell you at what time he arrived at that place.
Q.	Apart from the man you met with his children, did you meet anyone else being chased by Gacumbitsi on that day?
A.	On the way I met people whom I did not recognise and whose destination I did not know, some of them were carrying bags.  I don't know if they were among the people we are talking about.
Q.	At what time did Gacumbitsi arrive at the market?
A.	I don't know the time at which he arrived.
Q.	You said this morning Gacumbitsi arrived, got down from his double-cabin and got in the back -- the double-cabin pickup and got in the back; can you explain to us what that means?
A.	I wanted to explain the following.  He was behind the shops around the market and we were there.  And there was a water tank at that place.
Q.	When he arrived at the market, were there people who had sought refuge in your -- on the hill on which you lived?
A.	No, no one sought refuge on the hill where we lived at that time.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Counsel, Madam President I didn't -- I don't think the witness understood, I was not talking about the colline -- hill, I was speaking of the commune.
THE WITNESS:
I already told you the people that Gakobogo spoke -- the people of Rukira who sought refuge in our commune.  There were also people from Birenga and Nyakarambi.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	You personally?
A.	Personally, no, it was in the countryside.  I didn't go to the communal offices, I stayed at my home.
Q.	In answer to the main Prosecution question, "How many people were with Gacumbitsi", you answered, "I only noticed Kazoba."  Are you going to stick to that answer?
A.	Yes, I maintain what I said, as I said it.
Q.	In answer to the Prosecution question "Were these people armed", you answered, "Only Kazoba was bearing a weapon"; is that correct?
A.	It is Kazoba who got down from the vehicle and stood next to Gacumbitsi and who had a weapon in his hand.  The others were sitting in the front of the vehicle and as they were sitting, I couldn't check whether they had arms, but they were policemen, and policemen had the right to bear arms.
Q.	Was Gacumbitsi dressed in any special way?
A.	Gacumbitsi was wearing civilian clothes, not wearing a uniform.
Q.	Did he have a weapon?
A.	No, Gacumbitsi was not bearing a weapon, but he had a megaphone and he spoke through the megaphone.
Q.	Was that the first time you saw a megaphone, Witness TAS?
A.	At the communal offices when there were sports they would use a megaphone, or in secteurs when there were meetings or games, sports at the communal meetings.  So I had already seen a megaphone.
Q.	Does Witness TAS mean that her secteur also had a megaphone?
A.	No, when there were sports, the communal megaphone was brought and used by the various authorities for the occasion.
Q.	Do you know the sous-préfet --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I missed that -- 
THE WITNESS:
I knew the sous-préfet of (unintelligible) by sight, but I don't remember his name.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Were the offices far from the bourgmestre's offices?
A.	The sous-préfet's office was opposite the communal offices.
Q.	Of the bourgmestre and the sous-préfet, was one in a higher position of authority than the other?
A.	I don't know who had the higher rank.  You have asked me who had the higher rank, I did not often see the sous-préfet.  The person I saw was bourgmestre Gacumbitsi, I knew there was a sous-préfet but Gacumbitsi was the one I saw more often.
Q.	Was the sous-préfet at the meeting at the market?
A.	No.  He was not at the meeting.  It was a meeting called by the bourgmestre Gacumbitsi.
Q.	How many people spoke at that meeting, Witness TAS?
A.	No one else apart from Gacumbitsi.  In any case, I didn't listen to his whole speech because I immediately went home.
Q.	And why did you leave in a rush?
A.	I understood that the meeting he was holding and what he was saying were of no interest to me.  I should not attend this meeting, but I should hurry home to inform my husband.
Q.	What was he saying?
A.	I already repeated what he said at the outset of the meeting.  He showed -- indicated to the population the houses in Rukira commune that were ablaze.  And he said that the inhabitants had to remain vigilant and be sure that no one escaped.
Q.	Was Gacumbitsi also bourgmestre of Rukira?
A.	No, the bourgmestre of Rukira was someone else, and Rusumo had its own bourgmestre.
Q.	Witness TAS, when -- in answering the Prosecution you said, "after the president's death."  Now I'm asking you, apart from the death of the president, did you learn of any other deaths on the 14th of April 1994?
A.	There was talk of someone else who had died in the night -- the Thursday night, the prime minister, Agathe, was killed on the Thursday night.
Q.	Were the president and the prime minister of the same ethnic group?
A.	I could not answer that question.  I know nothing about that.  I don't know whether they were the same -- from the same the ethnic group or not.
Q.	I shall put the question in another way.  Do you know what the president's ethnic group was?
A.	No.
Q.	Do you know what the prime minister's ethnic group was?
A.	I do not know what Agathe's ethnic group was.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, would the Trial Chamber allow me to read the witness's statement of Witness TAS, page 4 of the French.  It is dated the 28th of November 2000, second paragraph, I think, beginning with the words, "On the 8th of April."  It appears to page 3 of the English, third paragraph:  

"On 8 April 1994 we panicked when we learned, still over Radio Rwanda, of the death of prime minister Agathe, and other high ranking officials in the country.  The main reason behind our fears was that all of those who had died were Tutsi."

"-- were Tutsi.  We therefore decided to barricade ourselves at home until 13 April 1994." 

Witness TAS, do you recognise this statement?
A.	My -- what I said has not been recorded exactly.  And when it was reread to me I pointed out that certainly the anxiety -- I had pointed out that what I had stated had not been correctly recorded.
Q.	But did you nonetheless sign it, Witness TAS?
A.	Yes, I signed the written statement.  And when it was reread to me I noted the mistakes that had crept in and I pointed them out to the people concerned.
Q.	Witness TAS, do you know the people who questioned you?
A.	Those people introduced themselves to me and told me their names, but that was quite some time ago and they weren't Rwandans, which means that I have forgotten their names.
Q.	Do you mean that these people recorded in a document that you signed things that you did not say?
A.	Regarding Agathe, I said in the night of the Thursday she was killed, but I did not say that she was the same ethnic group as the president.
Q.	Witness TAS, around that Nyakarambi market is it possible to see Rukira?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Sorry, allow me a moment. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	At that Nyakarambi market behind the shops, is it possible to see Rukira?
A.	When you are at Nyakarambi market you can see Rukira because that -- Nyakarambi is at a higher altitude than Rukira.
Q.	During the brief moment you spent at the meeting, did you hear Gacumbitsi mention the Hutu?
A.	Gacumbitsi did not say anything about the Hutu or the Tutsi.  He just said that no one should be allowed to escape and they should follow the example of Rukira and remain vigilant.
Q.	TAC (sic), Gacumbitsi said, "Be vigilant, be vigilant, look at Rukira in flames."  Wasn't he asking the people to make sure that there would not be fires -- similar fires in his commune?
A.	If he had wanted to prohibit people from doing what the people in Rukira were doing, he would not have sent away the people that had sought refuge at the commune.
Q.	You maintain, however, that he said, "be vigilant" and pointing at the flames though, don't you?
A.	Yes, I maintain that, because that is what I heard and saw with my own eyes.
Q.	Witness TAS, you have stated as follows: "While I was hiding with my partner" -- I believe -- not partner, but with my companion, I assume you are referring to the lady with whom you were with.  You heard when Kazoba -- or Kazoba talking with someone else; is that correct?
A.	I didn't say I was hiding with another person.  I told you that I was hiding with my husband and children.
Q.	And that is when you heard Kazoba's words?
A.	Yes, that is when Kazoba was saying that he had just killed Marie and Beatrice who were living at Gacumbitsi's in Nyakarambi.
Q.	What happened?
A.	I couldn't see him, we were in some shrubs and they were walking down the path.
Q.	On the 13th, had you already seen Kazoba?
A.	We could see him very often because we lived in the same cellule and he lived above us.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I'm sorry, I hadn't realised that there was an overlapping between the answer from the Rwanda booth and my question..

	May I proceed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Did you ever have a conversation with Kazoba?
A.	I had never spoken to him because he was a young man and he would have had nothing to say to a woman of my age.
Q.	Are you saying that before the 13th you had never heard the sound of his voice?
A.	He would come by our house on his way to work or his way from work and he would say hello.
Q.	Witness TAS, please look at the room, at the courtroom, could you give us an approximation of the distance that separates the two walls?
A.	No, I would not be able to make such an approximation.  You know in Rwanda our houses were scattered and we didn't live in villages the way we do now.
Q.	Could you give us approximately what distance separates us in the courtroom?
A.	I would not be able to compare that with the distance between my house and Kazoba's house because it might be a distance of metres or kilometres, unless I did not understand your question properly.
Q.	Do not just answer because you might reveal information that we are seeking to protect, I'm just asking you if you can give me an approximation of the distance between you and I in the courtroom?
A.	I have already explained that I did not understand your question.  Are you're asking me the distance that separates the place I was hiding and where he was on the path.
Q.	Witness TAS, fine, what distance would that have been?
A.	From the road to the place where I was hiding, there was approximately 30 metres.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAS.  And between you and I, how many metres separate us?
A.	I would say five metres if I'm not mistaken because of my level of education.
Q.	Five metres, perfect.  Witness TAS, five metres and you are able to distinguish his voice 30 metres away?
A.	I heard the voice and I recognised it because they were having a loud conversation, they were going down and we were below the road.
	(Pages 28 to 37 by Donna M. Lewis)


	1215H
Q.	You said that on the second occasion that you meet the bourgmestre you saw him, and Kavuzo saw you?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated, and that is when I saw him on the second occasion.
Q.	What was he doing when you saw him?
A.	When I saw Gacumbitsi I was climbing through shrubs, I was not taking the path, and I came across the place where he was with Gasangwa.  And as they were talking, I wanted to know who it was.
Q.	Witness TAS, you have said, "I was coming out from some shrubs that were below"; is that correct?
A.	I was climbing through shrubs to bushes and I wanted to cross the road to go higher, and that is where they worked.  I did not know that they had dug a pit, and that's where they were throwing people in.
Q.	Does this mean when you say, "I was going up", you mean that they were above you and you were below them; is that correct?
Q.	Yes, that's correct?
Q.	You were going up, you came across them.  Did they see you?
A.	If they had seen me, I would not have survived.  I immediately turned around and hid in the bushes.  And that is how I was able to follow everything that was happening.
Q.	Witness TAS, when you saw the bourgmestre, you turned around and got back down into your bush, and you are saying that it was from below that I saw them; is that correct?
A.	I have stated that I had come close to that place because I did not know there was a pit in which they were putting the bodies, and I turned around in a few steps and hid in the bushes.  And that is from -- that was where I heard Gacumbitsi speaking to Gasangwa.  He was telling him that the people of that species that were being looked for, that no one should survive.  And that is when Gacumbitsi pushed the tall woman Mukamwiza Tatiana and she fell into the hole with the child in her arms.
Q.	Witness, do you confirm that this pit was in Gafurama's compound?
A.	Yes, the hole was in Gafurama's property.
Q.	Did you see the hole after Gacumbitsi left or while they were there?
A.	I saw the hole while Gacumbitsi was still there, because I saw that the woman who had fallen had fallen into the hole, and I could see the soil that had been dug out from the hole when it was being dug.
Q.	Witness TAS, you said that the hole was not deep, but many persons were put into it.  How many persons were inside that hole, Witness TAS?
A.	I said that the hole was not very deep, but it was very wide and I gave you the names of three persons who were in that hole; I mentioned Revelien Sirikari, and I also mentioned Gafurama.  Those three persons were thrown into the hole.
Q.	Witness TAS, when I began my cross-examination earlier, I asked you if you knew what was the ethnicity of Gacumbitsi's wife.  You told me that you had not looked at her identity card.  Now, did you lift the bodies to identify them?  Did you see them - or did you see them before they were thrown into the hole?
A.	I didn't know what the hole was, but I had already heard that these persons were killed before I even reached that place.  And I would not have gone to that place because Gasangwa was there next to the hole waiting for other victims to be brought - - had also been killed.
Q.	So what you are telling the Court today, this is a story that you have learnt; isn't it?
A.	No, these are not things that I was told.  I am telling you about incidents that I witnessed myself.
Q.	Can you know the name of a body just by seeing it, Witness TAS?
A.	If you know someone well, even when you see them -- when you see their body after they had been killed, you can identify them.  You do not forget someone just because they are dead, and the clothing would be -- might be clothing that you knew that will help you to identify the person.
Q.	Witness TAS, you have spoken of Gasangwa, had he already killed someone else?
A.	I would not say that he had already killed someone else.  He was there at his cellule in Kavuzo next to the hole, but he -- if he had already killed other persons, I have no way of knowing.
Q.	Witness TAS, what would the date be, as you were near the hole?
A.	It was on the 16th.
Q.	Before the 16th, were you aware of the existence of this hole?
A.	No, because I did not live in that place.
Q.	Had you at least heard of it?
A.	No, no one had spoken of it, but I saw the hole myself.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There was an overlap between the question and answer.  The English booth did not hear what counsel asked.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's correct.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, if we refer to the transcripts of examination-in-chief, if this is what the witness said.  I am reading from my own notes, unless I am -- my learned friend has other information.  
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	"The row was very wide and many people were put into it".   "Were any persons killed on the 14th?    Gafurama, Sirikari and Revelien".  I assume these are the bodies of persons -- "these are the names of persons whose bodies were in the hole"; is that correct, Witness TAS?
A.	Yes, these persons had been killed on the 14th, but I arrived on the 16th.  That is the day I reached that location.
Q.	You arrived on the 16th.  Then how can you, strangely enough, discover these bodies in the hole?
A.	I knew the bodies were in the hole, because the bodies had not been removed immediately when they were removed from the road.  When I saw Sirikari's jacket, then I realised that his body as well must be in the hole.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAS.  Asides from Sirikari's jacket, what else did you see?
A.	I also saw the hole and I saw him with my own eyes.  This is not hearsay.
Q.	How far away were you from the hole?
A.	There was approximately 15 metres between me and the hole.
Q.	When you say -- referred to the word, "Concession" in Rwanda, what does this word mean for you?
A.	When I referred to the word "Concession" "property" or "compound", I was referring to bushes because we were hiding in the bushes or in the shrubs even as we were progressing.  We did not use the path.
Q.	Witness TAS, in answer to a question, you said the hole was in Gafurama's concession - - in his property.  What do you mean by that?
A.	Well, to me, that is a field, a cultivated area belonging to someone that they use to cultivate crops.
Q.	Witness TAS, were in that -- in Gafurama's field?
A.	I could see some kind of property line, but could -- I would not be able to say who owned the property next to Gafurama's, but I could see the property line.
Q.	Witness TAS, what type of markings did you see?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, could you repeat your question, because the Kinyarwanda interpreter was not able to understand your question?
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	I would like to ask the witness, what type of markings she saw between the two properties?
A.	There was a fence that would lead one to think that Gafurama's property ended, and that another property began after that.
Q.	Witness TAS, what was the fence made of?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, counsel has no need to speak so impolitely to the witness.  Questions can be put in appropriate tone.  She has given evidence in a closed session which would indicate that she is a vulnerable witness, and I politely request that he refrain from shouting at her.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I indeed -- I've noticed that you have been raising your voice.  Please use your normal tone of voice to speak to the witness.  She can hear you perfectly well.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, you know we have always been taught in this manner.  In any case, I apologise for this.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Can you explain to us what this fence was made of, this fence you saw?
A.	It was made of tree branches that made up a hedge which is used to -- usually used to separate different properties.
Q.	Are you saying that the branches were alive or dead?
A.	It was the plant making at the hedge, were alive.
Q.	And this was a rainy season?  This was happening during the rainy season?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	When did you lift the body to see -- to establish what the colour of the jacket was?
A.	I did not say that I lifted the body.
Q.	Thank you.  I am sorry I misunderstood.  So behind the hedge -- from behind the hedge you were able to see a jacket inside a pit at some --
A.	I did not say that I saw the jacket in the hole.  I told you that the jacket was not in the ditch, but next to the hole.
Q.	Witness TAS, are you telling the Trial Chamber that the body -- that the clothing had been removed from the body and the clothing was left next to the ditch, or are you saying that the body was still close next to the ditch?
A.	I told you that when I saw the jacket, it was next to the hole.  I did not say that the body was still wearing the jacket.
Q.	Witness TAS, should I understand, did you see the body or did you see the vest -- the jacket?
A.	I told you that I saw the jacket beside the hole and that I already knew that this person; in other words, Gafurama, had been killed quite close by.  These people had been killed close to the hole and then close to the road.
Q.	Witness TAS, you testified that Gacumbitsi spoke to Gasangwa.  What happened next?
A.	After they had pushed the lady into the hole, Gacumbitsi went back to the road.  He got into the vehicle and left.
Q.	What time was it, Witness?
A.	It was between 10:00 and noon.  That is only an approximation because time does not matter, that we held to heart.
Q.	Was it after Gacumbitsi left that you came close to the hole?
A.	After Gacumbitsi left, Gasangwa remained and I didn't go back up again.  I didn't have any way to go and I had to go back in order to go to Nyakibande cellule.
Q.	Witness TAS, if I were to ask you today what had happened to the lady who was pushed, what would be your answer?
A.	I would give you the same answer, as was in my testimony.
Q.	Can you give it to us again?
A.	I would repeat what I said here.
Q.	Is she dead or is she alive?
A.	She died together with her two children.
Q.	Did she die with the two children in the pit, in the hole?
A.	Yes, she died together with her two children.
Q.	Witness TAS, do you know what sex her children were -- do you know the gender of her children?
A.	The elder was a boy, but the younger one had only been born the day before.  So I wouldn't know its gender.
Q.	I beg your pardon, I didn't understand you?
A.	The first was a boy, but as for the younger, I do not know its gender.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour - -  Witness TAS, I am directing this in relation to the question put to her by the Prosecutor.  "Gacumbitsi pushed the woman and her two children into the hole and Gasangwa hit her.  The children were taken away.  One of the children was taken away, because she was Tutsi and -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Your Honours, could that answer be -- could counsel's question be repeated for the benefit of --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
First of all, there was an error in translation -- sorry, there was an error in the question that was put.  The witness had said that the child taken away was Hutu; she didn't say she was Tutsi.  She can -- counsel, again, is making comments, for the record, rather than cross-examining the witness.  And such questions are inappropriate.  

In any case, the translation that we received in English is incomplete.  If it is a comment, that ought not be repeated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you proceed, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAS, where did Mukamwiza go with the child?
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	You stated that one of the children was taken out of the pit and it was said that the child was Hutu, and that the child left together with Mukamwiza, I believe.  So my question is this:  Where did they go?
A.	I think you misunderstood me, Counsel.  Mukamwiza was killed together with her two children, but the girl who was there was taken away by a gentleman from Ruhanga.
Q.	Witness TAS, the lady who was pushed into the hole, did she die together with her two children?
A.	Yes, the woman died together with the two children in the hole, because when I left they were still in the pit.
Q.	And the eldest who was taken away because she was Hutu, what happened to her?  Was she put back in because she was Hutu?
A.	No, she was not put back into the hole.  I said that the child was taken away by a man who was from Ruhanga secteur.
Q.	Witness TAS, did you go back to the hole?
A.	No, I didn't go back there, and I went immediately back to Nyakibande.
Q.	How did you know that the child taken out of the hole was a Hutu?
A.	I saw that child later on, and I asked the child where his parents were, and he explained to me how he had left his parents' home.
Q.	Could you please tell the Chamber where it was that you saw that child subsequently?
A.	We met at Benaco, because when we were looking for refuge, I met him there and I recognised him.
Q.	Can you give his name to the Chamber?
A.	I do not know the child's family name, but I know that the child was referred to generally as Angelica.  I do not know where she is living now.  All I know is that she came from Rukira commune.
Q.	Witness TAS, this child that you saw thrown into the pit and subsequently taken out of the hole, and then you saw again later in Benaco, was this child Hutu or Tutsi?
A.	She was not thrown into the hole.  She was taken up to the edge of the hole and, in fact, I didn't ask her what ethnic group she belonged to, but all I know is that I saw her at the edge of the hole at that time.
Q.	Witness TAS, with which driver did Gacumbitsi go away?
A.	I won't be able to tell you the name of the driver with whom he left because I was in the bushes next door, and I was unable to stand up to see which driver it was, because had I gotten up, those who were in the back of the vehicle would have seen me.
Q.	Are you saying that there were people in the back of the vehicle?
A.	Yes, there were people in the back of the vehicle.
Q.	Were they civilians or soldiers?
A.	No, they were not soldiers, they were civilians.
Q.	Was Kazoba with the bourgmestre?
A.	I didn't see Kazoba on that occasion.
Q.	Was there another policeman with the bourgmestre?
A.	I wasn't able to see very well into the vehicle since I was in hiding.
Q.	How many vehicles were there?
A.	One vehicle, but another military vehicle had just gone by.
Q.	That vehicle didn't stop at the hole, did it?
A.	No.  Moreover, Gacumbitsi was going up towards his vehicle in order to leave at that particular point in time.
Q.	At the time when the woman and the two children were pushed into the hole, did you know the ethnic group?
A.	I knew the woman's ethnicity as well as that of her children.  I knew that they were Tutsis.
Q.	How did you know that?
A.	The woman in question was the daughter of my brother-in-law.  His father was the brother of my husband, and his wife was originally from Rukira and they had come to seek refuge in their native commune, believing that there would be peace there, but she died before she reached her native commune.
Q.	When Gacumbitsi left that location, where did he go?
A.	He took the road.  I do not know whether he went towards Nyakarambi.  I myself went towards the bush in order to continue on my way.  I was unable to know what happened subsequently.
Q.	Between you and Gacumbitsi, who left that location first?
A.	After Gacumbitsi left, in order to avoid being seen by several people, I retraced my steps and went down and left.
Q.	After -- according to you, did he go to the left or to the right?
A.	When he left the hole, he went forward and then he turned right.
Q.	When you say "He", are you intending to say that it was Gacumbitsi who was driving?
A.	I told you that I didn't get near in order for me to know who was driving.
Q.	How much time did you spend there?
A.	After his departure, I didn't remain there for long, I went down into the bush, but from where I had come.
Q.	Did you not try to make a parting in the live hedge so you could see through it?
A.	I didn't stay very long in that place.  It's when I heard people speaking that I went close by there.
Q.	On what date did you reach Benaco?
A.	I do not know the date of my arrival at Benaco.  I do not remember any more.  I no longer recall.
Q.	While at Benaco, did you see Gacumbitsi again?
A.	When I reached Benaco, we settled down.  As for Gacumbitsi, he remained in Rwanda.  He joined us later.  I do not remember the date nor the month, but I know that he dragged his feet in Rwanda.
Q.	Before you left Rwanda, did you see Gacumbitsi kill anyone?
A.	Before I left Rwanda, I didn't see Gacumbitsi kill anyone except the woman that he pushed into the hole.
Q.	Witness TAS, I am not talking about pushing.  Did you see Gacumbitsi kill anyone?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel be reminded to allow enough space between the question and answer?
THE WITNESS:
No, since I only saw him twice during war?   

BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	At Benaco, did you see Gacumbitsi kill anyone?
A.	At Benaco I didn't see Gacumbitsi kill anyone, but at a given place, I saw that someone was being killed and Gacumbitsi was there.
Q.	Which place was that, Witness TAS?
A.	It was in Benaco.  We were going back.  We had gone to look for firewood, and this was close by a cemetery.
Q.	Yes, so what happened?
A.	A man had just been killed there and he was buried immediately.  So we continued on our way.  We didn't stay there for a long time.
Q.	On that occasion did you see Gacumbitsi pushing this other person into the hole, into the tomb - - the grave?
A.	No, Gacumbitsi was there and he was monitoring what was being done.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, by your leave, I respectfully request that we go to page 6 of the witness statement; in other words, the last page of said statement.  

May I read that passage, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Yes, this is the last passage.  I cannot read out the names in there, because we may identify the witness.  So can you take the date of the 28 April as an indication on page 5 of the English text.  MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Please proceed.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Let's begin with that part of the sentence until the 28 of April 1994.  "When I left to seek refuge in Benaco in Tanzania, there I once again met Gacumbitsi who continued to kill the Tutsis who had taken refuge there.  I therefore decided to leave Benaco and went to Ruvubu" -- Ruvubu is spelt, R-U-V-U-B-U; Ruvubu -- "in Ngara province" -- Ngara is spelt N-G-A-R-A; Ngara.  "He would instruct his victims to dig their own graves before being killed." 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAS, were you the one who made that statement?
A.	Yes, those are my words.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, may we at this point in time go into a closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, are you on your last question right now, and then you would be concluded with your 
cross-examination?  Is that my understanding?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Or should I then continue so that we can then move into closed session to close?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may continue in open session.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAS, how many -- how much time -- how much time did you spend at Benaco camp -- at Benaco refugee camp?
A.	I remained for three months at the Benaco refugee camp, and it's during the third month that I went to Ruvubu in Ngara province where I stayed for six months, and then we were taken back to the refugee camp -- and then we were taken back to Rwanda, and I went to live in Kayonza commune.
Q.	So, in total you spent six months in Tanzania?
A.	I remained in Ngara for six months and I came back to the refugee camp, but before that, I have been living in the refugee camp.
Q.	When did you come back from Tanzania?
A.	I came back together with others at the same time as them in 1997.
Q.	You are saying 1997.  Witness TAS, were the refugee camps in which you were in Tanzania guarded?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber who was guarding those camps?
A.	The Benaco camp was guarded, but I wouldn't be able to tell you the names of the policemen and the security officers who were guarding this camp.  I am unable to do so.
Q.	Witness TAS, are we speaking of Tanzanian police or policemen belonging to the United Nations?
A.	I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't know whether they were United Nation policemen or whether they were Tanzanian policemen.  I would see the Tanzanian policemen and we knew that it was the Tanzania police who were ensuring our safety.
Q.	What -- were the policemen guarding the refugee camps?
A.	Yes, the camps were guarded, but at the time of our departure there was no security.  It was only later on that -- it was only at the begin -- at the beginning, there were no --
MS. MOBBERLEY:
We didn't hear the English translation, and counsel would need to pause before he has to ask his question once he received the witness's answers.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you please respect the request that we have already made that you have a break in between your question and the witness's answer.  We've already done that.  We've already asked you that.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAS, in what year did you go to Tanzania?
A.	I went to Tanzania in 1994.
Q.	And what month did the RPF soldiers enter Rusumo?
A.	I had already crossed the border, and I would not be able to say that I saw them enter the commune.  I just heard it said that it was in the month of April.
Q.	And you continued to say that in April 1994, the camps in Tanzania were not guarded?
A.	I say that the camps were not guarded because when we arrived the massacres continued.  I thought to myself that the camps were guarded once the killing stopped.
Q.	Witness TAS, when you reached the refugee camp, who greeted you?
A.	When I reached the refugee camp there were other refugees that had already arrived, and we settled in the forest, but later we saw policemen patrolling and there was a camp somewhere in Tanzania, but I don't know where the police camp was.  The camp was large -- the refugee camp, rather, was quite large.
Q.	In the camp, did you receive any food rations?
Q.	It was not until later once we were registered and we settled, three weeks after we had arrived, that's when we started to receive food rations?
Q.	Did you say that you were registered when you first arrived?
A.	We arrived and we were told that those who know how to read and write should write down our names, and that was done.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAS?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, may we now go into closed session for my last group of questions?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, how much longer would you need in closed session?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I need to go into closed session, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but how long will you need in closed session?  How much longer, would you know?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I don't know.  It will depend on the answers that the witness gives me.   Personally, my questions would take maybe 15 minutes, max.  If she answers the questions, then we should complete the cross-examination in 15 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we are now in closed session. Please wait a few moments before you put your last questions to the witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 49 to 51] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 38 to 48 by Haruna Farage)
































MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have a witness that would be ready to come and testify this afternoon? 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Yes, we do.  He has been here for almost the whole morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to resume at 3 p.m. is that convenient for all?  

Very well, we are going to adjourn now, and we shall resume at 3 p.m. with a new witness. 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
I will do redirect for this witness.  I am happy to do it at 3 o'clock; she has been on the stand for a considerable period.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Witness, you are still under oath.  We shall continue this afternoon with redirect led by the Prosecutor.  She will ask you other questions following the cross-examination led by the Defence, and it will begin at 3 p.m. 

Please enjoy your meal and we'll see you in a few moments.  
(Court recessed at 1225H)
(Page 52 by Haruna Farage)



















	(Court resumed at 1500H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing shall resume.  The Prosecution please, you have the floor. 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness TAS?
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Witness TAS, the Court is in open session.  So, again, I remind you not to give any information that could reveal your identity.  Do you understand me?
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	Witness TAS, in answer to a question by Defence counsel, you said that Mirabaja, Patricie, had died. 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, it is name 154.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, do you know about the circumstances of her death?
A.	I did not witness Nyirabaja's death, but I know that she was killed because of the ethnic group to which she belonged.
Q.	And to which ethnic group did she belong?  
A.	She was a Tutsi lady.
Q.	Witness TAS, you were asked this morning about the events between the 6th, the 13th and 14th of April 1994, you answered that soldiers had set up roadblocks; that they didn't stop massacres.  You further added that in Kirehe secteur massacres had begun, and in Kigina secteur, the neighbouring secteur to yours, there was a meeting held about which you were speaking.  Do you recall saying that?
A.	Yes, I do remember.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, Kirehe is the name No.109 on the list ,and Kigina is name No. 106 on the list.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Do you recall, Witness TAS, what day the massacres started in your secteur?
A.	Yes, I do remember.
Q.	What day was it?
A.	It was Wednesday the 13th.
Q.	Were you able to establish who the attackers were in your secteur?
A.	I could not identify the assailants.  I only could see those that attacked us just after the president's death.
Q.	Those assailants that you saw, were you able to determine their ethnic origin?
A.	In the first attack on the Thursday they, were Hutu and they were from the Nyakibande secteur.
Q.	During that attack, were you able to establish who -- I am sorry, I will rephrase that.  Following that attack, were you able to establish who the victims were?
A.	There was someone called Musa, he was the one who was killed very near to where I was.
Q.	Could you know his ethnic origin?
A.	Musa was a Tutsi.
Q.	Witness TAS, I want to take you to the events of the 13th of April 1994.  Defence counsel asked you what you had heard Sylvestre Gacumbisti saying while he was standing on the back of his pick-up speaking through a megaphone.  Before I ask you questions, can you clarify for us exactly what you heard Sylvestre Gacumbitsi saying?
A.	Yes, I can do that.
Q.	Please go ahead?
A.	At Nyakarambi when he was presiding at the meeting, the bourgmestre asked the people to look over at Rukira where the houses were ablaze, and asked the local population there at the meeting to be vigilant so that no one should escape.
Q.	What exactly did you think he meant by that?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the witness has answered this question already under examination-in-chief and under cross-examination, the witness has just answered.  And the re-examination -- and now the suggestion is being made to interpret the answer.  I don't think that is proper to proceed as such.  She already answered the question three times and now she is being asked to translate -- to interpret:  "Look at the flames at Rukira," -- "Look at the flames in Rukira, and he said, "Be vigilant, no one should escape."  This is the third time we have heard the answer, and now the witness is being invited to translate and interpret that answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, please answer the question.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	The questions was:  What did you think he meant?
A.	When I heard those words, I understood that he was giving instructions to begin the killing, as was occurring in the other communes.
Q.	At any time during that meeting, did you hear the Accused specifically discourage people from burning houses?
A.	No, Gacumbitsi did not specifically ask the people not to burn the houses.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I appeal to you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, I am listening.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, this is a bit bothersome to the Defence.  That question had never been asked and no house was burnt in the commune where the witness was, ever.  So we can check our notes all of us.  There was never mention made of any houses burnt in Rusumo on Thursday the 13th.  So why is the question being asked now?  Something is amiss, Madam President.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, if I may respond.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, rephrase your question as asked by the Prosecution.  We cannot accept it.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, this matter was directly raised by the Defence counsel in his  cross-examination.  He asked the witness this question:  "Wasn't he," meaning Gacumbitsi, "Asking the people to make sure that there would not be similar fires in his commune?".  

	Defence counsel has opened the door in his cross-examination, and I am entitled to re-examine on it by asking the witness whether she heard any specific statement made by the Accused.  The Defence counsel seems to misunderstand the purpose of re-direct.  It is an issue which was opened in cross and the Prosecutor is perfectly entitled to re-direct on it.  Now, in this case, he put a proposition to the witness.  He asked her to interpret what the Accused was saying.  He has asked her -- he has given here an opportunity to determine what she thought the Accused was saying, and it is up to the Prosecutor to ask her whether he expressly made any comment.  There no basis, in my submission, for the objection, and there is no basis for similar objections made by the Defence counsel when the Prosecutor is re-examining.  The purpose of re-examination is to clarify matters raised in 
cross-examination, and the Prosecutor at this point is perfectly within her rights to re-examine on this point.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence counsel, do you want to speak again?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, absolutely.  Trial Chamber asked us, I think it was last Friday, that we should conduct the proceedings in courtesy -- to continue the proceedings in a state of courtesy as we started, but really, as a human being, I can bear being criticised, but to be told that I said something that I did not say, I will react most vigorously to that with my last ounce of strength.  I did not mention that in 
cross-examination, and I don't see why the re-examination should be in respect of a matter that I did not raise, and I beg the Prosecution to be as courteous as we have tried to be since the start of the trial.  Every time I make a mistake, I am told that I don't know the proceedings.  But I must say, under your supervision, Madam, that one, two, three, four, five times sooner or later, is too much, and what I have been showing is courtesy towards the Prosecution.  I would ask them to do the same.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, for the record, the Prosecutor is taking a verbatim record of the proceedings.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, we asked you to reformulate the question.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, the question has been asked and answered.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAS, in cross-examination by Defence counsel you were asked about a hedge that marked the edge of Gasugama's land holding.  Was the hedge between you and the pit where the corpses had been stacked?
A.	It was not between me and the hole -- the pit.
Q.	Witness TAS, were you able to see whether Gacumbitsi had a clear view of the pit from where he stood?
A.	From where he was standing he could very well see the hole, because he was very near it.
Q.	How near was he to the edge of the pit?
A.	Maybe one yard -- one metre, he was very near the pit.
Q.	You said that you saw Gacumbitsi push Mukamwiza into the pit on that day.  Did you ever see her again?
A.	No, I never saw her again, nor her children.
Q.	Were you either able to establish what had happened to her?
A.	I only know that she died.  When we buried the others, I saw the clothes that she had been wearing on the day she was killed.
Q.	Witness TAS, you were asked questions in cross-examination about killings in Benaco camp, were you either able to identify the ethnicity of the victims?
A.	Anyone who wasn't much liked and who was called a Tutsi was killed.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, at this point, I would apply for a brief closed session to conclude my re-examination of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will now go into closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript (pages 58 to 59) was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have the floor, sir.
MR. KAREGYESA:
I am making an application under Rule 75B (ii) for closed session, and it is during the closed session that I will advance the grounds for the application because the grounds may compromise the identity of a witness, if given in open session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, have you any comments in response to the Prosecutor's application?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I just wanted to know whether it is one or two motions -- to hear the witness, and then the in camera session to make submissions.

For the first closed session, I cannot object as I don't know yet what -- it might be better if the Prosecution makes its submissions first.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, without divulging matters which might reveal the identity of the witness, can you tell us why you are asking for the closed session so that we should know, at least, approximately what these reasons are?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, we have done this before, and more specifically ,last week on Thursday, when we -- prior to hearing the evidence of  TAX, as a provision in the Rules.  I am moving this Chamber into closed session so that I can advance my grounds for the application to hear the testimony of the witness exclusively in a closed session.

The provision we made last Thursday is under Rule 75B (ii) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, My Lord.  In short, the application I will be making is that we stay in closed session to take the deposition of the next witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  We shall, therefore, go into closed session so as to enable the Prosecution to give us details regarding the grounds for his application.

We are extending our apology to the gallery.

Very well, Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed with your submission.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript {pages 61 to 63} was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
