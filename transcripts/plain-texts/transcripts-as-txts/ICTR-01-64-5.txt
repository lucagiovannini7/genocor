MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is open and in principle this morning we are going to proceed with the Defence in    cross-examination of the witness.  Before we begin I would like to ask the parties whether they have any motions or applications this morning.  If not, I shall ask Mr. Kouengoua to commence his 
cross-examination of the witness at the stand.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.  Good morning to the other parties.  Madam President, I believe Witness TBC was examined in closed session and as necessary his 
cross-examination should take place in the same conditions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, you are correct.  So we are requesting that the registry take the necessary measures so we are indeed in a closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall go into an open session now.  Mr. Prosecutor, the floor is yours.  You've announced Witness TAP yesterday for today's session; does that still stand?
MS MOBBERLEY:
Good morning, Madam President, good morning, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor is ready to call Witness TAP to testify.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the registry bring in the witness, Witness TAP?

	Good morning, Madam Witness TAP.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness, therefore, we shall call you -- refer to you as TAP, Witness TAP.  The registry shall now assist you in your solemn declaration and then you will be questioned by the Prosecution, cross-examined by the Defence and the Judges may also wish to put to you some questions in search for clarification.  

Thank you.  You may proceed for the solemn declaration, registry.
MR. JUMA:
Madam, would you please stand up, raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me. 
(Declaration made by Witness TAP in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Witness, and the registry officer.  

Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MS MOBBERLEY:
Thank you, Madam President.  This morning - this morning and in respect to this witness rather than presenting a Form II with her particulars, I think in my submission, given her evidence, it would be appropriate to begin with a closed session so that those particulars could be enlisted from her directly. (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 5 to 6] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, we are now in open session.  You may proceed.
MS MOBBERLEY:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP, the Court is now in open session; that means that the public are able to be present and your evidence is broadcast.  Please avoid making any comments or giving any evidence that might reveal your identity.  Do you understand me?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	In April, 1994 did you know the bourgmestre of your commune?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	What was his name?
A.	His name was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.
Q.	How did you know him?
A.	He would come to preside over meetings at Nyarubuye, and that is how I came to know him.
Q.	Other than presiding over meetings, did you ever see him in any other -- for any other reason before the death of the president?
A.	No, I would only see him on those occasions.
Q.	When you saw him, were you able to approach him, and speak to him?
A.	No, it was very difficult for me to approach him and even when you touched the vehicle in which he drove, you risked being jailed.
Q.	Why was it difficult to approach the bourgmestre; can you explain to us?
A.	Yes, I can explain to you.  If I were to compare the situation then and now, today one can even meet the president of the republic; at that time I did not feel at ease with the bourgmestre and I couldn't approach him.
Q.	Witness TAP, in April 1994 following the death of the president, do you remember anything unusual happening at Nyarubuye parish?
A.	Yes, it's the place where I lived.  And I heard gunshots and the noise made by a building which was collapsing.
MS MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, I would like to mark this part of the transcript for interpretation - for a review of the interpretation.  And I'm going to ask the question, more questions surrounding the witness's answer.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP, did you say that you heard gunshots, is that shots from a rifle or a pistol?
A.	I heard gunfire and there was an impression that there were buildings which were collapsing, and we thought that this was -- these were the buildings of the parish which were collapsing.
Q.	What was it that made you think that the buildings at the parish were collapsing?
A.	Going by the way the events started we felt that something was happening.  It was like something special was happening.
Q.	Witness TAP, you said you heard gunshots; where were you at the time?
A.	I was very close to a banana grove; I was hiding very near the house.
Q.	Witness, how loud were the noises that you heard coming from the parish?
A.	Very loud, there was a rumbling.
Q.	Were they shots from a gun or were they explosions?
A.	I could hear shooting and one could hear things like bricks falling, walls collapsing and projectiles, shells that were falling.
Q.	In the days following the explosions that you heard at the parish, did anything happen to you?
A.	Yes, the next day.
Q.	What happened?
A.	A group of assailants attacked me.  They came to where I was.
Q.	And where were you, Witness TAP?
A.	I was very close to my parent's home, below a banana grove.
Q.	Were you hiding alone?
A.	I was hiding with my mother; she was by my side.
Q.	Was she immediately by your side or was she close by you?
A.	She was very close to me at about seven or eight metres.
Q.	Could you see her from where you were hiding?
A.	Yes, I could see her and I saw everything that was done to her.
Q.	Witness TAP, what was done to her?  What happened first?
A.	I saw that a branch of a tree was thrust into her vagina and exited through her head, I saw that.
Q.	Did you see who did this to her?
A.	I could not identify them, but they were killers and I saw them.
Q.	When you say they were killers, what exactly do you mean?
A.	Killers such as we saw them at the time were people that were armed, who had spears, machetes.
Q.	How many attackers were there?
A.	There were about 30.
Q.	What happened when they first found your mother?
A.	As soon as they saw her, they forced this stick into her -- this branch into her vagina and it exited through her head.
Q.	Did you hear your mother saying anything?
A.	She screamed.
Q.	And after she screamed, what happened?
A.	The assailants -- the attackers came towards me.
Q.	Were you able to tell whether your mother was alive or dead at that point?
A.	She screamed and I saw that they had killed her.  The assailants grabbed her, raised her, inflicting atrocious injuries on her.  I don't think that in such circumstances she could still be alive.
Q.	Other than inserting the stick into her vagina, did they inflict other injuries on her?
A.	No.  The assailants did not inflict other -- any other injuries on her.
Q.	Witness TAP, you have told us that at that point the attackers came towards you.  Without mentioning names, did you recognise any of them?
A.	Yes, I recognised one of the assailants.
Q.	As they approached you how many attackers were there?
A.	They were many, but those that hit me were three.  When they came to the place where I was, there were many of them.
Q.	As they approached you, Witness TAP, were they saying anything?
A.	Yes, they were saying things as they approached me.
Q.	Were you able to -- were you able to hear what they were saying?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us what they were saying?
A.	Yes, they were saying that we hated them and that now they were going to freely take advantage of us.
Q.	Do you know who they meant when they said, "we", "we hated them"?
A.	They meant that Tutsi women and girls didn't like Hutu men and refused to marry them.  And they said that now they could do everything they wanted with us freely.
Q.	Witness TAP, are you able to tell us what happened next?
A.	They then immediately struck me and then raped me, and afterwards they thrust a stick of a tree -- a branch in my vagina.
Q.	When you say they struck you, what do you mean?  What did they do to you?
A.	They hit me to force me to sit down or to frighten me so that they could achieve their ends. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
They hit me all over, I think she said.
BY MS.MOBBERLEY:
Q.	What did they hit you with?
A.	They slapped me.
Q.	Do you mean they used their hands and fists on you; is that what you mean?
A.	Yes, they used their hands.
Q.	Witness TAP, you've said that you were raped; how many men raped you, was it one or more than one?
THE WITNESS:
It was more than one, but the person that I recognised was the last one to rape me because that one said words to me that I remembered.
Q.	What did he say to you?
A.	He said, "I don't want to kill you atrociously, your father appreciated me -- loved me -- likes me because I worked for him at his house".
Q.	Witness TAP, when you say "They raped me", can you tell us what they did to you?
A.	It is very painful, it is hard for me to say, so with your permission, perhaps I could write it down.
MS MOBBERLEY:
Can the registrar please assist?

	Your Honours, I think the most appropriate procedure at this point is to show you what the witness has written, ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to read it onto the record and then have it interpreted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I should nonetheless like to ask Madam Witness a question.  Do you have any objection to our reading what you have written on this piece of paper?
THE WITNESS:
You may read what I have written.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Therefore, please give the document to the interpreters so that they can read and interpret for us what is written there.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter will read first in Kinyarwanda the sentence, and then translate it. 

Translation:  They raped me, sticking their penises into my vagina.  End of translation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the interpreter.  

Madam Counsel for the Prosecution, please continue.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP, after you had been raped and after -- Witness TAP, would you like to take a short break before you continue?
A.	Yes, I should like to rest for a moment.
Q.	When you are ready to continue, Witness TAP, I'd like you to tell me. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you feel better, Madam Witness?

THE WITNESS:
Yes, we can continue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Counsel for the Prosecution, pray continue.
MS MOBBERLEY:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP, you have told the Court that the words that you wrote down are hard to say.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Is there any particular reason other than the fact that this happened to you, other than the fact that you were raped, that you find these words difficult to say?
A.	Things of that nature are not spoken of.  Our parents never taught us to speak like that; it was a taboo, which is why I did not want to say those words.
Q.	Witness TAP, after you were raped, did you stay in your hiding place or did you go somewhere else?
A.	I went somewhere else.  I went elsewhere.
Q.	What was your physical condition?
A.	It was as if I had lost my head, I'd gone crazy.

Q.	Witness TAP, answer this question --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the Defence is horrified.  I believe I stated yesterday that this procedure should take place in an open and honest manner.  Madam President, on the 4th of August I received a letter from the Prosecution about Witness TAP.  And I believe that at this stage there was nothing for me to do but to read this letter out.
MS MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, if I can just have a clarification, is Counsel objecting, and if so, what is the basis of the objection?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you please explain further.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely.  My learned friend on the opposite side of the courtroom wrote me as follows: 

"Dear Counsel, Copy made to the Judges of Trial Chamber III in the Gacumbitsi case.  Witness TAP has stated that she might have additional evidence to provide linking Gacumbitsi to sexual violence.  However, the witness has been traumatised and cannot speak about the events openly.  And as we are not fully informed of her allegations at this stage, we shall not lead questions in               examination-in-chief." 
"We shall not lead questions about this matter in examination-in-chief.  This additional disclosure is done by the Prosecution pursuant to Article 67(D) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Sincerely," dated 4 August.  

And today, contrary to all of our expectations, Madam President, the Prosecutor who had promised that they would not address measures that were disclosed are being lead into examination-in-chief, and this is actually what is happening. 

Madam President, Witness TAP should not have testified today.  You will remember, Madam President, and in order for her not to appear, we were -- submissions were made and we will have to come back about these submissions, but at the present stage, we wish to energetically object to this way of proceeding.  I don't know if, indeed, complimentary copies were given to the Honourable Judges of the Trial Chamber and to the Presiding Judge; if not, I can give a copy of my letter to the registry so that it can be -- so that you can see the document, because it says on my letter, at least, that copies were given for information to the Judges of the Trial Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, did you provide copies for information to the Judges?  I don't have a copy of the letter before me.
MS MOBBERLEY:
I did, Madam President.  You were served with copies -- or rather your assistant was served with copies at the same time you were on the 4th of August.  And subsequently a document was filed -- the same document was filed with the registry.  

This is a one-page letter from the Prosecutor to Defence counsel, copied to Ms. Talon and also to the Honourable Judges of Trial Chamber III.  You were also served this morning with a copy of the related and subsequent letter which I went to great lengths to explain to Defence counsel last night, by telephone, when he rang me and which I served on him last night.  Evidence of that service is his signature at the bottom of the letter, dated the 5th of August 2003.  

Do Your Honours have copies of both of those documents now?  
	(Pages 7 to 16 by Donna M. Lewis)









	1015H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
My colleague, Judge Egorov, has just handed me a copy of the letter of 4 August 2003 in English.  The letter of the 5th August was given to me this morning.  It seems that the letter of 4th of August is only in English.  Do you only give us an English version, you do not give us a French version; is that correct?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Yes, Your Honour, but I do have a French Version.  Defence counsel was served with a French version.  When he was given the English version that was interpreted to him, the contents of the letter were interpreted to him, and I subsequently had an official translation made in French to assist him.  The letters of 5th of August are in both French and English.  Mr. Registrar, if you could assist.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I have just received the letter of -- dated 4th August in French.  Counsel Kouengoua, 
Mr. Kouengoua, are you now raising an objection before the Chamber?  Is that the case?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you require of the Chamber? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I respectfully submit to the Chamber that the whole questioning on these matters be struck off the record, Madam President, Your Honour.  

Madam President, the letter of 4th August is one of unilateral commitment which the Prosecution is making for not examining Witness TAP in examination-in-chief.  The other letter refers to Rule 67(D) as does the one of 4th August.  And it says that we are obliged to disclose to you the evidence we have just received.  

Madam President, apart from the documents which you have received, Defence has no other document, and I repeat, no other document.  I have said, and I have a memo to that effect, we have received two letters in four copies in English and in French on the 4th of August, and the French version on the 5th of August.  And I think this is what I can say in regard to the acknowledgment of receipt of said documents.  

Further, Madam President, I do presume that the targeted Rule 67 speaks of evidence and any new evidence that the Defence or the Prosecution may come by subsequently, and each party would place at the disposal of the other, in other words, reciprocal disclosure.  

If the Chamber is of the opinion that the two letters of 5th and the 8th August constitute adequate notice of such; that would be fine.  But the -- Defence would say that this has absolutely nothing to do with the investigations of the matter before your Chamber, Your Honours.  And we believe that the examination-in-chief of this witness on this matter should purely and simply be struck off the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We - - Mr. Kouengoua.  

Madam Prosecutor, do you wish to respond to those submissions made by the Defence?  Do you wish to respond to the submissions made by the Defence, Madam Prosecutor?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Yes, Madam President, I do.  

The first points I wish to make are procedural.  It's unfortunate that in a forum such as this, it is necessary to correct misrepresentations that are made for the record; that the submissions made by counsel are incorrect and need to be rectified.  The Prosecutor served Defence counsel on the 4th of August after this proceeding adjourned for lunch with a letter, a copy of which you now have in French and English, putting him on notice that Witness TAP was traumatised, but had revealed to some extent that she had evidence implicating Sylvestre Gacumbitsi in sexual violence.  

At that point, her state of being didn't enable her to disclose the particulars of the offender.  The Prosecutor immediately advised the Defence, as is required, under Rule 67(D).  The letter was given to Defence counsel in English and the content was interpreted to him.  He said he understood what the letter was saying.  The most important aspect of that letter, apart from the information concerning new evidence, was the caveat, that as the particulars were unknown, the Prosecutor wouldn't lead the evidence.  

On the 5th of August, last night, when I spoke to this witness, she revealed the allegation that she has made today concerning Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, and that is, that he raped her.  I immediately advised Defence counsel and he assisted in this regard.  He telephoned my colleague, Mr. Karegyesa, while I was present and Defence counsel asked whether this witness would testify today.  I advised him that she would, and that we knew the allegations, the particulars of the allegations she was making against the Accused.  

In order that he would fully understand the picture, I located an interpreter who told him on the telephone that the witness had revealed her allegation of rape against the Accused, and that now we knew about the allegation, we would be leading it in evidence.  Elaborate arrangements were made to meet Defence counsel last night.  The letter was written in English and translated into French to ensure that he would understand the contents of the letter.  

You can see on the bottom of the letter of the 5th of August 2003 that Defence counsel signed the letter at the new Arusha Hotel at 8:30 p.m.  He told me that he didn't have his glasses and couldn't read it.  And I reminded him of our telephone conversation not an hour before where he had heard the information in French first hand.  He has since had more than 14 hours to read the French version.  

Addressing the law on this matter, Your Honours, it's the Prosecutor's submission that there is no basis for the exclusion of this evidence.  The Rules provide for ongoing disclosure and Rule 67(D) is the provision that was relied on for the disclosure of this new material.  It's clear that given the provisions in the Rules for ongoing disclosure, it is anticipated that new evidence may arise throughout proceedings and that that can be brought before the Trial Chamber.  

Rule 89(C) of the Rules of this Tribunal and, in fact, Rules 89(A) and (B) anticipate that this Trial Chamber can hear evidence, and may admit evidence which is relevant and which the Trial Chamber deems to have probative value.  

Further, the Rules stipulates that the Trial Chamber is bound to apply Rules of Evidence which bears favour - - a fair determination of the matter before it, and which are consistent with the spirit of the ICTR statute and general principles of law.  

It's the Prosecutor's submission that if there is any basis for Defence counsel's objection at all, it is simply that he hasn't had sufficient time in order to prepare his cross-examination, and that is a matter simply remedied.  Before almost every witness in this case, Defence counsel has requested a break, and there is no reason why, subject to Your Honours' ruling, he couldn't have an extra 15 minutes to prepare his cross-examination.  If he has concerns about the late disclosure of the allegation by the witness, then those are matters that are rightly put in cross-examination.  There is nothing to exclude this evidence from being put before the Trial Chamber.  The emphasis of this Tribunal is always on oral testimony of witnesses. 

In my submission, Your Honour, counsel has made out no basis for his objection to have the evidence excluded, and if he is simply requesting more time, then the Prosecutor would not object to that application.  That concludes my submissions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the Prosecution.  

Mr. Kouengoua, do you have a reply?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, but by your leave.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I am taking the Prosecutor word-for-word.  She wrote two letters, as I said, on the 4th and the 5th.  And in those two letters, she indicated -- she referred to Rule 67(D).  I think, for obvious reasons, she did not read that Rule, and I can do so, Madam President:  "If either party discovers additional evidence or information or materials which could have been produced earlier pursuant to the Rules, that party shall promptly notify the other party and the Trial Chamber".  

Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Defence, but I am speaking before the Chamber.  I have just received these documents.  You have just received these documents.  Reference is made to Rule 67(D), I don't think that I have been given any piece of evidence at all.  The Rules says, "Which should have been produced earlier; which should have been produced earlier".  Given the difficulty the Prosecution has had in using Rule 67, she has had to have recourse to Rule 89.  

But Madam President, Your Honour, you know that, as you have seen this morning, the Prosecutor is trying to put questions to the witness regarding a new -- regarding the conversation that they have had, something which we have not been notified of.  As for a protected witness, this -- this is information which should have been disclosed to us 21 days before the appearance of this witness, Madam President, Your Honour.  

And I have said before this Chamber on several occasions, I don't have anything against practice, but what does practice have to do with the law and justice?  You ruled that the information concerning this witness should be disclosed to me at least 21 days before she comes to the Bar.  Today we are been brought a letter and you are being told to consider such as additional evidence, which has been discovered.  I don't think that this is normal, and it's not even loyal.  The Prosecutor is reproaching me for having signed the letter at 8:30 p.m., but this is loyalty.  I was told that -- Witness TAP could not appear on the 4th.  The Chamber is being told, and I don't know why.  

Now, I am asking Mr. Karegyesa who I happened to meet, and I am saying what will you be saying when she comes there?  And in 35 minutes, I was supposed to leave the Court and I called him and he said that that was the situation.  Nothing was translated in the form of evidence, Madam President.  If it was translated over the telephone and I didn't understand, I should have been given the original.  That didn't exist.  The information which I was told of, of the extra interview with Witness TAP was not communicated to me.  So we have nothing tangible.  We cannot operate in this way, 
Madam President.  

Furthermore, the letter from the Prosecutor, I believe, I mean that one of the 4th -- that of the 5th, Witness TAP has disclosed to us relevant evidence against your client and it's not contained in her witness statement, and we are talking, indeed, about relevant evidence.  If this evidence is important, she should produce -- proceed as she has done before.  She should have documents which should transmit to us.  She has got important evidence and she is keeping it to herself, and this morning she comes just before the witness testifying with the letter. 

The procedure, Madam President, Your Honour, which is described in Rule 66, which deals with disclosure of materials.  Rule 67 also, concerning the disclosure the Prosecution needs to make, does not require that there are things understood without them being spelt out.  We are not looking for camouflage and we do not want to surprise the other party.  The evidence should be presented in a lawful manner.  

Madam President, Your Honour, this is the first time, I believe, that we will be obliged to question a witness before the Tribunal before knowing the background to her testimony.  Normally this person has already provided a statement which she signed and is with the Tribunal, and has been disclosed to the Defence.  I state and maintain, I reiterate that these two letters do not constitute additional evidence, Madam President.   

Given that, no examination-in-chief or cross-examination should be base on those two documents.  I was of the impression, and I did say that that was the case with the Tribunal that internal communications should be without any hindrance, it should be convivial.  But it was at night, I was tired and I was having this letter translated to me, and it was being purportedly said to be evidence.  

I am sorry, Madam President, Your Honour, I believe these two documents do not fall within the ambit of Rule 67(D).  And this is what we would wish to say in reply to the submissions made by the Prosecution.  Thank you, Madam President, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Having heard the parties, we are going to deliberate and we shall make our ruling in a few moments, and the parties shall be informed.  Thank you.  

The session stands adjourned.
	(Court recessed from 1045H to 1140H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.
Witness, we are going to put two brief questions to you.  

Can you tell us on what date you mentioned to the Prosecutor for the first time the rape that you are accusing Sylvestre Gacumbitsi of committing?
THE WITNESS:
I don't recall the date.  I do not recall the date.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
If you can repeat it, Madam President?  
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, if you would be so kind to repeat your question? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I asked if you could tell us on what date you mentioned to the Prosecutor, either to Mr. Karegyesa or Ms. Mobberley, the rape that you are accusing Gacumbitsi of committing?  Could you please tell us on what date you mentioned to the Prosecutor for the first time, the allegations -- your allegations against the Accused, Gacumbitsi?
THE WITNESS:
I no longer recall the date, but I can repeat to you what I told the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am asking you only about the rape, I'm not asking you about anything else.  I'm just asking you about the rape you mentioned earlier.  On what date did you mention this to the Prosecutor?  This could be either to Ms. Mobberley or to any member of the Prosecution team.  Was it today, yesterday, day before yesterday, three or four days ago, a month ago?  This is the question I wish to put to you.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Madam President, just to clarify for the interpretation, if you specify which rape?  The translation isn't clear, and it may assist if you could specify which rape.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I clearly specified the rape you mentioned - - this mention - - and that she is accusing Gacumbitsi of committing.  I am only referring to that rape; I am not referring to the rapes mentioned before.  I am referring specifically to the rape she alleges Gacumbitsi committed against her.
THE WITNESS:
I made this statement today in this courtroom, and this was a secret that I was keeping inside me.  That is why I wanted to write it down on a piece of paper.  That is why I wanted to make this statement here in this courtroom.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You had not mentioned it to the investigators that you had met previously?
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not mention this incident because it was a secret for me.  They were taking notes, and that's why I waited for the opportunity to be in this courtroom to make these revelations.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you finished, Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you for answering my questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber will therefore render a decision.  The Trial Chamber is aware that it is impossible for the Prosecutor to disclose information that it had no knowledge of, which seems to be the case -- which seems to be the case.  Therefore, the Prosecutor seems to have respected Rule 67(D) of Rules of Procedure and Evidence by disclosing as soon as possible the new allegations.  

Moreover, the Trial Chamber is aware of the rights of the Defence to obtain preliminary disclosure of all allegations that are going to be made against the Accused during the trial.  

In the interest of justice, the Trial Chamber orders that the full testimony of Witness TAP shall be heard and will decide subsequently whether or not the new allegations will be received and under what conditions?  Thank you.  

I would now like to ask the Prosecutor, Madam Mobberley, to continue with the examination-in-chief of the witness.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP -- Witness TAP, before we concluded, I asked you -- I was asking you questions about what Sylvestre Gacumbitsi did with the weapon that you said he raped you with.  I just want to clarify a few matters.  First of all, what sort of weapon was it?  What was it called, do you know?
A.	Yes, I know the type of weapon he used.
Q.	What was it?
A.	It was a club.
Q.	Witness, you have answered that the weapon was a club; is that correct?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter wishes to correct, it was a truncheon.  We apologise.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any objection?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, absolutely.  The witness has said just a club, and now she is being told the witness has just answered out loud, and this trickery has lasted too long.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please refrain from using such words.  I would like the interpreters to please clarify the point.  

Yes, was the word used "a club" or "a truncheon"?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, there was an error in the English booth.  The witness said "truncheon".
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness said "a truncheon".  You may continue.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP, what length was the truncheon that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi raped you with?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Perhaps you could repeat your question?  
THE WITNESS:
I think the truncheon was approximately 40 centimetres long.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP -- Witness TAP, when you say Sylvestre Gacumbitsi raped you with this police truncheon, are you able to tell us exactly what he did with it?
A.	It is very difficult for me to tell you this.  I would like to ask that I be allowed to write the information down on a piece of paper.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall now give the document to the interpreters so that they can translate it.  

Witness, may we be allowed to read out what you have just written?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
May we have the witness's microphone, please?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, you can read what I have written.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I will ask the interpreters to read what the witness wrote.  Thank you.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter will first read the sense in Kinyarwanda and then translate it into French.  I will translate into French now:  "He took the truncheon and put it into my vagina several times".
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'd like to thank the interpreter.  

Ms. Mobberley you have two documents that have been signed by the witness, the two documents that she wrote on hand.  Do you wish to tender the two documents as exhibits?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Yes, I do, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Therefore, the two documents are now considered Prosecution exhibits.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
The registrar could give us the numbers, please.
MR. JUMA:
Your Honour, the next Prosecution exhibit number is P10.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
If the first document could be numbered P10, and the second P11. 
(Exhibits Nos. P10 and P11 admitted)
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, with your leave.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the Defence did not clearly hear exactly what type of exhibit this would be.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We said that the first document is tendered as P10, and the second document is tendered as Exhibit P11.  

Ms. Mobberley, you may proceed.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP, as Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was putting the police truncheon into your vagina repeatedly, was it painful?
A.	Yes.
Q.	As this was happening, how did you feel?
A.	I'm not sure how I can explain this -- or express this, rather.  But I got to a point where I was hoping for death.  I cannot explain it to you in any other way.
Q.	Witness TAP, are you able to continue or do you need to take a short break?
THE WITNESS:
I would like a little break, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, how do you feel?  You can maybe take a sip of water, if you wish.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Could the registrar please hand the witness some tissues?
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP, do you feel you are able to continue with your evidence?
A.	If you allow me a moment to collect myself.
Q.	Of course.  

Thank you, Witness TAP.  

Witness TAP, whilst Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was raping you with this police truncheon, did he say anything to you?
A.	No, during the act he said nothing to me, but when he finished he said something to me.
Q.	What did he say?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness added that "He personally raped me".
THE WITNESS:
After he raped me with his penis, he asked me to leave so that I could be killed by the others.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Q.	Witness TAP, after you were raped with the police truncheon, did Sylvestre Gacumbitsi put his penis into your vagina?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How long were you in that room with Sylvestre Gacumbitsi while he raped you?
A.	Two hours.
Q.	Witness TAP, are you able to tell this Court what it means to be a single Rwandan woman who was raped before she is married?
A.	Yes, I can.
Q.	Please go ahead.  Just take your time, Witness.
A.	I would use myself as an example, from the time of those events.  I suffer a great deal as a consequence of those events.  I have many side-effects.  My periods -- my monthly periods last three months normally -- three days normally, but with me, they last a whole month.
	 (Pages 17 to 26 by Haruna Farage)  


1215H
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Are you able to continue, Witness TAP?
A.	I would like to have another break.
JUDGE EGROV:
Forgive me.  Do you have any more questions?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
I have questions concerning the identity of the Accused.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you tell us how long -- how much time you need for the identity, if that is all you have left, matters dealing with the identity?  You are not going to go back to these events, are you -- I mean, the rape incidents?
MS. MOBBERLLEY:
Your Honour, the only question I am left with concerns the ability of the witness to identify the Accused.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.
BY MS. MOBBERLLEY:
Q.	Witness TAP, are you able to continue for some final questions?
A.	Yes, you can put your questions to me.
Q.	Witness TAP, it is nine years since you have seen Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, do you think you would recognise him if you saw him again?
A.	Yes, I could recognise him.
Q.	Witness TAP, can you please stand up and look around the courtroom, tell the Court if you see the person you have referred to as Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	Yes, I have seen him.
Q.	Can you describe for the Court what he is wearing?
A.	Yes, I can.
Q.	Please go ahead.
A.	He is wearing spectacles.  He is wearing a black jacket, and he is also wearing a shirt and a tie.
Q.	What colour is the shirt?
A.	There is white in the shirt.
Q.	And what colour is the tie?
A.	It's a colour which is close to black, but my height does not enable me to see clearly the colour of the tie.  But I can also tell you that he has a broad face and he is beginning to be bald.
Q.	Witness TAP, can you describe where he is in the courtroom?
A.	He is seated to my left in the third row.
Q.	Is there anybody seating with him in that row?
A.	Yes, I can see that there is someone next to him.
Q.	What is that person wearing?
A.	That person is not wearing a jacket, he is wearing a uniform, a short-sleeved shirt, but I am not very sure about the length of the sleeves because the person is seated.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, do you required anything further?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, Madam Prosecutor, the Chamber will take note that the witness has identified the Accused in the courtroom.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have no further questions in direct examination for Witness TAP.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  Mr. Kouengoua, can you please tell the Chamber at what time you will be able to proceed with your cross-examination of Witness TAP?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I really don't see the time from here.  I don't know whether there will be adjournment at this point in time or not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is now twenty-five past twelve.  In principle, the lunch break is taken at 1 o'clock.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
In that case, Madam President, since the witness seems to be tired, we could have until the resumption this afternoon.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
I have no objection, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we thank you.  So, we shall adjourn at this moment and we shall resume at 2:30 with the cross-examination of the witness.

Madam Witness, you are still under oath, we therefore request you that you avoid speaking with any persons, especially regarding the matters which have been brought to the attention of the Chamber.  We wish you a good rest during the lunch break.
(Court recessed from 1225H to 1430H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Counsel Kouengua, are you ready?

Good afternoon, Witness.  Do you feel better?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Prosecutor is now going to cross-examine the witness -- sorry, the Defence.  Well, well.  So, the Defence counsel will now cross-examine the witness.

Counsel Kouengua, please proceed.
MR. KOUENGUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before we begin the cross-examination per se, as everyone has seen, the Trial Chamber has taken a decision -- I would like to take into consideration the decision rendered by the Trial Chamber.  The Trial Chamber decided this morning that it would subsequently decide if the new allegations made today will be accepted or not.

Madam President, Your Honour, I believe that a cross-examination can only be done properly if the Trial Chamber decides at this stage whether or not it accepts the testimony given by the witness this morning or not, and for the Trial Chamber to be able to render a decision, this is because the justice that is rendered by the Trial Chamber -- this is a trial which is part of the human rights international criminal law.

I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention and the attention of the presiding Judge to the fact that this morning the Defence raised a motion -- an objection, and in answer to them, 
Madam President, it was clearly stated by the Prosecution that as soon as the information was made available to the Prosecution with respect to the allegations of rape, we were informed of these allegations that same night.  Before today's date -- before the 4th of August, the Prosecution stated that Witness TAP had not fully stated what they had to say -- what she had to state.  And as far as I am concerned, 8:30 p.m. last night, at the new Arusha Hotel, I was informed of this, and the Trial Chamber was informed this morning that Witness TAP unveiled that she had been raped by Gacumbitsi.

The letter is before you.  This morning, Madam President, before you rendered your decision you asked the witness:  "Witness TAP, can you tell me when you mentioned to the Prosecutor the allegation of rape against Sylvestre Gacumbitsi for the first time?"

The answer given by Witness TAP was:  "I do not remember the date."

Presiding Judge:  "Did you understand the question, Witness?"

Answer:  "Could you please repeat the question, Madam President -- could you please repeat the question?" 

Madam President:  "I asked you if you could tell us on what date you mentioned to the Prosecutor for the first time, either to Mr. Karegyesa or to Ms. Mobberley, the rape that you are accusing Gacumbitsi, the Accused, of having committed.  Can you tell us what date the act was committed?

The answer:  "I do not remember the date, but I can repeat what I stated to the Prosecutor." 

Madam President, after the objection - an interruption, rather, raised by the Prosecution,
Ms. Mobberley, the presiding Judge asked again:  "I was referring to the rape referred to this morning, that she is accusing Gacumbitsi of having committed.  I am asking about that rape.  I am not asking about the rape mentioned earlier, the rape she is accusing the Accused of having committed.

"Madam President" -- this is the witness' answer " -- I made the statement today in the courtroom.  This was a secret I was keeping inside.  That is why I wanted to write it down on a piece of paper, and that is why I wanted to make the statement here in this courtroom."

Madam President, Your Honour, you have available to you two pieces of evidence that cannot be distorted in any way.  You have two letters filed by the Prosecution.  You have the answer given by the witness, one of the two pieces of paper where the witness wrote that.  It is very clear, and Gacumbitsi should know.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please conclude, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President.  When the Prosecution -- in front of the Prosecution and the witness, now I say that one of these two persons is lying, and as it's not in the habit of the Prosecutor, I think we should look elsewhere in the room.  I just wanted to very respectfully submit this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have no right to say that someone is lying before this Court.  I would like you to bring your speech to an end, but do not make comments of this type.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am sorry, Madam president.  It must have been a slip of the tongue.  I was saying that between these two statements there must be some truth, and I respectfully request the Trial Chamber to tell Gacumbitsi if it accepts the new contradictory statements -- accusations made against Gacumbitsi at the last minute so that Gacumbitsi should know, pursuant to Article 20 and any other provisions in the Rules, that state that the Accused must be aware of all the accusations made against him, otherwise this will open the door for people who will come into this courtroom to state anything that they please.

After this, Madam President, I shall sit down.  I have now concluded.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, you know, everything that you have said here, we were here when the witness answered our questions.  We know what happened in the courtroom.  We rendered the decision after the witness answered our questions.

We will stand by our decision rendered earlier.  We have rendered a decision and we have come this afternoon so that you could conduct the witness' cross-examination.  We have nothing further to say.  You now have the floor to cross-examine the witness.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am sorry, Madam President, Your Honour.  Is the Trial Chamber advising the Defence that they should cross-examine the witness on the new allegations made this morning?  We have a decision here before us, and it says:  "I will decide subsequently after the witness has answered all of the witness' questions (sic)."  That is why I made an intervention before I began.  And, I respectfully submit, in order not to be mistaken and allow the Trial Chamber to find out if the subsequent is now or later, and I am not asking you to return -- to change your decision.

I wish to apologise to the interpreters for the speed which I was speaking.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I would like to remind you that I have given you the floor to begin your cross-examination.  It is not for me to tell you what you should do.  The witness was led in examination-in-chief this morning and it is up to you to cross-examine the witness on what the witness said.  Is that clear enough for you, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS TAP
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Witness TAP, do you know what Gacumbitsi stands accused of?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	Witness TAP, you stated this morning that you knew Gacumbitsi.  Can you remind the Trial Chamber of the circumstance in which you know of him?
A.	Well, first of all, I knew him before the events that took place, while he still had a heart and before he turned into an animal.  At the time there were meetings, and he would chair the meetings in Nyarubuye and I would see him there.

Secondly, I know him as a killer, and he inflicted on me the behaviour I described to you this morning.  And this is how I know him.
Q.	Witness TAP, before today's date, before the 6th of August, 2003, on how many occasions were you interviewed?
A.	I don't recall, but I do know that I was interviewed.
Q.	Can you tell us who interviewed you?
A.	I don't know the names of the persons who interviewed me.  They just came and interviewed me.
Q.	You said this morning, in answer to a question put to you be the presiding judge:  "I do not remember the date, but I can repeat what I stated to the Prosecution.  Can you repeat this information?  Do you confirm this statement?
A.	I am not sure I understood your question, Counsel.
Q.	Witness TAP, it was 1:36 p.m. when the presiding Judge put a question to you, asking you when you spoke to the Prosecution.  In answer to this question you said:  "I no longer remember the date, but I can repeat what I stated to the Prosecutor."
A.	No, that is not what I stated.  I was referring to the secrets I had kept and I unveiled before you all before Trial Chamber.
Q.	Witness TAP, without meaning to pressurise, I would like to repeat the question which was put to you earlier by the presiding Judge.  It was I was 1:36 p.m. exactly;  "I was asking you if you could tell us when, for the first time, you mentioned to the Prosecutor, either Mr. Karegyesa or Ms. Mobberley, the rape you are accusing Gacumbitsi of having committed.  Can you tell us when this happened?" And this was your answer:

"I don't remember the date, but I can repeat what I said to the Prosecutor."
A.	I hadn't understood the question properly, but I asked for the question to be repeated.  But I answered the question.  If you would like me to I can answer.  You are speaking to me of people I do not know.  The question dealt with a secret I kept inside and I unveiled publicly in this courtroom.  I had kept this secret to unveil it before the Trial Chamber.  I don't know the people who you are referring to.  I never met them.
Q.	Witness TAP, the answer that I am reading to you is the one that I heard you say -- one that was written down by the court reporters and was given by the interpreters in four languages (sic).  But I can repeat.  Didn't you say this to the presiding Judge who is sitting across from you?  Didn't you say that this morning?
A.	That is not what I said.  I said that I wanted to unveil the secret in public.  This is a secret I had kept in my heart, and once I unveiled this secret I felt better.  And I have nothing to add to that.
Q.	In answer to the first question I put to you in my cross-examination, you said that you saw Gacumbitsi during various meetings.  Can you tell me what meetings you were referring to?
A.	Yes, I could try.  They were meetings organised by political parties and it was usually for that reason that he would come to Nyarubuye.
Q.	Witness TAP, didn't you tell the Trial Chamber this morning that you could repeat what you told the Prosecutor?  Do you at least remember having made statements?
A.	Yes, I remember having made a statement.
Q.	Could you give us an approximate date even, of the date on which you made the statements?
A.	I don't remember the date but I do remember the year.
Q.	Please.
A.	It was in 1998.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAP.  The 22nd of October of 1998, did you sign the statement?
A.	I don't remember whether I signed it or not, but I know I made a statement.
Q.	Witness TAP, can you tell us what your level of education is?
A.	I completed eight years of primary education.
Q.	Eight years of primary education.  I am not asking you for any names, but can you tell me the number only.  In l994, how many sisters did you have?
A.	Why are you putting this question to me ?  What is your purpose, can you tell me?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, just tell Counsel how many sisters you had in l994.  Don't mention the names.  Just tell us how many sisters you had.
THE WITNESS:
I believe I had four sisters.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, between you and me there is no interpretation.  The interpreter has just said as follows:  "I believe I had four sisters," - "I believe I had four sisters."  Is that the answer you gave in Kinyarwanda?
A.	That is what I have just stated.
Q.	How many brothers do you have, Witness TAP?
A.	Five brothers.
Q.	Witness TAP, should I take this to mean that your mother had nine children?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you know even if you make a mistaken, four plus five is nine, plus one; the witness, it is 10.  Can you count?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, with all due respect, I might have -- I am -- maybe that I should be careful indeed.  With the Trial Chamber's leave, I think that I am following a certain logic.  Maybe you could tell me later that I have made a mistake, but I was following a certain logic.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, put your questions directly because, otherwise, the witness is lost.  She doesn't understand.  That is why I am telling you, you must tell these things directly, in a straightforward manner.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
That is why I am saying, Madam President, and if she says, if I had done this thing correctly; five brothers -- four sisters and five -- four brothers and four sisters, that is what I wrote down.  Sorry, four sisters and five brothers, I believe that is what she said.  In any case, Madam President, thank you for correcting my arithmetic, but as she said that she believes that she only has five sisters; she is not sure and I am not sure.  And, can I now proceed, Madam President?
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Did your brothers live with you?
A.	Some of them lived with us, but others didn't.
Q.	Can the Trial Chamber be informed of how many lived with you?
A.	Two.
Q.	Did your sisters live with you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Witness TAP, were you the eldest in the family?
A.	I did not understand your question.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, cross-examination, just as in examination-in-chief, must comply with obligations, and as far as I am concerned, I am under time constraint.  You can see that the witness is doing everything she can in order to avoid answering my questions and time is marching on, and I just wanted this to appear -- to be noted in the record.

	1500H
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, where were your brothers on the 6th of April 1994?
A.	Two of my brothers were at home and two others were in Kigali.  One brother was a -- was in the army of Habyarimana's government.
Q.	Is he still in the army?
A.	I don't know whether you know where those armed forces are, if you do, that's where he is.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, at what point in time can contempt be determined?  I think this is the fifth time since I began that the witness is cross-examining me, deliberately refuses to answer my questions.  That's not acceptable.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, do you wish to say something, Ms. Mobberley?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, I seek a direction from the Bench that counsel stop marking the records with comments.  They are inappropriate.  If he has issues to raise in cross-examination, he should do so.  He is inappropriately twisting the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you tell us whether your brother is still in the army today? 
THE WITNESS:
	We do not know where he is. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	On 6th of April 1994, Witness TAP, where were you on that day?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness mentioned the cellule in which she was residing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please do not interpret what she had just said.
THE WITNESS:
That's not true.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have to be very careful because we have a protected witness, and if you ask questions which may reveal her identity, that will cause problems for us.  This is a protected witness and you know.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Madam President, absolutely.  Madam President, very respectfully, indeed.  

And before I'm preached at from the other side, when they say that the brothers were in Kigali, I shouldn't be told that "I was at home".  I'm not revealing anything at all.  These are things which came out in public, in the open during examination-in-chief.  I'm avoiding as much as is possible.  I'm trying only to go back to the questions which were raised in examination-in-chief: "Where were the sisters?"  "At home."  "And the brothers?"  "In Kigali."  "And yourself?"
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let me remind you that these questions were used during the closed session concerning the location of the witness.  So if you say, "Where were you" to the witness, she may reveal her address.  And, for instance, you could ask her, "Were you at home at that point in time?"  In that way no one will know where the home is, but if you say something that requires a specific answer, this will cause problems in the records.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Quite right mister -- Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	On the 6th of April -- please, Witness, don't mention the cellule, the commune or the prfecture -- were you.  Were you at the market, were you in your room or where were you exactly?  That's my question.
A.	I was at home.
Q.	At what point in time did you learn of the death of the president?
A.	I learnt of it on the same day, on the 6th.
Q.	At what time, please, exactly?
A.	Please, could you repeat your question, Counsel?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, ask your question again, you'll go much faster.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, that's what I was thinking.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	At what time did you learn of the president of -- at what it time did you learn of the death of the president, Witness TAP?
A.	I recall -- well, actually, I don't remember the time, but someone came to tell us that something had happened and was asking us whether we knew about it.
Q.	Can you give the name of that person to the Chamber?
A.	No.
Q.	Where were you on the 7th?  Witness TAP, please, I do not want details about the commune, the cellule and so on, or the secteur.  All I want to know is where you were on the 7th.  Because on the 6th you were at home, what about the 7th?
A.	I was at home.
Q.	And what happened on that day while you were at home?
A.	Nothing, apart from the fact that there were secret meetings held here and there, and that was something unusual.  And it was the Hutus who were holding those meetings.
Q.	Can you explain how you knew that there were secret meetings -- or, what do you mean by secret meetings?
A.	These were people who met together, who had no one to go against them.
Q.	Witness TAP, do you confirm that someone came to your home on the 6th to inform you about the death of the president?
A.	Yes, I do.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, the transcripts of the initial investigation at page 2 -- of the witness statement; I believe it's the second paragraph, we have: "On the day President Habyarimana died in a plane crash, which was 6th April 1994, I was in my family home with my five sisters, father and mother, while three other brothers were where they worked.  We were informed of the accident at about 8 a.m. on 7th April 1994 by our Hutu neighbours who were already furious". 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	What does the witness make of that statement?
A.	What I think?  Well, what I think is that I didn't make any mistake, it's the same thing.  Even computers can make mistakes, and you need to remember that the events took place a long time ago.
Q.	What happened on the 8th of April, Witness TAP?
A.	I do not recall the other dates because we were already traumatised.  We were only thinking of our survival.  We were not bothered about keeping up with the dates.
Q.	Witness TAP, if you continue to state that you don't know anything I'm going to ask permission from the Judges that I don't ask you any more questions.  I will move to a closer time.

Who asked you to come and testify before the Tribunal?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, counsel's comments are inappropriate.  He asked a question and the witness gave him an answer.  It's not appropriate for him to make these continual comments.  These are matters for you to decide.  Issues of credibility are for the Trial Chamber.

I am aware that he is marking the record for his appeal, but I would seek a direction from the Trial Chamber that he just continues his cross-examination, without the comments.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I had already drawn your attention to this problem.  You should put your questions to the witness, but you should avoid making any comments.

Now, if you have some intent, go ahead and lay it out on the table.  But it's not useful to tell the witness that if you continue I'm going to do this and that.  I think you should avoid this kind of comment.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the Prosecution is right, seeing it from that angle.  But now I'm saying, if I were to ask the question to the witness, "Who asked you to come to testify before the Tribunal today?"  That is not a comment.  So my question is: 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Who asked you to come to the Tribunal to testify?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, did you hear the question?  Can you answer it? 
THE WITNESS:
	I was asked to do so by the appropriate persons.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Did you meet them?
A.	No, I did not see them.
Q.	Did these people telephone you?
A.	I learnt of this in the same way as you did when you got to know that you should come and represent someone in this case.
Q.	Witness TAP, since you've been here in Arusha, have you gone to see a doctor?
A.	Do you want to make an appointment for me with the doctor?
Q.	Witness TAP, we were informed that you were unable to be in court yesterday because you were traumatised.  Can you please explain to us the nature of that trauma you experienced?
A.	The words you are speaking to me may traumatise me.
Q.	What happened in your family home on the 8th of April 1994, Witness TAP?
A.	I do not remember the date, but after the small groups of Hutus that we referred to, I remember there was a group of assailants, led by Rubanguka, that came.
Q.	And what time was that --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Because it was the 8th", I believe was the end of counsel's question.  His microphone went off momentarily.
THE WITNESS:
	Whatever the case may be I believe it was before noon.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Apart from Rubanguka, did you recognise anybody else?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Could you give us the person's name?
A.	It was his son known as Augustin Kabagema.
Q.	Who else?
A.	A former soldier known as Janvier Munyaneza.  He was on leave.
Q.	Who else?
A.	And another person whose first name was Alexis.
Q.	Any others?
A.	Vincent.
Q.	Any other?
A.	Athanase.
Q.	How many were they?
A.	They were not the only ones, those I've mentioned.  There were others, but those were the only ones whose names I recall.  They were many.
Q.	But roughly, again, how many were they?
A.	They were about 40 in number.
Q.	And what, in particular, did they do, Witness TAP?
A.	Rubanguka said that he knew us.  So they ran after the cattle that they were going to slaughter.  They were going to -- they ran after the cattle which they were going to slaughter.
Q.	And afterwards?
A.	When they left we dispersed, each one in his or her own direction.
Q.	And then?
A.	During the night I was able to find my mother in the banana groove.
Q.	And then?
A.	She hid in one place and I hid in another place.
Q.	From the place where you were hiding, were you able too see your mother?
A.	Yes.
Q.	During this hiding, where were your brothers and sisters?
A.	I did not know where they were because they had fled in their direction, and I do not know where they were killed.
Q.	Were you your mother's last daughter?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What happened to you that night, Witness TAP?
A.	Everything that happened to me happened the following morning.  It was not during that -- during -- it was not during that night.
Q.	Is this the new version or is this what you've always said?  

Witness TAP, please don't answer my question.  When you said you got there the next morning --
MS. MOBBERLEY:
-- now the question is being asked --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Please calm down, Counsel, I have already withdrawn my question.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
That is the clarification I was seeking because if it wasn't withdrawn, the witness should have had the opportunity to answer.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely.  That's why you should also be following.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	What happened to you, Witness TAP, the following day?
A.	Another group of killers found me.  They beat me and they raped me.  They inserted a branch in my private parts.
Q.	Is this the same group as that of the day before?
A.	I can't remember now, but there was one person who was in both groups.
Q.	And can you tell us his name?
A.	Athanase.
Q.	How many people raped you that day?
A.	I could not count them because they were too numerous, but the last one to rape me was Athanase.
Q.	Did you know Athanase before the occurrence of that odious act?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Under what circumstances did you know him?
A.	He had been a domestic servant at our place.
Q.	And did Alexis Suzi also work for you?
A.	No.  When I speak of people as knowing them it's because we lived together for some time, and those were the people that I could identify in the course of the attack.
Q.	Where did Vincent -- Vincent -- where did Vincent work?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Were the rapist of the 9th of April with Evariste?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
On the 8th of April.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know, but Athanase came with Evariste's group and he was the one that I could identify among them.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordship, page 2 of the witness statement in French, second paragraph.  The sentence begins with "dans ce groupe" -- "There were three of" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This is third paragraph in the English text, I think.  Third paragraph, last sentence.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
"This group included three of our workers namely; Alexis, Athanase and Vincent, armed with machetes". 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, among this group, how many people raped you?
A.	I did not count them, but I did recognise Athanase.
Q.	Do you think they were perhaps five or ten, amongst the 40?
A.	I don't remember how many.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please go on to something else.  The witness has stated clearly that she doesn't remember.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Very well.  I'd like to go to page 3 now, of French version of the witness statement; fifth paragraph of page 3 of the English: "That same night, Alexis, Vincent, all of late memory, and Athanase -- I do not know his present whereabouts -- attacked me.  The three raped me.  They arrived at 8p.m. and Alexis said, 'You despise us and refuse to become our women, now we are getting you free-of-charge.  We shall now get a taste -- get the -- get to taste Tutsi women'".  

"Before raping me, the three of them slapped me.  Athanase took me last and he said, 'I was going to kill you atrociously, but for the fact that your father liked me and he gave me a cow'". 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Is that your testimony, Witness TAP?
A.	When I stated it in those words it seemed correct, but the most important thing is to know what happened to me and that I know very well.  I'm not inventing anything.
Q.	And who penetrated your vagina with a stick, Witness TAP?
A.	I don't know his name.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, page 3 of the witness statement, French text: "But will" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel has not -- has not specified the paragraph.  Counsel has not specified the paragraph, excuse me.  

It appears to be somewhere in the fifth paragraph where it says -- the sentence starting "Athanase": "Athanase took me last and he said" -- (not interpreted)
THE WITNESS:
	I must tell you that it was some time ago.  Even computers make mistakes.  You can take my statement as it stands.  All I know is -- all I can tell you is I'm not lying.

BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	What happened afterwards, Witness TAP?
A.	I should like to have a break, please, so I can pull myself together.

	1545H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you feel better? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  We can continue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, pray proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, the branch you referred to, did they already carry it in their hands or did it -- they cut it from the shrubs or bushes?
A.	I would have known if I had been involved in their plans.  I don't know where they went to fetch that branch. 
Q.	As you were asked by the Prosecution this morning, can you tell us approximately the length?
A.	A bit longer than a metre.
Q.	What did you do after that, Witness TAP?
A.	After that I went into the swamp to wash. 
Q.	And after that?
A.	After washing, I went up to the road into the bushes by the side. 
Q.	And after that?
A.	That's when the Rusumo commune vehicle came. 
Q.	Can you tell us at what time you left the swamp?
A.	In those days, you couldn't tell time.  We were living like animals.  I don't remember what time it was.
Q.	Was it night-time or daytime?
A.	It was daytime. 
Q.	If it was in the daytime, Witness TAP, was it in the morning or in the afternoon?
A.	You can tell time when you wear a wristwatch, but for me it was early, because it wasn't dark yet, and it was during the daytime. 
Q.	You washed in the swamp or marsh -- you washed in the marsh during the daytime?
A.	Yes.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, page 3 of the witness statement, sixth paragraph:  "Around midnight I left and entered the swamps to take a bath".
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, at what time did you go to Kabesime's? 

MR. KOUENGOUA:
For the booth, the name has already been given and spelt out this morning.  I can repeat:  K-A-B-E-S-I-M-E, Christian name Spciose, S-P--C-I-O-S-E.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, on what date did you go to stay with this Spciose Kabesime?
A.	I don't remember the date, because we walked, but we weren't concerned about dates. 
Q.	At what time was it; in the daytime or at night?
A.	It was in the daytime.
Q.	Were you afraid then of being killed?
A.	Yes, I was still afraid of being killed. 
Q.	But if one is in hiding, can one move about in the daytime?
A.	It all depends whether there are assailants around or not.
Q.	How long did you stay at Spciose Kabesime's place?
A.	Four days.
Q.	You spent four days.  Do you remember that person's ethnicity?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was it?
A.	Hutu.
Q.	Did you find her at home?
A.	Yes, she was at home.
Q.	And what did she do?
A.	When she saw the state I was in, she welcomed me, heated some water and massaged me. 
Q.	And after?
A.	After the four days she also ran away, and I stayed there.
Q.	And after?
A.	The Inkotanyi found me there, and they continued to nurse me as the old lady had done, and led me to where the other people were.
Q.	And then?  You have pronounced a name I did not understand.  You talked about the Inkotanyi, something like that?
A.	Yes, I said Inkotanyi; yes. 
Q.	What is that all about, Witness TAP?
A.	I know that they were called Inyenzi, but today it is the army of the government. 
Q.	Witness TAP, this morning under examination-in-chief and in the course of this cross-examination, you have mentioned Evariste and his group.  On the 8th you spoke of Athanase and his group for the rape; on the 9th you just spent four days at Kabesime's; so we should now be on the 13th of April 1994.  Did the Inkotanyi come on the fourth day or some time -- considerable time later?
A.	I told you that the dates were approximate because we were asked to suggest dates, but I did not confirm the dates.  We were concerned -- anxious to survive.  We weren't paying much attention to what day it was.  Personally, I'm not absolutely sure of these dates.  They are an approximation. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAP.  Can you confirm to us that it was the Inkotanyi who took you away from Kabesime's house?
A.	Yes, I confirm that.  It was the Inkotanyi that saved me.  As soon as I saw them, even in the state I was, I felt there was a change, and it is the Inkotanyi who saved me.  It is thanks to the Inkotanyi that I am still here and alive.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't hear what counsel for the Defence said.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, my question is a very precise one.  I will ask it again:  was it the Inkotanyi who came to take you from Spciose Kabesime's house?
A.	They did not force me out.  They did not threaten me with weapons; that had happened before.  I saw them come, they took pity on me.  They didn't ask me any questions, they merely told me that they would take me to where the other people were.  They continued to nurse me, care for me, and I was able to recover.  Thanks to the care they gave, I was saved. 
Q.	Witness TAP, do you confirm before the Trial Chamber that it was after having washed in the marsh that you went to Spciose Kabesime's house?
A.	Yes, it was after having washed, after I met the man who had been bourgmestre of Rusumo, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  They left and they went to Isaie Karamage's house, and that's where I saw them.  And it is from Karamage's house that I went to the old lady, Spciose Kabesime. 
Q.	Witness TAP, you spent four days at Madam Kabesime's house, that's what you have told us today, and it was the Inkotanyi who came to take you out of there.  I'm asking you the following question:  who heated the water and bathed your wounds?
A.	I did not understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you confirm to the Trial Chamber that Madam Kabesime heated the water to bathe your wounds?
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	Do you confirm before the Trial Chamber that after Athanase wounded you with a branch more than a metre long, you went to the marsh to wash?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, did that come through?  All right.  Thanks. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is the way things happened.  But there is a question that you haven't asked me that I should answer.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	I have not finished with my questions.  Please allow me to continue.  I'm not like a computer.  We agree that none of us are like computers.
Witness TAP, was it the Inkotanyi that came to take you from Kabesime's house?
A.	I have already told you that it was the Inkotanyi that took me, but peacefully, not forcefully. 
Q.	Witness TAP, how many times did you seek refuge at Spciose Kabesime's house?
A.	On only one occasion. 
Q.	Witness TAP, when you told -- mentioned the word -- when you say that "The Inkotanyi took me to where the other survivors were located", can you tell us where that is?
A.	They were at the Nyakarambi refugee camp.
Q.	Witness TAP, did you leave that camp by yourself?
A.	I'm not sure I understood your question, Counsel.
Q.	Did you leave Nyakarambi camp by yourself to go to town?
A.	What town are you referring to, Counsel?
Q.	Witness --
A.	I met some of my family members and I joined them.
Q.	Witness TAP, from the day the Inkotanyi collected you from  Kabesime's house, did the Inkotanyi leave your region?
A.	I was not in charge of monitoring the comings and goings of the Inkotanyi.  What I do know is that they took care of me.  They took care of me, and took me to a place where others were located.  I do not know what they did after that. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAP.  After the Inkotanyi took care of you, were you subsequently injured?
A.	I did not have any other problems after that, aside from the fact that you might fall ill, but that is just normal.  But since that day, since the day I was treated by the Inkotanyi, I felt calm, I had an inner peace that I did not have before. 
Q.	Thank you, TAP. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, with all due respect I would like to ask you to go back to page 3 of the witness statement.  I am referring to the first paragraph.  What I read earlier -- I'm not referring to the passage about the branch, but I said -- "I bled profusely, then they dragged me to our neighbour's latrine, taking me for dead.  The neighbour was not there.  Around midnight I left and entered the swamp to bathe.  Then I went to the home of an old Hutu woman named Spciose Kabesime, where I stayed for four days.  While there, several persons launched an attack, and people asked, "Are there any snakes here?", and the woman said, "No".  Finally the woman fled, and I remained in her house because the RPF -- in parenthesis, Inkotanyi -- were fast approaching.  We could hear the firing -- shots being fired.  I stayed there for seven days before being rescued by the RPF".  Is this passage that I have just read correct, Witness TAP?
A.	There are some details that you have added, Counsel, but there are some things that are true, and there are other details that you have added that I ignore. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAP.  Madam President, Your Honour, are here; they have the document before them.  I have no shame, I can say -- if you say that there are things that I -- that I have added details, that is your prerogative. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, do you have the document that I have just read before you?
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, could you tell the Chamber what details I have added to your statement?
A.	I spoke in general.  There are some things that you have said which, in my opinion, are not a part of my statement.  When I was speaking, I was speaking in general.  Many words have been exchanged here, Counsel.  This happened a long time ago.  I want to bring to your attention that this happened a long time ago, therefore it is difficult to remember everything.  It happened a long time ago.  You should take my testimony as such.  I have nothing to add to it. 
Q.	Witness TAP, did you state before the Trial Chamber that you were raped and that a branch was inserted into your vagina?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you remember that this morning during examination-in-chief you said you could not answer the question because your parents told you these were things that you should not mention?
A.	That is what I said. 
Q.	And what you have just stated, is this still in the same vein? 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, counsel is mischaracterising the witness's evidence.  She has simply answered yes or no.  It is him who used the words in his question. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't think so, Counsel.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Can we mention the words that Defence counsel has changed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you tell us what words were changed by Defence counsel? 
THE WITNESS:
He spoke of a number of days I spent at Kabesime's.  He said I stayed there for seven days, when actually I stayed there for four days. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you followed, Counsel? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You referred to seven days, when she says she only went there for four days. 

MR. KOUENGOUA:
We are not on the same wavelength.  I read the statement to the witness; the same statement is before you.  Look at page 3, paragraph 1, of the French version, and you can verify this.

This is a statement that was disclosed to me by the Prosecutor as part of the exhibits to this case.  I have nothing to add.  And I thought the Prosecutor was going to tell me what I had changed in the statements disclosed to me by her.  I did not add anything, I did not remove anything, Madam President; nothing at all.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence -- sorry, Madam Prosecutor, have you noted anything that was changed by Defence counsel in the statements made by the witness? 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, my objection was on a completely different issue.  Defence counsel was questioning the witness on the use of words that this morning she wrote down.  He had changed his tack, he had changed his line of questioning, and he was saying to her that she was using phrases that today she could only write down, and in fact that is not correct.  It was Defence counsel who was using the word "vagina" and asking the witness to confirm or deny.  She was saying yes or no.  That was the point that I was clarifying.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I would like to thank the Prosecutor.

So it is on a completely different point, Counsel.  And she did not use those words publicly; it seems that she wrote those words. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, with all due respect, I was reading the witness statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Didn't you put another question?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
That was before.  The question was put to the witness before I read the witness statement, and I did not add anything or take anything away from the witness statement.  I read it as it was disclosed to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So do you have a question to put to the witness, then? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The only thing I asked, Madam President, was whether or not she recognises her statement.  That is all I asked her, does she recognise what she said.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
And did she answer the question? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, not yet.  She is saying that I added words that I did not say, and that's where we were. 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, I have the record here and can clarify exactly what was said from our verbatim transcript.  What I objected to was this question by Defence counsel:  "Did you state before the Chamber that you were raped and that a branch was inserted into your vagina?  Do you remember in cross-examination you said this morning that you couldn't answer the question because your parents had told you these were things that you couldn't mention".

Now, my objection is based on the fact that the witness herself has never used those words.  It was Defence counsel who used them, and there is no implication to be drawn from the fact that the witness has only answered yes or no.  He is now trying to say that this morning she was unable to answer whereas in cross-examination she has used those words, and that is not the case.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In any case, I think that we can proceed, since mention was made of both four days and seven days in the statement.  As to the words used by the witness, I believe that maybe we have gone beyond this point at the present stage, and I would therefore like to ask you to continue with your questions. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Madam President, Your Honour, I was with Witness TAP, we discussed the 6th, the 7th, the 8th, the 9th, plus four days.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, are these questions for the witness or submissions by counsel? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please answer the question, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Madam President, and with ease.  Maybe it is necessary to follow what Defence counsel is saying.  I am laying the foundation of my questions so that the witness cannot tell me that she did not understand the question.  I am just making sure that there is continuity in my question.

May I continue, Madam President, for cross-examination?  I cannot see the clock on the wall, but I can see that everything is being done so that I cannot complete the task that you have asked me to do.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I was saying that we had followed the 6th, the 7th, the 8th and 9th, plus four days and -- to Kabesime's house, and this brought us to the 13th, plus seven, that would bring us to the 20th.  And, Madam President, the RPF reached Spciose Kabesime's on the 14th day of April and saved Witness TAP --
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, counsel is making submissions.  He is not asking questions.  The witness said that she stayed at Spciose's place for four days, and then she said, "After four days she ran away, and I stayed there".  She has repeatedly said that she can -- and I have a verbatim transcript.  Question by Defence counsel:  "And after?" -- that is, after she saw the state she was in and she welcomed her, heated some water and massaged her.  "And after?", asked Defence counsel.  Answer:  "After the four days she also ran away, and I stayed there".

Now Defence counsel is making submissions on dates.  The witness has made it clear -- the witness has made it clear that she does not remember dates.  It is perfectly fine for Defence counsel to put questions to the witness, but it is not appropriate for Defence counsel to make submissions to the Bench, and that is what he is doing.  These are dates that do not arise from the witness's testimony.  The witness did not give any dates in her testimony.  If he has questions about her statement, he should put those to her. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you for your lesson.

Madam President, this is cross-examination, and I must continue.  I can see what is coming, but I must continue.  I must finish so that the Trial Chamber may be released and so that we do not waste judicial time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I told you to put questions to the witness.  Stop making submissions.  The witness did not give specific dates, so continue without you mentioning dates to the witness.  That is all we are asking you to do.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, thank you. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, after the RPF came, when did you meet Gacumbitsi?
A.	No, after that we did not meet again.  We saw each other before -- before I saw the RPF Inkotanyi..
Q.	Witness TAP, did you meet him before you saw Mrs. Kabesime or after you saw Mrs. Kabesime?
A.	I met him before I saw Spciose Kabesime.
Q.	Witness TAP, did you meet Sylvestre Gacumbitsi before you went to Spciose Kabesime's house?
A.	Yes, I met him before I went to Spciose Kabesime's house.
Q.	Witness TAP, after bathing in the swamp, is that when you went to Spciose Kabesime?
A.	Yes, it was after I had bathed in the swamp.
Q.	Before you bathed in the marsh, had Athanase injured you?
A.	Yes, he had already injured me.
Q.	And you stated before the Trial Chamber today and before myself that when you were injured by Athanase you went to the marsh to bathe, and after you bathed you went to Kabesime's house, who heated the water to bathe your injuries; is that correct, Witness?
A.	Yes, but before that I had met Gacumbitsi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you translate what the witness said?  I did not hear what she said.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness has just said, "Yes, but before that I had met Gacumbitsi".
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	In those conditions, Witness TAP, can you tell the Trial Chamber, between being raped - between Athanase and before going to Kabesime's, when you came across Gacumbitsi?
A.	After being raped by my attackers, who inserted a tree branch inside my vagina, Athanase was the last to rape me during the attack, then his friends whom I didn't know pulled me away and took me to a latrine belonging to someone who lived there and threw me there.  Subsequently, I came out and I went down towards the marsh and I went to the marsh and bathed there, then I climbed up to the small road in the bush and I hid there.  That is when the Rusumo commune vehicle arrived and I saw it.  Gacumbitsi was inside and there were three policemen.  

The vehicle came across killers that were wearing dry banana leaves and were armed with machetes and spears.  He asked them, "Why did Rubanguka do nothing? There is still much dirt."  He told them, "You must work and when you have finished join me at the Nyarutunga -- at the Nyarutunga centre."  The vehicle left immediately after and went to the house of the conseiller of Nyarubuye whose name was Isaie Karamage.  
I went down towards the house of Isaie Karamage, but my intent was to go to the house of the old woman, to the house of Spciose Kabesime.  When I came close to the toilets, that is, near the banana grove, someone spoke to me and asked me who your father is, and I saw Gacumbitsi.  I told -- I gave him my father's name and he told me, "Why did your father leave you -- abandon you?"  And I answered as follows, "I have not seen him in a long time and I do not know where he is."  That is when he asked me to follow him.  

We went inside the house -- inside Isaie Karamage's house in a room and I felt -- and I got the impression that he used to rest there, so he took out the weapon we spoke of earlier, a weapon used by policemen, a truncheon -- I am mistaken, first he took out a pistol and he told me that he wasn't going to waste a bullet.  He told me that he was going to kill me only with his penis.  He raped me with the policeman's weapon, with a truncheon, then he raped me with his own penis and when he had finished he told me, "Go, and others shall kill you."  

I immediately went to Spciose Kabesime's house, and when she saw me she shivered with fear because I was bleeding profusely.  She boiled some water and then she massaged me.  I stayed at her house for four days.  Subsequently she fled, and the Inkotanyi found me there.  They took me to the place where the other persons were and took care of me.  They did everything to take care of me and that is how the events unfolded. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAP. 

Do you remember whether this incident took place before or after the rumblings that you heard at the Nyarubuye parish?
A.	It was afterwards.
Q.	Witness TAP, can you tell the Chamber the distance between Karamage's house and that belonging to Kabesime?
A.	The distance was about a hundred metres or between a hundred and 150 metres.
Q.	Witness TAP, don't give me any names, just answer the question:  Karamage and yourself, did you belong to the same cellule?
A.	Yes, we are natives of the same cellule and the same secteur and of the same prfecture.
Q.	When the bourgmestre dragged you to Karamage's house were you on foot or were you in a vehicle?
A.	I went on foot.  I found him in the toilet and we left together and we went together into the house.  When we left, I thought he was going to help me and that he was going to be like my own father.
Q.	Witness TAP, was your first rape after the events at the Nyarubuye parish?
A.	Yes.  Yes, it was after those events.
Q.	Witness TAP, I hope you followed my question closely.  Was the first rape, in other words, that involved three people, Athanase, Alexis and Vincent, did that take place after the events of the Nyarubuye parish?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You left the marsh and you saw the bourgmestre, so where was the bourgmestre's vehicle?
A.	The vehicle was on the road, on the small road that I referred to; it was parked there.  I was by that small road.
Q.	Did you go to the responsable de secteur for protection or was it the bourgmestre who invited you there?
A.	I did not quite understand your question.
Q.	Was the bourgmestre with other persons at that point in time?
A.	Yes, he was with others.
Q.	At that point in time, was the bourgmestre already a killer as you referred to him a moment ago?
A.	That's what I personally saw.  Under the circumstances, he could have wondered what was happening, but when he met with the people who were wearing banana leaves, he said, "Rubanguka has done nothing and the filth is still there."  So I understood that he was still a killer.
Q.	Do you mean that at that point in time he was with other killers?
A.	Yes, they were together, and it's those killers who were armed; they were carrying guns which seemed to be guns made out of wood.
Q.	When you came to the vehicle, was Gacumbitsi inside it?
A.	Yes, he was in the vehicle.
Q.	Now, in relation to the vehicle, where were the killers?
A.	The killers came towards the vehicle and they were about eight metres away from the vehicle.  They were close to the vehicle.
Q.	Were they many in number, Witness TAP?
A.	Yes they were; they were many.
Q.	Did you also approach the vehicle?
A.	But I remained where I was, where I could hear what they were saying and I could see all their movements.
Q.	Since you are seeing everything, where did Gacumbitsi go with those killers?
A.	He told them to work, and when they were finished to remove the filth, to join him at the Nyarutunga centre.  I don't know what happened there, but those were his words.
Q.	And where did Gacumbitsi go?
A.	He immediately left and he went to the house of -- the Nyarubuye secteur using the small road.
Q.	Witness TAP, when Gacumbitsi said "Clean up," did he mean that your secteur was very dirty or what was the meaning of his words?
A.	He meant that all the Tutsis should be killed and that none should be left alive in that secteur because it was the Tutsis who were being sought.
Q.	At that time were you a Tutsi?
A.	Yes, and I am still a Tutsi.  I haven't changed; nothing has changed.
Q.	Knowing that these were killers who were looking for Tutsis, how did you allow yourself to go into the house of a killer?
A.	I went there because he was my father's friend and I thought that he -- when he saw me he would have pity on me.  In fact, he did have pity on me.  When I got to his home he didn't have any problem, as far as I could tell.
Q.	Witness, when you say, "When you got to his house" to whom are you referring?
A.	When I got to Spciose Kabesime's house, because it was very close.  She was a Hutu.  When I went to her home she washed me and she did what I had described to you, and this she did for me.
Q.	Witness TAP, who was your father's friend?
A.	Even Gacumbitsi was his friend and the others, they would share everything without any problem.
Q.	And to whose house did you go?  You said you went to his house because he was my father's friend.  To whom were you referring in that sentence?
A.	I told you that I went to Kabesime's house because she was my parents' friend.
Q.	Witness TAP, where did Gacumbitsi rape you?
A.	We were in Karamage, Isaie's house, conseiller of Nyarubuye secteur.
Q.	Was the conseiller at his house?
A.	No, not even the children.  There was the vehicle which was parked in the courtyard and the policemen were on board at that vehicle.
Q.	Witness TAP, what vehicle are you referring to being in front of a house?
A.	The Rusumo commune vehicle.
Q.	Was it in that vehicle that Gacumbitsi was?
A.	I've told you that there were policemen in the vehicle. Gacumbitsi was with me in the room.
Q.	Witness TAP, you have just told me that the -- Gacumbitsi's vehicle was parked on the road and he went on the small road to Karamage's house, the conseiller?
A.	No, allow me to repeat what I said so that you can understand me better.
Q.	Witness TAP, did you find Gacumbitsi at the house of conseiller Isaie Karamage?
A.	I found him in the toilet.  You see it's as if you were somewhere and you were going to the toilet.  What I did was to go towards the toilet, but I was on the road to Kabesime's, and when I found him at the toilet, he asked me who my father was and I gave him my father's name.
Q.	Witness TAP, did you know conseiller Karamage before?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	Was he Hutu?
A.	Yes, he was a Hutu.
Q.	And was he part of the group of killers?
A.	Yes.
Q.	The toilets of conseiller Karamage, were they within a compound?
A.	No, the toilet was built below the kitchen.
Q.	Could you tell us how many metres the toilet was from the house?
A.	About five metres.
Q.	Five metres.  

Witness TAP, look at me please.  How far away am I from you?
A.	I would know that if I were to be able to measure the distance.
Q.	Witness TAP, did you measure the distance between the toilet and the conseiller's house?
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
(Microphone not on) -- question.  For the record, I understand the witness said, "I could only be exact if I measured."  

And this is an appropriate time again to note that the interpretation in Kinyarwanda should be made available so that we can check it for the record.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness said -- the interpreter interpreted what the witness said. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand you Mr. Interpreter.  You may proceed, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP, you have just stated a moment ago that there was no one in the house of responsable of the secteur.  Can you confirm that statement?
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.
Q.	Is it the policemen who came to arrest you from where you had been hiding down below?
A.	No, the policemen never arrested me, they remained where they were.
Q.	So, how did you manage to get into Karamage's -- the conseiller's room?
A.	It was not Karamage's house -- room.  I didn't go into Karamage's room; I went into that room which was apparently reserved for Gacumbitsi where he was probably resting in transit.  That's the impression I had.
Q.	How did you manage to get into that room?
A.	I didn't do anything.  I thought that I was going to be saved.  I didn't have any specific objective, and when I got in there he did what he did.  I didn't have anything else to do. 
Q.	Witness TAP, can you tell the Chamber how you entered that room?  How did you get into that room?
A.	He told me "Let's go."  That's when I met him at the toilet. We left and I was happy.  I thought that I was going to be rescued, whereas -- or that I was going to be taken to his home so that I could be a servant.  That's what I was thinking.  When we got in, he did what he did and that's what happened.
Q.	Witness TAP, at that point in time, were your wounds caused by Athanase, had they already healed?
A.	No, I hadn't been treated, rather I had met someone who worsened the nature of my wounds.
Q.	Do you mean to say that when you were going towards the conseiller's house you were bleeding abundantly, profusely?
A.	I was no longer bleeding.
Q.	Before you went to the conseiller's house, had you been treated after the incident with that branch?
A.	No, I hadn't received any treatment but I was not bleeding.
Q.	Witness TAP, had you been wounded?  Were you wounded by Athanase?
(Pages 51 to 56 by Judith Baverstock)





























	1700H
A.	All of these people who raped me, wounded me.
Q.	Was it the same day that you were wounded by Athanase that you went to the house of the conseiller?
A.	Yes, it was the same day.
Q.	Was it in the afternoon, in the morning or at night?
A.	We were no longer in a position to estimate the time.  We saw the day, we saw night fall and that was all we could distinguish between night and day, but I saw that it was in the daytime.
Q.	You said, Witness TAP, that you knew the conseiller before; did he have family?
A.	Yes, he had a family.
Q.	Do you mean that at that moment there was no member of his family present?
A.	No one.  I told you that there was no one except the policeman who was sitting on the parked vehicle.
Q.	According to you had the policeman come to arrest the conseiller?
A.	No, I don't know what their plans were.
Q.	Was the conseiller a Hutu or a Tutsi?
A.	He was Hutu.
Q.	And Gacumbitsi had the keys to his house?
A.	It appeared to me that he had keys because he seemed to be someone who knew the house very well.
Q.	Witness TAP, is it when you came up to the house that he took out the keys or when you got there was everything already open, wide open?
A.	The doors to the house were already opened and he went into the room.
Q.	Do you remember what Gacumbitsi did?
A.	I could remember.
Q.	Was it Gacumbitsi who found you in Karamage's toilet -- was it he that found you there or was it you that found him?
A.	It is I who found him there.
Q.	Witness TAP, does the toilet have a door?
A.	There was a mattress -- a straw mat that was used as a door.
Q.	How did you get away from Karamage's?
A.	I went on my way to Kabesime, the old lady who was my initial destination.
Q.	Witness TAP, can you estimate all of the injuries that were inflicted upon you in the course of that long day?
A.	If you had lived through the same experiences as I, you might know better and then I could describe them to you; you'd understand.
Q.	How many children did Karamage have, Conseiller Karamage?
A.	I don't know how many children he had, but he did have children.
Q.	You've just told us that you were in the habit of going to his house; for what purpose?
A.	No, I never told you that I went there often.  He was someone I knew because I saw him pass and I would see him at the secteur offices, that was all.  And I saw his wife at church, as well as his children.  I didn't go to their house, but I did know where they lived.
Q.	Witness TAP, are you telling the Trial Chamber that it was Gacumbitsi that you followed there that day?
A.	Why would I have followed Gacumbitsi?  It is him who told me to follow him and I thought he was going to save me, that is why I followed him, otherwise I had no other reason to follow him.
Q.	Witness TAP, did you find Gacumbitsi in the toilet at Karamage's house or was it somewhere else before?
A.	I told you that when I met him he was coming out of the toilet.  You do go to the toilet, don't you?  And when you go to the toilet you come out and you go back to where you were, that is what he was doing.  I saw him come out of the toilet going back towards the house where he had been before going  to -- 
Q.	And it was as he came out of the toilet that your paths crossed, that you met?
A.	No.  No, the path I was on passed the toilet.  And when I got as far as the toilet I saw him as he was coming out of the toilet.
Q.	Are these public toilets?
A.	It is a toilet.  It was Karamage's toilet and I suppose he was going there as a visitor, as a visitor he was going to use the toilet.
Q.	And in what capacity were you going there?
A.	Where -- I wasn't -- didn't go there deliberately.  He was an authority and it was a miracle, I thought he was going to save me and I followed him.  It was, in fact, the first time we were talking face-to-face, he and I.
Q.	(No translation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English booth did not catch the honourable counsel's question.  If counsel - well -- the answer --
THE WITNESS:
I was passing there on my way to Kabesime's house.
MS MOBBERLEY:
The English booth indicated they did not interpret counsel's question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you've heard what counsel for the Prosecution has pointed out to us that that question did not get through.  And I myself should like to take this opportunity to warn you again about the questions.  When do you plan to finish your cross-examination?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordship, I think I have shown my availability to -- this morning, I              cross-examined the witness in one minute  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Defence, I asked you a very simple question:  How long will your cross-examination last.  You can either say 20 minutes or say you don't know, but you don't need to give lengthy explanations.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
It is because in the present situation -- state of affairs, I cannot answer. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAP.  Did you see the bourgmestre when the vehicle had stopped or when it was still moving?
A.	When I saw him the first time the vehicle had stopped.
Q.	And the second time was when counsel asked?
A.	The second time I saw him was when I saw him outside the toilet.
Q.	Could you identify any of the three policemen that were with him?
A.	I identified the two policemen.
Q.	Can you give us their names?
A.	One was called Kazoba, the other was called Berakumenyo.
Q.	How do you know their names?
A.	When they came to run the meetings either for political parties or for ordinary meetings where instructions were given he would come with them, and we were used to seeing them.
Q.	Witness TAP, of you, the bourgmestre or the policemen, who left that residence last? 
Q.	I did not understand your question.
Q.	Of you, the bourgmestre and the policemen, who was last to leave that residence?
A.	I don't know what happened after I left because I left them there, and I don't know what they did thereafter.
Q.	Can you tell us -- can you tell us how Gacumbitsi was dressed?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And how was he dressed?
A.	He was wearing a long-sleeved beige suit, khaki suit. 
Q.	And -- is that all?
A.	That is all I saw.
Q.	And from where did he draw the gun with which he threatened you; was it under the pillow, was it in his pocket, was it in his shirt?
A.	I saw him take it out from the inside pocket of his shirt.
Q.	Witness TAP, the French interpreter said that you took the pocket out of -- out of his shirt pocket.  Is that what you said in Kinyarwanda?
A.	Yes, inside -- yes, I saw him take the pistol out of inside, from inside he drew it.
Q.	Witness TAP, while he was drawing this pistol out and for  -- and the whole scene, were you watching him?
A.	Yes, I was watching him.
Q.	What did you notice of significance?
A.	That pistol that I didn't know about and what he did to me was the first time -- first he raped me with the truncheon and then with his own penis, that made me think that really we had all become animals.  No human could do that.
Q.	Witness TAP, after that, when did you see Gacumbitsi?
A.	After that incident at Karamage's I never saw him again; it is only here in this Trial Chamber that I saw him again.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, last page, last paragraph but one, penultimate paragraph of the statement - of the witness statement:  

"I would like to add that I saw bourgmestre Gacumbitsi riding passed in a white double-cabin Hilux, conveying three policemen from Rusumo commune.  He stopped in our cellule -- three dots -- for approximately" -- there are no dots in the English.  Oh, he is explaining to the typists that these three dots replace a name that he can't mention because it is a protected witness.  There are no name and no dots in the English.  

"-- for approximately one hour.  I heard him say, 'What has Isaie done?  Elsewhere, they have already worked, they have cleaned up, mopped up and nothing is left.  And you, what have you done?'  The people said, 'We have worked, there is no one left.'  The bourgmestre then ordered the Interahamwe to assemble.  He said  'Come along, we shall meet at the centre. I neither saw nor heard what transpired at the centre which was too far away." 

Witness TAP, what do you say about this statement?
MS MOBBERLEY:
Your Honour, this is not the proper way to impeach the witness.  There is no inconsistency in the statement.  If Counsel has an issue he wishes to raise, he should put it directly to the witness.  If he thinks there is an inconsistency, he should identify it and ask her to explain.  She has been over and over and over this evidence.  She has been in the stand for nearly three hours without a break.  

There is nothing in this paragraph that is an inconsistency with what she has said.  If Counsel believes there is an inconsistency, can he put it to her concisely?  But at this point, Your Honours, I apply for, at least, a break for the witness because it is simply too long for any witness to be in the stand without having some sort of respite.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you got much longer?  I asked you the question before, you didn't give me an answer.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I think that in about 20 or 30 minutes I would have finished, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I should like to ask the interpreters, can we continue for a few minutes.  Thank you for being available.  

Counsel, I would like now to ask you, invite you to make your questions precise and concise.  What you have read out now, she said it several times; if there are contradictions, point them out.  You said this on one day, said this on another day, fine, but do not continue with repeating over and over and over the same things.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, do you know Gacumbitsi's ethnicity?
A.	No, I don't.
Q.	The question could be asked otherwise; is he a Tutsi or Hutu?
A.	I don't know, but he is a person with whom you perhaps have close contacts, but there was no close connection between he and I.
Q.	Among the killers that you named yesterday and today, were there any Tutsis?
A.	I spoke of the killers that I had met.  There was no sign by which you could identify them as Tutsi.  I merely saw that they were human beings.  I didn't ask them for their ID cards, identity cards to determine if they were Hutu or Tutsi. But what I do know is at that time that the Hutus were hunting down the Tutsis.
Q.	To your knowledge, did Gacumbitsi pursue any Tutsi?
A.	From what I saw, the Tutsi would have survived if he had done anything for it -- had said anything for it.  The Tutsi would not have been killed, by which I mean that in all of Rusumo commune if he had discouraged that, nothing would have happened.
Q.	Did you see Gacumbitsi personally cause the death of anyone in Rusumo commune?
A.	I said that in general what he did to me.  I did not say that I saw him kill anyone, shoot them or hack them with a machete.  I was talking about what he did to me.
Q.	Witness TAP, how old were you at the time?
A.	I was 21 years old.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, I have finished.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  
Madam Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any additional questions for the witness?
MS MOBBERLEY:
I do have questions and re-examination, Madam President.  I'm concerned though at the length of time that the witness has been in the stand. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can Counsel please repeat?
MS MOBBERLEY:
I have been asked to repeat my comment, Madam President.  I said, I do have questions in              re-examination of the witness.  I am concerned about the length of time that she has been in the stand.  
	(Pages 57 to 62 by Donna M. Lewis)

























	1730H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you consider that you have many questions to ask and the witness is tired, we could, of course, adjourn until later.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Madam President, do you mean later today or tomorrow?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am not talking of today any more.  I think it will have to be tomorrow because we would have to release people, they have been also working many hours.  Normally we do adjourn at 5 p.m., and it is 5:30.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
I think the most appropriate course of action is to proceed tomorrow morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You wanted to say something, Counsel for Defence, the argument that --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Certainly, Madam President.  The argument -- the submission by the Prosecution is that the witness is tired, but the witness has said nothing.  

I should like to remind the Prosecution -- Madam Prosecutor, that Mr. Karegyesa told us that -- he asked the Trial Chamber's permission for Thursday and Friday not to have hearings, because he has other matters to attend for -- in the Cyangugu case, and I think we agreed to his request.  I should like the Prosecution to pay better attention.  Thank you, Madam Chairman -- Madam President.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Madam President, my learned friend, Mr. Karegyesa, in fact, said that he would apply for the adjournment once the Prosecution witnesses had concluded this week, and that is indeed what we'll do.  At this point we have a representative of WVSS present, Witness and Victim Support Services, who is -- who has indicated to me that it is not appropriate for witnesses to continue under questioning for extended periods of time without a break, especially when we have a witness who has given evidence of the nature that she has given, and who had been under extensive cross-examination today.  

I am happy to proceed tomorrow morning, and I believe that is the most appropriate course of action.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In view of the fact that everyone is tired, and we've gone well beyond our time limit, we will resume tomorrow morning.  

In any case, we were supposed to hold hearings the whole week.  It's true that Mr. Karegyesa has requested those two days to prepare himself.  I suppose this will not prevent him from preparing himself.  So, we shall adjourn now and resume tomorrow at 8:45, quarter to nine for re-examination.  I thank you all.
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
