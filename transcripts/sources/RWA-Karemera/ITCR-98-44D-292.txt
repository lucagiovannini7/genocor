MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.

And before we proceed with the testimony of the witness, can we have the appearance of the parties, starting with the Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance of the Prosecutor is as follows:  Mr. Paul Ng'arua, the senior trial attorney; Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Efrem Mutashya, language assistant; and two interns, Jamet Marion and Igor Barilik.  

Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MS. LEBLANC: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence today is composed by Mr. Courcelle-Labrousse; Mr. Larochelle; Callixte Nzabonimana; and our investigator, Celestin Kakango.  

Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and you, Madam.  
MS. LEBLANC: 
Nathalie Leblanc.  I'm the legal assistant for the team.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you forgot yourself.  

Yes, Witness, good morning.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
	The Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the solemn declaration you made and that you will continue to testify, bearing in mind that declaration.  We also take this opportunity to remind you of all the briefings we have given you during the course of your testimony and urge you to bear them in mind.  Is that okay, Witness? 
THE WITNESS: 
I have understood you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Madam, we are in open session. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Madam President, I would request that we get into a closed session for now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, could you arrange for a closed session, please?

	(Court resumed at 1153H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are presumed.  

There were some pending documents from the Prosecution side.  Are you ready to tender the documents, Counsel?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  When T24 was testifying, we attempted to produce the Kiyumba Gacaca document, and counsel for the Defence objected and it was deferred for him to go through and satisfy himself that the document is in order.  He has since informed us that the document is in order and has withdrawn his objection.  This is document number 13 on our folder for T24.  May I, therefore, produce this document and the attached motivation which was served to the Defence on the 27th of April 2010?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, before the Defence confirms what you have stated, Learned Counsel, are there any dates on those documents, the motivation and the Gacaca proceedings?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, My Lord, the motivation has an amended dated reading, 3rd May 2010, the previous date was 
27th April 2010.  And the Gacaca document is number 13 on our folder, and it refers to the Kiyumba trial of 23rd of September 2008.  
 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel. 
MS. LEBLANC: 
The Defence doesn't have any objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, perhaps we should go into a short closed session.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 30 to 32] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Page 29 by Haruna Farage) 





(Court resumed at 1515H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed, and the Trial Chamber will begin by delivering an oral ruling.  

This is an oral decision in respect of the right of audience of Ms. Nathalie Leblanc.  

During the proceedings today, the Defence proposed to allow Ms. Nathalie Leblanc, a legal assistant for the Defence of the Accused, Callixte Nzabonimana, to conduct the examination-in-chief of 
Witness T27.  

When questioned by the Trial Chamber regarding the capacity of Ms. Leblanc to examine a witness in these proceedings, co-counsel for the Accused submitted that she is a licensed lawyer and is duly registered on the list of Defence counsel who may appear before the Tribunal.  

Co-counsel further informed the Chamber that lead counsel for the Defence had delegated the
task of examining this witness to Ms. Leblanc, and that such delegation was within his authority as 
lead counsel.  

When questioned by the Trial Chamber whether such a delegation was in conformity with Article 15 of the directive on the assignment of Defence counsel, co-counsel responded that the article in question was not prohibitive and that no specific rule prohibited lead counsel from delegating the conduct of the defence to other members of the Defence team.  

Co-counsel further argued that the practice of allowing legal assistants to examine witnesses has been allowed by other international tribunals and that he, himself, was permitted to examine a witness while acting as a legal assistant in a prior case before this Tribunal.  

He also noted that the Prosecution has had three lawyers examine witnesses in these proceedings to date and that it would be in keeping with the principle of equality of arms for the Chamber to grant audience to the same number of lawyers for the Defence.  

The Trial Chamber has considered the submissions of the Defence and consulted the applicable rules and directives governing this situation, and is now prepared to render a decision on this matter.  

The Trial Chamber recalls that Rules 44, 45 and 45 ter of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence speak exclusively to the roles of advocates who have been officially designated as counsel or co-counsel.  
The Trial Chamber further recalls that Article 15(A) of the directive on the assignment of 
Defence counsel explicitly states that each accused may only be represented by one counsel, who is responsible for dealing with all stages of procedure and all matters arising out of the representation 
of the accused or in the conduct of his defence.  Moreover, Article 15(C) allows counsel to designate one co-counsel to assist him in the performance of these duties.  

For these reasons, the fact that Ms. Leblanc has been registered on the list of advocates who may appear before the Tribunal as Defence counsel is insufficient, in and of itself, for Ms. Leblanc to gain locus standi before this Trial Chamber.  In order to gain such standing, she must be properly assigned as counsel or co-counsel by the Registrar of this Tribunal.  Because Ms. Leblanc does not have such authorisation, the Trial Chamber cannot allow her to lead evidence before these proceedings.  

Furthermore, the Trial Chamber recalls that Rule 37(B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence quite explicitly grant powers of delegation to the Prosecutor.  Therefore, the Defence argument that disallowing Ms. Leblanc from leading evidence before this Chamber violates the equality of arms is unfounded.  

Finally, it should be stressed that this ruling should in no way be interpreted as a commentary regarding Ms. Leblanc's qualification as a lawyer or her designation as an advocate permitted to appear before this Tribunal.  The sole issue under consideration is whether Ms. Leblanc has been properly authorised to gain audience before this Trial Chamber in these proceedings at the present time.  

For these reasons, the Trial Chamber must deny Ms. Leblanc standing to examine any witness in these proceedings unless or until such authorisation is granted.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

Following on this ruling, the Defence team composed of co-counsel -- lead counsel and co-counsel must decide now between the two of them who is going to lead the witness.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I will start by announcing that lead counsel is not here.  So I guess that leaves only me to lead the witness, which I will do immediately.  

So if the witness could be called into court so that we can begin his examination, Your Honours.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, I think the stage at which this issue arose was as the production of a document by the Prosecutor, and it is at that point that the legal assistant stood up to comment that they had no objection.  

May I now request if co-counsel can confirm that they do not have any objection to the production of the Prosecution exhibit.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, because the proceedings have stalled and restarted, we need to recall the document for the record so that the record is quite clear on what we are admitting.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

The document we are requesting to be admitted was shown to Witness T24 during his testimony.  The document in question is a document taken from the Kiyumba Gacaca, dated 23rd of September 2008.  Previously, the Defence had expressed reservation as to whether the content was from Kiyumba or from Mugina.  They were allowed time to look at it and subsequently learned -- lead counsel informed me that they had withdrawn their objection.  It is on that ground, My Lord, that we are now submitting this document to be entered as an exhibit.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Co-counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I can confirm what my learned colleague has just said.  We have no objection to the admission of that document as an exhibit in the case.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Defence Counsel, is there anything -- anyone who was not here in the morning on your bench who needs to be introduced?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  There is a girl who is not here, and Eric Sullivan, another Defence intern, is sitting on the 
bench of the Defence and the lead counsel, Maître Courcelle-Labrousse, is not here as well.  
So the bench -- maybe I can positively state who is here.  It is Maître Nathalie Leblanc; 
Eric Sullivan, intern; Nathalie Leblanc, legal assistant; Mr. Nzabonimana and myself, Philippe Larochelle.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And, Prosecution Counsel, was your team constituted as it is in the morning?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, My Lord, it was -- it is constituted as it is right now, that is, myself, senior trial attorney, 
Paul Ng'arua; appeals counsel, Memory Maposa; assistant trial attorney, Mr. Simba Mawere; 
legal -- associate legal officer, Diana Karanja; language assistant, Efrem Mutashya; and 
our two interns, Jamet Marion and Igor Bariliki.  Thank you, My Lord.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, we have problems with the CaseView, so if something could be done about the 
English CaseView.  

Yes.  Defence Counsel, do you object to the document?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No, Madam President, the document can be admitted.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Gacaca-Kiyumba proceedings of 23rd September 2008, with the additional motivation, dated 
3rd May 2010, is admitted as one document for the Prosecution, and it is Exhibit P?
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
It would be P. 37, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 37.  Is it in Kinyarwanda, Learned Counsel?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Indeed, it is in Kinyarwanda.  And may I request that the registry makes effort so that it is translated into both languages, English and French.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In that case, the Kinyarwanda version is?  Is it 37?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President, 37.  P. 37.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The Kinyarwanda version would be 37A, French 37B and English, 37C.
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Noted, My Lord. 
(Exhibit No. P. 37A, P. 37B and P. 37C admitted, under seal) 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Madam President, since the name of Witness T24 is on that document, maybe it would be preferable that the document be under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the document should be under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of a protected witness.  Thank you, Counsel.
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours, we are also applying for the production of two statements of 
Witness T31.  The first statement is dated 21 November 2009 and the motivation is dated 4 May 2010.  And the Defence had indicated that they have no objection to the production of that statement.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statement is of which date, Counsel?  
MS. MAPOSA:
The statement -- the first statement is dated 21 November 2009. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let's go statement by statement.  

Defence Counsel, any objection?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We have no objection to the admission of both statements, so they can both be admitted.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The statement of Witness T31, dated 21st November 2009, and its motivation of 
4th May 2010 is admitted as one exhibit for the Prosecution, Exhibit P. 38. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
P. 38, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 38.  It is in French, is it?  
MS. MAPOSA:
It is in French, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The French version would be admitted as P. 38A and the English when it is translated, it would be 
P. 38B.
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Noted.
MS. MAPOSA:
If it can also be under seal, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, under seal because it contains the personal particulars of a protected witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam.
(Exhibit No. P. 38A and P. 38B admitted, under seal) 
MS. MAPOSA:
The second statement, Madam President, Your Honours, is dated 18 April 2010 and the motivation, 
4 May 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As the Defence does not object to this statement being admitted, the statement of T31 of April 18, 2010 and the motivation dated 4th May 2010 are admitted as one exhibit for the Prosecution, and the 
French version would be P. 39A and the English would be P. 39B.  

Registry, is the numbering correct? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, please.  
MS. MAPOSA:
If it can also be under seal, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It is also to be placed under seal because it contains the personal particulars of a 
protected witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam. 
(Exhibit No. P. 39A and P. 39B admitted, under seal)  
MS. MAPOSA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, can we now have the next witness, after the curtains has been drawn, whom we understand to be Witness T27.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, kindly administer the oath to the witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Declaration made by Witness T27 in Kinyarwanda)
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, before you begin your testimony, we would like to give you a briefing about the procedures that obtain in this Tribunal.  We would like to begin by first advising you to learn to switch on and off your microphone.  If you are not speaking, like you are now, keep your microphone closed.  If you open it while another microphone is open, it interrupts the proceedings.  

So the procedures are as follows, Witness:  You will be led in-chief by the Defence team, which is seated on your left side.  Can you see the Defence team? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see members of the Defence team.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then on the right is seated the Prosecution team, which will ask you further questions after the 
Defence has completed its examination-in-chief.  The Prosecution team is seated in front of the translation booth.  The Judges may also ask you questions any time through the proceedings.  Answer all questions that are put to you briefly, clearly and directly.  Don't make long narrations, as they make it difficult for the interpreters and recorders to translate and record respectively.  It also makes following your testimony difficult.  So make your narrations short, precise and direct in relation to the question that will have been put to you.  If you have not understood a question, you may ask for that question to be repeated to you or to be clarified.  

You are a protected witness and, therefore, the Trial Chamber is concerned about making sure that your identity is not disclosed to people who should not know about it.  Therefore, we will be conducting these proceedings in both open and closed proceedings.  

Open session means that the public will be allowed to attend and listen to what you say.  They will not be able to see you, but they will be able to hear what you are saying.  So when we are in open session you will be told about it and you need to be careful of what you say when we are in open session, as it may identify you.  When we go into closed session it will be because we cannot admit your testimony in open session for the reasons that you may be identified.  

And while we are in closed session, feel free to give any information even if it may identify you.  We require everybody in this courtroom to be courteous to you and we require you also to be courteous to everybody in this courtroom.  We believe that if you follow these simple instructions your testimony should be smooth and quick.  Have you understood, Witness?

Switch on your microphone so that you can be heard.  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Witness.  

Yes, Defence Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President.  If the witness could be provided with the personal identification sheet which was distributed earlier?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, is it before the witness?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President, it is before the witness. 
WITNESS T27, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, are you able to read the content of the document that is before you? 
A.	Yes, I can read.  
Q.	Could you check through the contents, please, and to ensure that the information contained therein is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the answer was not recorded.  Probably the microphone was not switched on.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Correct, the microphone was not on.  
THE WITNESS:
The information contained on this sheet is accurate and I heard what you said a while ago.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, make sure that your microphone is switched on before you begin to speak, and when you have finished speaking, switch it off.  Otherwise, we will not be able to hear you through the system.  Is that clear, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
It is clear, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
My client tells me that there is a problem -- that he does not understand.  It is okay.  I think it is because the witness did not switch his microphone on, but nothing came through.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, could you please sign that document and also mention the date of today.  Today is 
	5 May 2010, please.  
A.	I will sign the document.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
With your leave, Madam President, I would seek the admission of that document under seal as 
Exhibit D?  I kindly ask the registry to assist us.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President, it would be D. 13.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Has the Prosecution looked at this form, and do they have an objection?
MR. MAWERE.
No objection, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So what number would this be, D. 13, is it?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet of this witness is Exhibit D. 13, under seal, because it contains the personal particulars of this witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Exhibit No. D. 13 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Because the questions I will ask us may lead to the identification of the witness, I would kindly request for the closed session for the beginning of the examination-in-chief of that witness, with your leave, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will go now into closed session.  

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave now because we have to protect the identity of this witness.  We hope it would be for a short time.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 42 to 43] was extracted and filed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 33 to 41 by Sithembiso Moyo) 





MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are now in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are now in an open session which may be attended by the public.  So be careful not to give any names of places or people who may be connected to your identity.  If you have any problems answering your questions and you consider that the answer you may give may identify you, do not hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber.  Have you understood, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I have understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Defence Counsel, you may continue.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, in 1994 did you know a man called Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I did not know him.  
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	Yes.  I heard people talking about that person.  
Q.	Now, I would like us to -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Counsel, to interrupt you.  But the previous question to which he said, "Yes, I heard people talk about that person", does not appear to have been interpreted.  Could you repeat that question, please?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  I have noticed.  What I asked was:  "Did you hear about him?" 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we already have the answer, so you can continue, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	I would like us to move to the death of Habyarimana in the evening of 6th April 1994.  I would like to know how you learned about that incident.  
A.	I heard the news of the death of the president in Gasenyi at the market square.  I had taken cassava to the market to sell it.  
Q.	When did you hear about it?  
A.	I did not quite understand the question.  
Q.	When did you learn that Habyarimana's plane had been shot down?  At what time?  Was it on the 6th or at some other time?  
A.     I heard the news on the 7th and I was in ************.  It was a Thursday.  
Q.     What was the distance between the ******************* and your residence? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel -- 

Just a moment, please.  

Are we safe answering that question in open session?  That is the question I wanted to put.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I think so.  Let's ask the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the answer he might give might -- we could defer that to the closed session later on.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Okay.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you know the distance, we don't. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well -- yes, I know the distance.  

Okay.  Let's move back into closed session then because I do not want to break it.  I think the information is important and I want to use it as we move along.  
(Pages 44 to 45 by Sithembiso Moyo)
















1600H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, are you saying that it is safe to give that distance in open session or not?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, we won't have a precise location.  There will just be a time -- what we will eventually get is more of a time it takes to go from his place to the *****************.  And since that can cover a wide area, that's why I deemed it was safe to provide the answer in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Let's hear the witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
That distance can be covered in 15 minutes, but if one has a burden on one's head, that distance could be covered in about 30 minutes.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.       What was the atmosphere like at the ***************** on that day when you learnt of the death of 
           the president?  
A.        People were very afraid.  
Q.        How much time did you spend at the *****************?  
A.         I stayed there for one hour, then I went back home.  
Q.        Now, I would like us to dwell on the 8th of April.  I would like to know what you did on that day in the 
            morning of 8th April.  
A.        I took the cows to pasture.  
Q.       Where was the pastureland to which you took your cows?  
A.       It was located in the valley called ****************.  
THE ENGLISH INTEPRETER:
The third name on the spelling list:  *************.
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	What was the distance between that residence -- between that location and your residence?  
A.	Since I was leading my cattle slowly, it took me between 45 and 60 minutes of trekking.  
Q.	And in relation to the *************************, what was the distance between that location and the *****************?  
A.	********** and the location where I took my cattle were almost in the same location; they were separated by only a football stadium.  So one can take five minutes from the place where I -- I had my cattle to reach the market square.  
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber how many buildings were found at the *****************************?  
A.	That's a very difficult question.  I've never really sought to count the buildings at that **********  
Q.	Just an idea of how many.
A.	Please allow me some time so I can think about it, and I'll answer you.
 
I can say that there are about 30 buildings at that centre.
Q.       Do you know one ************************? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Number 8 on the list. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.      Do you know where his house was located?  
A.	His house was to the right, down below the road, if you're coming from the direction of ***********.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Number 7 is for *********.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Was his house located at the **************************? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	From the place where you grazed your cattle, would you be able to see the ****************** properly? 
A.	Yes.  Sometimes we would leave aside our cattle so that we could go and play football.  And this is at the ********** football field.  In fact, to leave the football pitch, for you to reach the ***********, that would take you hardly two minutes.  
Q.	Were you alone on the morning of the 8th of April at the place where you grazed your cattle?  
A.	I was with others.  
Q.	Is it with these other people that you were playing football? 
A.	Yes, we played football.  
Q.	At what time did you arrive at the place where you grazed your cattle in the morning of the 8th of April?  
A.	At seven in the morning.  
Q.	And for how long did you remain there? 
A.	At about 11:30 or noon, we took the cattle back home.  
Q.	Did you come out later that day of the 8th April 1994?  
A.	At about 3 p.m., once again, we drove our cattle to the grazing area.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
My client is telling me that in Kinyarwanda it apparently was said that it was the 7th.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So, Witness, can you please confirm that at about 3 p.m. on the 8th April 1994, you took your cattle to graze? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I took the cattle back to the grazing area that same day of the 8th April, and that was at 3 p.m.  
Q.	Did you go back to the same place where you were or you had been in the morning?  
A.	Yes.  We were grazing our cattle in that valley and we did that for at least one week.  And then we moved to another grazing ground to come back to the original grazing ground about a week later.  
Q.	In the afternoon of the 8th April, were you alone or were you with other people?  
A.	I was still together with others who were looking after their cattle.  
Q.	While you were grazing your animals in the morning and afternoon of the 8th of April, did you notice any -- anything in particular happening at that ******************?  
A.	Nothing. 
Q.	In the afternoon of the 8th of April 1994, until what time did you remain in that place? 
A.	I told you at -- in the morning, we kept our cattle until about 11:30 or 12, and in the afternoon we drove our cattle once again to the pasture.  
Q.	What I wanted to know, Witness, is this:  In the afternoon you arrived there at three; for how long did you remain there in the afternoon?  
A.	Normally, we would drive our cattle to the pasture at 3 p.m. and we would bring them back home in the evening between 7:30 and 8 p.m.  
Q.	And in the afternoon, between 3 p.m. and seven in the evening, were you able to see ************************** house?  
A.	No.  In order to reach the pasture, you have to, first of all, pass by *********** house.  
Q.	Were you able to see -- let me go back a little bit. 
Did Mathias Barajiginywa also have a shop at the ********************?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did these consist of two distinct and separate buildings?  
A.	It was one single building, but it had two entrances.  
Q.	In the afternoon of 8th April, were you able to see that building from the place where you grazed your cattle?  
A.	There was a big tree which was in the marketplace, and that tree blocked view -- your view to the house.  But if something was happening at ********** house, I would have been able to know.  
Q.	Had there been a group of a hundred people in ************************* house; would that tree have caused an obstruction to your view?  
A.	No.  We would have been able to see those people.  
Q.	So after grazing your cattle, where did you go?  I'm talking about the afternoon -- the end of the afternoon of 8 April.  
A.	I remained at home.  
Q.	Now I want to move on to the day of 9th April 1994.  What did you do on that day?  
A.	My regular job was to look after the cattle.  On that day, once again, I led the cattle to the pasture.  
Q.	Did you take your cows to graze at the same time and to the same location as you had on the 8th of April 1994?  
A.	Yes.  In fact, that whole week we were to graze our cattle in the same location.  
Q.	So, in respect of the 9th of April 1994, in the morning and in the afternoon, between approximately 3 p.m. and 7 p.m., you went to have your cattle graze at the same location?  
A.	Yes, that's right.  
Q.	Once again, could you clearly see ********************** house on that day? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you see any gathering or anything in particular at that place?  
A.	Nothing -- nothing special happened at that place.  Normally, there would be two or three people in the *************.  There were only many people at that centre on market days.  
Q.	What was the market day ********************?  
A.	On a Thursday.
Q.	So on the Friday and the Saturday you -- did you -- did you notice anything in particular at ********************* house?  
A.	No, nothing.
Q.	I now want to talk to you of the 10th of April 1994.  That would have been a Sunday, the 10th of April.  What did you do on that day? 
A.	In the morning I went to Mass, because my parents had asked me to do so.  My parents promised that they would look after the cattle in my stead so that I could go to Mass and then go for a walk, like all the other children in the area.  
Q.	So what did you do after Mass?  
A.	We went for a walk in the *******************.  And let me specify -- in fact, I didn't attend Mass; it was rather a celebration.  
Q.	After that celebration, you went -- you went for a walk at the ***************; did you?  
A.	Yes, that's right.
Q.	Do you remember approximately when you arrived at the *******************?  
A.	I attended the celebration, which took place between 10 a.m. and noon.  So I arrived at the ******************** at about 12:30.  
Q.	For how long did you remain there; until what time?  
A.	I left the centre between 4:30 and 5 p.m.  
Q.	Did you see anything in particular while you were at the ******************* in the afternoon of 
	10 April 1994?  
A.	Do you want me to say this in an open session?  
Q.	Well, we will go in closed session if you have any concern that this information might identify you.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
So I would kindly request the Trial Chamber that we move into closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, what are your fears about saying what you have to say in an open session?  
THE WITNESS: 
On that day I saw many things.  Maybe some people would be able to identify me.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
So do I understand that these are events that were witnessed only by a few people, and that if you mention them, that may identify you; is that what you mean?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes; otherwise, if you believe that there wouldn't be any consequences that I would run (sic), I could mention this in public.  But I am asking that we go into a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will go into closed session for the reasons articulated by the witness.  

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave now.
