P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

The Trial Chamber regrets the late commencement of these proceedings, which was deliberating on matters which have an impact on the trial, and that is why we are starting late.  

Before we proceed with the appearances, we have a ruling to make and the witness should not have been brought in court.  

Witness, good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We explained to you about the procedures we follow here yesterday.  We are due to finalise the matter we were deliberating on in a few moments.  We are sorry that you have to leave again.  It was a mistake.  You should not have been brought in court before we dispose off this matter.  As soon as we are done with it, you will come back and continue with your testimony.  So, the curtains have been drawn, you may now leave.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, can we have the appearances of the parties, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance for the Prosecutor is as before.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  This morning the Defence bench is composed of the Accused, myself, Natalie le Blanc and Mr. Fernand Batard.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

This is the ruling of -- the oral ruling of the Trial Chamber, that is, with regard to the will-say statements of Witness T5, that was served to the Chamber and the other party yesterday afternoon at the opening of the Defence case.  
The Trial Chamber would like to underscore to the Defence that this practice is unfair to the other party and a waste of judicial time.  The Trial Chamber states that from now on it will not allow last minute will-say statements to be sprung upon itself or the other party, and finds this conduct amounts to a flouting of the rules.  

The Trial Chamber wishes to state that it was inclined to exclude the will-say statement of 
Defence Witness T5.  However, the Trial Chamber does not consider the exclusion of Witness T5's evidence an appropriate remedy in the circumstances of this case.  It will, therefore, allow the witness to conclude his testimony in-chief and postpone his cross-examination to allow the Prosecution sufficient time, if needed, to investigate.  

The Trial Chamber observed that the purpose of a will-say statement is, firstly, to clarify matters; secondly, to give new information; and, thirdly, to give sufficient details what it intends to lead -- of what a party intends to lead in evidence.  

In the interest of justice, the Trial Chamber will allow the Defence to lead evidence on the following matters:  Development of political matters in Nyabikenke since 1959, so far as it is limited to what the witness saw, bearing in mind that he is not an expert witness.  The -- two, the political views and personal character of the Accused, Nzabonimana; three, his personal experience during the genocide in as far as it is relevant to this case; and, finally, the distance between Kigali and Nyabikenke.  

Prosecution, if you could indicate to the Trial Chamber how much time you would require for investigation, if at all, after the testimony in-chief of this witness. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, we will let you know. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, when, Counsel?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
We'll first want to hear, because the notice we have does not contain any detail.  We want to hear whether those are things that we can dispose off right away or whether they are matters that will require some investigation.  Then, it will only be able to do that after the examination-in-chief of this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will revisit this issue after the examination -- testimony in-chief of this witness, T5.  
Could the registry now kindly arrange to bring the witness in the Trial Chamber.  Thank you.  

Defence Counsel, are we continuing in closed session or open session?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
In closed session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, good morning, once again.  Can you hear the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Trial Chamber wishes to remind you of the solemn declaration you made yesterday at the beginning of your testimony, and that you should bear that declaration in mind as you continue to testify.  You should also bear in mind all the directions that were given to you by the Trial Chamber.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 28] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 3 by Haruna Farage)



















MADAM PRESIDENT:
For avoidance of doubt, it is Witness T6, not T5, after the curtains have been drawn.  
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As the witness takes her seat, could the registry inform the previous witness, T5, that he is not required back for his testimony until Monday afternoon.  Registry.  

Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, could the registrar administer the oath to the witness.  
(Declaration made by Mechtilde Mugiraneza in French) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, you have just made a solemn declaration to tell the truth and we would like to give you information on how the procedures in this Tribunal unfold.  

You will be led in your evidence by the Defence counsel and his team, who are seated on your left-hand.  When they are done with putting questions to you, the Prosecution will also be given an opportunity to pose questions to you, and the Prosecution is seated in front of the translation booth on your right.  

The Judges may ask you questions any time during the proceedings.  

You are required to answer all questions put to you by either party, unless the Chamber deems the question improper, in which case you will be informed accordingly.  

Make brief concise narrations with pauses in between to allow for proper translation and transcribing of your testimony.  And if you have not understood a question you may ask for it to be repeated.  

We would like to remind you that if two microphones are left on, they interrupt the translation and transcribing of the evidence.  So if you are not speaking switch your microphone off.  And since you have opted to testify in open proceedings, these proceedings will mainly take place in open session, unless an issue that warrants that we go into closed session arises.  

We believe that if you follow these instructions strictly your testimony will quickly come to an end.  

And, finally, before we wind up our briefing, we require courtesy from the parties and everyone present in this courtroom to the witnesses.  Likewise, witnesses must be courteous to everyone in this courtroom.

That is the end of the briefing, and please indicate if you have understood.
THE WITNESS:
I have properly understood. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Counsel, we don't have much time, but you could go through the preliminaries and we adjourn for lunch.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well.
MECHTILDE MUGIRANEZA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, we will go through this short formality.  You have a document there which is your personal identification sheet.  Could you look through that document and tell us if the information therein is accurate or if there are corrections to be made?  And if the document is okay, you sign it.  
A.	It is accurate. 
Q.	Very well.  Could you then sign the document please, if you have a pen.  
A.	Yes, I do.
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Registry officer, could you please show the signed document to the Prosecution.  

So, Madam President, I would like this document to be admitted in evidence as D. 6, I believe.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, what is the number?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, it would be Defence Exhibit No. D. 6.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The PIS for the witness is entered as Exhibit D. 6, and sealed.  Put under sealed.
(Exhibit No. D. 6 admitted, under seal)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, is this a convenient moment to break for lunch?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  These proceedings are adjourned to 2:30 this afternoon.  

But, Witness, before we adjourn, we would like to remind you that you have now commenced your testimony and you should not discuss it with anyone, as you are still testifying.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings adjourned to 2:30 this afternoon.  
(Court recessed from 1302H 1435H)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
God afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed, Learned Counsel.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Madam Witness, could you please tell us where you were living in 1994? 
A.	I was living in Kigali, in Rwanda. 
Q.	Could you please tell us what your profession was at the time? 
A.	I had a little business.  I had a shop selling foodstuffs. 
Q.	Very well.  Could you please give us your husband's name? 
A.	My husband's name is Mr. Prosper Mugiraneza. 
Q.	And what were his functions in 1994? 
A.	He was minister for public administration . 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, there is a slight overlap between the answers of the witness and your questions.  The interpretation is strained.  So please observe a pause because you are speaking the same language.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I didn't do that purposely.  

BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Could you please tell us what job your husband was doing in 1994, in case our answer and questions overlapped? 
A.	I said that he was minister for public administration. 
Q.	What is his present situation now? 
A.	Right now he is in preventive detention at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda here in Arusha. 
Q.	Is it the first time that you are appearing before this Tribunal? 
A.	No, it is not. 
Q.	Can you please tell this Court before which trial you already testified? 
A.	I already testified in my husband's trial. 
Q.	The contents of your testimony, were they the same as what we are dealing with today? 
A.	No. 
Q.	In that testimony you provided, did you mention the period from 6th to 12th April 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Well, that is what exactly what we are going to talk about now, Madam Witness.  

Can you explain to us what you did in the evening of 6th of April 1994? 
A.	On 6th April, I was at home together with all members of my family. 
Q.	And what happened? 
A.	In the evening after dinner, we heard an explosion which seemed rather extraordinary to us. 
Q.	And then? 
A.	Then we didn't know what it was about at the time, but after some moments we received a telephone call from a neighbour who had also heard the explosion as we heard and the neighbour provided us with more explanations. 
Q.	But did you get to know? 
A.	He told us that it was the presidential plane that had been shot down. 
Q.	And then what happened next during the course of that evening? 
A.	That evening many things happened, but at that time, we didn't know what to do.  So we remained at home waiting for further information on what to do next. 
Q.	How did you get that further information and who provided it to you? 
A.	My husband also tried to telephone, to get more information.  He called one of his colleagues to ask whether they had further information about what was going to happen, whether they had anything envisaged because we didn't have any information as regards to what should happen next. 
Q.	Can you please give us the name of that colleague that your husband called? 
A.	He is called Mr. André Ntagerura. 
Q.	Very well.  So did you remain at home that evening? 
A.	Yes, we stayed at home for some moments because Mr. Ntagerura told him that he also did not know what he was going to do, but he asked us to wait at home and that he was going to see whether it was necessary to leave and join the others. 
Q.	Were you hearing any noises from outside? 
A.	Yes, a few moments later we heard gunshots outside. 
Q.	So what decision did you come to, finally? 
A.	After that, Mr. Ntagerura, the minister, called us again to say that they were going to send us a convoy to see how we got to join the others who were already in Kimihurura at the GP camp. 
Q.	What is the GP? 
A.	It is the Presidential Guard, Guard Presidential. 
Q.	So did that convoy come for you? 
A.	I am sorry; yes, they did come to fetch us afterwards. 
Q.	Can you please tell us roughly when the convoy came to fetch you?  Was it the 6th or the 7th of April by then? 
A.	I don't really remember the exact time, but it was still the night of the 6th to 7th April. 
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness.  So did you get to that camp? 
A.	Yes, we did reach the Presidential Guard camp. 
Q.	And what situation prevailed upon your arrival there? 
A.	There were quite a few people who had arrived there before us and there was a lot of noise; there was a lot of crying because people were afraid.  There were people who were praying; others were crying and we could still hear gunshots coming from afar. 
Q.	Would you please give us the names of those that you found there? 
A.	There were a lot of people.  I wouldn't remember everybody's names, but there were some people whom I recognised.  There was the Ntagerura family there  already; there was Callixte Nzabonimana's family; and Ferdinand Nahimana's family, and so and so on, because I don't really have time to remember the names of all those that I saw at the time. 
Q.	Who, from Callixte Nzabonimana's family, was there? 
A.	I saw his wife, Beata, and his children, as well as Callixte, himself.  He was there outside with the others. 
Q.	What else happened whilst you were at that Presidential Guard camp?  Did you settle down there? 
A.	Yes, we settled down, women and children were given priority to settle down in the rooms.  So the men remained at the entrance so that they could provide room for the women and children.  So we all remained in that room throughout the night. 
Q.	And could you hear any noise coming from outside during the course of the night? 
A.	Yes, we could still hear noises from outside, but it was rather far off. 
Q.	What kind of noise were you hearing? 
A.	Well, this was the first time that I was facing a war.  It was gunfire. 
Q.	You told us that Callixte Nzabonimana's wife and children were there.  Was she with her children in the building together with you? 
A.	Yes, she was with us inside -- in the room in which we were. 
Q.	What happened the next morning? 
A.	The next morning, since the room was already full, there were some rooms which were unoccupied inside the camp, so we were asked whether we could go into some of those rooms. 
Q.	So did you go into a room? 
A.	Yes, we were just beginning to settle down because it wasn't very clean.  So we started the cleaning up in the morning, and we were only settling down and we soon, thereafter, had to leave. 
Q.	You had a room.  Were there other people in the rooms neighbouring yours, people whose names you could give us? 
A.	Yes, there were other people who had taken rooms next to us.  There was Callixte Nzabonimana's wife, there was also the André Ntagerura family, and there were the families of Casimir Bizimungu and many others. 
Q.	Can you please tell us of the circumstances under which you left that camp and why did you leave? 
A.	I said that we had started cleaning the rooms which had been assigned to us about 11 -- 10 o'clock, 
11 o'clock, and in the morning we heard gunshots which were coming closer to the camp.  So there were shootings, which was becoming more intense and afterwards we heard a voice which was coming towards us, a voice calling out Beata, Mrs. Callixte.  And since they were in a room next to us, we could all hear her name being called out.  She also heard it.  After that she became afraid because she was hearing a voice calling out to her, but she didn't recognise that voice at all.  She ran; she left her room to come to ours to tell us that there was a man's voice calling out to her and that she was not expecting anyone at that time.  So she came to ask us for advice as to what she should do.  Should she respond or should she not.  
Q.	And then what happened next? 
A.	She was told to go and at least see who it was and to know why the person was calling her name.  So she said that she was there and it was a soldier.  He said that he had been sent by her husband, 
Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, for him to come and fetch her and evacuate her. 
Q.	To your recall, do you remember where he was going to evacuate her to? 
A.	At that time we asked where he was and he told us that it was Mr. Callixte who had sent him that he was at the ministry of defence, so he had come to fetch his wife -- Nzabonimana's wife.  
Q.	So what happened next? 
A.	Beata was afraid to leave along with the children, especially since it was a time when no one should be trusted.  So she said she was not going to leave if, for instance, she was not accompanied by others, 
at least, so that she could be reassured.  So she asked us to leave with them because it was a large vehicle -- it was a minibus, so in that way she would be reassured. 
Q.	So did you accompany her? 
A.	Yes, we went with her, so together with her children we went with her family. 
Q.	So where did that minibus take you? 
A.	The minibus took us to the ministry of defence as those were the instructions given to the driver, but when we got there, Mr. Nzabonimana was no longer there.  He had left the instructions according to which we should go to the French embassy. 
Q.	And is that where you went? 
A.	Yes, the driver continued to take us to the French embassy. 
Q.	Do you remember at about what time this was?  We are, indeed, on the 7th of April; aren't we?  
A.	Yes, we are. 
Q.	Now do you remember at what time you got to the French embassy? 
A.	Yes, we got there at about 4 or 5 p.m. 
Q.	Was it still daylight or not? 
A.	Yes, it was still daylight. 
Q.	Were you able to enter the embassy? 
A.	Yes, when we arrived, we registered at the entry because there were people from the embassy who were registering those entering, so we were registering (sic) and we were able to enter the building. 
Q.	Within the French embassy premises, could you please tell us who met you? 
A.	Yes, there were already people who had reached there earlier, especially 
Mr. Callixte -- Callixte Nzabonimana was there.  There were also other people.  I recognised the wife of Justin Mugenzi, but there were quite a lot of people there already.  
(Pages 29 to 35 by Sheriffo Jammeh) 

















1500H 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Can you please tell us how you settled in and where within the premises of the embassy?  
A.	We went into the buildings.  There were already people there, so we remained in the corridors on the ground.  So that's where we were, in the corridors, on the ground.  
Q.	Were there other families settled down next to yours?  
A.	Yes.  At that time we were together with Callixte Nzabonimana's family, my family, and all around us there were other family members.  
Q.	Do you know whether Callixte Nzabonimana slept in the embassy that night? 
A.	Yes, he slept there that night.  
Q.	How can you be so sure?  
A.	Since they were not very far from us, and since we were barely sleeping, I could see him next to us with his family next to him.  
Q.	What would the following day have been?  It would be the 8th.  Do you remember anything about the 8th to the 11th of April, having seen Callixte Nzabonimana in the French embassy?  
A.	Yes, I remember well, having seen him in the morning of the 8th.  He was there.  Since I didn't go out, I could see him in the premises of the embassy.  And the evening also, at some point he was there too.  There were days when -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry.  Her microphone has gone off.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, your microphone went off as you were speaking.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I apologise.  

Yes, I was saying that the 8th -- on the 8th he was at the embassy; the 9th also in the morning.  But during the day, I believe the men must have gone out, because they had a meeting on the 9th.  I think he also left to go there.  But in the evening he was with us.  He slept at the embassy on the 9th also.  

On the 10th he was also there in the morning; I saw him.  On the 11th, I left the embassy to go and sleep at the hotel, because my husband had found a room so that we could change atmospheres.  So I saw Callixte in the evening at the Hôtel des Diplomates and in the morning of the 12th, because we came back to the embassy for the evacuation, as had been envisaged by the French embassy, to evacuate people who were there to the Central African Republic.  
Q.	How was the procedure for coming and going out of the French embassy premises?  Was there any control? 
A.	I only left on one occasion, on the 11th.  We were checked as we went out, and I believe that it was the same for coming back in, because there were still people outside who wanted to enter and the embassy could not be left open to all and sundry because there was not space there.  
Q.	Were you discussing the prevailing situation during the period from 8th to 11th of April?  Were you discussing this situation at all with your husband at the embassy? 
A.	It was obvious that we would be discussing the situation prevailing in our country at the time, but we didn't really go into detail.  But it was quite normal for us to discuss to find out what the situation was or what could we plan for the future about everything that was happening in the country.
Q.	What was the atmosphere like during those days at the embassy?  Were people optimistic?  
A.	The atmosphere was tense, and sometimes there were questions that went unanswered.  The situation was really difficult, considering that we did not receive answers to all the questions that we asked.  
Q.	Do you remember -- or, rather, was your husband part of the interim government that was formed?  
A.	Yes, he was a member of that government.  
Q.	Do you remember the day -- the date when he was appointed into that government?  
A.	Yes.  It was the 9th of April.  
Q.	Do you know if this was also the case for Callixte Nzabonimana?  
A.	Yes, I believe it was also the case for Callixte Nzabonimana.  
Q.	Do you know whether on that day the new members of government held a council of ministers meeting? 
A.	I cannot answer that because I do not know whether they held a council of ministers meeting or not?  
Q.	Do you know if there was a ceremony for their appointment or for their installation or swearing in? 
A.	In any case, when my husband came back, he told me that they were installed.  Whether there was a ceremony or not, I cannot say.  I cannot answer that question.  
Q.	Do you remember when your husband came back on the 9th of April, when he returned to the embassy? 
A.	He returned at the end of the day around 4 p.m.; 5 p.m., he was there.  
Q.	Do you remember whether Callixte Nzabonimana was also returned to the embassy that evening, whether he was there at the embassy?  
A.	I do not know at what time he was there, but I saw him.  He was there.  
Q.	What activities was your husband involved in at the time you were at the embassy?  Did he have meetings to attend and did you discuss those meetings? 
A.	He only told me about the meeting of the 9th, when they were installed.  As for the other meetings, he did not discuss them with me.  
Q.	You told us you left the embassy on the 11th; correct?  
A.	Yes, correct.
Q.	Do you recall whether on the 9th -- on the night of the 10th or 11th of April, Callixte was at the embassy; do you recall that or not?  
A.	On the 10th, he was at the embassy, but the evening of the 11th, I saw him at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  I do not know if he spent the night there because together we returned to the embassy on the 12th, because we had just learned that the embassy was about to evacuate the people who were there.  Since his wife had stayed at the embassy, he came back to tell her goodbye.  So I saw him the evening of the 11th and the morning of the 12th.  
Q.	As far as you recall, could you tell us at about what time in the evening of the 11th you saw him at the Hôtel des Diplomates?  
A.	It was at dinner time, at about 7 or 8 p.m.  
Q.	And the next day, do you recall at what time -- at about what time you left, together with him, for the embassy? 
A.	We left early for the embassy at about 5, 5:30 a.m., because the person who had given us the information had told us that the French were going to start the evacuation very early in the morning.
Q.	Very well.  And you yourself, when you got to the embassy did you meet Beata? 
A.	No.  When I arrived she had left already with the first group.  
Q.	And later on, what happened with you, as from the 12th of April? 
A.	I had myself and the children registered for evacuation as well.  
Q.	And where were you evacuated to? 
A.	The person who had given us the information had said that people were being evacuated to the Central African Republic, but when we arrived, people were not being sent to the 
	Central African Republic, but to the airport in Bujumbura in Burundi.  
Q.	And that is where you went; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I am done with the questions I had for you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Thank you, Counsel.  

Any cross-examination from the Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, indeed.  And I'd request the assistance of registry.  

Thank you for that indulgence, Madam President, Your Honours.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good day.  
Q.	Are you comfortable?  
A.	Yes.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, you have been in contact with the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana since last year; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And they have interviewed you on several occasions about this matter; isn't it? 
A.	I met with them only once.  
Q.	And they interviewed you about the matters you have spoken here; isn't it? 
A.	They asked me whether I was at the embassy on those dates and they asked me questions about Callixte Nzabonimana.  
Q.	And they took notes; that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	I do not know about that.  They asked me questions and I answered.  I do not know if they took down notes or not.  
Q.	Who in the Defence did you meet?  
A.	I do not remember the name.  He's not there now.  I was told he was an investigator.  
Q.	Is his name Mr. Batard?
A.	I believe so.  Maybe he's the one.
Q.	He is an average height, well-built Frenchman; is that correct?  White Frenchman?  
A.	Yes, correct.
Q.	Yes.  And did he tape -- or take your voice during that interview?  
A.	As far as I know, there was no recording equipment.  Maybe he took down notes in his memory, but I didn't hear anything about that.  
Q.	And did he tell you he was an investigator for Callixte Nzabonimana?  
A.	Yes, that is what he told me.  He told me that if it were necessary for me to come and testify, they would contact me again.
Q.	And you are certain that the interview was not written down?  
A.	As I was saying, even if it was taken down, I did not sign any document concerning what I had just said.
Q.	But you wrote (sic) some papers; is that correct? 
A.	No, I did not see any documents.  
Q.	And at that interview, did you tell him that you had testified earlier in your husband's trial?  
A.	If I recall well, it was long before I came to testify in my husband's trial.  
Q.	You testified in your husband's trial in 2008; wasn't it?  
A.	Yes, 2008.
Q.	But you've just told the Court that you have been in contact with the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana since last year, 2009; isn't that correct?  
A.	Yes, it is since last year.  I'm sorry, I was mistaken.  It was not before the testimony.  
Q.	So the question is:  Did you tell him that you had already testified in Mr. Mugiraneza's trial?  
A.	That question was not put to me.  
Q.	So you did not tell him that you had previously testified; is that correct?  
A.	I did not see anything that would prevent me to come and testify in this case.  I did not feel it was very important for me to tell him that.  I did not think I should tell him that I had testified or not.
Q.	Did you also tell him that you needed to be protected when you came here?  
A.	No.  That was never asked.  I never asked him that.  
Q.	Did you tell him that you'd be able to account for where Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was from 
	the 6th of April to the 12th of April?  
A.	I told him that I would tell him what I do remember about those dates.  
Q.	Madam, did he ask you to account for Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana between the 6th and the 12th of April?  
A.	He asked me if I had seen him, but he did not ask me what he was doing on those dates.
Q.	Did he ask you when you had seen Callixte Nzabonimana?  
A.	No.  He asked me whether I had seen him on those dates.  And then we talked about it.  We talked about the dates and about the places where we were at that time.  
Q.	Where did the interview take place?  Was it at your house or was it at the hotel?  
A.	It was at the hotel.  
Q.	And you had contacted the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana about your testimony; is that correct?  
A.	Last month, somebody called me from the Tribunal to tell me that it would seem that I would have to come here and testify.  And he proposed some dates and I was not available on those dates.  So I said that since I was working, I had to, first of all, ask for a few days to be able to leave.  And that was confirmed later on, according to the dates that I had been granted.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you're avoiding my question.  It's a very simple question.  My question was:  You contacted the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana, didn't you?  
A.	Up to the time when I came to Arusha, I had not been in touch with anyone before I came.  I saw them when I arrived.  On Tuesday, last Tuesday, that is when I saw them.  
Q.	Earlier on, Madam Witness, you told this Court that you have been in contact with them since last year.  And that's what I'm talking about.  Why are you saying that you only contacted them a short while ago?  
A.	I have said that somebody came and saw me, but later on no one else was in touch with me up till when I came here in Arusha.  
Q.	When last year, did Mr. Batard take your statement?  
A.	I do not recall at all.  I cannot answer that question.  I apologise.  I did not retain the date.  
Q.	That was only last year.  And you want the Court to believe that you can remember about the 10th and the 9th of April 1994; is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes.  Those were unforgettable events.  I would be surprised if I were to forget something like that, which I experienced, which was really unpleasant.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness, on the 12th of April 1994, you had a young baby; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	How young was your baby? 
A.	One year, three months.
Q.	And tell the Court, when you got to the Presidential Guard barracks, did you get there before or after Beata and Callixte Nzabonimana?  
A.	It was after, because I met them there.  
Q.	So, indeed, you do not know how Callixte Nzabonimana had arrived at the Presidential Guard barrack; is that correct?  
A.	No, I do not know.  
Q.	Callixte Nzabonimana and his wife, Beata, were your good friends, weren't they? 
A.	I do not know what you mean by "good friends", but as far as I know, they were acquaintances.  And Callixte was -- was my husband's colleague, so I really cannot say if we were close friends or not.  
Q.	So these are not people you particularly cared about, were they?  
A.	What do you mean by "care about"?  I do not quite understand your question.  
Q.	Other than the fact that Callixte Nzabonimana was your husband's colleague and that Beata was his wife, there was nothing social or personal between you; that's what I mean.  Is that the case?  
A.	Socially speaking, yes, because since Callixte was my husband's colleague, we would see one another in many national holidays and occasions.  So these were people who we would see quite frequently.  And since the town was not very big, if -- these would be people that we would be seeing from time to time.  We knew each other.  I wouldn't say I didn't know them or they didn't know me, but they are not really very close friends, as that term is understood.  
Q.	Really?  Yes.  In fact, when you appeared in your trial -- in your husband's trial in 2008, you knew that 2Callixte Nzabonimana was a minister, but you could not remember that he was a minister for youth and sports; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, I remember very well.  Maybe on that day, I was somewhat stressed and that my memory returned a bit later.  
Q.	So you arrived at the Presidential Guard barrack at night of the 7th and 6th; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	And by any chance, did you see Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's car within the barrack where you were held?  
A.	Where we were, there were no vehicles.  Vehicles remained outside and we had to walk to go to the hall which had been assigned for receiving people.  
Q.	Did you see Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's car outside the barrack entrance?  
A.	I didn't see the vehicle, but I saw the person at the entrance to the room.  
Q.	There were no vehicles parked outside the Presidential Guard barrack, were there?  
A.	That's possible, but I didn't really take a good note.  And since I didn't know the number plates of cars or to whom which car belonged -- so I don't think I would be able to answer that question, even if I did see vehicles parked.  
Q.	Now, Witness, during your trial (sic) in 2008, you did not say that you saw Callixte Nzabonimana.  In fact, you said he was not there and that is why you accompanied his wife to the military headquarters.  Why have you changed your story now?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Objection.  Can you please refer to the relevant text instead of making a suggestion?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, I would appreciate that if my learned friend wants that kind of intervention, he ask the witness to leave first.  I think the question is understandable and the witness can respond.  I will -- I will come to it.  I will come to the document.  

I've already given you a copy, Mr. Defence Counsel.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  What is your answer?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	We need to make a ruling first, Learned Counsel.  

The Trial Chamber considers that the question is clear enough for the witness to answer.  

Yes, if, Witness, you have understood the question, you may proceed to give an answer.  If you have not understood the question, counsel for the Prosecution can repeat it for you.  
THE WITNESS: 
Could he please remind me the question?  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	My question is exactly this:  Witness, during your trial in 2008 -- during your husband's trial in 2008, you did not say that you saw Callixte Nzabonimana.  In fact, you said he was not there at the Presidential Guard barrack, and that it was -- that is why you accompanied his wife, Beata, to the military headquarters.  

Why have you changed your story now?  
A.	I'm not changing my story.  I wasn't asked whether I had seen Mr. Nzabonimana.  And when we left the camp, Mr. Callixte was no longer there.  So I had seen him the evening before, when I arrived there on the night of the 6th to the 7th.  But at the time when we left, Mr. Callixte was no longer at the GP camp.  
Q.	So your testimony is that Callixte Nzabonimana left his wife and family at the Presidential Guard barrack and went away, but you do not know where he went; is that correct?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Witness, did you hear the question put to you?  
THE WITNESS: 
Please, I wasn't quite following.  I didn't think that it was meant for me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Okay.  Counsel, can you repeat the question?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
	My Lords, maybe she needs a five-minutes break.  Maybe we should allow her to take a small break.  She's taking too long to respond to questions.  And when the time comes to respond, she said she was not concentrating.  I think, in the interest of progress and time, we should give her a few minutes' break so that she can recuperate herself.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	No -- 

Witness, do you need a break?  
THE WITNESS: 
No.  I'm quite okay.  I can continue.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Counsel, just repeat the question so that we can make progress.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, is it now your testimony that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana left during the night, leaving his family at the Presidential Guard, and went away?  
A.	I cannot tell you at what time he left but, at any rate, when I left the camp, he wasn't there.  
Q.	Now -- so, you kept on seeing this man, Callixte Nzabonimana.  Let's talk about the next time, this time at the Presidential Guard barrack.  You saw him once and he disappeared.  You don't know the time when you last saw him again, until you got to the French embassy; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, I saw him again when I arrived at the French embassy.  
Q.	Now, tell me and tell the Court very candidly:  When you left the barracks -- the Presidential Guard barracks with Beata, are you sure Callixte Nzabonimana did not board the minibus with you?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes, Counsel, when you are shuffling your papers, kindly switch off your microphone, please.  

Witness, did you hear the question?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I did, indeed, hear it.  

He was not on the minibus with us.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	The Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana will be calling at least one witness who was at the Presidential Guard barrack.  And she will tell this Court that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was on that minibus.  What do you say to that?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
	I don't know if the procedure has prophetic powers, but it is a bit early to anticipate what the other witnesses will say in this trial.  I have no objection to him referring to past testimony, but other than that, unless he has, again, powers which can anticipate what witnesses will say in court, I think the question is completely improper.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
	Madam President, may I request that the witness leave the Chamber, and I'll make my response. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes.  

Witness, we have a procedure here to request witnesses to leave the Chamber when counsels are arguing a legal point.  It is a bit inconvenient but, unfortunately, we have to go through it.  So we request you to leave now so that we can deal with this matter.  You will be informed when we are done with the discussion.  You may leave now.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. NG'ARUA:
	My Lords, may I first, on the onset, say that that objection was really unmerited.  In cross-examination the cross-examiner can put a proposal or a proposition to a witness.  We do have a statement with us to that effect.  And I'm entitled to put that to the witness.  So when counsel stands up at such a delicate time, what will the Court assume he's doing?  

My Lords, I think if we exercise some restraint here, we can be able to go through this very smoothly.  But that question was -- and that objection was really unmerited.  So, My Lords, I would implore you to disallow it and also to direct us, especially to the principles of cross-examination:  Unless a question is unfair, it's allowed and if, indeed, counsel needs to object in such a sensitive manner, he should first request the witness to leave and we shall proceed.  

So I request that that objection be overruled and that I be allowed to proceed with my case.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
	The purpose of cross-examination is to use material which is in evidence or which can be validly opposed to the witness.  And I'm sorry to repeat that a witness's anticipated testimony is not -- is nothing tangible.  The Prosecution is well aware that statements can be modified by will-says.  And the document he intends to use was not signed by the witness and she has no knowledge at all of what the Prosecutor is relying upon.  So the purpose of cross-examination is to use legally admissible material which can be opposed to the witness.  
The Prosecutor is at liberty to ask for a recall of the witness, as it was said to us earlier, if there is evidence surfacing in this trial which contradicts what the witness is saying during a cross-examination.  But to try to put her in contradiction with anticipated testimony of a witness, I suggest to you, goes way beyond the realm of what is acceptable in the context of a cross-examination.  Those are my submissions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber:  The first one is that the Trial Chamber considers that objections that may have an impact on a witness should not be made in the presence of a witness.  When a counsel stands up to make an objection or a submission, the Chamber will not know in advance what that counsel is going to say.  Therefore it's upon counsel to exercise judgement before they start speaking to decide whether to proceed with an objection or not.  It is proper for counsel to say:  I have an objection and may I request the witness to leave.  And we will take the necessary steps. 

Now, two, we also don't think it proper for cross-examining counsel to say to a witness that a witness for the Defence or a witness for the Prosecution will come or has come and said A, B, C.  That proposal can be put in a neutral manner, and we have already said so once.  It would suffice, for example, if counsel stood up -- put this question to the witness and said:  If a witness came here and stated A, B, C, D, what would be your reaction?  That is neutral enough.  Once you label the witness that may have an impact on the witness who is on the stand.  

So we want both counsels to take note of these observations.  That will be our ruling.  And therefore, we request counsel for the Prosecution to rephrase his question.  After that we will take the break.  

Could we have the witness back in the courtroom, Registry?  
(Witness entered courtroom)

1600H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we will continue with your testimony.

Prosecution Counsel 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, indeed, if somebody came to this Court and said that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana boarded the minibus that took you to the French embassy, that person would be misleading this Court; is that correct? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to respond in the place of the other person, but I said what I saw, and maybe he left in another minibus, but not in the one we were in. 
Q.	Witness, it is your testimony, isn't it, that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana may have boarded another minibus when you boarded the one that took you to the French embassy or that he could still have been at another place in the presidential guard barrack; is that correct? 
A.	I don't know about that.  And as I have said, when I got into the bus -- the minibus, I didn't see him with us. 
Q.	On your way to the military headquarters, did you ask Beata when her husband had left in the night? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Witness, before you answer.  Learned Counsel, what do you mean, military headquarters?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, what I mean is, they left the presidential guard to the French embassy, but they stopped at the military headquarters. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, if the witness has understood the question because it is now clearer, then she can answer.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
"Ministry of Defence", says counsel for the Defence. 
THE WITNESS:
We went by the ministry of the defence, but we didn't come out of the vehicle because when we arrived there, we continued on our way, given the message that had been left by Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Yes, the question was.  Did Beata tell you or did you inquire from her where her husband was, when had he left? 
A.	I didn't ask her that question and she didn't speak to me about it either, because we were joining him there at the place where he said he was going to be waiting for his wife. 
Q.	Now, Witness, it's a very short distance, isn't it, between the presidential guard barrack and the ministry of defence headquarters; isn't it? 
A.	I don't know what that distance could be.  But there's some distance anyway. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  It helps the Trial Chamber if you can give an estimate.  We don't require exact measurements, but we would like to understand because we don't know the places and you do.  Could you give an estimate?  
THE WITNESS:
Since there are hills over there, I don't know how to make the estimate in kilometres.  Maybe I would say some ten or so kilometres, but I am not at all sure of that estimate. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I have a map of Kigali in front of me.  May I invite you to have a look at it?  Now, you will see on that map that the ministry of defence headquarters or rather, you will see that the French embassy is labelled number 4.  Do you see it? 
A.	Yes, I can see No. 4. 
Q.	Yes, now you are at the presidential guard barrack at Kimihurura; weren't you? 
A.	Yes, that's true. 
Q.	Now can you see the roundabout with the name "Kimihurura"? 
A.	What number would that be?  
Q.	It doesn't have a number.  There's a name "Kimihurura" and a roundabout with a circle? 
A.	There are many on the map. 
Q.	Witness, if you can look at me, there's one right there with Kimihurura.  Do you remember that roundabout? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	And the French embassy is No. 4 on that map within the vicinity of the central business centre.  That is around very close to Radio Rwanda.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see where it is. 
Q.	If I told you that that distance is about five kilometres, would you agree with me? 
A.	Well, that's quite possible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we want to understand.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are talking about the distance between the French embassy and Radio Rwanda?
MR. NG'ARUA: 
The distance between the presidential guard barrack and the French embassy.  I just used 
	Radio Rwanda to focus her mind to a place very near the French embassy.  They say that sometimes some people have difficulty reading maps. 

BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Any how, Witness, during that ride, your husband was in the vehicle, Beata was in the vehicle?  Can you tell the Court who was accompanying Beata in that minibus? 
A.	Beata was with her children.  There was also my family with her and the driver was there as well. 
Q.	Now, other than her children, was anybody else accompanying Beata? 
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	How many children accompanied Beata? 
A.	I do not know how many of her children were there.  I cannot say. 
Q.	Do you remember whether her maid servant was present? 
A.	It is possible, but I did not know her maid, I am sorry. 
Q.	Other than the two families in the minibus, there was no one else, was there? 
A.	I do not know if there were any other people inside the minibus when we came in, because we were really under pressure because of the firing.  So we were doing our best to run into the minibus very quickly and be evacuated. So it's possible that there were other people in the minibus who were coming or going out, particularly since I was going through a difficult time because I had left my son behind.  Maybe when I went back to look for him, there were other people who came into the minibus, but I do not know.  I did not pay attention. 
Q.	Witness, you have just told this Court that you virtually entered into that minibus by accident.  And that if it was not for the soldier who came calling for Beata, you would not have gone in that minibus; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	In fact, that minibus had only come to pick Beata and her children, isn't it?  
A.	In principle, yes. 
Q.	And, in principle, you only worried about your son, Robert, who had been left behind with a family.  Is that not correct? 
A.	I do not quite understand your question.  Could you please repeat the question. 
Q.	My question is, all that you were worried about that evening when you boarded that bus is that your son Robert - Robert, I think you call him in French, was with the family of André Ntagerura and he could not accompany you.  Is that not correct? 
A.	That was an issue of concern for me, just when we were getting into the minibus and when we realised that he was not with us; otherwise we were concerned by all that was taking place around us.  
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Let's go a bit slowly.  So at no time before you boarded that minibus, did you leave that minibus to go and look for your son because the soldiers refused you to do so; is that not correct? 
A.	No, not at all.  Before, the child was playing just nearby.  It was when he heard firing that everyone went in using the nearest door.  And when we were boarding the minibus, we realised that Robert was not with us.  I tried to go and look for him and the soldiers stopped him -- stopped me.  I did not try to look for him before that because I could not go out. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, you are missing the question a little.  I want you to be very precise so that the Court understands you.  At no time, at the time you were boarding that bus, did you leave that bus in spite of the fact that Robert was not there.  They did not allow you to do so.  Is that correct? 
A.	I was not able.  I tried to get up and go out, but the soldier asked me to sit down immediately.  So I was not able to leave the vehicle. 
Q.	Correct.  That is the answer.  Therefore, what you are saying that you did not know whether anybody else boarded the bus is not true because no one else boarded the bus.  You never left there.  Is that not the case? 
A.	But I did not know everyone who was there.  So I could not say with precision the number of children who were with Beata.  Maybe there were some adults with her or other members of her family. 
Q.	Do you recall, Witness, whether any other family, save yourself, your husband, your children and the family of Beata, was there any other family that joined you in that minibus? 
A.	As far as I know, the families that I knew -- no, I can't name any.  I do not know. 
Q.	It is not that you do not know, Witness.  You know that it only took you, your husband, your children, save for Robert, Biata and her children.  That is the truth, isn't it? 
A.	I did not pay attention.  I did not notice anyone else.  I only saw my family and Biata's family. 
Q.	Correct.  And you were particularly focused on the people on the bus because you were looking for your son and you didn't want to miss him.  So you looked at everybody very carefully in that bus.  Is that not correct? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I object -- I wish to object. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the witness is here.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
As you indicated before, Madam President, I am waiting for the witness to leave the courtroom. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, you may leave now.  After we have had this discussion with counsel, we will take the afternoon break and you will be informed when we resume.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
The question has been asked and answered several times.  The Prosecutor may not like the first answer he got, but the witness explained that there was a great deal of confusion, that she was not able to retain everyone who was in that bus.  And he is pushing and pushing and pushing because he doesn't like the first answer which he got.  Therefore, I suggest that he should move on to another topic because this has been thoroughly addressed
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
The submission from my learned friend is not true.  The witness is deliberately creating a shadow.  
	At first, she said that she went to look for the boy and she did not know who else entered the bus. The question that I want the Judges to understand is to put light on that little shadow that she is creating.  That little shadow of doubt has significance because there's another witness you will call, who will come and say that, not only was Callixte Nzabonimana in that bus, but that she was also there and we know she wasn't.  So this is the little light that I want to be shed.  This question now is the link whether she looked at everybody in the bus while looking for Robert, because she was not sure where Robert was, and this is a mother, not an uncle, a mother, she must have looked.  So, I believe that this is a proper question.  We have to prove our case beyond reasonable doubt unlike the Defence and I think this question should be allowed. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Briefly, Your Honour - again, I reiterate what I said earlier that she has been asked and she responded to that question five times.  And I would like to take this opportunity to -- for Your Honours to call on the Prosecutor to avoid unnecessary bracing, let's say, you are deliberately misleading the Court.  There's has been use of names here that is completely inappropriate, and I would call on Your Honours to request the Prosecutor to refrain his language.  I think the people that come here to testify do it under great stress and sacrifice time, and all, to be able to do that.  And I would request, Your Honours, to call on the Prosecutor to refrain his language I think there has been many -- we did not object because we didn't want to disturb the proceedings, but I am taking this opportunity to call on Your Honours to request the Prosecutor to stop using that kind of a language. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, we have understood the point you are trying to put across to the witness, that is Counsel for Prosecution.  We will allow you one more chance to computise your question and whatever the answer is, we have to move on.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the break and resume these proceedings at twenty minutes -- ten minutes to five.  

The witness should be informed accordingly.  Ten to five.  
(Court recessed from 1625 H 1655H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber.  

THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	Witness, it is your testimony, isn't it, that after you boarded the minibus, nobody else entered or left until you arrived at the French embassy, is that correct? 
A.	I didn't say that no one got off or on the bus, that on the road, on our way nobody else came into the bus. 
Q.	And is there a point before you got to the French embassy when somebody alighted from the bus?  
A.	I don't really remember whether anyone alighted from the bus. 
Q.	Witness, I want to refer you now to your testimony of 1st of May 2008.  I have prepared a French and English copy for you.  Witness, the document in front of you, in English and French starts from 
	page 10 to page 18, and there's a little bit at page 45, the last page.  Do you see that?  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I have page 10, in French.  From page 10 in French up to page 44. 
Q.	But from page 10 it goes consecutively to page 18.  Do you see that?  And then it jumps to page 44 where there was some cross-examination, correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  
(Pages 46 to 51 by Judith Kapatamoyo)


















1700H 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	And in those pages, you described before the Bizimungu trial, starting from line 8 of 10.  In the 
	English version it's line 6.  It describes the events from the time you heard the plane -- the explosion of Habyarimana's plane to the time when you left the French embassy.  Correct? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Can you read from line 8 to the bottom of the page, starting with the line, "I was at home with 
	my husband and my children".  Correct? 
A.	Yes, okay. 
Q.	Can you read? 
A.	"A:  I was at home with my husband and my children.
Q:  What happened?  Did something unusual happen that evening which may have caught your notice? 
A:  After dinner we heard a loud explosion and that made us afraid.  Later on we learnt that it was President Habyarimana's plane that had been shot down.  
Q:  What happened next?  And how did you get to know that it was, indeed, 
President Habyarimana's plane which had been shot down? 
A:  Someone called my husband at home and he told me that the president -- that it was the 
president's aircraft that had been shot down.  We didn't know whether he had died -- whether the president had died or whether he was alive.  
Q:  Do you know who it was who called your home? 
A:  My husband told me that it was one of our neighbours, Minister Ngirabatware."  

Should I continue? 
Q.	Yes.  Yes, Witness.  Start with the line, "My husband, Mugiraneza, told me."  Yes, a bit down the line, "My husband, Mugiraneza, told me", at line 31.  
A.	"A:  My husband, Mugiraneza, told me.
Q:  Now, you, together with the members of your family, you got to know about the president's death.  What happened next? 
A:  We were at home, as I just told you, and we were scared.  And a while later we heard gunfire, we didn't know what was happening outside.  We couldn't go out.  And we were very scared.  So we took the children into the corridor to shelter ourselves from stray bullets and we stayed there.  But I must tell you that we were very scared and didn't know what to do.  
Q:  At that time did your husband have any bodyguards? 
A:  Yes.  But when my husband asked them if there was a plan to assist us, the bodyguards told us that they couldn't do anything and so they stayed with us simply."   

Should I continue? 
Q.	Turn to the next page, page 11.  And do you see the line starting with paragraph, "Ntagerura asked us to wait at home".  That is line 19 on your French.  Can you read that? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Learned Counsel --  
MR. MAWERE:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before the witness reads, we've been wondering whether the reading wouldn't be too long for the question -- for us and the witness to understand what you are trying to demonstrate.  Maybe if you could take it in bits and pieces, it might be easier.  
MR. MAWERE: 
That's right.  

In that case, Madam President, may I refer her to this paragraph?  Then I'll make my point.  If she could just read this part, then I'll put my question to her.  Thank you, My Lords.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Can you proceed, Witness? 
A.	"Q:  After your husband talked to Minister Ntagerura what happened?  
A:  Ntagerura asked to us wait at home.  Subsequently, he called my husband again and he said that a military vehicle had been dispatched to escort us right up to a Presidential Guard camp.  A short while thereafter, the military vehicle came.  We got into the vehicle, along with our children.  
Q.	When you spoke to Beata at the Presidential Guard compound, did she tell you how she had come to the Presidential Guard camp? 
A.	I did not put that question to her.  
Q.	She had come in the similar manner that you and Mugiraneza had come, as you have read in that paragraph; isn't that correct? 
A.	To get to the military camp -- or, rather, to the Presidential Guard camp we did not go with Beata.  
Q.	Witness, the first night between the 6th and the 7th, you spent in a hall; is that correct? 
A.	We were in a room. 
Q.	Now, I would like to refer you -- in the English the answer is at line 24.  And in the French, you'll bear with me, where it says, "When we arrived at the Presidential Guard camp".  Do you see -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Which page, Counsel? 
MR. MAWERE: 
Page 11, My lords.  Eleven, My Lords, at line 24 in the English.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Line 33 might help, Counsel.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Line 33.  Yes.  Can you read your answer there? 
A.	"A:  When we arrived at the Presidential Guard camp, we noticed that there were many people who had gone there also.  People were afraid.  There was significant noise.  Children crying here and there, others shouting because people were scared.  We heard gunshots.  We were showed a huge hall where other people had been settled.  That is where we also settled.  Women and children were on 
	one side and the men on another side."   
Q.	Witness, when you were sleeping with your children and other women at the hall, did you know where Callixte Nzabonimana was? 
A.	We were not able to sleep under such circumstances.  
Q.	Correct.  But my question is:  Did you see Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes, I saw him at the entrance when we had just arrived.  
Q.	Witness, in this huge hall where women were on one side and the men were on the other side, did you see Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	There was a group of men that was just at the entrance and Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was among that group.  It was well lit both in and outside the room, it was well lit.  
Q.	He spent the night there, didn't he? 
A.	I cannot confirm that, because after that I went inside, as I said.  
Q.	What about Beata?  Did you see her inside? 
A.	Yes, I saw Beata inside.  
Q.	So, Witness, do you agree with this statement that the correct position is that you did not go to a room but you went to a hall, a single hall, where there were men, women and children? 
A.	Correct.  
Q.	Thank you.  In that hall, did you settle next to Beata? 
A.	She was right behind.  Maybe she had just arrived herself.  
Q.	What do you mean that she was right behind?  I don't get you.  Is it that she came after you or what do you mean by that "she was right behind"? 
A.	I did not say she had come after me, but when I came in one could easily see people one knew before.  She was not far away from the entrance.  And since the hall was not -- since the hall was not full, she was right there at the entrance.  
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see other ministers' wives there?  Did you see, for instance, 
	Casimir Bizimungu's wife? 
A.	No, I did not see her.  
Q.	Did you see Mugenzi's wife? 
A.	No. 
Q.	There were many people in that hall, weren't there? 
A.	That's true.  
Q.	But it was less crowded than at the French embassy.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I do not quite understand the question.  
Q.	The question is:  In this hall where you were settled in the Presidential Guard barrack, the number of people there were fewer than the number of people who you find yourselves with in the same room at the French embassy.  Is that correct? 
A.	Are you talking of the evening of the 6th to the 7th? 
Q.	Witness, when you got to the French embassy, the accommodation was more crowded than it was at this place, this hall, in the Presidential Guard.  Is that correct? 
A.	The hall at the Presidential Guard was more crowded than was the case at the embassy when I was there.  
Q.	So in the room that you were in at the French embassy, approximately how many people were there? 
A.	When I arrived, I did not go around the house to find out how many people had been there before us.  And I stayed in the corridor where there were a few people, some ten or so people.  
Q.	But that number increased significantly, is that correct, at the French embassy? 
A.	Yes.  Afterwards people came gradually.  
Q.	And the arrangement at the Presidential Guard barrack reflected closely the Rwandan culture that men in such crowded places stay separate from their women, is that not correct? 
A.	Not necessarily.  Those who wanted to remain with their wives and children were with them.  It was not systematically separate.  They were not systematically in separate groups.  
Q.	But in your statement to the Bizimungu case, you created the impression that men and children were on one side and men on the other.  
A.	It was not systematic.  Maybe the men were somewhat outside to leave room inside for the women and the children, but it's not like someone separated them.  
Q.	Now, let's get to the French embassy.  Now, when you got to the French embassy, you found the compound guarded by soldiers, is that correct? 
A.	When I arrived, I did not see any soldiers.  
Q.	And there were no vehicles or people outside the embassy, that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Maybe there were some, but I do not remember.  
Q.	When you got there, was Callixte Nzabonimana inside or outside the embassy? 
A.	He was inside the embassy. 
Q.	So when Beata and her family registered at the embassy, they registered on their own, is that correct? 
A.	She had herself registered together with her children.  
Q.	And did anybody call Callixte Nzabonimana from the inside to come outside when you were there registering? 
A.	No.  No one called him.  
Q.	And the registration was smooth and within a few minutes you were inside the walled compound of the embassy.  That is correct, isn't it? 
A.	In any case, we did not encounter any problems having ourselves registered.  The French allowed us inside. 
Q.	Did you identify yourselves when you got to the entrance? 
A.	At that time they did not ask us to introduce ourselves.  They had already started receiving other people.  So we asked if we could be allowed to stay inside the embassy, if we could seek refuge there.  
Q.	And before you entered, nobody called the ambassador, did they? 
A.	No, I do not believe that was the case.  
Q.	Along with you were some of your servants, is that correct? 
A.	No.  The maids had remained at home.  
Q.	What of Beata?  When she entered the embassy, did she have any servants with her? 
A.	I do not know.  
Q.	Beata had two daughters, isn't it? 
A.	I'm sorry, I do not know whether she had two girls or boys.  I do not know for sure how many girls and boys she had.  
Q.	I mean, the children accompanying her, there was Mahoro, M-A-H-O-R-O, and Charlotte -- Charlotte, I think, C-H-A-R-L-O-T-T-E.  Do you remember that? 
A.	I remember that she was with children but I do not know their names. 
Q.	Those were young children, weren't they? 
A.	When you say "young", what age are you referring to?  
Q.	They were not teenagers yet, were they? 
A.	Maybe there was one teenager and one who was not yet a teenager. 
Q.	Did you see a lady with her -- with Beata, who was about 20 years old, in her company at the registration? 
A.	I cannot say.  I did not really pay attention to know whether there was a young girl there or not.  It is possible that she might have been there.  
Q.	Now, Witness, if somebody says that to enter the French embassy you required the consent of the ambassador, that person would be ...(microphone not activated), isn't it? 
A.	It would depend on the person.  
Q.	The persons who came to the embassy were relatives and family of high-ranking officials, isn't it? 
A.	No, they received everyone who came there.  
Q.	Now, Witness, in your statement in the Bizimungu Chamber, you never say that you saw 
	Callixte Nzabonimana at the embassy, do you? 
A.	I was answering the questions which were being put to me.  
Q.	Now, when you got to the embassy, did you take the same quarter or the same -- did you sit at the corridor with your husband and child? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Witness, do you agree with me that from the French embassy, which is marked number 4 on your 
	little map, to assist you, and Hôtel Diplomates, which is across the road from Kigali hospital, it's less than half a kilometre?  Do you see number 4 and number 11 on your little map?  Yes? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And that was an area that was mostly occupied by government forces and by militia loyal to the government, is that correct? 
A.	It is possible but I do not know where everyone lived. 
Q.	Witness, it is correct, isn't it, that on the 8th of April 1994, at about 4 p.m. you became aware that your husband, Prosper Mugiraneza, had been appointed in the interim government, is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not true.  I heard about it on the 9th. 
Q.	Witness, it is either that you are not with your husband at that time or that you are mistaken, because your husband came to know that he had been appointed as minister, along with other ministers who were in the French embassy, at about 4 p.m. on the 8th.  
A.	In any case, I heard about it on the 9th.  Maybe he was informed on the 8th, but I knew about it on 
	the 9th.  
Q.	It is possible, isn't it, that for some hours between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on the 8th you had lost 
	visual contact with your husband, is that not correct? 
A.	If I had lost sight of him, well, he wasn't far away.  He was inside the embassy.
(Pages 52 to 57 by Rebecca McCoy) 


















1730H 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	That is not the point, madam.  We are not saying he went anywhere.  We are just saying that during that period you didn't see him, because if you had seen him you would know he was nominated as minister. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, do you want the witness to leave?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:  
Well, it is 5:30 any way, and I can make my submission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we have come to the end of your testimony for today.  You are still testifying.  So do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  You will resume your testimony on Monday morning at 9 o'clock in the morning.  You may leave now. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We are again -- the question has been answered by the witness, and the Prosecutor is simply rephrasing it in a completely hypothetical way, which I think, any answer given to that answer cannot be of any assistance to the Court.  So I would like the Prosecutor to rephrase his question or move on to another topic, on the first leg of my submissions, because this question has been repeatedly asked and answered by the witness.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, I will not dwell on this matter for long, and it is obvious that I have something on my sleeve.  If you look at your folder of May 2007, I have there two documents.  The first document relates to this witness, and the second document, you will see that there was knowledge of appointment of ministers on the 8th of April.  That is at page 31.  

So, again, this is an unwarranted objection.  Counsel knows very well that I am trying to say that this lady artificially says that she see things that she did not see simply to fulfill and to help 
Callixte Nzabonimana.  That is the point, and there is no other way of doing it other than going into small details like this painstakingly, and counsel is aware of it and he is trying to stop me from going there, because he wants the original testimony of this witness to go unchallenged.  There is no other way from putting these things to her in the manner I have done.  And I can assure the Court that I will not belabour the point.  I am almost through with it.  I will now show her the document.  So I think he need not protect this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. Counsel, we also want to understand the point you want to put to the witness.  You've been suggesting to her that she has lost visual contact with her husband between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. and, therefore -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My conclusion, if I can help My Lords.  I don't want to disclose everything, but if she lost contact with her husband, I'm also going to say she lost contact with Callixte Nzabonimana, and not the way she has been saying it that he is always inside.  This man at one time, we're been informed by 
Mr. Ntagerura -- André Ntagerura that they had been appointed, and if she didn't know that her husband had been appointed at that time, it means that she had no contact with her and with Nzabonimana, as well.  That would be my closing arguments.  

So, counsel knows of this, I know it because I do have coffee with him very often.  He is a very intelligent man, and that is why he is trying to interfere.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Your Honour, with the very smooth words, the Prosecutor comes again, every submission that are made are stark with accusations of trying to protect the witness or trying to impede on the Prosecutor's work.  And I am making all these objections in good faith.  I think the Prosecutor admit himself that he is harbouring and labouring on getting this point.  He is getting answers that maybe do not fit precisely with what he has in his sleeves.  I think once he gets an answer to one of his questions, he should just move on.  And if he doesn't -- if he doesn't like it, well, too bad.  

The Prosecutor has a certain way of seeing what the witness says, I think that's -- that's his right to do that, but again, repeating again and again, questions with a view to trying to get different answers from the witness is not of any assistance to this Court.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have sort of exhausted this argument.  I think we need to deliberate and make a ruling.  

Yes, Counsel, first of all, the Trial Chamber is happy to note that this discussion is taking place in an amicable manner, and we hope that this will continue.  

Secondly, Counsel for the Prosecution, the Trial Chamber considers that you can make more direct proposals to the witness than you are doing.  And given that this is the second time we are bringing this to your attention, we are hoping that when we resume on Monday, you will be more direct with your questions and proposals.  

Now, that said -- yes, Registry, did you want to say anything?  
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
Madam President, last Tuesday you had asked us to give you a report on the situation of the spectacles for Mr. Nzabonimana, and this is what I wish to do.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed.  Thank you for reminding us.  Go ahead. 
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
I am going to read the report delivered by clinic.  "Nzabonimana was examined last Tuesday and strong spectacles were prescribed for him, one for close up reading" -- let me repeat.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
She was asked to slow down. 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
"One pair for close up reading, which should be ready this week, and another pair for seeing far, which would be ready in 10 or 15 days, because the lenses had to come from Nairobi and Mombasa.  
Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry. Yes.  Thank you, Registry.  We consider that we have made progress in that regard.  

Learned Counsel for the Prosecution, how much more time do you need to end your cross-examination because we need to plan for Monday?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, I think by the morning break, I will be finished with this witness.  It's really very little left.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And we hope that you can make it shorter -- even shorter.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Well, I said that so that if I am shorter you will give me credit, but I think that I will be.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, and we need to plan for utilisation of the time between the morning break and lunch time. 

Counsel -- Defence Counsel. 

MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President, I wanted to know whether we should bring a new witness on Monday, because you will be finishing with this witness.  On Monday at 14:00, you are going to cross-examine T5, if I understood.  So between the coffee break and the lunch break we'll have a new witness, T9. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, is it possible that you might have completed your investigation by the 11 o'clock break in the morning so that we can finish with that cross-examination before we start on the next witness?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
We will inform the Chamber, but I thought that we had said 2 o'clock so that we do not disappoint anyone.  If we get our results before then, there is no problem, we will proceed.  But at the moment, I would like to leave it at 2 o'clock, because in any event, I'm sure that we shall finish the cross examination that afternoon. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
My learned friend, Larochelle, said that he could take another witness, T9, in a few minutes so that will leave us from 11:00 to the lunch break for continuing with the other witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So, this is how we envisage the day to proceed.  From 9:00 to 11:00, we'll deal with the witness on the stand and conclude her testimony.  From 11:30 to 1 p.m., we'll deal with T9, and if possible, complete her cross or if not possible, stand her or him over until the next day, so that we conclude T5.  So we have three witnesses on the stand on that day.  

Registry and witness protection, please take note.  So --

Yes, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I am sorry to delay you further.  Since we have been in court whole day, we would wish an hour more for us to be able to provide the list which we were supposed to hand in today to the Trial Chamber, containing more information on what our witnesses will say.  So we are asking up to 1900 hours to send it by e-mail by 7 p.m. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, the extension is granted.   

Any other matter?  

All right, we wish everybody a nice weekend and we meet on Monday, God willing.  The proceedings are adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1745H)
