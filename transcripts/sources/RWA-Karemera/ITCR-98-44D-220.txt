MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The Chamber apologises for being a little late.  We had some urgent matters to address, and that is why we are late.  

Witness, good morning.  We have come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you for coming to testify in this matter.  Your testimony will be considered along with other testimonies at the end of this trial, and we thank you for the assistance you have rendered the Chamber in establishing the truth.  And you may now leave after the curtains have been drawn.  

And, Prosecution, after introducing your team, you can also let us know whether your next witnesses are available.  

Witness, you may now leave 
(Witness excused)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What we would really like to know is whether you are constituted as before and if there's anybody missing. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor's bench -- the Prosecutor is as before and the Prosecutor's appearance is as before.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Good morning, Madam President.  The Defence has lost its investigator, who is going on mission this morning, but apart from that, Mr. Courcell-Labrousse and myself are here for Mr. Nzabonimana this morning. 

Good morning, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you scared us when you said that you lost a member of your team.  We're happy that nothing happened to him.  

Could we have the next witness, Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  Our next witness is CNAZ.  May I request that he be brought in.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Witness has no earphones.  

Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS:
Now, I can hear you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Could the registry administer the oath to the witness, please. 
(Declaration made by Witness CNAZ in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you should move closer to the microphone and make sure that it is switched off when you have finished speaking.  

We would now like to -- sorry.  You were saying something?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I was wondering how to switch off the microphone.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  You now know how to switch it off?  
THE WITNESS:
Now I know.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then we would like to give you some information regarding the proceedings in this Tribunal.  The team seated on your right hand is the Prosecution and it will lead your evidence before this Court.  It will ask you questions to elicit your evidence.  When they have completed their questions, the Defence team, which is seated on your left, will also ask you questions.  If the Judges require some further clarifications from you, they will also put some questions to you.  

In order to assist the Trial Chamber to quickly come to an end regarding your testimony, we urge you to answer questions directly.  If you are required to answer yes or no, do so.  If you need to make some explanations, you may make those explanations, but briefly.  And listen carefully to the questions and make sure that you understand them before you start answering.  If you have not understood a question, you can ask for the question to be repeated or clarified.  

Is that okay, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have understood you very well. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  And if you follow those instructions, we should quickly be able to finish your testimony, and you can return tomorrow thereafter.  We thank you.  

Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours.  We have circulated the personal information sheet for this witness, and may I request that he be guided through his PIS. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could we have a Kinyarwanda speaker from the interpretation booth to guide the witness through the identification sheet, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution Counsel, please switch off your microphone, please.  Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness confirms that the information in his personal information sheet is accurate. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Interpreter.  

Prosecution, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, may the PIS for CNAZ be marked as Prosecution Exhibit P. 3 and be placed under seal, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, any objection?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  The form should be tendered as an exhibit for the Prosecution and marked P. 3.  Is that the correct number, registry?  
(Exhibit No. P. 3 admitted, under seal) 
MR. NYONGO:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you may proceed when you are ready. 


WITNESS CNAZ, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Did you have a good rest?  
A.	Yes.  I slept well and I feel very well. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, after the death of the president on the 6th of April 1994, did you see a certain gentleman by the name of Callixte Nzabonimana?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, maybe before the witness answers, we need to point out that we are in open session and the witness should be careful not to reveal any information that may lead to his being identified.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  I have understood.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	So did -- what is your answer, Witness?  Did you see -- yes.  
A.	I saw him.  Do you want me to proceed?  
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	I saw him when he came from Nyabikenke commune to my native commune.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has mentioned the name of his native commune, but this has not been mentioned by the Kinyarwanda booth.  
THE WITNESS:
He told us at the time that he had just launched the killings, the work in Nyabikenke commune.  So he came to our commune and told the people that he was a minister of associative activities and that since the killings have already begun in Nyabikenke, they should also begin in Rutobwe commune.  He asked whether all members of the population were armed and whether they had machetes, clubs, grenades and other weapons.  Then he told us that everybody knows that the country's enemy is the Tutsi.  Then he bought some beer for the inhabitants, and everybody was able to drink.  

Then the minister repeated the statement that the country's enemy was the Tutsi, and then he asked whether there was any Tutsi in the crowd.  Members of the population pointed at me saying that I was Tutsi and mentioning my name.  The individual who pointed his finger at me is known as one***********.  It is **********who mentioned my name.  And then members the public continued to drink, and 
Callixte Nzabonimana asked the people to take me away and to kill me so that I may serve as an example for the killings that were supposed to begin.  

We were in downtown Butare, and members of the public were thirsty and were engaged in drinking, so I whisked myself out of the place and escaped to a house which was not very far from the location where they were gathered.  Once I got behind a certain house, I ran off, and Nzabonimana asked 
four gendarmes, who were in his company, to chase after me and to kill me.  But these gendarmes did not know the area, so as they were going by the road, I had escaped through a small path behind a house.  And that is how the gendarmes were not able to locate me.  I went through a coffee farm and on with my escape.  

Later on, I was informed -- or, I heard that members of the population had continued to search for me, but because I had fallen into a hole, they were not able to see me and I hid in that place up until 2 a.m. in the morning.  That is at what time I left that hiding place to go back to my home.  

So when I got home, I told my mother, my nephews and my cousins that the killings had begun, and I told them that we had to leave our area.  And since the killings hadn't started across the area, they did not heed my warning.  So I took the children who were with me and we went to my sister's place in *************(phonetic) where we spent two nights and then went on to Kabgayi, where I sought refuge.  

That, briefly, is what I had to say regarding that point.  Thank you.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, the spelling of Kabgayi is on number 8 on the spelling list.  Do you have the list?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is this supposed to be a new list regarding this witness?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, for this witness, for CNAZ.  

No, it seems to have been omitted.  May I request registry, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And as the registry distributes the form, Witness, pause through your narration to enable easy translation and recording of your testimony.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you for that, Madam President.  I was going to request that.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, just a few clarifications so that Their Honours may understand you even better.  When you said that Callixte Nzabonimana had said the killings had already been launched, what did you understand by that?  Who was being killed?  
A.	It is the Tutsis who were being killed, and he made that point very clear when he stated that the country's enemy was the Tutsi and that the Tutsi, wherever he or she was, needed to be killed.  
Q.	Was any explanation given as to why Tutsis had to be killed at that time?  
A.	Nzabonimana gave instructions when he said that the enemy of the country is a Tutsi and he needed to be killed.  He told us that he had come from Nyabikenke commune, where all the Tutsis had been killed, and that he we needed to do the same thing in our commune of**********.  In other words, kill the Tutsis.  
Q.	Witness, in relation to the death of the president, approximately how many days had passed when you heard Callixte say those words at***********? 
A.	The president died on the 6th of April, and Nzabonimana came to our commune on or about the 
12th of April.
Q.	Tell the Court, Witness, did Callixte Nzabonimana find you at the Butare trading centre, or did you find him there?  
A.	Nzabonimana found me at the Butare centre and there was a big crowd.  He arrived from the direction of Nyabikenke commune in the company of four gendarmes and********************************, who was the********************************************.  When he arrived, he began his meeting.  And to please the local inhabitants, he bought them beer.  
Q.	Yes.  Now, the spelling of **************is number 1 on the list; Butare is number 2 on the list; and *****************is 5 on the list, and earlier on he had talked about Vincent, number 7 on the list.  

Now, thank you, Witness.  Can you briefly describe the crowd that was gathered there.  About how many people were they and who were they?  
A.	All this happened a very long time ago and I don't remember all the names of the local inhabitants, but I remember there was one***********.  Let me inform you that there was a large crowd, but I will give you the names that come to mind.  There was one******, as I have said.  There was also***********.  There was one*********.  And there was******************,**********.  Those are the names that I recall.  I have forgotten the others because, as you are aware, these events took place a very long time ago. 
Q.	Yes.  
MR. NG'ARUA:  
The spelling for ***********is*****************.  And ***************is************************************.
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, all I want you to tell Their Lordships is how large the crowd was.  Just try and focus your mind on the crowd and tell the Judges about how many people were there.  
A.	About 20 people.  
Q.	Was this meeting something that had been previously arranged, or was it a meeting that spontaneously happened?  
A.	This meeting had not been planned.  It was a meeting which took place when the minister arrived on the spot at the centre where we had gathered in a large number.  So he began to hold his meeting by telling us that he had just come from the Nyabikenke commune, and this was the first time that he was assembling us in order to speak to us. 
Q.	And how were the gendarmes armed?  Can you describe if they were armed or not.  
A.	The gendarmes, who were with Callixte, were carrying weapons, because they were his close protection officers, and they were carrying rifles.  
Q.	Thank you.  And, Witness, how was Callixte Nzabonimana dressed?  Do you remember whether he was dressed in any particular way?  
A.	He was wearing a suit, but he was wearing boots on his feet.  He told us that "I am just coming from Nyabikenke.  You can see that I'm wearing boots which are covered in mud.  This is to show you that you, too, should begin killing."  And, in fact, his boots were covered with mud. 
Q.	Now, while you are still focussed on the meeting, can you give an approximate time when the meeting took place.  Was it in the morning, in the afternoon or was it in the evening?  
A.	I believe the meeting started at around 3 p.m. and lasted for some time.  
Q.	Now, after you ran away, can you tell the Court how many people were looking for you.  
A.	I wasn't able to know how many people were looking for me because I fell into a ditch and I wasn't able to know how many people were after me, but I understood that there were many.  The young men who were there with me at the drinking place are the ones who chased me.  I could hear their -- the sound of their feet as they ran after me, but since I was in a ditch, I wasn't able to see how many they were.  
Q.	Now, after you took refuge at Kabgayi, did you return back to your home area?  
A.	For a long time I was afraid to go back home.  I only went back to our home in 1998. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court, when you got back to your home, how did the people receive you?  
A.	The local inhabitants thought that I was dead and they had shared out my land amongst them.  So when I came back, they were surprised and they said, "Are you still alive?"  And I said, "Well, yes, I am still alive."  Gradually I tried to get back into the life of that society, but I realised that it was difficult because I was no longer safe.  (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover)  
Q.	May the last part of his statement be placed under seal, My Lords.  I think it is not fair for him.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Could the last part of the witness's answer be transferred to the closed session proceedings. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, when you say that when you returned back, your neighbours and others thought that you had died.  Did you come to learn from them when they thought that you had died?  From which incident did they think you had died?  
A.	The local inhabitants thought that I was dead while I was in Kabgayi because many people died there in Kabgayi, and since I took awhile to return home, because other surviving refugees had returned to their homes earlier, they came to believe that I was dead and that is why they had shared out my land.  Moreover, my sister, who survived the massacres, was not living in our native area.  So this means that the local inhabitants did not have any news about us, and that is why they believed that I was dead. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, I have no further questions for this witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Before the Defence starts on its cross-examination, we would like to observe that the Prosecution has taken approximately one hour and 35 minutes to conduct its -- I stand corrected.  It was about 
40 minutes.  So we expect the Defence to conduct its cross-examination in such a way that it is proportionate to this time.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honours, I will be making a short motion to postpone the cross-examination of that witness.  In the meantime, I am anticipating, somehow, what your decision may be.  I have pictures here which I will use if we go ahead.  So I would like to communicate them to the Prosecutor so that he can have a look at them before we embark into the cross-examination.  If the registry could assist. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Registry, assist the parties. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I'm also providing the registry with a list of names, which will be distributed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The list of names should not be distributed to the witness because it contains information which may help identify other witnesses.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you heard the submission of the Defence. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, My Lords.  We have heard the submission of the Defence, but he has not made any substantive motion yet, so there is nothing to respond to.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If I may proceed on the motion itself, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
So the ground on which we are basing our request for the postponement of the cross-examination of that witness is somewhat different in that we have received, again for that witness, a statement concerning his judicial curriculum in Rwanda.  And it states that he has not given testimony into any courts of justice.  However, concerning the events which he relates and the area where they allegedly took place, Your Honours are well aware of our efforts -- I will be very careful not to mention any information that -- it is safe for the witness to hear what I'm going to be saying, Your Honours.  There will be no information which might be relevant, and I will talk in such a way that it will not create problems. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Counsel, if you assure us that that will be the case.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I'm simply stating that Your Honours are well aware of our efforts -- multiple efforts trying to meet Witness CNAO.  And that witness has very important information concerning that area, the same area where that witness is alleging that these events took place.  Because of his position there, because of certain allegations against him, it was crucial for us to meet that witness before embarking on the cross-examination of the witness who is before you this morning.  

Because we never have been allowed -- solely for what I submit to Your Honours is a lack of candour by the Prosecutor, there is no reason why we were prohibited to meet that witness apart from that.  And this is why now this morning we are again lacking very important information that would allow us to fully explore the allegations of this man before you.  Therefore, I request that this cross-examination -- he can remain in Arusha, but his cross-examination should be postponed until we have had the opportunity to meet with Witness CNAO.  

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor submits that the postponement of the cross-examination of this witness is without merit.  

My Lords, if you turn to the binder of witness statements at tab M3, it is almost to the end of the -- 
of the -- of that docket, you will find that we duly disclosed the testimony of this witness to the 
Defence counsel in both languages in good time.  Indeed, that is not his complaint. 

Now, the witness's testimony before Your Honours is exactly what the Defence expected to hear.  Now, it is incumbent upon the Defence Counsel, in exercise of their diligent work, to investigate all the circumstances, and we believe they have had time to do so.  Indeed, in our status conference of 15th October, this was not an issue raised.  In fact, this application is similar to the two other applications that we have heard.  He is trying to distinguish them, but there is no distinguishing mark.  

Now, with respect to CNAO, the Defence has accused us of not being candid, but, again, we say that that submission is unfortunate.  We've discussed the issue of CNAO long enough.  In fact, in our 
status conference of the 15th of October, if lead counsel can remember, it appeared from his submission that he knew exactly where CNAO was, but wanted to meet him alone, without the Prosecutor, contrary to the ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber.  The Pre-Trial Chamber had said, "As soon as you get to where CNAO is, please visit him with the Prosecutor.  And WVSS should facilitate."  

It is now common cause to all of us that CNAO is a fugitive Prosecution witness.  He may come.  And the tracking team, from the report that we gave the trial (sic), was that the tracking team is trying to get hold of him, but we cannot give up the quest for the CNAO until the last -- the second week -- the last week -- the first week of December when we have slotted him for that purpose.  And we heard a lot of talk about CNAO.  

So we have also disclosed CNAO's statement in full to the Defence Counsel.  So now the submission being made that they cannot cross-examination this witness on what he has said because there is hypothetical information that may come from CNAO, which hypothetical information may be used to cross-examination this witness, does not fit well with the application to stay the cross-examination of this witness, because it is hypothetical.  This witness has already given a declaration, which the Defence is aware of, that he has not even appeared before any other tribunal in Rwanda.  

So what is the merit and what are the distinguishing features of this application and the previous applications that have been denied by the Court?  There is none.  And, actually, in the interests of time and guided by Rule 90(F)(i) and (ii) which states as follows:  "The Trial Chamber shall exercise control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:  

(i) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of truth; and 

(ii) Avoid needless consumption of time."  This application falls under the caprice of 90(F)(ii).  

I, therefore, submit, My Lords, that the information that the Defence have had since October 2008, with respect to this witness, has not changed.  And they are in a position to proceed with the cross-examination of this witness.  

If they come across any other information that is cogent to warrant the recall of this witness, then we shall be the first to accept, but before that has been established, we cannot work on a hypothetical statement by CNAO as a good ground to prevent the cross-examination of this witness. 

My Lords, I rest my submission.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Can we have the reply from the Defence.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, I specified when I made the motion that this was on a different ground.  I'm not invoking the fact that we did not receive Gacaca proceedings or judicial material from Rwanda.  I don't understand why my learned colleague is addressing that matter.  I stated that it all rests on the incapacity of the Defence team to meet with Witness CNAO.  It is not to have fun that we want to meet with him or by caprice.  It is because CNAO is mentioned by another witness who deals with -- who talks about the same allegation.  So this allegation that you heard this morning by this witness is covered by other witnesses of the Prosecutor and one of them links CNAO with it 

And with regards to our efforts to meet with him, we have been trying unsuccessfully since more than two or three months.  It has been many months that we have been trying to arrange that meeting with CNAO.  

So, in essence, the reason is the same.  The application is different in that this time it's the failure of the Prosecutor to collaborate with the Defence to allow a meeting with a key Defence witness by what I suggest is artificially maintaining him -- maintaining Witness CNAO on their witness list when they are fully aware now that the CNAO does not desire to testify for them.  So this is pure obstruction by the Prosecutor, and this is prohibiting the Defence team to properly conduct its investigations with all the difficulties which we have submitted to Your Honours in the past few weeks regarding the conduct of these investigations from the Defence and the Prosecutor is submitting that it has disclosed to us the statements of CNAO 

He fully knows that CNAO now wants to recant these statements, and he fully knows in what circumstances these statements were obtained from CNAO in Rwanda.  He is no longer there, so that he's at liberty to speak now.  And the problem is that the Defence has not been able to meet that witness now that he is at liberty to speak and that he can provide a full account of what happened in that commune where, if you look at the witness statement, you will see what his position was in that commune.  It is very important to take note of that.  I don't want to mention it here because it may reveal information that would help to identify witnesses, but if you look at the statement of 
Witness CNAO, which was provided lately by the Prosecutor in your binder, you will see that by virtue of his position, it is clear that this witness has vital information to provide, not only to this Court, but to the Defence before it can fully counter the allegations made by the witness in front of Your Honours. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
A very short and brief one line of response, My Lord. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, make it one minute.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, one minute.  

Firstly, it is unfortunate that the Defence Counsel continues to address the gallery rather than the 
legal issues, and, in so doing, paints a distorted picture of the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor is not trying to obstruct anything.  We have made a legal argument bearing in mind that we have a no-contact order from this Court with CNAO.  Indeed, we have asked the Defence Counsel to assist WVSS to contact CNAO because we are sure that CNAO has contacts with the Defence team.  Therefore, we are not obstructing.  

Secondly, we are not aware that CNAO is going to recant anything.  This is a pure creation by the Defence.  We have asked them to cooperate with WVSS -- with WVSS to try and get them to know where CNAO is because they are constantly getting information from CNAO and filing motions about it.  It only shows that they know where CNAO is.  So we are not maintaining CNAO on our list artificially.  Rather, we are in pursuit of CNAO to come and testify, and as soon as we get him, he will come here.  So it is unfortunate that the Defence is not addressing the legal issue but it is addressing the gallery 

As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will now deliberate and give our ruling.  

And, Registry, our computers, particularly the French computer, is not working, so we cannot properly follow the proceedings.  Can it be rectified once and for all, please.  

Defence Counsel, we are seeking one small clarification from you.  Do you know where CNAO is?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We know in what country.  We receive -- we do not seek information from him, or we do not try to contact him because at present he is still a Prosecution protected witness, apparently, although the Prosecutor has put a tracking team on his trail, which, by the way, contradicts the order of the 
Pre-Trial Chamber who prohibited the Prosecutor to contact that witness.  What is it that they are trying to achieve?  The same thing as they did as alleged by the witness putting pressure on him so that he comes to testify here.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we asked a simple question and let's get a simple answer.  Thank you.  

This is our ruling on this matter:  

We have listened carefully to the parties, and we have also taken into account the circumstances of this witness.  This witness is here.  The Defence has had information relating to him since October 2008.  It is also in possession of the statement of CNAO, and in the circumstances, we see no basis to postpone the testimony of this witness in cross-examination.  

If the Defence in the future comes by information which they consider important to put to this witness, they can move the Trial Chamber to have him recalled on demonstration of the issue that they want to ventilate.  

So that will be the ruling of this Trial Chamber and cross-examination should proceed.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
As the Court pleases.  

Just a short comment as to length of cross-examination.  Your Honours, we hope that if the Prosecutor takes three minutes for his examination, we would be entitled to more than six for the cross-examination thereafter.  I think that the interpretation of the principle of equality of arms, if it is so, that the Prosecutor is entitled to 12 years of investigation and the Defence less than one, that the same kind of arithmetics can be used for respective examinations and cross-examination.  We don't think it is fair that the Defence be unduly limited in its cross-examination just by virtue of the fact that the Prosecutor is restricting his own examinations.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, it will assist us if you make less statements and make relevant questions to the witness, we are likely to make better progress.  We are not saying that we are going to be mathematical, but we are asking you to take into account the fact that the Prosecution has used that amount of time.  So we expect you to be precise in your questions, to be relevant and to be brief.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President.  

May I proceed?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	In a statement that we received from the Prosecutor -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, actually, Your Honour, I will request that we move into closed session because I will embark on questions that may lead to the identification of the witness or a close person to him.  So it would be -- I apologise to the persons who are here this morning, but it may lead to the identification of the witness, so it would be preferable to move into closed session, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Registry, will you arrange for us to go into closed session.  

We regret, members of the public, we have to ask you to leave at this particular moment because there are matters that we are going to address that may reveal the identity of this witness who is a protected witness.  

We thank you.  

And, Witness, remember to switch off your microphone.  

Registry, we had somebody attending to our computers, but because we were deliberating, we asked her to leave.  If you could arrange for her to come back and assist.  Thank you.

MR. DIALLO:
Yes, Madam President, we are in open session.  We may proceed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are now in open session.  Be careful not to mention names of people or places that may identify you.  

Prosecution Counsel, you may proceed.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon.  
Q.	Yes.  Witness, in 1994 did you hear of a gentleman called Callixte Nzabonimana?  
A.	Not only did I hear mention made of him, but I also saw him.  
Q.	Yes, we'll come to that also.  Tell me -- tell the Court, when did you first hear of Callixte Nzabonimana, before you come to when you saw him?  
A.	People were speaking about Callixte before 1994.  They were saying that he was minister.  And I also used to see his vehicle pass by, not too far away from my home.  
Q.	Yes.  Can you describe the type of motor vehicle that you -- that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana used to travel in?  
A.	The vehicle was a Pajero whose colour was dark.  
Q.	Yes.  Witness, can you tell the Court, after the death of President Habyarimana, did you see Callixte Nzabonimana?  Give the circumstances around your answer.  
A.	After the death of President Habyarimana, the government of the Abatabazi moved to go and set up in Gitarama.  And then, on a date which I do not remember -- but maybe I could hazard a guess regarding the date, because I did not take any notes.  Let me take as my point of reference the day on which the government transferred to Murambi.  So let me refer to that as the dismantling of the government, and in that dismantling, Minister Nzabonimana took his vehicle and drove towards Nyabikenke.  He was accompanied by two soldiers, as well as his driver.  His driver was at the wheel.  

So he came.  And when he reached*****************, he found us there, and we had captured two men.  So we had captured two men and -- it was being said that these two were Tutsis and that they were enemies of the country.  So we took these two men behind*******************, and when we reached that location, some of us said, "Well, here we are at the commune office", and they began to cut them up with machetes.  And Nzabonimana arrived at the scene at that point in time.  And since he was in the company of soldiers, the soldiers told us, "A soldier known as *************has escaped.  He was with us and he has escaped.  And you must find him at all costs."  So we told them that we could not go in search of a soldier who was armed, whereas we don't have any guns.  Callixte then said, "Don't worry about that, I'm going to give you guns." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, slow down in your narration and have pauses in between, because your testimony is being translated in other languages and it is also being recorded.  So the people doing this job need some time to do that before you move on to your next narration.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, Madam President, the spelling of ************************is on number 6 of the spelling list.  And at number 5 is******************.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, Witness, when you and your friends were cutting up the two persons, the two Tutsis, and Callixte Nzabonimana came, lead us through that.  What happened when he arrived at the scene?  
A.	When he arrived at that location where we were in the process of cutting up the two Tutsis with machetes, he stopped, he parked his vehicle, and he said, "You're doing a good job".  One *************************told him, "Give us money".  He gave him 300 francs and he told him, "That is all I have".  And he promised to see him later.  Now, that man said to us, "Since Callixte has given us -- has given me such a little amount of money, I cannot share it with you".  So he told us -- the soldiers who were with Callixte said to us, "You have to go and intercept *****************".  When we told him that we were only civilians and that we could not arrest an armed soldier, whereas we didn't have any guns, Nzabonimana promised that he was going to give us guns in the following days.  
Q.	Did the guns come?  
A.	He left on that day and I didn't see him again.  
Q.	Witness, enlighten the Court as to how long Callixte Nzabonimana stopped at that place where the attack on two Tutsis was taking place, at*************************.  
A.	Not more than five minutes.  Although he spoke with us, he did not get out of his vehicle. 
Q.	Now, after he told you that you were doing a good job, what did you do?  
A.	When he told us that we were doing a good work, we had strength because we felt that he supported us.  So we continued beating up those men.  We abandoned them there and left.  
Q.	Yes.  What happened to these two men?  
A.	They died.  
Q.	When did they die?  
A.	They died on the spot. 
Q.	Now, tell this Court, what were the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the two men?  Why were they arrested?  
A.	The two men were going to Kabgayi in order to seek refuge there.  But since the road was blocked, they hid in banana fields or in the bush.  Since we had to cut down banana trees, we realised that they were hiding behind banana trees -- or, banana trunks.  
Q.	Now, tell us, when you say "we", who are -- who are those people?  What was -- what was your group?  Can you describe it?  
A.	(By order of the Court, this answer was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And another person whose name the Kinyarwanda interpreter did not get.  
THE WITNESS:
-- so they were saying that we had to act according to what had transpired at the meeting.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this question was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, is that information we should receive?  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Sorry, sorry, just a minute -- just hold on, just hold on.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Maybe, My Lords, I don't think that would reveal his identity.  But I take the caution that -- that you have flagged in this regard.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, can we go into a brief closed session.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Members of the public, we regret that you have to leave at this moment because we are going to discuss matters relating to the identity of this witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 61 to 68] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 58 to 60 by Kirstin McLean)












MR. DIALLO:
Yes, Madam President, we are in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  You may proceed. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honours, for this fourth attempt for postponing cross-examination, I have tried to equip myself with better weapons.  

There's a fundamental distinction concerning this witness, which I think is highly important for your consideration, which is the fact that we know that he has been detained.  Again, the Prosecutor has made absolutely no efforts to obtain the Gacaca material that was generated in the course of that 
man's imprisonment.

And you can see this afternoon how -- what disadvantage and what inconvenience it creates for the Defence.  We mentioned earlier we attempted to object to the second meeting that was described by the witness, which eventually he confirmed was different even from what is alleged in the statement.  

We saw that the site where he committed the infractions, which he agreed upon, is in a different site than the ***************centre.  It overlapped a different place.  

And two days before the 9th, on the 7th November, we received the statement of the witness, which was a declaration, as we agreed to call them this morning, of the witness.  You have his name.  You have his signature.  He acknowledged there that he received a sentence of***********; that he has been imprisoned for eight years following accusations in the Gacaca of the districts of*******.  

At the bottom of page 1, you have the fact that he made the confession in the Gacaca of********, that he gave a statement to the ICTR.  The statement is from -- was disclosed by the Prosecutor, regarding this witness, is from 2002, seven years ago.  

And on the next page of the statement, you can see that he acknowledged having testified both in the *********Gacaca court and the ***********Gacaca court in***********.  

Your Honour, a statement like that takes anywhere between 30 seconds and one minute to obtain from a witness.  

And the next document I would like Your Honours to turn their attention to is the decision which I have distributed and the case of Prosecutor versus Juvénal Kajelijeli rendered on 2 November 2001.  And I would like to bring Your Honours' attention to paragraphs 16 and 17, where the Chamber there 
stated -- and I'll read slowly because, I apologise, I did not bring copies for the translators.  We will try to adapt.  

But the Chamber stated there nevertheless that -- it noted that:  "In order to make a determination, it must consider the relevancy of these statements and who bears the responsibility of obtaining these statements from Rwanda."  We are talking of detained witnesses here. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, could -- is it possible for the interpreters to have a copy because it is being read out?  If possible.  Or counsel could speak slowly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the interpreters don't have a copy of what you're reading, and they request you to speak slowly so that they can internalise what you're saying. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
So I'm now at paragraph 17:  

"And in determining whether the said statements are relevant, the Chamber notes that in preparation for the trial the Prosecutor would have been expected to find out and obtain all prior statements of detained witnesses that such witnesses might have made in other similar investigations and 
judicial proceedings, and so far as they could be relevant to the issues with which the Chamber is seized."

At paragraph 19:  

"Furthermore, the Chamber is of the view that following within the purview of Rule 66(A)(ii) of the rules and in the interests of justice these statements could be material to the preparation of a case and the testing of the credibility of the witnesses pursuant to Rule 90(G) of the rules.  Such statements could also facilitate the Chamber in the eventual evaluation and ascertainment of the truth and of the credibility of the witnesses.  

"In the instance case, therefore, having decided that the statements are relevant, the Chamber has carefully considered the question as to who bears the responsibility of obtaining the said statements of detained witnesses from Rwanda.

"The Chamber is of the opinion that since these witnesses were to be called by the Prosecutor in her case against the Accused, it was incumbent upon her to have had in her possession the said statements, particularly, as the said statements might be used in weighing the credibility of the said witnesses."  
And I think the next sentence is very important:  

"Accordingly, in the interests of justice, the Chamber finds that the Prosecutor bears the responsibility of obtaining the said statements from the Rwandan authorities and providing them to Defence, pursuant to Rule 66(A)(ii) of the rules.  

The Chamber notes that Trial Chamber I seized with a similar request by the Defence in the
Prosecutor versus Nahimana, (inaudible), issued an oral ruling on 4th September 2001 directing that a Prosecutor make every effort to obtain from the government of Rwanda the records of that witness including pre-plea agreements, the date of conviction and sentences and any confessions that have been filed with the Court as well as the records of all other witnesses she intends to call or has called who are in custody in Rwanda.  It is the Trial Chamber's opinion that these records are relevant for cross-examination and that they must curdle extensive cross-examination."  

Where will the Prosecutor hide this time?  It is his duty for the last seven years to have at least requested from the Rwandan authorities the statements that we are pursuing.  

Therefore, in view of this breach of its duties by the Prosecutor, I request, once more, that the cross-examination of that witness be postponed until the next session of this trial. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Indeed, My Lords -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
-- where will the Prosecution hide this time.  Now, I refer you to paragraph 1 of that ruling so that you may understand the context.  

Now, in the case of Prosecutor versus Kajelijeli before Justice Chamber II, this was a case of re-hearing.  And if I could just draw your attention to the -- to the third line of that first paragraph, you'll find out that -- and it says and I quote:  "As a result of discrepancies between GAO's testimony before the Tribunal and the said prior statements, they request the Chamber to order the re-hearing" -- re-hearing, I emphasise that word -- "of GAO on these discrepancies."  

That is the request the -- the -- the Defence counsel was requesting for.  So this is what we've been saying all along.  This authority is not for this stage.  It is after, after, they have obtained documents from Gacaca and find that there are some substantive issues that need to be addressed.  
Now with regard to the responsibility of the Prosecutor to disclose those records, I don't know why the Defence counsel in this case is not referring to the rulings of this Trial Chamber and the 
chamber of Appeal.  

We have a decision by this Trial Chamber dated 11th November 2009 -- sorry, sorry, not a decision.  We have -- we have before you, My Lords, ample authority -- and I quote -- such as Rutaganda.  This is a decision of the Court of Appeal at paragraph 45.  And again Kajelijeli.  The same ruling that he has referred to in the Kajelijeli 's Appeals Court ruling at paragraph 263, the Prosecutor is not encumbered with this responsibility to go and get Gacaca records.  He's only encumbered with disclosing records within his authority and power, within his domain.  

Therefore, this application is not different from the three other applications my learned friend has made.  And I don't think that it merits any different decision than that which the Court has already issued.  

The cross-examination of this witness can proceed, firstly, because the statement which he has given has been in the custody of the Defence counsel since last year, October 2008.  

Therefore, we do not see any distinction, because -- we are not going to repeat the entire argument, but we're saying that the distinction that the Defence is trying to create in this situation is a distinction without a difference.  And it is simply rhetorical and has no merit.  

You have seen the authority that he has put before you.  I wonder how he can respond to paragraph 1 of that authority.  This is a decision for re-hearing, re-hearing of GOA's testimony.  So I think he has read it out of context.  It's a very good try.  But I think the -- I rest my submission with that, My Lords.  It is quite evident that it does not apply to this case.  In fact, it's the remedy that we've been saying all along, that if in the event the Defence comes up with a cogent motion moving this Court to remove the 
current witness, then we shall be the first to accept, but he has not reached that stage yet. 

As the Court pleases. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Very briefly, Prosecutor.  The eucalyptus tree behind which the Prosecutor is hiding is not very thick because indeed if you look at this decision, it is precisely because the statements were not obtained by the Prosecutor that re-hearing was ordered.  So the Trial -- the Prosecutor is trying here to bring confusions which does not exist.  The statements of the Court are clear.  They talk about Rule 66(A)(ii), which is the rule we have constantly invoked.  

And our main -- the main remedy we are seeking is for the postponement of that witness until the next session.  But, subsequently, we would request the Chamber to allow us over the next three days to obtain what we can to postpone the cross-examination of the witness until next Monday.  

Thank you, Your Honours.
(Pages 69 to 73 by Melissa Hook)

































1700H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, which rule did you cite?  Because it wasn't very clear in what you said, and it's also clear in the CaseView.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
At paragraph 19 of the decision, what I was saying is that the Prosecutor is trying to say that the statements that were made by the Court there should not apply because it was in the context of rehearing.  

What I'm saying here is that this is not true and that when you read paragraph 19 of the decision, it is clear that the Chamber has stated that as part of Rule 66(A)(ii) of the Rules of Procedure and also in the interests of justice.  The Prosecutor has the duty to obtain prior statements of detained witnesses.

It's as simple as that.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, if the interpreter could help, I think counsel meant 66(A)(ii). 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Interpreter.

Is that so, Defence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes.  66(A)(ii).  Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to begin by recalling all our previous decisions on this matter and to say that we will make the same decision in respect of this witness.  In our considered opinion, there is enough material on which cross-examination of this witness can proceed.  If in accordance with our decisions, either party is able to secure these records and a case is made out for us to review -- to recall this witness, we will do so.

So for the remaining 30 minutes, we are of the view that the cross-examination of this witness should proceed on the basis of the evidence that has already been laid.  We have also taken into account that the witness statement -- the statement the witness made is within the possession of Defence counsel and has been so since October 2008.  Therefore, cross-examination of this witness will proceed.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I'm going to make a subsidiary application.  I'm simply requesting the Trial Chamber to actually -- to skip the 30 minutes today and allow me to have time up to Monday so that by Monday I can actually have documents which have been mentioned or referred to by the witness and in the statement which he gave to the Prosecutor last week -- last Sunday.  Last Sunday. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, please wait to give him the earphones because counsel is raising an issue with us.

Yes, Counsel.  You may proceed.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, I'm sorry for this to and fro-ing, but I would like to wish the witness to be excused because I'm not very sure that he doesn't understand French, and what I'm going to say, actually, is related to his testimony which he has given today.  So can he be excused, although we are sorry for this to-and-fro movement.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I can assure counsel that the witness does not understand French.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I'm going to mention Rwandan names.  So I don't want to take any risk, Prosecutor.  I'm requesting only thirty minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment.

Would you kindly switch off your mike.  Yes, Witness.  Could you leave for a while.  We will inform you when we will have finished these deliberations.  The registry will approach you.  We are sorry for this inconvenience to you.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Thirty minutes is not a long time when you compare it to the benefit that we could obtain from the next three days.  You have noticed that this morning, Madam President, Your Honours, that our investigator had disappeared.  He went on mission to deal with a number of issues, and one of the issues specifically is related to this witness here.

The first point is the issue of the obtention of legal documents or several which have been referred to by this witness in the statement that he gave to the Prosecutor and signed.  This witness spent **********in prison.  We know that he was a subject of several judgements thanks to the statement or declaration which was disclosed to us by the Prosecutor.

We have the specific identification of the years, the sites where he was prosecuted or where he admitted to his criminal responsibility.  We think that, even if this arises from the efforts we are going to make between now and Monday, we will be able to obtain ourselves such materials, the previous 
legal and judicial records or documents.  

And I think on this you can be in agreement with what my learned colleague, Larochelle, has just read out, because this is very important when it comes to the issue of credibility of this witness as well as when it comes to the ascertainment of the facts or otherwise, although I understand that your Tribunal is not bound by any decision given by other courts in other countries.  That is my first point.

So in view of the possibility of us obtaining such materials, what is half an hour?  The second point is, in order to go to -- when it comes to the site, the witness places the scene where he says -- he accuses Callixte Nzabonimana to be at a place which is totally different from the place which he mentioned in a statement which he signed in 2002.  

You have that statement.  The witness signed a statement with a Prosecutor where it says that Callixte Nzabonimana got to the **************trading centre.  That centre is actually a small area where business is done.

However, today the witness told you about another place which is called Cungwe.  And when you look at the map which is there where a centimeter represents 500 metres, you'll notice that is not the same place as the**************** trading centre.  So I need the three days so that my investigator can tell me where that place is because it is not mentioned in the witness statement which he signed, and I was not there.  

I would like to know where the roadblock is.  I'm talking about the roadblock where the witness says that Callixte Nzabonimana passed through or went to.  I'm surprised to know that the Prosecutor talks about the testimony another time with his witnesses -- I'm surprised that the Prosecutor has not provided the Defence with a will-say statement to alert the Defence about new elements which allegedly occurred at another place in order to make the comparison with the place referred to here.  

It's like me working for one year -- working for one year here and whereby my client told me that he went to the Arusha hotel on the one hand and then when the witness testifies before the Court, he says, "No, no.  Actually, he meant he went to Impala hotel."  

These are not the same places.  So the Defence team finds itself in the same situation because we did not go to Cungwe which was not mentioned.  I'm not requesting something which is enormous and which will slow down the trial.
I think that I'll be in a better position to more effectively cross-examine this witness properly on Monday when I have obtained such information.  In any event, I need such elements to be in a position in order to fairly cross-examine this witness.  In other words, I'm requesting 20 minutes and that the evidence or the cross-examination of this witness be deferred to Monday.  It's now 5:10.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  You've taken ten minutes of the 30 minutes you requested.  Next time you should be more brief than that.

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
We are objecting to the postponement for 30 minutes  because, firstly, the matters that he is raising are not any different from what our learned friend, Mr. Larochelle, spoke about.

Secondly and most importantly, it's unlikely that they'll finish the cross-examination of this witness in the next half an hour.  So they can begin and then finish off on Monday with the documents that they will receive.  There is nothing -- it is simple logic.

Secondly and most importantly, the scale that he's talking about, New Arusha and Impala, are irrelevant here.  If somebody says that ************centre is in****************** cellule --***************** is a cellule.  So it is a matter that they can start cross-examining on immediately before they get their geography right and then confront this witness with the Gacaca records, which I can  assure them will not distinguish ***********************and ****************** as two different places.

So, My Lords, I'm saying that there is sufficient material on which to proceed with cross-examination immediately.  This is a very expensive Tribunal to run.  And counsel for the Defence should be the 
last person to request for a postponement on a baseless ground such as this.

We will not mind having this witness stay here until Monday, but they should start the cross-examination immediately.

As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have carefully listened to both parties, and in the interests of justice and in order to allow the Defence to fully prepare for this cross-examination, we will allow them the remaining minutes to organise themselves so that they are fully prepared to proceed with the cross-examination on Monday.  As we have granted them the time, we expect the cross-examination to proceed smoothly, expeditiously, and without any further interruptions.
So this case will be adjourned till Monday at 9 o'clock in the morning.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Before we break, Your Honour, there is a very important matter which must be resolved between the Prosecutor and I.  It is a question of whether we sit two days or four days next week.  

Your Honours spoke about it I think Monday or Tuesday, and we are not sure as to whether we are sitting for a full week next week or if we are only sitting two days, which we would like to know maybe before the weekend, if it's possible, to arrange in consequence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We would like to remind the parties that we indicated earlier on in the week that one of us has a commitment.  And, therefore, we will not be able to sit on Wednesday and Thursday next week.  So we will resume -- we will sit on Monday and Tuesday full day, and we will adjourn until the following Monday whose dates I'm not very sure of at the moment.

So we will not be sitting next week Wednesday and Thursday.

This matter is, accordingly, adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1720H)
