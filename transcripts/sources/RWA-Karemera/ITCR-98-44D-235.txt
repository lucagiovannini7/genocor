MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Good morning, Witness.  We hope that you had a good rest last night, a night of calm in which you prepared yourself for today's deposition.  While we wish you good health the whole of today, we invite you to today's session. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Since we are sitting outside our headquarters, I guess nothing has changed.  The Defence has finished its testimony, and the Prosecution -- as we announced yesterday, the Prosecutor would like to continue with his cross-examination.  And if I am not mistaken, it was in open session.  

Prosecutor, please, go ahead.   
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Indeed, I also see that the Defence Bar is as before. 
STRATON SIBOMANA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Now, Your Honour, we were dealing with a document that was placed before the witness yesterday.  Now, I would like to produce this document as Exhibit P. 16.  

	And, Your Honour, this document is in Kinyarwanda.  We shall endeavour, after a reasonable time, to have it translated.  And we shall then produce the English version as 16E and the French version as 16F, in due time.  

	As the Court pleases.  

So may the document be marked as Exhibit P. 16.  
(Exhibit No. P. 16 admitted) 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Your Honour, I definitely have no objection for whatsoever, that the document be registered.  However, before we go ahead, I would like to have the date of that document established.  We should know when that document was written. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.  Would you like to respond to that remark from the Defence?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Look at the first line of the document.  It seems to say 4th of March 2007.  And it has an official stamp at the bottom. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Prosecutor.  I am not clear -- it looks like this document has not appeared before us, unless I am mistaken.  Has the copy been provided to me?  It looks like we have not received that document you are talking about. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yesterday when the document was given over to the witness, I believe one was placed before the registry, if not, we have more copies that we can give to the Bench. 
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
Mr. Prosecutor, sir, I was not in the courtroom when that document was distributed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document is in Kinyarwanda, isn't it?  Once the Defence has that document and the witness has it -- you do have it, do you?  You can then go ahead, and you can deposit it as long as the Defence has no objection to that. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I have got a copy for the registry of the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It looks like the witness has something to say. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you for allowing me the floor.  Regarding this document, there are some allegations brought against me and some counts which were not brought against me, for which we are sitting here today.  However, they did not show me the document and they did not make me sign it, yet the law stipulates that the concerned individual must sign such a document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, I really want to know, what is it?  What is in this document?  What is it exactly?  Is it an indictment?  Is it a decision of a judgement?  What is it?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, that document as far as I have been advised, it is a summary of the document, and the Court signed below, by the Judges.  So it is a summary of the conviction of the witness.  This is the official document which he has no role in signing.  All we are trying to put to the Court is of which he answered in court, not that he made that document.  But it involves his trial.  

As the Court please. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
On the left right-hand side corner, we see something there written on page 5.  Is it possible for the Defence to have the entire document?  But once again, I want to reiterate that I have no objection to this document being used in court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, you have heard what the Defence is saying.  Can you supply the rest of the part of that document. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
But since we did not refer to the other parts of the document, I don't think it would be appropriate at this stage to admit it with the rest of the document so that he may use it for his own purposes later, but for now that is the official document that we have in respect to this charge.  

	If I may proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before it is admitted, I hope the Defence has no objection unless I am mistaken.  We have not yet read this document, unless I am really mistaken, perhaps if we could get a witness (sic) to sit next -- we could get an interpreter to sit next to the witness so that the -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The Prosecutor has given us a document which is dated 4th March 2007.  I would like the witness himself to confirm that the date appearing on that document is a right date because it doesn't appear to be that clear although the Prosecution has said it is the 4th of March 2007. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Prosecutor, are we talking about the same thing? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No, I don't think so.  This document was read -- it was read to him yesterday.  Now we are not saying that the witness is able to clarify anything before the Court apart from what it involves.  Actually the Prosecutor is not trying to say that the witness will give an explanation.  I don't think we can go further than that. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The information I have, Your Honour, is that this document is dated 4th November 2007 and 
	not 4th March 2007.  I don't think the Prosecutor is quite correct unless the witness attests to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, given the circumstances, the Court decides that this document be read out with an investigator -- an interpreter next to the witness so that this document can be read out.  

MR. LAROCHELLE: 
If there are no interpreters available, then the Defence investigator can help in doing that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court has no objection to the Defence investigators sitting next to him. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters are saying they are present.  They still have no objection in translating the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the document as in whole does not need full interpretation, then we can just read it out and we proceed.  

Witness, can you read that document out, starting from the heading -- letter head up to the lowest of the page where it appears to have something handwritten there.  You may please go ahead. 
THE WITNESS:
Can I start reading out.  Would you like me to read or explain something on this document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No observations.  You are just requested to read out that document, and the interpreters are going to interpret it. 
THE WITNESS:
"Republic of Rwanda, national Gacaca court judgement, today, 4th November 2007, Gacaca court of Kibangu secteur of the southern province, having examined -- having pronounced in the document in the case of Sibomana, Straton, son of Munazushyaka (phonetic) and Munamaziko (phonetic), having noted that the interested party, the person concerned asked or requested for pardon."  There is a box there that was particularly not accepted.  The Accused pleads not guilty on the following charges; having participated in the attacks, during which Ndidendereza and Ngoga were killed; refused to provide asylum (inaudible)."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English booth is not hearing anything anymore. 

The interpreter for the Kinyarwanda booth is asking the witness to read slowly for interpretation purposes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, you are asked to read at a slow pace so that interpreters can interpret what you are reading. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  May I go ahead now? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth interpreter would like to request the President to ask the witness to restart right from the beginning for ease of interpretation. 
THE WITNESS:
It would be better, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are wasting a lot of time.  It seems -- I wonder how we can go ahead.  Would it be possible -- this question is addressed to the Interpreters -- if you yourselves read out the document.  One reads out in Kinyarwanda, and the others interpret into the other two languages.  Is that possible.  Otherwise we are wasting a lot of time. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's possible, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are losing a lot of time.  Registrar, please provide a copy to the interpreters so that they can read it simultaneously. 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
	Yes, My Lord.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Summary of document, 4th November 2007, Gacaca court of appeals, Gacaca court, 
Kibangu secteur -- Secteur Kibangu, district Muhanga -- having considered the case of 
Straton Sibomana, son of Munazushyaka and Munamaziko, having established that the Accused entered a plea of guilty and asked for forgiveness -- confessional procedure not granted.  The Accused pleads not guilty for the following counts.  One, participation in the attack during which Ndidendereza and Ngoga were killed; two, refusal to grant refuge to the victims.  The Court hereby decides that 
Mr. Straton Sibomana is guilty of the following offences.  One, participation in the attack during which Ngoga and Ndidendereza were killed; two, refusal to provide refuge; three, encouraging persons to kill or encouraging the killers; is therefore convicted to a prison term of 19 years and sentenced to a prison term of 19 years.  Name and signature or fingerprint of the members of the bench that handed down the judgement.  Hitimana, Alexis; Musabyimangu; Habyarimana, Jonas; Dominique Sibomana; Bizimana and Dative Mukarurangwa.  District, name, signature or fingerprints of the accused person, Straton Sibomana.  Seal of the Gacaca court of Kibangu secteur.  District, eligible.  NB.  This document is filed prior to the delivery of the judgement, and a copy is forwarded to the Accused." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases.  Thank you.  

BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, I think now I can safely say that the document has been admitted into court; that is the ruling of the chamber in the first instance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have listened to the comments of the Prosecutor.  We have listened to Defence say that there is no objection, and we shall defer to admit the document to be identified at the headquarters or what would be the number, Registry?  
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
Yes, Mr. President.  On the list here it should be P. 16A for Kinyarwanda, B for English and C for French.  I do not know whether this is acceptable. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, we would prefer, if possible, to have it marked 16K for the Kinyarwanda document and for the English document 16E for English, and the French be marked 16F, if that pleases the Court just for ease of reference. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document is thus entered by the Bench sitting away from the headquarters, P. 16K for Kinyarwanda E for English, and F for French. 
(Exhibit No. P. 16K, 16E and 16F, admitted)
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now Witness, a few moments ago you said to the Court that you never signed that document; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  I never signed the document. 
Q.	What you are telling this Court is that the signature that appears at the bottom of that page is a forgery; is that correct? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Objection, objection.  The witness never said any such thing.  The witness never said any such thing.  I remember clearly that the translator read the name and fingerprint.  Once again, the Prosecutor bases his cross on false premise.  The witness never said it was a false signature. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, I think my learned friend is a little bit enthusiastic.  This morning, we are here in cross-examination, and cross-examination is clearly wider than examination-in-chief.  The witness was handed a document which he states he never signed.  He addressed Your Lordship, that he never signed the document.  Now the document that we have handed in as Exhibit 16 is signed under the name of Sibomana.  It is, therefore, a legitimate question to ask him whether that signature is a forgery.  And I don't think that my learned friend, the Defence Counsel, should openly attempt to protect the witness.  The witness is a learned person, also a sophisticated man, and understands the question.  So may that objection be overruled.  
As the Court please. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Your Honour, I would like the witness to take off his headset.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, take off your headset.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, allow the witness to be -- for thinking -- for having suggested to the witness which he didn't say.  If the Prosecutor were to establish the foundation on which he is coming to conclusions and start by asking the witness whether he is the one who effectively put down that name on the document, but he is further going down this proposition by the Prosecutor to the witness, and if it is to be put in that way, it would be a false suggestion.  It would be a way of putting words into the witness's mouth.  That is why I object to the manner in which the Prosecutor put his question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Following the remarks made by the parties, the Trial Chamber wishes to bring to the attention of the parties that the name Sibomana is mentioned on the document.  We, therefore, request the Prosecutor to expatiate on that point beginning from the year in which the document was drafted and what was the format or nature of Sibomana's signature and then determine whether it is or not Sibomana's signature because the Trial Chamber, from the statement submitted by Counsel, the signature appears to be quite different from the signature on annex A and, therefore, to come to the truth and mindful of the fact that the witness clearly said that he did not sign this document.  We go along the lines that we have suggested. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court, pleases. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, look at the bottom of that.  Yes, thank you.  Look at the bottom of that page.  Now read the last line, second but last line starting with the word "Izina, naumukono, name, signature or fingerprint of the accused, Sibomana, Straton."  
A.	I did not sign this document.  No, that is not my handwriting, and I did not receive this document on the delivery of the judgement.  And particularly I want to underscore the fact that there were charges brought against me and I was not notified thereof. 
Q.	That name appearing there is Sibomana; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that, indeed, is my name, but I did not write Sibomana, Straton, myself on this document. 
Q.	But that line purports that it was you who signed it; is that correct? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Objection.  Objection.  Name, signature or fingerprint.  There is nothing on that line which points to the fact that it was Mr. Sibomana himself who signed.  And by the way, Your Honour, it is the same person who wrote at the top of the page, and it is the same handwriting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Objection granted.  Mr. Prosecutor, please, rephrase or change your line of questioning.  Thank you.  The objection is sustained. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	It's very, very simple.  If somebody alleges that you wrote your name, that person would be alleging that that document is a forgery; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  It is a forgery.  It's a forged document.  I did not write the name Sibomana, Straton, on this document myself. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now let's move a bit further on.  Now, the two persons who were killed, Ndidendereza and Ngoga, did you know any of them before your trial in 2007? 
A.	I knew Ndidendereza and Ngoga well before my judgement.  Ndidendereza was a lecturer at Kabgayi and I used to see Ngoga when he was a driver at the nuns.  Although Ndidendereza and Ngoga were not my neighbours, I knew them. 
Q.	Would you also agree that Ndidendereza -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, I have a copy that had been placed before interpreters, the registry, and I hope it has been placed before you.  Unfortunately that name is not on the list of names. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, it is true that did you not only know Mr. Ndidendereza as a lecturer but he also taught your son; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  He was my son's teacher, and my son was Ndidendereza's junior brother's friend.  But I forget the name, but I can confirm that Ndidendereza's junior brother was my son's friend. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court which of your sons was taught by Ndidendereza? 
A.	My son's name is Octave Sibomana.  He graduated at the minor seminary, and then he went on to university. 
Q.	Correct.  He was one of your middle children; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Octave today lives in Norway; is that correct? 
A.	I don't know where he is presently.  Yes, I know that he is alive. 
Q.	But he lives in exile?
A.	I can confirm that he currently lives in exile.  The last news I got was that he is still alive.  But as at now, as at today, I do not know if he is still alive.  All I confirm is that he is in exile. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And do you also confirm that your son Octave was mentioned as one of the persons who also attacked Ndidendereza.  Are you aware of that? 
A.	I never learnt of that.  What I head rather was that Ndidendereza came to visit us at our home.  If you look at the report that was drafted by the bourgmestre of the commune on the 11th of October 1994, you would see that the bourgmestre confirms that Ndidendereza came to visit me at my home. 
Q.	That is correct.  Now the answer is that you do not know that your son was said to have been implicated in the killing of Ndidendereza; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Tell the Court, Witness, it is true isn't it, that when your son graduated, Ndidendereza withheld his leaving certificate?  Is that correct? 
A.	My son never had any problems with Ndidendereza.  It is Ndidendereza's junior brother and my son who graduated at the same time.  Rather my son graduated without any problem.  There wasn't any problem and he never had any problem with Ndidendereza. 
Q.	Witness, in fact you had to use your goodwill and charisma to persuade Ndidendereza to release that certificate which he did; is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  I did not conduct any manoeuvers to enable my son to obtain a certificate.  It is only through his own intelligence that he had obtained a certificate.  And by the way, I heard that he had good relation with his -- 
Q.	Witness, maybe you did not understand my question.  I am talking of the character certificate that is usually issued by the school.  Do you understand me? 
A.	I never entered into any agreement with Ndidendereza whatsoever with anything to do with my son. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, to this date as it comes to your knowledge that it is widely said that 
	Mr. Ndidendereza in issuing that certificate for your son extracted from you 100 francs.  Are you aware of that? 
A.	That is a false accusation.  I never paid any amount, whatsoever, to Ndidendereza.  That would have amounted to corruption.  I did not corrupt him. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, to this date and particularly during your trial, did it come to your notice that young men who were involved in the killing of Ndidendereza and Ngoga said that Ndidendereza was a harsh teacher and he often gave them bad grades as they killed him?  Did that come to your notice? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I heard mention of the fact that one Dominic of the former student of the minor seminary said such statement.  Then they found Ndidendereza in a bar, and it was Dominic who actually failed to obtain his certificate because of Ndidendereza. 
Q.	Witness, is it correct that you had in this charge the killing of Ngoga and Ndidendereza, initially you offered a guilty plea which was rejected by the appeal court; is that true? 
A.	I entered a plea of guilty in the case and stated that I went to the location where Ngoga and Ndidendereza were killed.  I went through that area on my way back from Gisenyi.  That is what I acknowledged. 
Q.	Otherwise, Mr. Sibomana, you acknowledged that when these two individuals lost their lives you knew about it and you were present; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is totally correct, and it is for that reason that I entered a guilty plea to the extent that I was present at the location when the attackers were boasting that they had killed an Inyenzi but I was not cautious enough to go and look at the dead bodies.  That is what I acknowledged. 
Q.	Witness, tell this Court now clearly at the time when these two individuals were killed, did you see your son Octave present there either as an onlooker or one of the perpetrators?
A.	No, Octave, my son, was not present at that location. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I put it to you, Witness, that when you were at that location you had a pistol with you; is that correct? 
A.	I had a pistol in my jacket because I went about with my pistol.  At that particular time, I was back on my way from missions.  And whenever I went on missions, I had my pistol on me. 
Q.	Among the persons you saw at the killing was Édouard Kabanda; is that correct? 
A.	When I arrived at the scene, I left my vehicle besides the scene.  I found Habyakere's elder brother and I fund Édouard Karemera and many of them.  I asked them what had just happened at that place. 
Q.	We will come to that, that is not my question.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, if you look at the spelling list of proper nouns, I am talking about No. 7. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Did you see Édouard Kabanda at the scene of the killing, that is my question? 
A.	There was a crowd of people, I didn't see Édouard Kabanda. 
Q.	Thank you.  You did not see him.  What about Nzehimana, Emmanuel, number 38 on the spelling list? 
A.	I was not able to see him on that occasion.  Rather it appears that those people were in a drinking joint where Ndidendereza had been arrested. 
Q.	So you are qualifying your answer by saying that it came to your knowledge that Kabanda, Édouard, that is, had something to do with the transaction that ended in the killing of Ndidendereza and Ngoga; is that correct? 
A.	Among the people mentioned for having been in the drinking joint those names are mentioned. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, Ndidendereza is number 36. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Did you see him in the crowd at that time? 
A.	No, I did not see him at that time.  I am sorry I stopped along the road behind the Tribunal there were a number of people who were talking out in loud voices and were boasting for having killed the Inyenzi.  
I never joined to see who was there and who was not. 
Q.	Can you tell His Lordship whether these three persons who were killed were teachers?  Do you know that? 
A.	Thank you.  Edras Ngendahayo and Édouard Kabanda were former teachers.  Emmanuel who was nicknamed Gikamba, was also a teacher. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
G-I-K-A-M-B-A. 
BY MR. NG'AURA:
Q.	Were these persons well known to you and you knew them; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I did know them.  Moreover, many people of our area knew me and I knew them as well. 
Q.	But you are not telling the Court with that regard that they lived in your house that was behind the bank in Kivumo cellule; is that not so? 
A.	I had a house in which students used and some teachers used to live, but I do not recall exactly which teacher used to live in which house.  Yes, Kabanda was one of my tenants.  There was also a certain magistrate who used to live in the premises. 
Q.	Now that your mind is focused there, you agree that three other persons lived in your house.  You agree with that.  You can't forget that? 
A.	One of those teachers used to sign the tenancy agreement, and that same teacher used to allow his fellow teachers to deal with him, but I would deal with the individual who signed the agreement with me. 
Q.	Witness, at the time when these killings were taking place during the genocide and in particular from 6th April 1994 to July 1994, there were groups of killers moving around Nyakabanda who were popularly known as Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	The word Interahamwe emanated from a song; by a group of Habyanyaramatu which used to sing. The meaning was that, "Go ahead, the youth of Rwanda."  The people who work together are called Interahamwe although there were people who used to kill people in our area. 
Q.	Witness, I know you are an old man.  You have limited time.  Just simplicity would suffice.  In Nyakabanda at the relevant time there were groups of persons who went around killing people, and they were called Interahamwe; is that correct or is it not correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Those power people who used to kill others were called Interahamwe and abapawa. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And these groups, as far as you know, were prevalent throughout Rwanda; is that correct?  They were killing people throughout Rwanda, these Interahamwe; correct? 
A.	Yes, if you allow me, Mr. Prosecutor, you could ask me questions about the criminals that used to know who killed the individuals in the Nyakabanda commune. 
Q.	Next time, but for now I just want to deal with those general groups.  Witness, anybody saying that Nyakabanda was spared from the scourge of Interahamwe would not only be lying but that person would be denying the fact that Interahamwe were the killers; is that correct? 
A.	If anyone claims that the crimes committed in Nyakabanda were not frightful, that would be totally -- that person would be a criminal himself. 
Q.	Witness, you are a sophisticated old man, but because I have only been given a few hours, my question is, during the material time, during the genocide, anybody who said that Interahamwe did not kill people in Nyakabanda -- that person, as you say, is not only denying the fact but he is a criminal himself.  Is that not to say simply? 
A.	Yesterday I took an oath to say the truth, and I am telling the truth.  Now, all the people that killed others were Interahamwe, and I said it in the various documents that I have written.  In Nyakabanda the Interahamwe who killed people were the Interahamwe called Interahamwe power. 
Q.	Witness, you gave a statement to counsel for the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are entirely correct. 
Q.	In the form of an affidavit which you signed on the 3rd of September 2009; is that correct? 
A.	Excuse me, would you mind repeating that question. 
Q.	(Inaudible) on the 3rd of September 2009 the statement you gave to learned counsel for 
	Callixte Nzabonimana; is that correct? 
A.	I sent them the document of my testimony to Gacaca in 2005.  There is an additional document now that is typewritten.  There's another document that is handwritten.  Perhaps we might need to look at both of them. 
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, I am sorry, but my question is very simple and straightforward.  When counsel came to see you, you gave them a statement; isn't it.  And you signed it on the 3rd of September 2009.  Forget all other things but that statement in particular. 
A.	Are you talking of the witness statement?  May I also ask you the question.  Is it the document in which I testified before the Gacaca courts, Mr. Prosecutor?  Can you be clear on which document you are talking about. 
Q.	Sorry.  I will clarify because it's very simple.  On the 3rd of September 2009, my learned colleague sitting across the isle came to see you; is that correct? 
A.	I gave him a document which I signed, and I can recognise it. 
Q.	Yes, and that statement that you gave, this was in support of this Chamber granting a request for you to testify from this location -- is that correct -- rather than being taken to Arusha?  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  I am not trying to -- I am not intending to tire you.  I remember very well that was the case. 
Q.	And in that statement that you gave, you talked about your advanced years and that you were born in 1929, correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	And Counsel had informed you that this is a serious document which must contain the truth; is that correct?  He cautioned you about the necessity of this document:  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	And subsequently you signed that document; correct? 
A.	Yes, I signed that document. 
Q.	And Counsel read it back to you and you confirmed the trustfulness and the faithfulness of his recording of your testimony, correct? 
A.	You are right again. 
Q.	Now let me read to you what you said to the Court because this was a document that was to be used by his Honour and two other Judges.  Let me read to you paragraph 7.  And 7 says -- I quote.  "In reality there were no Interahamwe militia at Nyakabanda of which the vast majority of the population were followers of the MDR".  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, I said that. 
Q.	"(Inaudible) militia called Interahamwe who went around killing people?"  Why did you say then something which was not true? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Hold on, Mr. Sibomana.  Mr. Sibomana, we would like to request you to remove your headset, please. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May I request the Witness Protection Section to ask Mr. Sibomana, who has good understanding of French, if he may just step outside to stretch a little bit so that my friend and I can talk about this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sibomana, you can please relax a bit.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The witness said that there were Interahamwe called abapawa and that word was well defined when -- were testifying that those are people who committed killings.  So proposing to the witness that there is a contradiction in what he said, I think we should give the opportunity to the witness to clearly express himself.  I will not agree that there was a contradiction unless the witness is given the opportunity to explain himself. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, I am a bit surprised by my learned friend's objection.  I will tell you why.  The witness has said that there were no Interahamwe in his area.  We are talking about Interahamwe, and these were called Abapawa.  And in another answer he said he recognised that there were Interahamwe called Abapawa.  Now, that is a matter that can be explored by my learned friend in re-examination.  That question is not explored.  I have read to the witness what he wrote in his affidavit to this Court which culminated in our being here today.  I do not see the basis of the wisdom of my learned friend in trying to 
	overprotect the testimony of this witness.  It's not necessary that whenever a serious issue of credibility comes up then an objection follows.  As in this case then, the witness must respond.  And we, as counsel, must sit down and listen.  We have to desist ourselves from the sensitivity of overprotecting the witness.  We should not necessarily be seen to be overprotective. The issue whether there was Interahamwe and those of them -- or whatever he is talking about -- but at this stage the witness must try and show the Court that one is different from the other; Interahamwe and Abapawa group, are they the same.  I find this objection should be -- should really be overruled.  As the Court pleases. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Mr. President, I find it regrettable that any objection raised by the Defence the Prosecution say that it is wrong and totally wrong.  Now, the second thing is that we are not here to follow what the Prosecutor says.  We are here to agree on what the witness says.  He should talk on the contents of what the witness has said so that we establish whether he is saying the truth.  The semantic is important.  There were several groups that were mentioned during the deposition, and the Prosecutor is grouping everything and accusing the witness of contradicting himself in his declaration.  We have the Interahamwe, and we have the Abapawa group.  My objection is I don't believe that there is a contradiction between the testimony today and what was written in the witness statement without putting the foundation.  That is what is important.  The Prosecutor sees a contradiction that has not yet been established.  I only want him to do it appropriately and objectively and in a manner that is not questionable when he says A on one occasion and B on another occasion. and that A and B are indeed irreconcilable; otherwise, the exercise has no value whatsoever.  It has no truth that is within the framework of re-examination.  

	To do justice to the witness, I must correct all the wrong propositions that the Prosecutor mentioned to the witness because the goal of the Prosecutor is to find the truth.  I have to go even further to prove what the witness is saying.  It is not my obligation to correct the wrong comments the Prosecutor made to the witness to date.  These contradictions must be established, and I strongly object to this approach of questioning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have heard the comments of the Prosecutor and the counter-comments from the Defence, the explanations by the Defence, and I feel that the question should be raised and must be answered by the witness.  As a matter of fact, initially, it appeared that I was -- there was some contradiction in the narration of the witness with regard to the declaration for which an affidavit was signed.  The witness, therefore is under obligation to explain clearly why such a contradiction arises.  

May the witness return to the courtroom.  Thank you.
(Witness entered the courtroom) 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Judge.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I hope that you have stretched and you are now a bit even more refreshed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I am feeling well. 
Q.	Now, Witness, explain to the Judge the contradiction that appears between what you told the Court here in your testimony and what you told counsel in your affidavit with regard to that there were no Interahamwe in Nyakabanda. 
A.	All depends on the terminology that I used.  Maybe it is the source of the contradiction.  It is true there were Interahamwe, and I even mentioned names of some of those Interahamwe members of the MRND and the other Interahamwe who were members of MDR who we knew.  And those Interahamwe of the MRND were wrongdoers.  And I confirm also that there were some Interahamwe in our commune who were called Interahamwe abapawa. 
Q.	Witness, I think you have left the Judge in exactly the same position, in my view, as he was before your explanation.  The question is how do you explain the obvious contradiction between saying that indeed there was an Interahamwe, as you have said before this Court, in Nyakabanda, and in the year 2009 statement, 3rd September, you said there were no Interahamwe in Nyakabanda.  So this is what we want the Judge to understand.  If you have -- don't have an explanation, you can say so.  If you don't, you can say so.  That is all I am asking from you. 
A.	I wanted to talk of the Interahamwe and I was referring to the Interahamwe that came from Satinsyi who used to come and kill Tutsis in our commune.  At the time those Interahamwe who used to come in from Satinsyi, but during the genocide there were indeed Interahamwe in our commune. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, let's go to another matter.  In 1989 you had an illustrious career as prior to that as a school teacher and I heard that you were also inspector of schools, in Nyakabanda; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  I was a teacher.  Later on I was director of schools, Inspector of schools and I would also like to confirm that I also became a bourgmestre. 
Q.	As you testified yesterday -- I am just recapping what you said yesterday -- this was indeed the height of your career and that you knew a lot of important people in the Gitarama as a whole, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	And as civic leader for more than 28 years in that capacity and even more as director and as a teacher, you knew all the important personalities, you knew all the bourgmestres and probably throughout Rwanda; is that correct? 
A.	You are right, Prosecutor. 
Q.	And when you visited Kigali, for instance, you would be able to have access to important offices; is that not correct? 
A.	Yes, I would meet some authorities.  I often went to the ministry for the interior.  I also visited the Adrachose organisations for assistance for development projects.  And on those occasions I had the opportunity to meet some authorities within Kigali. 
Q.	In 1989 would you, for instance, know all the party leaders of different parties within Gitarama in 1989? 
A.	I knew them, those that were in Gitarama. 
Q.	And you knew all the ministers in Gitarama; correct? 
A.	You are right, Prosecutor. 
Q.	And also you met with these people from time to time; correct? 
A.	You are right. 
Q.	Did you know a young man who was born in 1953 who in 1989 was a charismatic minister for planning and he came from Gitarama? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	His name was Callixte Nzabonimana; correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  Callixte Nzabonimana was at the time minister of planning and at the time I knew him. 
Q.	In 1989 you were about 60 years old, having been born in 1929; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	You must have been completely impressed with this young man who was only 28 years old and he was a minister.  He must have impressed you tremendously; is that not correct? 
A.	Many people were surprised at his promotion as a minister at his age.  At that time he used to say that these were the young generation that were coming in to replace the old generation. 
Q.	Absolutely.  I am talking about you in particular.  You have been around.  You have seen him grow, and now he is a minister.  You are impressed; isn't it? 
A.	My eldest son was born in 1953.  So when the president of the republic used to make appointments, we did not have any comment.  A bourgmestre would not comment when the president appointed someone.  I would not have the right to say that the president has appointed an old man or a young man for that matter. 
Q.	Callixte was the same age as your son Alfred; is that not correct? 
A.	I do not know when Callixte Nzabonimana was born.  Whether he was born in 1953, then he is the same age as my son Alfred.  You are right.  If he was born in '53, he is exactly the same age as my son. 
Q.	He was described as a charismatic minister.  
A.	You are perfectly right.  When he was minister, he was congratulated.  It was only later when people called him Bwarayaze. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
We didn't get the appropriate English translation of Bwarayaze. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Bwarayaze, B-W-A-R-A-Y-A-Z-E, Bwarayaze. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, explain to the Court what does Bwarayaze mean, very briefly? 
A.	People used to say that he had gotten into a road accident, he was hospitalised into the hospital, and following that accident he had became a bit -- become a bit mad or crazy, and that is why people nicknamed him Bwarayaze. 
Q.	But that was the political view that the young man was charismatic; is that correct? 
A.	You are perfectly correct. 
Q.	Around 1989, when he was minister for planning, you and him had a lot in common because you also belonged to the MRND; correct? 
A.	Starting from 1989, I was no longer an active supporter of the MRND.  I had even written to the president of the republic that he allows me to vacate my post, and these reasons were forwarded regarding me to vacate the post of bourgmestre. 
Q.	But in fact your friend Habyarimana, the president of the republic at that time, asked you to continue; is that not correct? 
A.	You are right because I had requested for financing for constructing a school building -- schools and when I put in my request to retire -- to be removed from that post and that construction had not yet been accomplished, it worked against my request and it was not in my favour. 
Q.	But the question is that you came from the same party and this young man was now the chairman of this MRND in Gitarama for which you were a member; correct? 
A.	Well, while I was still a member of MRND, the president at Gitarama at the level of the préfecture was the préfet, and when I was bourgmestre, I was president of the MRND at the commune level.  And the commune councillors were also presidents in the communes and so on downwards.  I think that Nzabonimana was president of the MRND in the renewed MRND.  And by that time I had left that party myself. 
Q.	All I want you to establish is that this is a person you had a working relationship within the party; is that correct? 
A.	The practice is that all Rwandans were de facto members of the MRND.  And so because we were all Rwandans, he and myself were members of the MRND and we pursued the same goals within the party. 
Q.	Witness, I have a feeling that you are trying to artificially distance yourself from knowing 
	Callixte Nzabonimana in 1989; is that correct? 
A.	I have nothing against Callixte Nzabonimana.  There's no conflict, and I cannot distance myself from him.  We have never had any problems, that is, between myself and him. 
Q.	Callixte Nzabonimana is not somebody who would ignore you at any time.  When he visits Gitarama if he saw you, he would come and shake hands with the grand bourgmestre of Gitarama; is that not correct? 
A.	That is correct, but allow me to tell you an incident which saddened me. 
Q.	(Inaudible)... about that.  Now, Witness, I take it from you that you were not envious of this young man of his national politics, were you? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Would you, therefore, explain to the Court why it is that you say that between 1992, and in fact up to the end of the genocide you really had nothing to do with him, you didn't visit him, you only saw him once; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	As an educated man of home affairs, do you find that strange that this young man whom you knew quite well in Nyakabanda, a man who was young enough to be your son, you never met him in 1992.  At the end of 1994, you saw him and you never even talked to him? 
A.	It is true that this might appear to be surprising, but from September 1991, the Interahamwe power killed my child.  They opened his chest, and they cut my daughter's arm.  And all of this continued until the time I was stone, when my vehicle was destroyed.  I still have the scars to show for that.  And since the death of Evalde, I never had any contact.  I was surprised, but later on I learnt that I should not be surprised by those acts because I was no longer a member of the same team as himself, and later on the flag of PCD party was flying. 
Q.	Witness, let's, first of all, deal with the accident of your son Evalde in Kigali in 1992.  Is it not correct, Witness, that it was said that the attack on the house in Kicukiro in which your son was killed, it was attacked by Tutsis?  It was said that?  Do you know? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, Kicukiro is number 29 on the list. 
THE WITNESS:
Can I answer the question now.  Well, my son-in-law was first killed in 1991, on the 
15th of September 1991.  My son was killed in Kabeza where he had bought a house and had planned to settle there.  He was killed on the 13 September 1993.  Well, you know also that activities by political parties were intense at the time and therefore -- I also understand that members of my family were killed because of party politics, because we all belonged to the same political party.  I am sorry.  Allow me to say that at the time Tutsis were not strong enough to attack anybody.  In fact, they were victims at the time. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, can you clarify about the death of your son.  The first death we got was 15th September, and subsequently we got 14th September 1993.  Which one do you mean? 
A.	Rather, he was killed on the 14th of September 1993 while the son-in-law was killed on 
	the 15th September 1991.  
Q.	Witness, tell the Court when your son Evalde was killed in 1991, did you hear it being said -- quote that word.  Did you hear it being said that the reason or the killing of your son was because of your activities in the massacres of Tutsis in 1973?  Did you hear it said? 
A.	Your Honour, my son was killed because the attackers found that myself and my sons had moved to Kabeza while others were at COFORWA at Kicukiro, and those are the people who killed him I believe.  If anybody claims that it was because of the fact that Tutsis were killed in 1973, all of that must be a rumour.  As far as I am concerned, it is the people from Nyakabanda who were after us who killed my son. 
Q.	Witness, you misunderstood my question a little.  I am asking not what was the reality as you saw it, but whether it was said -- whether you know that people said it. 
A.	Yes, those types of rumours were mentioned simply to mislead people. 
Q.	Witness, do you accept that in 1973, when you were a very powerful man, that the massacres of Tutsis took place in Nyakabanda.  Do you acknowledge that? 
A.	I agree with you on that point.  And by the way, the massacre of Tutsis in my commune caused me to face many problems. 
Q.	That the killing of Tutsis in Nyakabanda commune was particularly intense, almost all the Tutsis were killed; is that correct? 
A.	I agree entirely with you.  What you say is correct. 
Q.	At that time of the `73 massacres, Kayibanda was the president; that's correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And there was a specific spirit, an ideology at that time among MRND members and especially those close to Kayibanda, to remove the 1959 revolution, especially the Tutsi, correct? 
A.	That is what happened in Nyakabanda.  Criminals came and killed Tutsis in Nyakabanda. 
Q.	And during your trial, the trial for which now you are serving a sentence, a certain woman by the name of Marie Claire Mukamitali testified.  Number 2 on the list. 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	She did testify that she was a survivor of some of the atrocities in 1973, correct? 
A.	Yes, she actually said that. 
Q.	She also said that after your son was killed in 1991, Evalde, on 14th September, she was arrested and questioned; correct? 
A.	That is what she said, but I am not sure whether she was interrogated because I did not live in Kigali at the time. 
Q.	Correct.  I agree with you, but you will agree with me that during the massacres you met her when she had escaped from Nyabarongo river and she came by your office; correct? 
A.	That is correct.  And I have been in possession of the documents of the investigation I conducted at the time.  And the document contains the names of persons whom I arrested at the time in connection with that case. 
Q.	In fact, it was being said in your trial with respect to this 1973 massacre that you are the main coordinator of these killings in which all the living of Marie Claire were wiped out; correct? 
A.	That was her testimony, but she forgot to mention that I was the one who granted her refuge when they came asking for help.  If you want, I can provide or I can expatiate on this point.  And if you so desire, I can also give you the copy of the report of the interview I conducted after Mukamitali came out of the river.  There was another young child whom I also recovered at the same time as that lady.  I conducted that interview on the 17th February 1973. 
Q.	Witness, at the time of the 1973 attack, you were hailed by Kayibanda as a good example of a good bourgmestre who should be emulated by the whole of Rwanda; correct? 
A.	That is not correct.  I am sorry, but if you gave me a second, I would say that if there had been no 
	coup de téte at the time in '73, I was about to be killed because I had drafted a letter which must be available at the préfecture, at the minister of interior or the archive of the president.  My own copy was taken away from me when I was trying to photocopy the letter I had written to the president that the president of first instance had released more than 20 people whom I had arrested for having killed Tutsis.  The president had issued that no one should be held in prison.  They told the -- that all the Tutsis were to be killed.  One of my sons came to my home and sought refuge, and an attacker came to attack my home.  I fired into the home.  So I took the child and handed him to Father Bourguet.  And then Michel came to tell me that the attackers had wanted to dump the victims in the Nyabarongo river.  So that priest and myself -- and I found Mukamitali as well as one young boy by the name of Sylvain whose teeth had been pulled out.  I took those persons to the communal office, and all those persons who were killed were as a result of what Sematama and Max were doing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I would urge you to abstain from providing explanations that don't have a direct bearing on the question.  Do you agree? 
THE WITNESS:
	I have understood you very well, Your Honour. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	During your examination-in-chief, Witness, you created the impression before the Honourable Judge that you had nothing to do with the massacres and that you are of a good character; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Serveine Ndutiye? 
A.	I know that person and I know his son whose name is Ndutiye.  I know that person and his wife. 
Q.	It appears on number 7.  And his wife had four children with him; that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	No.  At the time of the events, she was at the maternity about to give birth. 
Q.	You are right.  You are extremely right and that Ndutiye's son was your godchild; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	It is true, isn't it, that when the attacks began, the wife had just delivered a child at the maternity ward at the COFORWA and that you ordered some people to go and -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I apologise to the interpreters.  I think I was moving too fast. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	And at the attack of 1993 you took this family, including the newly born child and your friend's wife, and put them under the care of Father Bourguet? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	But subsequently, you sent other people to remove and brought all those Tutsis for protection at the Kibungo office where you had protection? 
A.	No, that is not correct. 
Q.	Have you ever heard that version said before, what I have just told you? 
A.	No, it is true that I took them to Father Bourguet, but I never heard anyone say that I asked them to be brought to the communal office. 
Q.	Do you remember that those people were killed in Nyabarongo?  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I do clearly remember that incident. 
Q.	And that this young boy, Ndutiye's son, who is your godson miraculously, escaped at the river.  Do you know that? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And subsequently, as he tried to escape, a good Samaritan got hold of the child and brought him to your house where you kept him; correct? 
A.	I am the one who took him at Kibungo.  Father Bourguet had just told me that some people had just been killed - sorry.  I did not live at Kibungo at the time.  I used to live at the Kagogwe. 
Q.	Just answer my question.  This young boy was brought to your house, and you kept him; is that correct? 
A.	I am the one who brought him to my house from the location where I had found him. 
Q.	That is not correct.  He was brought there by a certain lady; correct? 
A.	That is a lie.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court, that child was subsequently removed from your house by the aunty? 
A.	Rather, I am the one who took him to his aunt's place in Biryogo, here in Kigali. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
B-I-R-Y-O-G-O, Biryogo.
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	I put it to you that the aunty who is still alive removed him from your house when they discovered that you were behind the killing of his parents because they were Tutsis; is that not correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  Gaudence came to my home later on to ask for Ndutiye's land to be sold so that people may not take it over for free, but I am the one who took Lambert Nditiye to her house. 
Q.	Do you know the person by the name of Dr. Kinyebuye?
A.	Yes, I know him.  He was the doctor at the Kibangu health centre. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
It is number 23 on the list. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	He was a Tutsi; correct? 
A.	Yes, he is Tutsi. 
Q.	He was your friend? 
A.	Yes, he was a friend.  His daughter had just had a baby.  When I was talking, I asked Kinyebuye to join us at Father Bourguet's.  At the time we were leaving, he was finalising a number of things. 
Q.	Ndutiye and his family and his daughter were subsequently killed at Nyabarongo river; correct? 
A.	It is Ndutiye and the young lady.  It is those that were killed. 
Q.	And (inaudible); correct? 
A.	That is incorrect. 
Q.	Now, they were brought to Kibangu and subsequently taken to Nyabarongo; is that correct? 
A.	I left them at Father Bourguet's, and then I took a lady who was wounded on her arm, and 
	she came along with her son.  I took them to the Buhoro health centre.  And yes, they were taken to 
	Father Bourguet's -- to the Nyabarongo. 
Q.	We shall show the Court that that is not correct.  They were taken to Nyabarongo.  Now, you know Karori, a teacher? 
A.	Yes, I know him.  Yes, he was a Tutsi. 
Q.	And he and his wife Speciose and Karori were killed under your orders; is that not correct? 
A.	That's not correct. 
Q.	Now, you knew a gentleman called Pascal; correct? 
A.	Yes, I knew him and it was at his place that I accommodated Mukamitali. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, Pascal is number 28 on the spelling list. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	When Marie Claire Mukamitali was found at Kibangu, you were with Pascal; correct? 
A.	Yes, and I handed over Mukamitali to him.  At the time Pascal was communal conseiller. 
Q.	At the time Marie Claire was found, you were coming out of the meeting; security meeting, with Pascal; correct? 
A.	You are right, I was getting out of a meeting during which we had said that the killing must stop and if you looked at the archives, you would find a letter which I wrote in that respect to condemn those who were carrying out killings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe, Prosecutor, would you like to mention the date of that accident you are mentioning.  Thank you. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  This was in 1973 at Kibangu in Nyakabanda.  This goes to the character of this witness. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, is that true?  Was it in 1993, in Nyakabanda? 
THE WITNESS:
It was not 1993.  If I am allowed, I am even ready to give you the date of when that incident took place and even the name of the persons who signed that. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	These things -- you are not hearing them for the first time.  They were said in the trial for which you are sentenced, correct? 
A.	You are right, but when I was accused of those crimes, I was released, and when all those facts were mentioned, I was not present. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, don't you think that we can take a short break. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
It is an appropriate time to take the break.  And after the break, I will show -- and after that I will -- I think I will be very, very short. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

Witness, you are also going to take a short break so that you relax a bit.  Let's break for 20 minutes and we resume here at exactly 11:30.  And as the Prosecutor has said, you will have some more time before you conclude your remarks. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
That's -- but I will not extend the lunch hour so that we have an early lunch today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  So we break for 20 minutes.
(Court recessed at 1100H)
(Pages 1 to 23 by Judith Kapatamoyo)
















(Court resumed at 1130H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
These proceedings are resumed.  

Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, do you agree with me -- can you hear me, Mr. Sibomana? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you. 
Q.	Do you agree with me that the massacres of 1973 in which all the Tutsis were killed in Nyakabanda could not have been possible without the connivance and the planning of the government, do you agree with that? 
A.	I agree with you. 
Q.	And at that time, you were the head of government in Nyakabanda; correct? 
A.	That is correct, but stronger people than I came on board later. 
Q.	These massacres not only involved the government, but also the Hutus in the cellules; is that correct? 
A.	Those Hutus were mobilised to commit the killings. 
Q.	How long did that mobilisation take? 
A.	Two days only. 
Q.	And after the 1973 massacres, you continued to be bourgmestre.  You were not accused by the government for failure to cooperate; correct? 
A.	That is correct.  I myself launched a complaint against the criminals, but the government did not want to listen to what I wanted to tell them. 
Q.	Witness, if, indeed, the killing of your son in 991 was as a result of rivalry between MDR and MRND, the MRND was -- sorry, the MDR should have attacked you in Nyakabanda where they were stronger; is that not correct? 
A.	They attacked my home on several occasions until I left my residence.  They did everything they could. 
Q.	But your son, Evalde, he was a (inaudible) living far away in Kigali.  Do you see the reason why people say that he was killed as a revenge killing to make you feel pain for what you did in '73? 
A.	No, I had sought refuge at the same time as himself, otherwise, members of the political parties were tracking us down because we did not belong to the same party as themselves. 
Q.	Subsequently, at the height of the genocide, you were in Nyakabanda; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And during that time no one was trying to kill you; correct? 
A.	I tried to escape from the attackers.  I was in hiding, but I know that the attackers did not trust me because I was working with the priests' to hide the Tutsis. 
Q.	Witness, you've been convicted for failure to give refuge to Tutsis; correct, not for giving refuge to Tutsis, do you agree with me? 
A.	That was a count that was subsequently added and that is the reason for which I was not shown that document for signature. 
Q.	In 1992, when -- or, 1991, when you saw Callixte Nzabonimana with Bikindi, did Callixte Nzabonimana have animosity towards you at that time? 
A.	No, he did not express any animosity towards me at the time, but I did not have any discussion with him either. 
Q.	When you saw him, you were quite close to him; is that not correct, with Bikindi? 
A.	Yes, I even said good day to him. 
Q.	And did he say -- did he respond?  Did you exchange pleasantries with him? 
A.	At the time, I was no longer bourgmestre and I said good day to him like anyone would say good day to another person, then I returned to join the crowd and to watch the performance being given by the dancers. 
Q.	And you even shook hands; correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Correct me if I am wrong, but there is a record.  During your examination-in-chief, you never said that you shook hands, you said that you saw him from a distance; is that not correct?  Why did you omit to say that you shook hands? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I went forward, stretched out my hand, as anyone would do in the presence of a figure of distinction, then I went back to the crowd.  I did not sit with those personalities because I no longer enjoyed the benefit of the honours that I used to enjoy when I was bourgmestre. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I put it to you that throughout the genocide, you remained very close to 
Callixte Nzabonimana, and, in fact, he spent a lot of time with you.  
A.	Throughout the duration of the genocide, I was not Callixte Nzabonimana's neighbour.  By the way I do not live in his native commune, and you, therefore, can understand why it is that I did not meet him often. 
Q.	But you were the neighbour to his uncle; is that not correct? 
A.	It is correct that I am his uncle's neighbour. 
Q.	And his name is Rutambuka; correct?  
A.  	Yes, that is correct.  His name is André Rutambuka. 
Q.	Are you sure, Witness, that you never saw Callixte Nzabonimana during the genocide visit his uncle, Rutambuka? 
A.	I did not see him, but I learnt that he had gone to Rutambuka, with Rutambuka's son-in-law.  That both of them had actually gone to visit Rutambuka. 
Q.	And that was in the month of May 1994; is that correct? 
A.	No, not in May, it was before the month of May.  I am sorry; it was not in May, it was before the month of May. 
Q.	During the genocide? 
A.	No, not at the time of the genocide.  It was before the death of President Habyarimana.  People said that Callixte Nzabonimana and the director who was Rutambuka's son-in-law had gone to visit Rutambuka. 
Q.	In your examination-in-chief, you said that you had never been to Ndiza; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Yet you forgot and said later that the road to Ndiza was very rough and your car could not climb there, do you remember? 
A.	People heard it that the vehicle could take up to 25 persons, but I said that it could have been -- that would have been impossible and I said that it would have been impossible with that number of persons in the vehicle to climb to the top of that hill. 
Q.	Again, you didn't understand my question or you are evading it.  What I am saying, Witness, is this:  You told the Court you had never been to Ndiza, and later you told the Court that the road to Ndiza was very rough, and, therefore, your car could not have gone up.  How come you knew about the road to Ndiza, if you have never been there? 
A.	I used the Ndiza road to accompany Father Bourguet.  In fact, I went beyond Ndiza to an even more distant location. 
Q.	So now you are modifying your answer to say that, "Yes, I have been to Ndiza and I have even passed through Ndiza."  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, I am talking about the chain of mountains known as Ndiza, which separates Nyakabanda commune from Nyabikenke.  That chain of mountains begins in Muringa and runs through Nyakabanda and on to Ndusu commune in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Witness, after your son, Evalde, died, he left a house vacant at Nkundo centre; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And that house was under your care; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, did you ever hear -- and listen carefully.  Did you ever hear that in front of that house sometime in 1992, going to 1993, an MRND flag was hoisted there, did you ever hear of it? 
A.	The MDR flag was flying at the communal centre and that was in front of the MRND headquarters next to the multipurpose hall.  Yes, I saw that with my own eyes. 
Q.	You have not answered my question.  My question is:  In front of your son's house, did you ever hear about that place that an MRND flag was hoisted? 
A.	No.  However, the distance from my son's residence to the MRND headquarters is about 100 metres and the flag was flying at the MRND headquarters at a distance of 100 to 200 metres between my son's house and the location at which the MRND flag was hoisted. 
Q.	In fact, you knew about it because that flag had been given to some youths who were very closed to you and you asked them to use Evalde's house as their headquarter; is that not correct? 
A.	No, the MRND office was rather located elsewhere and the hall still exist even today.  I can give you an outlay of the location and you will find the MRND flag's position.  

As for my son's house, and if memory does not fail me, I enabled the -- I allowed the Tutsis who had come from elsewhere to lodge in that house, and one of them was Habyakare, Abdallah's, father-in-law, his wife and his children.  Those Tutsis did not have any difficulty in that house.  I even obtained mattresses from COFORWA for them. 
Q.	Witness, do you confirm that Kabanda, Eduardo, the teacher, was a leader of Interahamwe in Nyakabanda? 
A.	Yes, he was the representative of the MRND party in Nyakabanda commune. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Spelling of the name please, Prosecutor.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Kabanda is K-A-B-A-N-D-A.  Number 37 on the list.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	And this head of Interahamwe was your tenant, is that not so? 
A.	I agree with you. 
Q.	So, it's fictitious and totally misleading to say that the MRND were trying to hunt you while you were hosting, as a tenant in your house, the leader of the MRND?  Can you clarify this matter to the Court? 
A.	Thank you.  Mr. President, my house is situated close to the secondary school.  Students were tenants in that house, as well as teachers.  Kabanda was a teacher in that secondary school, as well as Ndahayo and one Gitamba.  I was, therefore, lucky to be the landlord of teachers and my house was opened to teachers and students, and even to this date I even host them in my property. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question from the Prosecutor, Mr. Witness, is the following:  Why would you have been sought after by the Interahamwe, whereas their chairman was your tenant and chairman of the MRND?  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  Mr. Prosecutor, the Interahamwe tracked me down; they wounded me; they killed my children and they were the Interahamwe of the MDR.  You may want to know that it is the MDR Interahamwe who were in the majority in Nyakabanda. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, is it not the case that you went to collect rent from Édouard Kabanda? 
A.	Can I answer?  

Mr. Prosecutor, tenants must pay their rent.  I went to collect rent from all my tenants, including students. 
Q.	Do you agree with me, Witness, that from around September 1993, all the opposition parties, including MDR, formed a power wing to which the Interahamwes of those parties belonged, do you agree with that? 
A.	I agree with you, Counsel.  One could not distinguish between the MRND or MDR or opposition parties' Interahamwes.  All the Interahamwes were the same.  

Now, as far as I am concerned, when I said that I saw persons wearing banana leaves and I said that those demons were persons whom I mentioned even over the radio, and I was speaking on behalf of my party, the PDC, which was objecting to all reprehensible acts that were committed by anyone, irrespective of their identity. 
Q.	It is correct, isn't it, Witness, that after the formation of the power wings, all that Interahamwes and the Interahamwes of MRND were working together to attack Tutsis; correct? 
A.	You are right, but that does not mean that other members of political parties joined the Interahamwe to go and kill Tutsis.  There are some members of other -- of political parties who did not participate in the killings. 
Q.	But Édouard Kabanda was particularly notorious, do you agree?  Do you know of this? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you on that point.  They carried -- they wore emblems of their party, whereas others didn't do it.  He was somebody who was very influential. 
Q.	That Kabanda was an MRND Interahamwe is false; isn't it? 
A.	I agree with you because at one point in time he came with other power and they attacked me and they asked me to hand over my pistol because I was no longer a bourgmestre.  I had no more right to carry a firearm.  And when he came in, he was in the company of other Interahamwe of the power wing. 
Q.	Witness, when were you attacked by Kabanda and the power factions of Interahamwe? 
A.	On the 18th of April 1992. 
Q.	Witness, you met up with Kabanda because he then became your tenant; he lived in your house; you collected rent from him as from 1993 onwards; is that not the case? 
A.	I went to see the bourgmestre to ask him to calm down the assailants -- the attackers, and after that there was some lull, a little calm. 
Q.	What you mean really, Witness, is that after 1993, October, you were in no danger from the Interahamwe.  They were now your tenants -- the leader was your tenant and there was no animosity between you and them.   That is all that I am putting to you; is that correct? 
A.	Among the individuals who rented my houses -- when people started hiring my house, they no longer continued to aggress me. 
Q.	Witness, there was, therefore, no need for you to avoid Callixte Nzabonimana after 1993 to 1994 because his Interahamwe were in cooperation with you; is that not so? 
A.	Thank you, Prosecutor.  Supposing you have a house to rent, do you know what your tenants do inside there, as we speak now?  
Q.	Witness, you knew Kabanda, Eduardo (sic), was an Interahamwe and an active one; correct? 
A.	Yes, when Bikindi came to our place with Nzabonimana, Kabanda and Hatangimana were wearing their party emblems and they were the ones who prepared the Bikindi show.  I, therefore, agree with you that Édouard Kabanda was an influential member of the MRND. 
Q.	During the genocide, especially from the 7th of April 1994, up to July when you went to exile, you went around your business as usual; correct? 
A.	I was not working throughout the day.  You saw my contract.  I was in charge of debt recovery.  If you look at my contract correctly, I was appointed as a part-time worker.  I even have documents in support of the fact that I was in charge of debt recovery, and if -- in those documents you will even find out the amounts I recovered in that exercise. 
Q.	Witness, all I am saying to you is this:  During this time of the genocide, you were interacting with other people; correct? 
A.	Not with everybody among the population.  When I used to, I used to move around with fear. 
Q.	Witness, did you hear it said during your interactions that the genocide is being done in connivance with the political leaders, did you hear that said? 
A.	Yes, I did hear that. 
Q.	During your hearing of those words, did you hear anybody say that Callixte Nzabonimana is against the killing of Tutsis? 
A.	I didn't hear that.  It was rare that people spoke of Callixte Nzabonimana, because he was not a native of my commune. 
Q.	Witness, in your contract, it does not say that you were limited to collecting debts in Nyakabanda; does it? 
A.	You are right.  During the month of May, I went to Gisenyi to recover a debt from there. 
Q.	And you drove around Gitarama; isn't it? 
A.	I went out to see all those individuals who owed the COFORWA money. 
Q.	Witness, very briefly, and to the point.  Did you hear it being said that Hutus are being told by political leaders in Gitarama that they should first kill the Tutsis and then eat their cows?  Did you hear it said? 
A.	Prosecutor, sir, I never heard that being said. 
Q.	Did you know that Hutus were attacking Tutsi homes -- abandoned Tutsi homes and eating their cows? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, sir, in view of the atrocities that were committed, I know that people were killed, but I did not know who was giving those orders. 
Q.	If you listen to my question you will see that it's very simple.  Did you know that Hutus were eating the cows of Tutsis?  Did you know, not about killings, eating the cows of Tutsis en masse? 
A.	Hutus used to eat Tutsi' cows in public in the same way as Tutsis killed -- Hutus killed the Tutsis in public.  I saw Hutus eat cows that belonged to Tutsis. 
Q.	And while they were eating cows belonging to Tutsis, the Tutsis were escaping; is that not so? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)... you said that the political leaders were telling the Hutus, "Stop eating the cows now.  Pursue the Tutsis, kill them and the cows will be yours."  Did you hear that or not?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Objection.  He has just told us.  Didn't we hear?  We heard it.  He said -- he did not hear.  Why should the Prosecutor insist on this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps, Prosecutor, you might rephrase your question or go on to another question.  That objection is maintained. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, did you hear people complaining that Callixte Nzabonimana is nowhere to be seen and we need guidance as to what to do, did you hear that? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, sir, I never heard that in the place where I used to live. 
Q.	Now, in your examination-in-chief, you say this about the killing -- about the involvement of ************* in the killing of***** and*******, and I quote -- rather, I will paraphrase.  You said that took the two and abandon them in the forest and then he plotted to have them killed, and he handed those people to intelligence officers and they were killed.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I do remember that and I would like to reconfirm it. 
Q.	But you were not among the group that was called to come and kill the people; were you? 
A.	I was not among that group.  Nobody called me, nevertheless, I have documents which show that he abandoned them in a forest.  He later on went to see his elder brother, who followed him closely and instead of handing over those people, those two individuals to the bourgmestre, he instead went towards the people who were manning the roadblock and asked them:  "Are you ready?"  And they said, "Yes, we are ready."  *************was carrying a grenade, as well as traditional weapons.  And then later on ***************took those individuals and handed them over to the intelligence officer s.  If you want documents talking about those facts, I am ready to hand them over to you. 
Q.	Witness, that was your testimony.  All I want you to tell the Court is that, who told you about it, because you don't know from your personal experience who was there that told you about it.  
A.	There was************, the *****************of*************.  He testified and said that ***************came and so he too met him at midnight.  And then there was******************, who had just asked him where those people were, and where the bourgmestre had hidden them.  

Later on they went out together up to the location where those two individuals were hiding in a (inaudible).  ********************************were in that (inaudible) or forest where those two individuals were.  Then *******************and the cousin of the intelligence officer, who is called*******************.  **************used -- had gone to the same school as *****************in**********.  Since they knew each other, he came following him where he was in************.  When ***************handed over *****************to**************, he did not know that *************was plotting against those two individuals.  

May I add also that, if I said that **************was a rogue, I wanted to mean that he was a very tricky man.  I will give an example.  He was someone who used to behave as a soldier wherever he went.  Wherever the Tutsis were killed he was presented in *************commune; he manned a roadblock which he supervised himself, but because he was tricky, he was saying other things.  There are documents in which he claimed that he was innocent.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, if you listen to my question carefully, it is very simple.  Who told you about that?  Can you answer very briefly?  Can I suggest to you:  Did ********tell you about that? 
A.	*******told me part of that story.  He even had it written down.  Habyakare also talked about them.  ***************too.  The information that I got was obtained from those three individuals, and I would like to insist that those three people did not clearly stat that it is Alex Nsabimana who organised the meeting during which it was decided that those two people had to be killed.  That is some of the proof that I have. 
Q.	That is the defence you gave at the appeal; isn't it correct? 
A.	Yes, but I also told the members of the Gacaca bench where they could find the documents regarding to my defence -- relating to my defence. 
Q.	Witness, was (Microphone not activated)...  was discredited and ********appeared and said that you had bribed him with trousers; is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct.  In addition to **********there were 21 individuals who confirmed what I am saying.  *********was number 21.  Out of the 50 people who -- you have 50 people who are saying exactly what I am saying.  Do you think I could have bribed 50 people all at a go?  And those 50 people testified before the bourgmestre who -- whose friend had just been killed.  There is also a report that was written by that same bourgmestre on the 19th of October 1994, because we had been lucky in that that bourgmestre was once again called in to occupy the duties he had held before. 
Q.	I just want you to look the Honourable Judge in the eye and tell him that *********did not say -- that is not the Judge.  That is -- look the Judge in the eye and tell him that in your appeal trial, ********did not say that you bribed him, whether it was correct or not, whether he did not say that you had bought his testimony.  
A.	He said so. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Now -- 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Honourable Judge, I would like to show the witness a video clip of part of his trial.  I have already disclosed it to my learned friends and I would ask him a few brief questions.  

MR. LAROCHELLE:
That's not right.  I have never received a copy of that DVD.  I was told there was only one copy and I did not get it.  So what is the proper situation, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
He is absolutely right.  I confess; I misspoke.  We, indeed, told him that we didn't have a spare copy and as soon as we get it, we will let him have it.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, I hope what you said does not constitute an objection to getting this video screened?  Would you like to be patient for the video to be -- a copy to be done?  

And perhaps Defence Counsel says that it is unfortunate that he has not been given the opportunity to look at this video before, but -- so he -- does -- he has not physically been provided with the -- with this video.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:  
And the Prosecutor is about to screen a carefully selected script of that video.  But since the 
Prosecutor -- we insisted that this video should be given to us from the Gacaca.  On several occasions we asked for this, but we did not receive it.  We wanted it to be -- we just deplore the manner in which the Prosecutor manages his disclosure of evidence.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has taken note of your comments.  At the same time, Prosecutor, is it true that nobody else had seen this DVD before?  Or would you like to give some explanation about this video to the audience here?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Very briefly.  As I had told my learned friend, this video was only availed to us yesterday and we are not even allowed to make a copy of this.  As soon as we are able to, we would be able to give to my learned friend.  We explained it to him and he had no objection.  It is unfortunate.  We were expecting him actually to disclose it to us because this is his witness and there was nothing further we could be able to do.  

My Lords, maybe the technician can help us with the sound.  I think if they put on that microphone, the little computer will have a sound.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	In the mean time, witness, is that the Gacaca court that tried you and sentenced you on appeal? 
A.	Excuse me; I had forgotten to switch on my microphone.  

This is the first instance trial in the Gacaca.  This is not the appeal's -- it's not a recording from the appeals court of Gacaca. 
Q.	You are absolutely right, Witness.  But you confirm that this is the sitting, you saw the judges and you saw your image; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, I would like to confirm that I saw my image there and this is the headquarters of the first instance Gacaca court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you further point -- can we be shown Mr. Sibomana, as well as the judges?  Where are they in that clip?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Mr. Sibomana, was that music being played during the Gacaca trial?  
THE WITNESS:
No, but there was a machine that was being used to record,  but I, personally, did not hear that music during the trial.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I would rather suggest we either listen to the sound during the session itself or nothing as sound.  

(No interpretation)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)...  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for the Honourable Judge. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Could the technician hold it there?  Can technician -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Technician, pause please.  

In the interest of time saving, can I, at the same time, ask questions as we view the clip?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it possible for us to concentrate and at the same time as we listen to your questions?  Maybe it is better we first see what happened in that Gacaca. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I would suggest that we -- from time to time we stop and ask him some questions, as we go along watching that video, rather than just watching throughout.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean with regard to the picture being projected on the screen?  

Mr. Prosecutor, would you agree with that so that we can save time?  

MR. NG'ARUA:
I have no objections about it, but I would request that counsel realise that this is examination-in-chief (sic) and that he must not start leading and he should acknowledge that this is my opportunity to advance my case.  If he respects that, I have no problem.  

Technician, can you show the Judge the clip just before that?.  I want the witness to confirm that that was the bench that tried him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to inform you that we don't have more than 20 minutes allotted to you because we also have to give time to the Defence.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I entirely agree.  I just want the witness to confirm that that is indeed the trial settings, and then we would move from one clip to the other within a very short time so that he can accept and then I will make a request to hand in this document so that the Defence counsel and myself and the Chamber can be able to view it in full totality later.  We also undertake to give the transcript of the English version of this document so that in due time everybody would be able to see exactly what transpired.  All the questions I have put to this witness pertains to issues that have been raised in this trial.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a small comment.  How shall we be able to know exactly that this part of the film that has been screened -- that this was a part of the film that was screened during this deposition?  Shall we have a way of recognising the parts that have been screened?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I saw that there was a clock  somewhere probably that could enable us to know where exactly on the tape we were.  There is an indication of time on that screen.  Probably we could use that one as a point of reference that during the deposition the film was screened at this particular point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So can we agree that -- that we -- to have a reference for the parts that were shown during the deposition?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
The only difficulty -- the only difficulty I will have with that proposal is that, I don't feel it's necessary to show the entire movie because it will take more than two hours.  I just want to move from several clips, now that the witness has confirmed that, indeed, that is his trial and then produce it as an exhibit in order to save time.  Otherwise, I will then have to sit back and let the whole movie run, and I don't think it is in the interest of justice to do so.  So I would suggest that we proceed in the manner that I have proposed and that my learned friend does not have any serious objection about that. 

MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, we use -- I would not like to commit myself to getting this video screened when I have not seen it before.  I would -- I accept that the integral part of this video cassette be submitted and accepted, but I would say I just think that as we go along we stop and ask a few questions.  I don't think that is that much complicated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that objection is founded.  We should not accept as proof -- as evidence a DVD without having it discussed openly by both sides.  The Chamber too must have appreciated the value of this video so that we request for it to be admitted in evidence.  I wonder how we can go ahead now.  

Now, if there are any -- is there any other procedure in which the Chamber can view this or we agree that the entire video be viewed during our next sitting?  
MR. NZAVA:
Your Honour, the witness requests a short break so that he can answer a call of nature.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Granted.  

Let's have that break upon the request of the witness.  
(Witness exited courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation) 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The booth did not -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can we ask the Defence to restart his intervention because we did not hear him from the start.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
(No interpretation)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
We did not get interpretation.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
What I was saying is to have some extracts of that video used during the cross-examination.  I think the proper method would be to use the whole of that video -- to use the whole of that video -- to use and to stop at the moment where the Prosecutor intend to ask questions.  And when we make such stops, to indicate in the record at what time in the video we are.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
That's it.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
That is perfectly fair.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So may we go ahead.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, that is Marie Claire, a witness whom we spoke about earlier in your cross-examination; is that correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you've seen her swearing an oath before giving testimony in your trial; correct? 
A.	Yes, I saw that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, can you mention the starting time for that clip so that the stenographers can record it.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I think this is a technical matter.  May I request the technician to give us an input because I really don't know how to do that.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
In the left-hand side corner, I can see something there like 1 minute, 07.  Could that help?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I think that will help.  That will help.  I just want to confirm with the technician.  Is that the point?  

So, My Lord, I think the point for the stenographers to note is at point 3 minutes and 10 seconds, from that point.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So stenographers, 3 minutes, 10.  And the person there is Marie Claire Mukamitali.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, it seems that we have a technical problem, because the moment we try to forward this image to the next phase, we cannot be able to do that and have the sound at the same time.  So I don't know whether my learned friend has a serious objection in us fast-forwarding this to the end of the testimony of this lady for the purposes of recording the portion of the DVD that we wish to put in or -- because the alternative is to listen to the whole thing.  I don't think that's what I want.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I think I was clear enough.  I have no objection if you move from one section to the twentieth minute or whatever segment.  All I want is for the record to show which part of the video we are dealing with.  
I don't want to watch the entire video.  I want us to deal only with those excerpts that are of interest to you and then the record -- and let the record show that this is the segment I am interested in.  I think I was clear enough.  I made this clear in English and in French.  I said the same thing in both languages.  So you can move directly to the segment which is of interest to you.  

Am I authorised to put a question to Mr. Sibomana since we have seen Mrs. Mukamitali?  

Was it normal for people to wear sunshades in court?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

At the time of her testimony I had been asked out of the location because witnesses did not want to talk about what they had witnessed in my presence.  I hope that they would show the picture of a soldier taking me out to a detention area -- rather, a policeman taking me out to a detention area.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the position of the Defence counsel is clear.  Would it be possible for you to show this video at a normal speed?  If you were to do so, how much time would that take us?  Even if you were not going to interpret any segment of it, how much time would we need to do that?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, it is for that reason that we are not opposed to our viewing only the various segments of the video that are relevant to the Prosecutor, but on the condition that the entire video is made available to all parties. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
That will be completely agreeable to us that, if we give the copies, then we can hand it in as exhibits.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I think we all agree that you can go to the next extract which you would like us to see.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, we would like to take this clip at 18:50, showing the bench of the first instance.  And at that clip, it's 17:51, showing Mr. Sibomana conducting his defence.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Could we see that picture again?  I would like to put a question to Mr. Sibomana.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Given the manner in which this is happening, Your Honour, I insist that I be authorised to put my questions now.  I think that would enable us to gain time, and it is not in breach of procedure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What will happen is that the Prosecutor will explain the segment he is looking at and then the Defence would put his questions at the same time simultaneously.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Most obliged.  I think that will save time.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We were at 17 minutes 53 seconds.  

For how long did this lady testify, approximately?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe the witness could provide that answer.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, the Court would like to know for how long did Marie Claire testify in the first instance?  Was it for a day or shorter? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  When Marie Claire was testifying, the bench asked me to leave the courtroom and I was locked up in detention in order not to be able to follow the proceedings.  So during her testimony I was asked out of the courtroom.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
For how long were you kept out of the courtroom?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I cannot recall how much time I spent outside of the courtroom, but all I know is that I was in the detention facility for some hours during the time when many people testified against me -- or, testified about me.  During that period, I was in that detention area.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Next segment, please.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
While you were in detention, were you represented in the Gacaca proceedings by a lawyer?  
THE WITNESS:
No, there are no lawyers at the Gacaca proceedings.  What happened is that those who were accusing me had enough time to plot out their accusations against me.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, I think the technician is still trying to figure out how to manipulate this DVD.  May I suggest that we take the afternoon break, and in the meanwhile, he will try and see whether he can figure out how to make this thing faster, because as it is now, we seem  to be coming back to the beginning, whereas we want to be able to see if, indeed, the witness was removed out of the court during his trial.  So may I request that that is the best we can do for now and we see whether the technician can be able to figure out how to do it. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, I have a question.  Will you be able to tell us -- or are you in a position to tell us how many segment of that video you intend to use?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, we only wanted to put in the segment that deals with Marie Claire, the one segment where she talks about the activities of the witness.  There is only one segment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Maybe we can find a middle-of-the-road solution, namely that the Prosecutor puts it to the witness, having viewed what Marie Claire was saying, that he can put it to the witness that this is what she said and get his reaction.  If that were possible, then we would probably not need to review the whole video right now.  That would enable us to gain time, and I don't have any objection to the fact that the Prosecutor, who is aware of the content of the video should paraphrase what Marie Claire may have said and then put it to the witness as a proposition.  I trust him and I think I can trust him because we have the video, which we can review later on.  And I believe that in making such a proposition, he would be reflecting the true content and then we would be able to proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, My Lords, I have already done that.  The questions that I was putting to the witness and he agreed to were part of what is contained in the testimony of this witness.  So that being the case, there would be no need to do it again.  So all we want now to do is to hand in the clip that deals with her testimony because that is the clip that I was putting to him about his participation and the issue of his good character, which he alleges was present in 1973.  So I have already put those questions to him.  And if I recollect very well, he agreed to every proposition that I put to him that he was aware of that, and all that then remains is for us to give the document to the Defence counsel and then if they review it and find out that what we are saying is correct, then we can have it as an exhibit in order to save time.  

And the only part that I did not put to the witness that is on this video, which I can do now is to put to him about his conduct when he was the inspector of schools for Nyakabanda.  And I can do that very briefly in two or three questions because it is discussed in this DVD.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation) 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Regarding assertions made by Marie Claire during the Gacaca proceedings, I believe that viewing the video will then be redundant because the witness accepted that Marie Claire had made those statements, so it would be redundant to view the video in that connection.  So that is admissible.  

Now as for the other proposal by the witness (sic), I trust him.  If he says that there is a content in the video that alleges one thing or the other, let him make that proposition -- put that proposition to the witness and if the witness says yes, then we -- it becomes even all the more irrelevant to view the whole video.  I think we have all agreed on the point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed to put those questions when we resume and the witness will answer to those questions.  The Defence has demonstrated entire trust and good faith towards the Prosecution.  And the materials would be available; they would be assessed and I think that the rest will flow.  And for those reasons, it becomes unnecessary to view the video.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, I can do better than that.  I am particularly not too enthusiastic about putting those things on his tenure as director of schools.  I can abandon that.  My point would be clearly made with respect to the issues raised before the court on the issues that I have already put to him alone.  So if Defence counsel is satisfied with that, I am.  And all I would request is that, that clip with respect to -- up to the testimony of Marie Claire, which he says she was present at the court, that is the only segment I would like to put in evidence.  So in that case, I don't think my learned friend is objecting to the clip that shows the question that I put to the witness earlier on being admitted in evidence, subject to subsequent verifications by my learned friend, and that would be the end of the matter.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
For the umpteen time, we have no objection to the Prosecutor using any excerpts, but we insist that the entire video be produced into evidence.  Do I have to say this a million times?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will break.  You will now work with the technicians to screen that segment and then you should be able to put any questions to the witness when we resume at 2:45 or thereabout.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lord, in view of what my learned friend has made very clear, I think all that remains now is for me to hand in this video and subsequently point out the clip.  And when we come back after lunch, I would say from this point to this point of that clip is all that I need to put in, and that would be the end of the matter.  Thank you, Mr. Larochelle.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We shall take a small break and resume at 2:45, if this is amenable to all parties.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are now free to go for lunch, take a little nap, come back at 2:45. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
(Court recessed at 1317H)

(Court resumed at 1453H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We now resume proceedings in the deposition in the case of Callixte Nzabonimana, as we hear the testimony of Witness Sibomana.  

Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.  We want to thank the Chamber for indulging us and being very patient with us.  We have now been able to figure out the formatting of the DVD and it is much much easy now to present it.  We shall not be very long.  I think it will not take the Prosecutor more than 15 minutes to wrap up and finish.  I want to start by where we were at the last point. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.  
A.  	Now, I can hear you.  
Q.	Thank you, very much, Witness.  Did you have a good rest? 
A.	Yes, I had some rest, but not sufficient rest. 
Q.	I can assure you that I will not be very long before you have a lot of rest.  

Witness, there is something you say that I'm sure disturbed me and the Court and my learned friend very much.  

Witness, can you tell the Court how were you removed from your proceedings when Marie Claire was testifying? 
A.	I was surprised myself.  You see, other witnesses, apart from Marie Claire, also testified in my case in my absence.  Professor Mucyo, who lives in Butare, is Tutsi; his wife is also Tutsi.  He was a teacher in Kibangu, where he lived.  

When he came to testify he said that Sibomana had been falsely accused; that they wanted to kill him and even kill his children.  Then the member -- members of the bench of the Gacaca court retorted saying that they didn't want to hear any such statements from him, and then he answered back saying that he had not come to the court to tell any lies.  And in response to that, the bench of the Gacaca court asked him to leave.  And that is how it happened that I was also requested to leave the hall. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, spell out the name of the person who has been mentioned. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Professor Mucyo, M-U-C-H-O (sic) for Mucyo.  M-U-C-Y-O, correction from the English booth. 

BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, please I have only requested the Court for 15 minutes.  My question was, you told the Court that when Marie Claire, who you saw on the video was testifying, you were removed from the trial chamber.  I want you to tell the Court how were you removed and when were you brought back.  Please just that, if you can, please.  
A.	I thank you.  I did not look at my watch when I was asked to leave the courtroom.  I was locked up in a detention facility for more than one hour. 
Q.	Thank you.  But the question is:  How were you removed?  When Marie Claire took the oath to tell the truth, were you in the court? 
A.	I did not see her take the oath. 
Q.	Thank you.  And at what point -- at what point in time did you come back into the trial chamber?  Was Marie Claire still on the floor when you came back or was she gone? 
A.	When I returned to the courtroom, she was speaking.  Let me add that other persons testified when I was held in detention, but whose names I do not know. 
Q.	You are mixing up things, Witness.  Just be very systematic.  

Did you hear what Marie Claire said in her testimony? 
A.	If I had listened to her testimony, then the members of the Gacaca bench would have allowed me to defend myself. 
Q.	Witness, please did you or did you not hear what Marie Claire testified against you, did you or did you not hear?   Please, just that.  
A.	No. 
Q.	After she was sworn in to testify, did the trial chamber then order you to be removed? 
A.	I left the courtroom before Marie Claire took the oath. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, please.  

Mr. Witness, the Prosecutor is trying to find out from you whether you heard part -- or, at least, part of Marie Claire's testimony, because a short while ago you said that when you returned to the courtroom she was speaking.  So you had been taken away to the courtroom when she was testifying and you came back into the courtroom when she was testifying.  The question is:  What did you hear when you came back to the courtroom as part of her testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
Honourable Judge, you are right.  I heard her say that an investigation into her matter had been conducted in Kigali, particularly, in respect of the murder of Evalde. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I just want to understand you very clearly.  At the time -- 
A.	I heard her say that an investigation had been conducted into the role that Marie Claire allegedly played in the murder of my son, Evalde. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I think the kind of questions I want to ask you, you can answer with yes or no so that -- because it's very simple.  

At the time when Marie Claire came to the floor of the chamber, were you in the chamber or had you been taken out? 
A.	When she began to testify, I was not in the courtroom.  I did not even see her take the oath. 
Q.	Thank you.  At what point in time did the court make an order for you to be removed? 
A.	I had already submitted a document in which I pleaded guilty.  I had also provided a statement which I had made to a Gacaca court. 
Q.	So you confirm that the court ordered you to be removed before Marie Claire even took the floor; correct? 
A.	You have the video cassette and you can crosscheck that for yourself. 
Q.	No, Witness, listen to the question.  These questions are coming from the Court.  Tell the Court, how were you returned back into the chamber? 
A.	I was brought back into the courtroom. 
Q.	Witness, you are not answering the question.  

Were you arrested by two policemen and taken out and brought back by two policemen?  I want you to tell the Court.  I don't know why you are avoiding this question.  How were you brought back? 
A.	Only one policeman took me out and then one policeman brought me back into the courtroom. 
Q.	Witness, do you know at what point in time the court ordered for you to be brought back into the courtroom? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I did not look at my watch to be in a position to tell you at what time the court ruled.  So I crave your indulgence in this matter. 
Q.	Witness, I understand you perfectly, and please bear with me.  Maybe -- I want you to tell the Court the event; not the time, the event.  Do you know when the court ordered for you to come back; not the time, the event? 
A.	Your Honour, I was summoned and I was accused of participating in the attack during which Ngoga and Ndidendereza were killed.  I was also accused of illegally bearing firearms.  I had just begun to make my defence case by providing a copy of the document in which I had entered a guilty plea and that document is before the court.  I did plea in that document that indeed I did participate in that attack.  I also confessed to having been in possession of a weapon, but legally so, although I was not a soldier.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Witness, all of that is already in evidence.  What the Prosecutor and the Trial Chamber would like to know from you, if I understand properly is:  Why -- or, what were the reasons for which you were somehow evicted from the proceedings and what were the reasons for which you were again returned to the hearing -- to the proceedings?  

Is that what you are looking for, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
That is right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, in one sentence, answer the question.  Why did the jury or the Gacaca bench throw you out of the proceedings, and why were you subsequently returned to the proceedings?  Leave the facts aside.  If there were any incidents during the proceedings, maybe that is what you should be telling the Court that happened in order to lead to those consequences.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Honourable Judge.  Members of the Gacaca bench said that I was well loved by the inhabitants of my commune, and for that reason they would not hear their testimonies in my presence. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	And, Witness, after the testimony of Marie Claire, another witness followed immediately thereafter.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lord, may I request that we go into a very brief closed session to mention the name of the witness who followed.  

Are we in closed session?
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 46 to 51] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 42 to 45 by Sheriffo Jammeh)














MR. PRESIDENT:
We are in public session.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, the Prosecutor talked about the 199 -- 1973, the accusations brought against you in 1973.  What do you have to say about that? 
A.	The Prosecutor raised the events of 1973 and said Mukamitali accused me on that occasion.  And I said that when Mukamitali was testifying I was asked to leave the courtroom. 
Q.	And you left the courtroom.  And did you hear the testimony of Mukamitali upon your return; is that true? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	And, thereafter, were you able to attend the rest of the session? 
A.	Yes, I followed -- I attended.  Excuse me.  I listened to what was being said, but I was not allowed the chance to express myself on the accusations of Mukamitali regarding the incident of 1973. 
Q.	Therefore, whatever followed, did anybody else accuse you of genocide in the Nyakabanda with 
the -- in complicity with Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	If you read all the judgements that were issued in the entire Nyakabanda secteur, nobody accused me of having conspired with Callixte Nzabonimana. 
Q.	Did anyone accuse you of having received any weapons from Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Nobody accused me of the fact that Nzabonimana gave me any weapons. 
Q.	Did anybody claim that you were Callixte Nzabonimana's lieutenant in Nyakabanda? 
A.	Nobody. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Disallowed (Microphone not activated)...  it does arise out of cross-examination.  And re-examination only deals with obscurities that are raised in cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, would you please remove your headset for a moment.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, I think the Prosecutor had enough time for his cross-examination regarding the accusations against Sibomana in the Gacaca in Kibangu.  As you know very well, those accusations were mentioned in Arusha.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is very fast. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If the same charges were brought against him in the Gacaca in Kibangu, where it was alleged that those elements were brought forth as allegations against him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Objection, rejected.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Somebody should help the witness put on his headset again.  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Are we still in closed session?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I had said that when we asked the closed session that it cannot be real because we don't have the necessary means in this hall.  And I had said that we were going to continue, but the questions and the answers that were going to follow would be inaccessible to the public.  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
I understand very well, but from what point in time for our --  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
As far as I am concerned, all the re-examination must be in open session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the opinion of the Prosecution?  But the re-examination, I thought, was in open session, except where names of protected witnesses appear.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
It should be in open session, and also even though protected witnesses are mentioned, I think it is in the manner in which they are mentioned that should be protected, rather than merely the name of a protected witness.  But to answer the question that you've just put to me now, I think I have no objection in this matter going on in open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you go ahead, Counsel it for Defence.  

Mr. Sibomana, would you like to say something?  
THE WITNESS:
Just something minor that I wanted to say, with your permission.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are going to request you, first of all, to answer the questions put to you by Defence counsel.  
THE WITNESS:
This is something that is in connection with what counsel asked me about Mukamitali.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let Defence counsel ask his question. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Go ahead, Mr. Sibomana, and mention what you want to say about Mukamitali? 
A.	I would like to tell the Court the name of the individual who was the source of the fact -- of what Mukamitali said about the killing of Tutsis in Nyakabanda.  It was Gaspard Sematama, who was the president of the court of first instance of Gitarama, and who was acting in concert with Préfet Maxi Niyonzima.  Those individuals committed a huge crime in Nyakabanda by freeing the people that I had arrested for having killed Tutsis.  

And I would like to tell this Court that there is a document at the préfecture office, which I sent to the préfet at the time and that the names of the individuals are there.  Those are the people who said that the Tutsis should be killed.  People did not choose to become Tutsis.  So I was saying that if somebody decides to kill Tutsis, he must be somebody who is maybe mad.  I tried to defend the Tutsis.  I took them to Father Bourguet.  Father Bourguet is dead.  If he somebody who is still alive he will (inaudible) himself.  All that was recorded in the transcript. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Sibomana, people accused you of having been involved in the events of 1973.  During the Gacaca time -- your trial at the Gacaca trial, did any individual come to accuse you of having distributed weapons received from Callixte Nzabonimana to Nzigamasabo, to Charles Hitimana, to Gahamanyi, did anyone ever accuse you of that offence during the Gacaca hearings? 
A.	Thank you.  If anyone accuse me of that, it should have been mentioned in the minutes of my trial, otherwise, nobody did so.  
Q.	Lastly, Witness, did anyone in the Gacaca jurisdiction accuse you of having been part of the group of killers with Callixte Nzabonimana and Édouard Kabanda? 
A.	I will tell you the truth.  Nobody accused me of that offence.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Sibomana.  Thank you for having accepted to testify.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, my re-examination is over.  I would like to express my gratitude to you for this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
One or two minor questions to the witness.  

How many roadblocks were erected in your commune in Nyakabanda, and where exactly were they located?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I cannot know the locations of those roadblocks because I never manned any roadblocks, therefore, I cannot be able to know how many they were and where they were located because I did not allow anybody to man them or did -- neither did I supervise the people who were -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Judge is saying that he is not hearing anything from the French booth.  
THE WITNESS:
I will repeat.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you please come again in your answer because I did not hear what you were saying because of a technical problem.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  In the former *************commune, there were roadblocks that I cannot be able to say the number, nor even saying the -- as an individual myself, I did not man any roadblocks.  I only passed by one roadblock at Kibangu.  It was manned by **************and his friends.  It was actually ****************who was the president of that roadblock.  As regards other roadblocks, I am not able to know how many they were and where exactly they were located. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about the roadblock that is said to have been located near your own house?  
THE WITNESS:
In Kibangu, there was a small roadblock which was set up on the way towards the Adventist church.  I saw it once.  There was another roadblock not far from the commune office.  For those two roadblocks, I did see them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When were those roadblocks placed there, before the 6th of April or after the 6th of April 1994?  
THE WITNESS:
They were mounted in the days that followed the death of President Habyarimana, but the situation became more complicated for the roadblock that **************was manning near the communal office when ********************************were being looked for having killed the Tutsis in their commune.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth did not hear the last bit of that answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please repeat that -- the last part of your answer so that it can be interpreted.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. Kleber Zimulinda was a second lieutenant.  He arrived and started shooting the Tutsis and it appears that the plot had been planned in the bar where Kanyemera was preparing brochette.  It was after killing the Tutsis of the commune of ***************that the roadblocks were set up.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Last question, Witness.  You told this Court with regard to the judgement and your sentence that it was based on false allegations, and that consequently that you -- you applied for an appeal.  First question:  When were you officially notified of that guilty judgement?  

And second question:  Was the decision -- were you present when that judgement was being rendered?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I appealed for a review of my trial having heard that the judgement had been based on false allegations.  I got the information on the 4th of November 2007.  I was just near Kibangu prison.  I had just been sentenced to 19 years in jail.  The president of that bench told me, "Excuse me, these are the documents showing the bases of our decision."  I took the documents.  I wrote down my request to -- for a review of my case.  I have the documents that were signed by my colleagues.  I could even submit this document to you.  It is a document that I wrote on the 5th of November 2007.  I even have a copy of that letter with me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the first question was:  Were you present when the verdict was pronounced?  
THE WITNESS:
I was present.  I even signed on the document and I stated that I was not in agreement with the decision of the judges.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Witness, we have come to the end of your deposition.  We would not find the words to thank you for having been able to travel from your -- the prison where you are held in Gitarama up to here in Kigali to throw light on the matter which is going to be decided upon by this Chamber in the case of Callixte Nzabonimana.  

And having heard and taken your deposition, the examination-in-chief by Defence counsel, the cross-examination by the Prosecutor, we shall then transmit these files to Trial Chamber III, for it to assess as quickly as possible regarding your statement that you made yesterday and today.  And in addition to all the other statements and testimonies that have been received before you.  And we hope that we will come in -- it wouldn't take long to come in.  We thank you very much for having participated in this exercise of going about the truth -- establishing the truth.  And at this period where we come towards the end of the year, we take this opportunity to wish you a Happy New Year, and to wish you eternal peace.  

Once again, thank you very much to all the teams here present, the Defence team; the Prosecution team; the interpreters; the technicians and stenographers; the registry at large; and to everybody.  I could not enumerate every one who has participated in making this deposition a success.  I thank you infinitely for -- because we have been able to achieve this in perfect condition.  Thanks to your contribution.  Therefore, we wish to thank you very much.  We have to go to Arusha, and those who remain in Kigali, we are saying au revoir.  And thank you very much for your effort for all the diligence you have put in to make this a success.  Without your participation, we would not have been successful in this assignment looking for justice.  Thank you very much.  Therefore, I declare this deposition of Straton Sibomana closed today at 1600 hours, a few seconds before 1600 hours Kigali time.  

Mr. Sibomana, I made the last statement and I have closed.  Thank you very much and safe journey back home.
(Court adjourned at 1600H)
