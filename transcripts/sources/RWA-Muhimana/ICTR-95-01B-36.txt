testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Witness, I will put a few questions to you on the events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994.  Can you tell the Chamber how you learned of President Habyarimana's death?
A.	These are the circumstances under which I learned of President Habyarimana's death.  We heard about it from the radio.
Q.	Was that on the day of the death itself?
A.	We learned of it in the morning of the 7th of April.
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, what the security situation in your secteur on the 7th of April 1994 was?
A.	Regarding security, after President Habyarimana's death was announced, some people started leaving their homes.  Some of those people went to Mubuga parish, others to Ngoma.  Some even went up the hills of Bisesero.
Q.	Who were those persons who moved?
A.	They were Tutsis.
Q.	Witness, in April 1994, did you know a person called Mika Muhimana?
A.	The person called Mika Muhimana was known to me.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber the circumstances under which you knew him?
A.	I knew Mika Muhimana well before 1994.  He was a trader.  He was trying to earn a living.  He subsequently became bankrupt and was appointed conseiller of Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber whether in April 1994, you saw Mika Muhimana?
A.	In April 1994, I used to see Mika.  I used to see him in his house.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber the circumstances under which you saw him?
A.	These are the circumstances under which I used to see him:  I used to go to the shop where he was residing often.  Sometimes I saw him in his home, in front of his veranda playing cards with his friends.  And, on other occasions, I saw him in front of the buildings opposite his house.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you specify the date when you saw him playing cards in his veranda?
THE WITNESS:
I no longer recall the date, but during the month of April, he was often in his home.  And when I used to go to the shop, I saw him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Certainly after the war, 7th of April, or before it was 7th of April?
THE WITNESS:
I used to see him before the war.  And after the war broke out, I continued to see him in his house.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When did you see him playing cards?  Was it after the war or before the war or the death of the president?
THE WITNESS:
Before the war, he liked playing the game of cards and dominos.  And after the war, I saw him in his house.  He was often in his house playing with other people.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What you were asked by the - - by the Presiding Judge is, that occasion you saw him playing cards, did that happen before the 7th of April or after the 7th of April?
THE WITNESS:
I have stated to you that Mika loved playing cards.  Prior to President Habyarimana's death, I used to see him playing, and after President Habyarimana's death, I used to see him playing at home with other people.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what would you be doing yourself?  Did you play with him?
THE WITNESS:
As for me, it was when I went to the shops, I liked seeing what they were doing; I would stand near them and watch them playing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How many times did you see him playing cards after the war, after the 7th of April?
THE WITNESS:
I cannot count the number of times I saw him.  I did not pay attention to that, such as to count the number.  But, in any case, he was in his house.  I often saw him playing such a game.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Would you be playing -- would you be seeing him in the house, you being outside or inside?
THE WITNESS:
Whenever I saw him, he was on the veranda.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you pay attention with whom he was playing?  Did you know the persons he used to play the cards with?
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not know them.  Many people went there because it was a trading centre.  Anyone who was free played with him.  In his home was a set of dominos.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you telling us that in situations like one in 1994 -- April '94, Mika, who was a conseiller of the secteur, and as party of the area, sitting in a relaxed mood in the veranda playing cards with his friends?
THE WITNESS:
During that period of war, Mika Muhimana, was in his house.  It is, therefore, understandable that from time to time, he would provide for his wife's safety since his wife was Tutsi.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is not the question that was put to you.  Mr. Witness, answer the question that is put to you, not the one you want to answer.  The question you were asked by the Presiding Judge is this:  At a time, like April 1994, when everything was in commotion in Rwanda, would the conseiller of the secteur be spending his time playing cards outside his veranda with everybody who comes by?  That's -- is that the evidence you are putting forward to this Tribunal?
THE WITNESS:
I used to see the conseiller at the trading centre and in his house.  I have stated to you that I often saw him playing dominos.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, your personal particulars, which was presented to you a while ago, shows that you are in prison.  Can you tell the Court why you are in prison?
A.	This is the reason why I am in prison.  I am in prison because of crimes that I committed.
Q.	What are those crimes which you committed, Witness?
A.	I participated in the killings of 1994.
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us who you killed?
A.	I xxxxxx a man called Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx****************, rather - - 
*************************.
Q.	Who was that person called Xxxxxxxxxx, Xxxxx?
A.	Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx was a civilian living in Xxxxxx cellule.  He was Tutsi.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber whether you killed him or you participated in his murder?
A.	This is the role I played:  I was at home in my house; I saw one who had come down from the opposite hill.  He was running and people were running after him shouting.  I moved in the direction where the person was coming from.  When that person got to a football pitch, x xxxxxxxxxxx xxx, and the people who were pursuing him arrived, and we killed him on the spot.
Q.	Who killed him?
A.	It was a man called Xxxxxxxxxx, but I and the others were present.  I confirm this because I personally witnessed this with my own eyes.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us more about that person; for instance, did you know his family?
A.	I knew his family because that person resided in the neighbouring cellule, the cellule that was next to my mine.
Q.	Did you know his wife?
A.	I knew his wife.
Q.	Witness, could you please write his -- the wife of *************** name on a piece of paper?
A.	I can do that.
Q.	Witness, thank you for writing down that person's name on the piece of paper.  Do you know the names of the persons who killed *********************?
A.	As regards the names of the persons who killed ***************, I know them.  By the way, I am one of those persons.  If you want me -- if you want me to give you their names, I can do so.
Q.	Please, go ahead.
A.	The first is myself, DS; the second person is **************; there is also Xxxxxxx Xxxxxx; there is Xxxxxx Xxxxxxxxxxx. The other is Xxxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx - ************************  Let me spell the name ************************************************************ is spelt as follows: 
********************************* is spelt as follows:  ********************
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And if someone told you that Mika Muhimana was one of those who killed Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx, what would your reaction be?
A.	I would say that that is not true, because if Mika had been one of the murderers, I would have mentioned his name.  I did not know he was going to be prosecuted before this Tribunal.  I mentioned the names of the other murderers in my confession, and those people did not mention Mika's name either.
Q.	And if someone were to tell you, Witness, that the person or the persons whose names you mentioned acted on Mika Muhimana's order, what would your reaction be?
A.	This is what I would say to them.  Some of those persons are in detention with me in prison.  If Mika had given them orders, they would have said so, because we often met during gacaca sessions, and we recalled the events as they occurred, but none of those people ever stated that he acted on orders from Mika.
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  You wrote down the name of a person on a piece of paper as being ***************** wife.  If someone were to tell you that that person was raped by Mika, what would be your reaction?
A.	I would say that that is not true, since Mika Muhimana was a married person.  If someone were to say that he raped that woman, I would state that that did not occur.  By the way, it could not have happened, because since I was arrested in 1994, I have never heard mention of it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it, it did not happen because Mika was a married person, or because you have never heard of it?  Which is your reason for it not happening?
THE WITNESS:
That never happened.  Putting aside Mika, no one else has been accused of having participated in rape in his secteur.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It did not happen, but I'm asking you what is the reason why you say it did not happen?
THE WITNESS:
This is what I am relying on to say that it never happened.  Mika himself could never have done such a thing, whereas he was a married man with a wife and children.
	(Pages 1 to 6 by Haruna Farage)






	1445H
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You never heard of a married man with a wife and children who committed rape? 
THE WITNESS:
During this period of the war, no, I heard nothing of it, and in other circumstances, I have never learnt of it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then you are too ignorant. 
THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't say I was ignorant; I would say that it never happened instead. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, go on. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us whether you participated in a gacaca session in your prison?
A.	Many gacaca sessions are often held and I participate in them.  It happens sometimes that people of the same cellule meet, and people from the same secteur can also meet and we talk together and we say what we saw.  First, if I had heard such a thing, nothing would have prevented me from telling it to you.
Q.	In these gacaca sessions, has anyone confessed to rape in Gishyita secteur?
A.	No one.  What is more, if it were to happen that anyone is aware of such instances of rape, he would testify against the people who committed the rape.
Q.	During your gacaca sessions in the prison, has Mika's name -- or was Mika's name mentioned amongst the assailants of Mubuga?
A.	Nobody called his name.
Q.	Do you know Mugonero hospital?
A.	Yes, I know Mugonero hospital.
Q.	Did you learn what happened in Mugonero hospital in April 1994?
A.	I did.
Q.	What did you learn?
A.	I learnt that there were killings, that people were killed there.
Q.	Did you also hear that there were also cases of rape in Mugonero hospital?
A.	I did not hear about any cases of rape.
Q.	During the gacaca sessions in prison, did you learn that Mika was amongst the assailants?
A.	No one mentioned Mika's name, and yet in the prison there are people who speak the whole truth about these events, and, if you wish, you might be told that Mika's name was never mentioned. 
Q.	During the month of April or the month of May, did you discover what happened in Bisesero?
A.	I heard about it.
Q.	And what did you find out, Mr. Witness?
A.	It was said that people were also killed there.
Q.	During the gacaca sessions, did you hear that there was rape in Bisesero?
A.	I did not hear of any cases of rape in Bisesero.
Q.	Was Mika's name mentioned as being amongst the assailants of Bisesero during the gacaca sessions?
A.	Mika's name was never mentioned.  If this had been the case, nothing would have prevented us from telling you.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we shall go back somewhat to talk about the date of the 7th of April 1994.  Can you remember what you did on that day, the 7th of April 1994?
A.	My activities?  On that day, I did nothing.
Q.	On that day, were you in the secteur that is indicated on your particulars?
A.	Yes, that is where I was.
Q.	If someone told you that on that day the authorities held a meeting to which they invited the inhabitants, what would you say?
A.	I would deny it because I lived quite close to the communal office and quite close to the centre.  I never heard of any meeting that was held at that place.
Q.	And if someone were to give more detail and tell you that on that day a meeting was held in 
Mika Muhimana's home, how would you respond?
A.	I would deny it because no meeting was held at Mika's home.  Mika xxxxx quite xxxxx xx xx xxxx.  He was xx xxxxxxxxx.  Thus, a meeting could not have been held there at the centre without my knowledge.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you keep watch over him the whole day? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not see him all day, but often, when I was there at the centre -- that is where the shops are -- seeing that it is close to my residence, at eleven o'clock or just before then, I would be able to see him.  But it is not true that I could have seen him all day because did I not stay there all the time. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know a place called Kiziba?
A.	Yes, I know this place, Kiziba.  It is in Musenyi secteur, M-U-S-E-N-Y-I.
Q.	And if somebody were to tell you that at the beginning of the war there was a distribution of weapons by the authorities at that place for the Hutu people to kill the Tutsis, how would you respond?
A.	I have never heard of it.  I deny it because I was not an eyewitness to such a distribution of weapons.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did the secteur, the secteur where you lived in 1994, have an office for the conseiller?
A.	(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) secteur never had an office.  A conseiller lived at his home, and that is where he received the complaints of civilians. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the witness has mentioned the name of the secteur.  I move that it be struck from the records.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the secteur mentioned by the witness will be struck off the record. 

Professor, go on. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am sending you a name, and you will tell me, with the assistance of the registry, whether you know this name or whether you know the person who bears this name.
A.	I know this person.
Q.	And who is this person, Mr. Witness?
A.	This is Nduwamungu's sister.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we had wished to submit a cassette recording for the comments of the witness.  I do not know whether that is technically feasible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, what's the situation?
MR. CONSTANT:
Madam President, we have given the cassette, the video cassette, to the communications unit attached to this Trial Chamber, so Defence counsel can just give instructions from the courtroom and they will play whatever section he wants put on the record.  Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, did you notify the Prosecutor that you were going to play a cassette during the course of testimony of this witness? 
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, I should like to carry out the necessary checks. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, yes. 
MR. SONGA:
I wish to answer the question that His Honour put to me.  We did indeed write to the Prosecution to give them a copy of the tape. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Can you give the instructions to the technicians to play the cassette. 
MR. SONGA:
Would the registry technicians be so kind as to assist us in the viewing of this tape. 
	(Videotape played)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, what's this tape about? 
MR. SONGA:
It is a gacaca session which was held in Gishyita. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
	(Videotape continued)
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, did you arrange for translation? 
	(Videotape stopped)
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, I did not make any special arrangements for that. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Then you should have warned the Judges that you would be playing a tape in Kinyarwanda so that we could learn enough Kinyarwanda to follow the tape. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Can the Kinyarwanda interpreter assist in interpreting -- translating the speech or whatever is being said by the speakers? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the sound is not very good.  We shall do our best.  We cannot promise that we should render the speech in its entirety.  The sound quality is very poor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Go ahead. 
	(Videotape continued)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can we begin from the beginning? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Technician, please restart it. 
	(Videotape played)
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
"In your turn, you have a role to play.  If someone asks for forgiveness, you must forgive the person.  If somebody has a problem and he tries to talk about it, this will help him to be at peace.  
"Gentlemen, we call on you to say what you know.  Try to put your consciences at rest and clear the innocent.  Try to say what did happen.  We are also asking those who are accused to please tell the truth on what they know.  

"This person is aged 30.  When the war broke out, the person was about 26 -- 24 years of age, and this person is telling you this person was cleared.  Nobody is accusing him.  Everybody says that he conducted himself well during the war, and this person is saying, 'I was inside the house from the beginning till the end of the war.'  But how can you claim that you were inside the house and learn nothing?  And the person said, 'No, I heard nothing.'  And when people say that somebody died in the front of your house; people saw him.  

"These people will introduce themselves.  Each of them will tell you his name, will tell you his region and his secteur and his parents' names so that you can identify these people.  Perhaps when these people were arrested, there were no zones, but this is what they were.  

"Please give your names, gentlemen.  You must speak out loud so that people can understand what you are saying. 

	"Cellule Mpashi, Gishyita secteur, former Gishyita commune.  I am the xxxxxx of Xxxxxxxxxx and Xxxxxxxxxxxx.

"Please stand aside.  

"I come from Gishyita secteur, Mpashi cellule.  My xxxxxx is called Xxxxxxxx.  My xxxxxxxx name is Xxxx Xxxxxxxxxx.  

"Do you know these people?  Speak out.  

"My name is Xxxx Xxxxxxxxxxxx, who was Xxxxx's neighbour.  

"Come forward.  

"I was working with him.  

"Come here.  Who was this person's neighbour?  Those who were his neighbours, please come forward.  Neighbours, please come forward.  Come over this way.  Do you know these people?  Anybody who knows these people should raise their hand.  Wait.  It is clear that there are people who know -- there are people who know these people.  Is this not true?  Please, I beg of you, those of you who know these people, those who were their neighbours, come up.  If anybody remains sitting, whereas he knows these people, he will explain it to me.  Those who know these people stand up.  Two, three, four, five, six, seven.  All right.  

"And where did you stay?  

"I lived in Mpashi.  

"All right.  In the prison they have already said everything.  They had listed the crimes they have committed, and they have asked for forgiveness.  Those who stood up, please sit down.  I thank you, people of Rusenyi district.  

"As has been said, I did not come here to run a campaign.  I have confessed to my crimes, people.  Anyone who was a victim of the genocide in Rwanda, you know that everything was done in broad daylight.  You were eyewitnesses to it.  I notice that you are afraid of something.  You are afraid to tell the truth.  You, people, tell the truth.  I am looking at some faces and some people lower their heads.  Things were done in broad daylight.  Why do you hide the truth?  We killed people in broad daylight and you all were there.  Nobody was ill.  And even those who were abroad, we might say that this person or that person did not participate because they were abroad.  You, people of Gishyita, you are trying to shut your eyes to what happened.  You must not shut your eyes to what you saw.  

"In our prison, which has become our residence, I am a member of the committee that accuses you people.  We are accusing you people.  We have spoken out against those who committed crimes with us, and we are saying that those who did nothing are innocent.  This means that we have given the names of several people who are at large, who have not been arrested.  So you should stand up.  You are asked to stand up and say what these people say, and you show fear.  But when they asked you to get up and go to Bisesero you all went.  

"We want to create a family in Rwanda.  People who acknowledge their crimes must be forgiven, that the innocent should be freed.  Those who committed crimes should be punished as suitable.  Do you not know this?  Do you not know them?  

"I live here part of the time.  I know some of you.  As we were brought here -- listen.  Everybody knows what we did.  What's wrong with you?  What do you think?  Are your hearts still hard?  You know the victims, and the government is telling us that those who killed people should ask for forgiveness, but you don't want to do so.  But when you are asked to stand up and go and kill people, you went and killed them.  

"So, please, gentlemen in prison, as I told you, there are people who haven't been accused.  There are people who are not here in the country.  You should give their names so they can be released.  You should accuse us and say exactly what we did.  Those of us who have decided to be part of the confession and conciliation committee, we want to confess for the Hutu or for the Tutsi who are here.  We are asking you to tell the truth because it is the truth that will triumph in the end.  So you should be aware of all this.  

"People have just stood up.  You have said you didn't know them.  You are afraid to say something.  Somebody stood up.  He wasn't here during the war.  He was in Kigali.  You didn't say anything.  That person is innocent.  You of Gishyita, why don't you say so or don't you know he wasn't here at the time?  

"So we are appealing to those who are here to help us so that in turn we can also help the course of justice.  There are people who have been arrested and detained in our prisons.  You should give us their names, and we will try to see -- prosecute them and see what they did.  Don't you know these people?  You shouldn't be ashamed.  You shouldn't be laughing.  You should free your minds.  You should speak the truth.  Gentlemen, are you going to pretend?  

"This is this old lady who is accusing me.  What you are saying is the truth.  You know people who are with me, Abraham and the others.  Kiromba was with us.  We killed your two children.  Two of them died at Akanti's (phonetic) place.  We saw somebody who took Jason's head.  It was in broad daylight.  You were concealing the truth.  Jason's head was hung on a spear.  You saw it.  If you call the authorities of the locality, they will explain anything.  You should call them instead of supporting the victims.  No, you make us feel like weeping.  

"You, the people of Gishyita commune, if you don't want to speak out the truth, we'll speak the truth.  The truth should be spoken.  There is somebody who is here in prison.  We've undertaken investigations and realised that that person, the person called Bernard Mugenga -- we examined his case to know exactly what happened.  That person was in Rwanda and claims that he did not know.  We were told that this was person was in the north.  If there is something that you have against this person, please tell us.  

"We are trying to know all that you did, wherever you were.  You remember when we went to Bisesero, when Ruhindura died, Samuel Ruhindura.  You recall that we went together to take part in the attacks in Bisesero.  You concealed the truth.  The cows that we seized and that we killed in front of -- what is this person's name? - Muyangayo's house, in front of Muyangayo's house, aren't you aware of this?  Are you trying to hide the truth?  Jérôme Munyandamutsa (phonetic) you know all of this, but you are displaying fear.  

"A certain Kaberuka, is he here, the one who used to sell banana beer at Dukoni?  Can he come forward?  Can Kaberuka come forward and give us his testimony?

"My name is Shawn, and I am telling you this and asking for your forgiveness, and please forgive me.  You are hiding the offences.  Are we going to strip our conscience of these offences if you hide them? You are being requested to stand up and testify.  You don't want to do so.  Is Kaberuka not here?  Come and explain what you know and stop closing your eyes.  

"How did these people know?  Were they with us?  You know that this person who used to sensitise people to go and take part in attacks in Dukoni, you know him, but you are afraid.  Stand up.  Speak out your minds.  You are lucky because nobody is going to arrest you.  

"Has Mushakamba not returned home?  And Aminadab's son, the one who was called Adam, is he not here yet?  Well, it is a pity.   You yourselves, you should speak out the truth.  You should speak the truth so that the innocent can be cleared.  You should understand this very well.  

"It is my younger brother who had those cows.  You shouldn't say untruths in respect of my person.  

"Your junior brother who had these cows, have you given his name?  Everyone knew that that person was arrested and died in prison.  

"And what did you come to do in Ngoma?  Shawn was there as well.  Ask Shawn if I was with him.  In Ngoma I did not go with him.  

"But I saw you with my own eyes.  At Bisesero you were together.  

"Listen.  He may -- refrain from calling certain names so that those persons shouldn't escape, but if you try to escape, you may flee the person who is haunting you.  Well, you wouldn't be able to run away from the person who is inside you.  We have the list.  

"I would like to ask him something.  This person was with Thadet (phonetic).  I have a brother.  I know you know him.  

"I'm going to explain to you, madam.  Please take it easy.  

"I am here for this.  I know what happened.  

"This lady's brother, Mr. Prosecutor, was flushed out at Nganzo, and you know at her home there was a certain ***************************.  You understand, he was brought.  First of all, he was taken to **************s place and that is where he was tied up, and besides my brother, as **********'s wife --Listen, try to ask for forgiveness, like myself.  And **********'s wife entered the house.  I do not know if ********** killed her or not.  I cannot confirm this.  But I would like to ask you this.  

"These people should explain or say exactly who killed my brother.  I don't want to accuse their son, but I think these people know something about **************.  If any person knows something about ***************, they can come and say so because he was arrested at Nganzo.  That person was no longer at Rubengera -- rather, it was a certain Zacharie who hit him at the level of the hips.  

"Well, I'm not the one who was talking; it was, rather, that lady.  The person about whom he's talking, I think I know him for a long time, but I was not witness to his killing.  I did not witness his killing.  I did not witness his killing with my own eyes.  That person died in May, and this was said well before.  

"I mean you can say it, ************* -- let's understand each other.  I cannot accuse you of killing my brother.  I cannot accuse your wife of having killed him, nor can I accuse your son, but your wife made my brother to enter her house.  

"Listen, madam, I'm going to tell you.  I am a Christian.  I am an elder in the church.  I am going to tell you all I know.  Please listen to me and I will tell you.  Louis -- please listen for a while in order to hear the truth.  ********, just as Shawn has just said, was on the other side of the house, and a certain Augustin brought him out of hiding and was taken right to Gisovu, and right on to Gishyita.  All that I know -

"Now, who are these people?

"Amongst those who flushed him out, I didn't know them.  

"But you should speak the truth.  You should speak the truth.  The first person who discovered him was ******************* (phonetic) son.  That person was called ***************. 
(Pages 7 to 15 by S. Eboe-Osuji)

THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
"He is the one who discovered him, as well as a certain *************** (phonetic) and 
**************'s (phonetic) son and a certain son of ************ (phonetic), called Augustin.  They are the ones who discovered him, who flushed him out, and they passed by our house.  I am talking about ********************************* (phonetic).  They are the ones who passed by our house and they had caught your brother, madam.  You deny this?  Well, for these people to be known, ***************'s daughter should have said.  It is ************ (phonetic) that -- he was flushed out.  You shouldn't tell lies.  These people saw members of their families being killed and they are, of course, sad.  You know that my brother was killed here.  Tell me those who killed him.  

"Listen, madam, I am no longer amongst those who tell lies.  All I say is the truth because I can't do otherwise.  The truth be told, I wasn't witness to the killing of your brother.  And you are denying that you are one of those who flushed him out?  No, I no longer tell any lies.  This gentleman is an elder in the church but you can understand that he doesn't want to speak the truth. 

"How was the son of so-and-so called? 

"His name was Charles. 

"Now let's proceed.  You understand, therefore we are going to read a passage of the Bible; that is under Apocalypse, chapter 12, verse 20.  Please embrace each other.  There shouldn't be any problem.  This gentleman is praiseworthy because those other persons are hiding the truth.  Well, you may look at that gesture with some contempt but it's a praiseworthy act.  You see that anybody who will not tell the truth will not be able to embrace the members of the other party.  We are going to begin with those who are bringing forth accusations.  Who is accusing these persons?  Who is it you are accusing?  This one?  Please come forward; don't be afraid.  Let's try to gain time.  

"This is Mr. Mark.  He was a neighbour of my in-laws.  What I can say about this person is that he used to take part in attacks.  And the assailant killed my children, who were in my in-laws' home, and this person left and sat there up until the assailants arrived and the assailants asked him, "Is that child still alive?"  And he told them, "Yes."  So he was sitting at the sill of the house and he did not want the children to flee.  So he refused.  He said, "Whatever the case I'm going to denounce you, so you should not try to make -- cause these children to flee."  So the assailants came and killed them. 

"The assailants caught those children who were members of the attack?

"Well, I was hidden and I don't know their names.  

"So where was the child?  

"Buried, the child was buried at Emmanuel Ntakirutimana's house.  

"Do you know about this as well?  

"No, I know nothing of it.  

"Now, what do you know about that person?  You are being xxxxxxx of having xxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx (phonetic).  For us to know whether you are responsible for his death, you can say what you know to the members of the population here who are responsible for his death.  

"Well, I learnt nothing concerning his death.  My name is Xxxxxxxxx.  I live in the Gisharo (phonetic) cellule.  This boy lives at Ruatuna (phonetic).  I used to live in the Musenyi (phonetic) secteur and he in the Gishyita secteur.  I saw this person.  They are also Leonile's (phonetic) children.  One of the children of Leonile who was married to Bisesero.  He killed four children of Leonile.  He killed them in broad daylight.  We were all eyewitnesses to that factor.  There is only a small stream between our place and theirs, between us and him, and we saw him.  

"Now, if anybody -- are the neighbours of Gishushu's (phonetic) wife here?  May their neighbours come forward.  Please help us, people should come and testify.  You shouldn't have any problems.  

"Can this woman not tell us anything?  Well, Damascene was killed; his wife was also killed.  She was a Tutsi and she was a neighbour.  There's also her brother who is in prison, the uncle of her daughters -- of her children.  

"Generals, please come forward.  Testify.  

"No, I don't know these people.  

"Don't you recall anything?  Don't you remember anybody who took part in that attack?  

"No.

"Is it true what she's saying?  We are going to listen to the next person. 
"I don't know anything concerning Obert.  I knew him but I cannot accuse him.  Recently, when he arrived there's a person who said what he did but that person is in Kigali.  
"Everybody knows that I was residing in Kigali, in the Kinusaga (phonetic) secteur.  I left Kigali on the 15th.  I was in with an old man who lives at Kagamero (phonetic).  I was with a woman who lives at Kika (phonetic).  I came with that person." 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to propose that we stop at this point for now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You should please stop the film now. 
(Videotape stopped)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, go ahead. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I'm going to ask one of two questions to the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, a while ago I sent you a name on a piece of paper, and you said that you knew that person; is that correct?
A.	That is correct, I know that person.
Q.	You also told us that she was ************************* sister; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	That person, did you recognise her in the film that we just saw?
A.	Yes, I saw the person; I recognised her.
Q.	I'm going to send you a name and you will tell us if you know the person. 
MR. SONGA:
May the registry assist us in this, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I also know this person.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you recognise the person in the pictures that we just saw?
A.	Yes, I also saw the person in the pictures.
Q.	The person you saw in the film called ******************, is it the same person you are referring to?
A.	It is the same person.
Q.	There was also mention of the children of a person whose names I'm going to send to you. 
MR. SONGA:
Please, the registry official. 
THE WITNESS:
I also recognise this person. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Now I'm going to put a question to you, Mr. Witness.  Probably, I've already done so, but since we had to take a break to view the pictures, you might have forgotten. Now, Mr. Witness, if someone were to say that Mika is the one who killed ********************, how would you react to that?
A.	This is what I can say about this, sir:  that person would be lying on Mika.  First of all, the person who chased that person didn't include Mika, and I was on the spot.  I was at the location where this person was killed, and Mika wasn't there.
Q.	And if someone were to tell you that Mika killed the children of the person whose names I've just sent to you, the last person whose name I sent to you, how would you respond?
A.	Concerning the death of these children, there isn't much I can say about it because I don't know the circumstances under which they died.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I think this brings to a close my examination-in-chief and, please, I would like to tender the papers bearing the names of the various persons as exhibits. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document bearing the name of the first person is entered as Exhibit D. 92, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 92 admitted, under seal)
MR. SONGA:
Similarly, Madam President, we would also like to tender the cassette.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the second person appearing on a sheet of paper is entered as Exhibit D. 93, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 93 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the third one is entered as Exhibit D. 94, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 94 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the fourth name is entered as D, Exhibit 95, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 95 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the cassette will be Exhibit D. 96, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 96 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, you are done with your evidence-in-chief? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I'm done, Madam President, and thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor, on your right side.  Please try to understand the questions and be brief in your answers. 

Yes, Mr. Phillips, you have the floor for cross-examination. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that people like yourself who participated in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 were, for the most part, ordinary members of the civilian Hutu population?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
A.	Yes, that is true because those Hutu members of the civilian population committed genocide, myself included.
Q.	And therefore there were no bandits from Burundi and Congo and various parts of the hills that descended upon Rwanda in 1994, were there, sir?
A.	I haven't quite understood your question.  Could you please kindly repeat it? 
Q.	That's all right; I withdraw the question.  Now, Mr. Witness, let's move on to some aspects of your testimony in court this afternoon.  Would I be correct in saying that you testified this afternoon that you xxxxxx a xxx xxxxxx Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx?  He was a civilian living in Xxxxxx cellule.  Do you recall telling us that this afternoon? 
A.	I recall having given that evidence, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	And do you recall if you -- have you confessed your crimes before the prosecutor in Rwanda and, if so, do you recall if you told him during your confession that you had participated in the killing of this person?
A.	I confessed to having committed my crime, and if it were possible, you could ask the office of the prosecutor in Rwanda, and the officials of that office will show you the documents containing my confession. 
Q.	And in the confession that you made, do you -- can I start off with the date of the confession?  Do you recall when you made your confession to the prosecutor in Rwanda?
A.	I believe that I confessed my crimes in December 2001.  I do not recall the exact date but I know it was in December.
Q.	How many confessions did you make, sir?  Is it just the one or did you make more than one confession?
A.	I confessed to the murder of that person called Xxxxxxxxxx, so that is the only confession I made.
Q.	And is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that the circumstances that you described to the prosecutor in Rwanda during the said confession was exactly the same thing that you testified before this Court this afternoon? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the contents of my confession are the same as the evidence I have given before this Court.
Q.	Very well.  Now let's talk about the events that you described to the Court, the killing of 
Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx.  Now, can you tell me what role did you play in the attack upon Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx?  I recall that you stated earlier that you stood in his way or you blocked his way, or something.  Can you recall and particularise for us your role in that attack?
A.	The role I played was to xxxxx xxx while he was xxxxxxx, and it enabled those who were pursuing him to reach him.
Q.	Did you not testify in this court this afternoon that, "We killed him on the spot," you and others?
A.	Listen, the fact that I xxxxxxx xxx or caught him xxxxxx that X xxxxxxxxxxxx in xxx xxxxxx.  The fact that I didn't give him a xxxxxx to xxxx is a xxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxx X xxxxxxxxxxxx in xxx xxxxxx. 
Q.	So when you caught him you did what, you handed him over to others who killed him, or you struck him, as well as others?  How did it happen, sir?
A.	I did not strike him, but while he was fleeing, X xxxxx xx xxx xxx; X xxxxxxx xxx xxx.  He was discouraged.  He tried to dodge by taking the main road.  I pursued him to stop him.  When I got to the main road, X xxxxxx xxxx xx xxx and at that point those who were pursuing him came, and immediately Xxxxxxxxxx came and struck him with a club, and he fell.  I therefore cannot say that I xxxxxx x xxxx xx xxx xxxxxx.  I therefore cannot say that I did not play a part in his murder. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  Now, you did not participate in an attack at the Mugonero hospital in 
April 1994, did you, sir?
A.	No, I did not participate in that attack.
Q.	Did you participate in attacks in the area of Bisesero, sir?
A.	I did not go there either.
Q.	And on the 7th of April 1994, would I be correct in saying that you testified that you remained at home and did nothing, but you did nothing on the 7th of April?  Did you remain at home on that day or did you leave your residence?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I did nothing on that day.  I was at home. 
Q.	And you did not live within Musenyi secteur, did you, sir, in 1994?
A.	In 1994, I lived in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) secteur.  I have never lived in any other secteur.
Q.	You could have answered that question by just saying no.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have that struck off the record, please? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the secteur? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the name of the secteur struck off?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the secteur will be struck off the record.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to show you a document. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the September 2000 document, please, before the witness?  Oh, it is here, I'm sorry.  I have it here. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to show you a document which is a -- I want you to look at the signature at the bottom of that page.  It's a transcript of an interview that you held with the public prosecutor at the Kibuye trial of first instance.  Now look at the signature.  Do you recognise the signature at the bottom of that page and would you be in a position to confirm whether or not that signature is indeed yours, sir?
A.	Yes, it is indeed my signature.
Q.	Now, do you recall having been interviewed by the prosecutor in Kibuye on the **********************, the year 2000?  I think it was the same man that you just saw on the screen just now. 
A.	Yes, I remember that.  If you would allow me, I would like to scan through that document.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would rather draw your attention to a particular area that I'm interested in rather than have you scan through the document.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Registrar, can I have it back and I'll just indicate what I want him to read. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, during your interview with the prosecutor, you were asked the following question.  You can read, Mr. Witness, can you not? 
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	It's right at the top of the page.  I've marked it and I've highlighted your answers in yellow.  You see that?  Okay, now we're going to read together this document.  Question -- you were asked by the prosecutor the following question:  "You are accused of having killed Xxxxxxxxxx's family 
including ... " the people listed on that page.  Do you see that, sir, four names:  ****************, 
***************.  Do you see that?
A.	Yes, I can see that.
Q.	Carrying on with the question, he then said to you, having mentioned those four names, "You did this together with" the name mentioned there.  And I would not repeat it because I think he might be a witness in this case.  So you did this with those three names mentioned there.  And then he said to you, "You killed them using clubs and machetes."  And asked you the question: "What do you have to say about this?" 

Do you see that so far, sir?
A.	Yes, I can see that.
Q.	You then responded -- this is you now -- this is attributed to you.  "The ones I recognise among 
those -- " in other words, the names that were listed, the four names that were listed, the victims from Bernadette's family.  You said, "The ones I recognise among those are *********************** and **********************.  And then you say, "I saw them chasing ******************** from the direction of the shops at Gishyita; they took him below to the football field.  I managed to recognise one ***************** who had clubs.  As for **********, I have no idea where she died.  I don't know those others." 

That was your response to the prosecutor, wasn't it, sir?
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	Now, would you agree with me, Mr. Witness, that you did not tell the prosecutor of Kibuye during your interview on the ********************* 2000 that you had actually participated in any way, in any manner or form, in the killing of Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx, did you, sir, during this interview?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, at that time I had not yet confessed to that crime, but subsequently other persons who participated in that attack with me agreed to talk about it, and I decided to confess to that crime in 2001, and I explained to the prosecutor all that happened regarding*****************.
Q.	And towards the end of that statement, the prosecutor then asked you, after the interview and he asked you the following question:  "Will you maintain this statement?" was the question he asked you.  And you then responded, "I will."  Didn't you, sir?
A.	That is what I said.
Q.	And then after the interview, he then read over your statement to you.  You acknowledged the contents of that statement and you both signed the document, didn't you, sir?
A.	That was the case.  However, it appears that even though I may not have explained the role I played with regard to that person, I had not seen his name. 
Q.	Now, two years after you were interviewed by the prosecutor, you then confessed to your crimes, didn't you, sir?
A.	Yes, that is what happened.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the -- sorry, it's right here. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Again, Mr. Witness, I'm going to show you a copy of your confession statement.  I've highlighted the area that I'm interested in you reading, but I still want you to look at the signature and at least confirm that it's yours.  So if you flip the page -- not the highlighted page.  Flip over, look at the bottom of it or the front of it, whichever you want to do.  Do you see that document, sir?
A.	The signature on this document is mine.  I have seen it. 
Q.	Can I just draw to your attention that the date of the confession is not quite 2001 as you told us but 2002.  Would you -- does that refresh your memory, that you may have been mistaken as to the date, or is this a different confession from the one you testified about?
A.	To err is human.  I observed that the date on this document has not changed.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Now, can we go to the highlighted page now?  You have that in front of you, sir? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What page is it?
THE WITNESS:
I have the document before me.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Page three in the English translation, chapter 6, where it says "the crime".
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, this is a summary of what you testified or you confessed to having taken place in relation to the killing of ************, isn't it, sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	It mentions you by name and it refers to you as having pleaded guilty to taking part in an attack during which ************************** was killed.  It mentions that the attackers came from the Gishyita trading centre and that you had heard them calling for help and went to see what was happening.  It then says that when you reached the valley above the football pitch, you saw the attackers chasing ******************* You stood in Xxxxxxxxxx's xxx.  ***************** branched off and took a road higher up.  And it was at the road higher up that **************** bumped into the assailants as they had taken the road above the one which you were on.  Then it says, "The other people who were chasing him arrived immediately thereafter, grabbed him and killed him."  

Do you see that, Mr. Witness, so far? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would you agree with me that your account of the events that led to Xxxxxxxxxx's xxxxx as recounted in this Court this afternoon differs somewhat from what you confessed in December 2002, and the role that you played, doesn't it, sir?
A.	As regards the role I played, I explained to you that I was a person who intercepted that person.  And it is clear from this document that I intercepted him.
Q.	Very well.  Now, finally, Mr. Witness, you -- do you know a lady by the name Mukasine? 
A.	I do not know Mukasine. 
Q.	Are you sure about that, sir?
A.	Listen, there may well be many persons called Mukasine.  Perhaps you should explain further.
Q.	Did you -- were you ever asked by the prosecutor in Kibuye about a lady called Mukasine who worked as a **********************?
A.	Questions were put to me regarding Alleen Mukasine, who was a maid in Antoine's house.
Q.	Isn't it true that questions were put to you in relation to whether or not you had been involved or had any idea as to how she died, sir?
A.	As regards Alleen Mukasine, questions were put to me regarding her death because 
Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxxxxx had xxxxxxx xx xx xxx xxxxx.  But I know nothing regarding her death.  She left with Antoine Nzamurambaho to Ngoma.  I did not follow them and I do not know where she died.
Q.	Do you know where they had sought refuge at Ngoma in 1994, Mukasine and Antoine?
A.	I do not know where they found refuge, but I confirm that Antoine took her in his vehicle and they went in the direction of Ngoma.  I did not see them thereafter.
Q.	Did you ever hear that the lady Mukasine and Antoine sought refuge at the Mugonero complex in Ngoma secteur in 1994, sir?
A.	I do not know where they sought refuge.  I saw Antoine again when he charged me with having participated in her death. 
Q.	And he did that just by the fact that you were not at the Mugonero complex, did he, sir?
A.	I did not set foot in Mugonero.

	1615H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Finally, sir, do you know a man by the name Aaron Ntamageni, M-A-N-A-G-E-N-I, (sic)?
A.	I know Aaron Ntamageni.
Q.	How do you know him? 
A.	Aaron Ntamageni was a civilian who was at home.  I know nothing particular about him. 
Q.	Are you sure, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I know this for sure, because Aaron Ntamageni, even though he was in Kagano cellule, I knew him.  I knew him just as I met other members of the population.  I know nothing else about him.
Q.	Isn't it true that he's currently detained at the location where you are, sir, where you're currently detained? 
A.	That is correct.  We are detained at the same place.
Q.	So when I asked you if you knew him, why didn't you tell me that you were detained at the same place currently? 
A.	I forgot.  Please forgive me.  I explained to you that I had known this person for a long time, well before, when you put the question about that to me.
Q.	Did you also forget, Mr. Witness, that this person is the elder brother of the accused person in this case? 
A.	I know it, but you didn't ask me about the ties that link him to the Accused.  I explained to you that I knew this person.  That's all.
Q.	Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Witness, for being so kind to answer my questions. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, can I enter the two documents that I distributed as the next Prosecution exhibits, please, both under seal? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document of 5th September 2000 is entered as Exhibit P. 86, under seal.  And the document of 1st -- 4th December 2002 is entered as Exhibit P. 87.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I have no further questions. 

And, sorry, Your Honour, P. 87 has three languages, English, French and Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
E for English, F or French and K for Kinyarwanda.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the other one has two languages, English and Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And Exhibit 87 (sic) is E for English and K for Kinyarwanda. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's 86; 86 has two languages. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Eighty-six, E for English and K for Kinyarwanda.
	(Exhibit Nos. P. 86(E) and P. 86(K) admitted, under seal)
	(Exhibit Nos. P. 87(E) and P. 87(K) admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I have no further questions. 

Your Honour, P. 86, just to point out that P. 86(E) is actually an unofficial translation.  I'm still waiting for the final product. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Professor, any re-examination? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, I assume you want the Court to believe that -- you gave evidence that the killers of ******************* did not act on the orders of Mika, and the reason you gave for telling the Court this is that no one said this during your gacaca sessions.  Is that not correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You also said that you -- you never heard that there was rape during the war because nothing of the sort was mentioned during the gacaca sessions.  Is that also not correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, you listened to the video that was played, which was one of the gacaca sessions, did you not? 
THE WITNESS:
Regarding this video, I was talking about gacaca sessions that took place inside the prison.  This video was shot outside.  I was in prison.  I talked about gacaca sessions that we conduct with my fellow detainees and in which people who have confessed their crimes participate.

JUDGE SHORT:
Was this also not a gacaca session, even though it was held outside the prisons? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was a gacaca session, but what I wish to explain, when I gave testimony, I was referring to gacaca sessions inside the prison.  I do not know anything about the gacaca sessions that occurred outside the prison. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But the point I want to put to you is that you heard one of the speakers say that the people are afraid to tell the truth, that some people have shut their eyes to what happened, and some people are displaying fear.  Did you hear that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I heard that.
JUDGE SHORT:
Is it not correct, then, that it may well be that some of the people who you heard speak in prison during the gacaca sessions also sometimes were afraid to tell the truth, and may not mention names of people who they knew participated in attacks? 
THE WITNESS:
Listen, that happened in the past, but where we were, we decided to tell the truth.  I cannot confirm that people refused to tell the truth, whereas the people who are detained with me are telling the truth, as I am. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How is the Court to be satisfied that those people in detention during the gacaca sessions are telling the truth?  What is there to convince us that those of you in detention in gacaca sessions always speak the truth? 
THE WITNESS:
This is what can convince you:  If you think it's possible -- if the thing is possible, you can approach the prosecutor in Rwanda and ask for the confessions of these people. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, you yourself, on the **********************************************************************, you yourself were not telling the truth.  Is that not correct?  Or you were modifying the truth.  Is that not correct?  In your statement, P. 86. 
THE WITNESS:
What is obvious is that the parts referring to the event that the person was arrested and killed is not correct, but I sent an extra document to supplement this document, to acknowledge that I was on the scene, and I personally acknowledge --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, on the one that is before us, P. 86, on the 5th of September 2000, 2000, that is five years or six years after the event, you were still not willing to tell the truth.  Is that not correct?  You were modifying the truth even at that point.
THE WITNESS:
In any case, it is obvious that in this entire document, I explained that I did see this *******************, even if we were not about to tell the truth then.  But there is no great difference between this document and the document of 2002.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is there now to tell us that now you have reached the stage of telling us the truth or telling the whole truth? 
THE WITNESS:
What can confirm it to you is that on that very day, and I have just told you so. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry?  Repeat.  My question is:  What is there to make us believe that now you have reached a point of agreeing to tell us the truth, the whole truth, unmodified truth? 
THE WITNESS:
What can convince you that we are telling the truth is that I told you that you can approach the Rwandan prosecutor.  It is in this prosecutor's office that we tell the whole truth.  The prosecutor can give you the documents wherein those who are under detention confessed to their crimes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for your testimony before this Court.  You are free to go now. 

Mr. Issa, assist the witness to the exit. 
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please call in the next witness. 
	(Witness ushered in)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, can we have the protected information sheet of this witness? 

Mr. Constant, what's the problem? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have just been informed that the next witness is Witness DU.  That's not the information we were given.  We were told the next witness is DT, and I believe DT is in the building.  Why have they brought DU? 
JUDGE SHORT:
What difference does it make?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Because we are not prepared for DU, Your Honour.  We are prepared for DT, and the documents we have here are for DT.  We don't have the documents here for DU because we thought we would do two this afternoon and then the others tomorrow. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is Witness DT in the building?
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honour, Witness DT is in the building.  We brought Witness DU because that was the request made by Defence Counsel Leopold.  Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Bring the correct one.
JUDGE SHORT:
Why can't you bring DT then?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Bring DT. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
DT is there.  We shall bring him immediately.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.
	(Witness stood down)
	(Witness ushered in)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is he Witness DT, Mr. Issa?
MR. MJUI:
Yes, yes, this is Witness DT. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Can we have his protected information sheet? 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness, and to protect your identity, you will be referred to as Witness DT in the court proceedings today.  You also make sure that your identity is not disclosed. 

Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth. 

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness.
MR. MJUI:
Witness, kindly stand up.  Rise up your right hand.
THE WITNESS:
I have a problem.
MR. MJUI:
Witness, rise up your right hand.
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What's the problem?
THE WITNESS:
Before I take the oath, I would like to make a motion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What motion?  Go ahead. 
THE WITNESS:
Since a voice can betray the person who is giving testimony, I would like my testimony to be given in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Why do you want to be heard in closed session? 
THE WITNESS:
I'm asking this because a person's voice may betray who is speaking and the person's identity can be revealed.  I don't think that is good. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
There is nothing in the voice to reveal your identity.  You will not say anything about your parents, where you live or lived, or any other information which would be -- which is likely to lead other people to know who it is that is giving evidence.  If you have to give that kind of information, you will ask, or your counsel will ask, and we'll go into closed session, but we can't accede to your closed session just because your voice -- you do not have a -- nobody has a peculiar voice which is going to be heard through the machines and identify them to any other person.  You have nothing to fear if you don't tell us -- you don't tell us in public who your parents are, where you live or lived, or any other material which would make people know who you are.  People will not know who you are merely because of a voice. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness.  
	(Declaration made by Witness DT in Kinyarwanda)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sit down.  Take a seat, please. 

Mr. Witness, do you see a document in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have a document before me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read it? 
THE WITNESS:
Since I did not undergo advanced education, it is not easy for me to read quickly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Read it slowly.  We'll wait for you. 
THE WITNESS:
I have finished reading. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm that the contents of the document are correct? 
THE WITNESS:
I have realised that these are my particulars. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you also confirm your signature at the bottom of the page? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  It is my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  This document is entered as Exhibit D. 97, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 97 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS DT,
first having been duly sworn
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, how did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I heard it on the radio.
Q.	Was it on the same day?
A.	I found out on the next day. 
Q.	Are you able to tell us the date on which the president died?
A.	If my memory serves me right, it was the 6th. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I spent the day at home, at my home.  I was looking at my herd.
Q.	In April 1994, did you know a person called Mika Muhimana? 
A.	I knew him.
Q.	How did you make his acquaintance? 
A.	We lived in the same secteur.  That is how I knew him.
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	Well before that, he was a trader, but later on, he was appointed conseiller of the secteur.
Q.	Thank you.  In 1994, was he married? 
A.	I cannot know this because I didn't take part in his marriage.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I shall give you a piece of paper on which a name is written, and you will tell us if you know this person. 
A.	If I go back to the last question, the question that you have just put to me regarding his being married or not, I had heard that he was married to a woman but I was not present at the ceremony. 
Q.	And did you know the lady you are referring to? 
A.	Yes.  I know her.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You knew the lady you were referring to and you also said you did not know he was married, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I said so because I can't say anything in respect of their marriage, but I cannot fail to explain this, and that is why I said I was sorry for having said that. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
For having said which?  What are you sorry for? 
THE WITNESS:
You asked me the question as to whether he was married, and I remembered that in Rwanda, there are two types of marriages; that is, religious marriage and the civil-status marriage.  That is the reason wherefore I said that regarding the two types of marriages, I was never a witness to either of the marriages. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did the counsel ask you about two types of marriages? 

THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He merely asked you if Mr. Muhimana was married in 1994.  Is that not correct? 
THE WITNESS:
He didn't ask me such a question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He did not ask you that question?  He did not ask you whether Mr. Muhimana was married in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
You did not make it clear to me that those were your own questions, and besides, you did not ask me the question as to who asked me that question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, listen to me now.  That gentleman, the lawyer standing on his feet there, asked you if Mr. Muhimana was married in 1994; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  And I answered to the effect that I used to hear that he had a woman but I never attended their wedding.  That is what I said in answer. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is not what you said in answer.  What you said in answer first time is, "No, I don't know, I cannot know that because I did not take part -- attend his wedding."  That's what you said first.  Is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
But I explained later, after having remembered.  See, when you are asked a question, sometimes you remember details and you ask for leave to add to your earlier answer, and I think the answer that I gave you is not complicated --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The answer you gave us --
THE WITNESS:
-- Your Honours. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- is that you had heard that he was married to some woman.  That is the answer you gave, the correction you gave, correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And now you then said you even know that woman. 

THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And how could you possibly know that woman if you only just heard --
THE WITNESS:
I know that woman.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How could you possibly know that woman if you had only just heard that Mr. Muhimana was married? 
THE WITNESS:
I will explain this to you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Explain. 
THE WITNESS:
I knew her because she was a teacher, but people were saying that she was Mika's wife, but as far as I was concerned, I never attended their wedding.  I am not telling lies, especially as you can verify this and establish the facts yourself. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are unable to convince me that you did not know, when you answered the first question, that Mr. Muhimana was married in 1994.  You knew that and you chose to conceal it. 

Proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you ever see his wife? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, the one that was said to be his wife, I used to see her, and besides, since she was working in that locality, well, I'm telling you that I knew her. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I sent a piece of paper to you on which a name has been written down.  Can you tell us if you've read the name? 
A.	Yes, I've read it.
Q.	Do you know the person who bears that name? 
A.	It is possible that I know the person, because there is a neighbour of mine who bears that name.  Unfortunately, I'm not seeing the second name of that person. 
MR. SONGA:
Can I ask the registry official to bring back the piece of paper to me so that I can add the second name?   
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I can confirm that it is the same person, that I know the person.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Now, can you tell the Court under what circumstances you got to know the person? 
A.	Here are the circumstances under which I knew the person.  In -- as a matter of fact, the person is a neighbour.  Between my house and his there is a very short distance.  We are neighbours, close neighbours.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to send to you a second name, after which I will ask you a question. 

Have you been able to read the name that I just sent to you, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Do you know the person?
A.	Yes, I know the person.
Q.	Can you tell us what relation there is between the two persons whose names I sent to you? 
A.	Yes, I can do so.
Q.	Please proceed. 
A.	The two persons are brothers-in-law, because the wife of the first person whose name is on the first sheet of paper you sent to me, and the elder brother -- the elder sister, I stand corrected -- of the second person whose name you sent to me, so I can say that they are in-laws in Rwandan culture.  That is, the second person is the elder sister of the person on the second piece of paper you sent to me.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know what happened to the second person during the events of April 1994?
A.	What, for instance?  Can you explain to me further so that I can respond? 
Q.	For instance, in April 1994, that second person, was she married? 
A.	Regarding that person, what I can say is that during the events of that month, she got married.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She got married when? 
THE WITNESS:
Even if I can no longer recall the date, I know that at a certain point in time, she came to her brother-in-law's house -- or he came to his brother-in-law's house, and the brother-in-law got a wife for him. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You mean he got a husband for her? 
A.	I didn't understand the purport of your question, but what I'm trying to explain is that the fact that a spouse was gotten for the person means that he accompanied him or her -- or accompanied her to her husband's home.  I can't explain any further, which is why I told you that he accompanied her to her husband's home.  So he accompanied the bride to her husband's house, to the groom's house.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And how did you get to know this? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry, was that in April, May, June or July? 
THE WITNESS:
Now, it's been a while ago.  I cannot recall the date.  However, it was sometime in the month of April.  I am going to answer your questions because I was a witness to this event. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you state that you were a witness to the event, can you be clearer?  For instance, can you tell us if you accompanied her? 
A.	I will answer by saying -- well, for me to answer your question, I would like to start from the beginning in order to give you more ample explanations.  The fact is that the person whose name is on the first sheet of paper came to my house and told me that she would want me to accompany her -- or, rather, that he -- to accompany him because he was going to give his sister-in-law in marriage.  He asked me this and I gave him the assistance.  That is what happened.
Q.	And what route did you take, going from the brother-in-law's house to the husband's house? 
A.	From his or her brother-in-law's house, where they lived by the roadside, we took the road, we went down, and along the way we were holding conversation, and we went right to the house of the person who had to take her into wedlock.  That is what I can say.
Q.	Did you know the person who had to marry her? 
A.	I know that person.
Q.	Do you know the person's name? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us the name? 
A.	His name was ********************* 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
********************************************** is spelt as follows:  *******
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you.  Can you recall at what time you went to************** house?
A.	If I were to make an estimate, I would reckon that it was between seven and eight o'clock, around those hours.  According to Rwandan culture --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In the morning or in the afternoon?
THE WITNESS:
It is after the cattle would have come back home that we call seven o'clock.  That is between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m.  We can say that it was in the evening.  It is not exactly night yet because -- I would rather say it was the early hours of the night. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And how much time did you spend at *********** house? 
A.	We stayed there, according to my estimate, for a good while; say, about two hours.  We were there for quite a while. 
Q.	Can you remember the people who were present in ************house that evening? 
A.	Since it has been quite sometime ago, I cannot remember the names of those who were there, but I do remember their faces, but not exactly their names.  It has been quite some time.  You will understand that it has been a while since I saw those persons.
Q.	Do you remember how many of them were there? 
A.	I would say that there were more than four.  People came in and went out.  I cannot retain the number of people who were there, but there were people.  For instance, there were people who were there to help him welcome us, and indeed we realised that they were well prepared to welcome us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what was the ethnic origin of the lady appearing on the second document presented to you? 
THE WITNESS:
Do you want to know the person's ethnic group?  I didn't quite get your question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the ethnic group. 
THE WITNESS:
Is that your question? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I didn't pay attention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And what was the ethnic group of *************? 
THE WITNESS:
*********** was Hutu.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed, Professor. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, when I read the sheet bearing your particulars that was shown to you, it shows that your current address is the prison.  Can you tell us why you are in prison? 
A.	I can do that. 
Q.	Please proceed. 
A.	It is because of the crisis that rocked Rwanda, because of the misunderstanding between or amongst Rwandans.
Q.	Are there specific acts for which you are being accused? 
A.	All that I'm being accused of are lies.
Q.	And which is the first lie? 
A.	I am being accused with having participated in the killings in Bisesero, whereas I didn't set foot at that place.
Q.	And can you also tell us which is the second lie? 
A.	That is the lie of which I'm being accused.
Q.	Are there crimes to which you confessed before Rwandan courts?
A.	Apart from the lie that represents the charge against me, personally, I have sought to explain a number of things.  I did that. 
Q.	And what is it you explained, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I explained the events concerning the persons who were killed at a location at which I was present.
Q.	Can you give us the names of the locations? 
A.	I can give you the names, but in the request that I made, if I had to give those names, that would -- that might reveal my identity.  If I start telling you all this and what was done at this place and that, that would reveal my identity.  If anybody scrutinises what I might say, they may understand and know what I am saying, and that is why I requested that you allow me to make -- give my testimony in closed sessions but you refused.  So you do understand that I have concerns. 
Q.	Are you in a position to write down the names of the locations? 
A.	Yes.  I can do that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give him a piece of paper. 

Professor, how long will you be with this witness? 
MR. SONGA:
I still have some two or three questions, Madam President; not much time will I take. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right. 

Mr. Witness, how many names you have written on this piece of paper?  Just one or two names? 
THE WITNESS:
The first name is clearer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, show it to the Prosecutor, too. 
Go on, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you have indicated a location.  Can you tell the Chamber what happened at that location? 
A.	I can do that.
Q.	Please go ahead. 
A.	People were killed at that location. 
Q.	Who were killed at that location? 
A.	Please return the document to me, and I will add those names. 
Q.	Can you tell us the ethnic group those people belonged to? 
A.	What did you say? 
Q.	Can you tell us the ethnic group of those victims who perished in that location? 
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	Did you know the assailants? 
A.	Yes.  I used to see them.
Q.	Are you also in a position to tell us what their ethnic group was? 
A.	They were Hutu.
Q.	Can you give the names of some of those assailants? 
A.	Yes.  I can do that.
Q.	Please do so. 
A.	There was a man by the name of Munana, another person called Mugubushaka, another person by the name of Burabyo.  One person called Alphonse, another one called Ntagara.  A person -- those are the names I recall, but there were also accomplices. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Let me spell the names:  Munana, M-U-N-A-N-A; Mugabushaka, M-U-G-A-B-U-S-H-A-K-A; Burabyo, 
B-U-R-Y-O (sic); Ntagara, N-T-A-G-A-R-A. 

And the witness adds that there was a person nicknamed Gifaransa, G-I-F-A-R-A-N-S-A.  There was also a person called Kanyarengwe, K-A-N-Y-A-R-E-N-G-W-E. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And if someone were to tell you that Mika was among the assailants, what would your reaction be? 
A.	Mika was not one of the assailants, because I did not see him at that location.
Q.	Witness, do you remember the period or the month during which those events of Dukoni took place? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Please tell us. 
A.	It was on the 9th of April 1994. 
Q.	Did you know a place called Kiziba? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What is the distance from that place to Dukoni?
A.	Well, it's a good distance.  That distance is not within earshot.  If you call someone in that location, that person will not hear you, but I know that location.
Q.	If you were walking, how many minutes would it take you to go from Dukoni to Kiziba?
A.	If you are walking briskly, and if the person walking is young and can walk quickly, that distance can be covered in 20 minutes.
Q.	Did you learn that in April 1994, weapons were distributed to Hutu members of the population so that they could go and kill Tutsis? 
A.	No weapons were distributed.  I learned nothing of the sort.  That did not happen in that region. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Witness. 

Madam President, I have no further questions for this witness in examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Issa, can you bring those papers? 

The first document with the name is entered as Exhibit D. 98, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 98 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The second name is entered as Exhibit D. 99, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 99 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the third is entered as Exhibit D. 100, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 100 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are still continuing with your evidence.  Please do not communicate your evidence or proceedings of this court with anyone outside the court.  Thank you. 

We adjourn and resume tomorrow morning at nine.
