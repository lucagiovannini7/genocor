MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.

May we have the appearances for the Prosecution?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Adeogun-Phillips, Kapaya, Madenga, Kabasinga and Lauriston appear for the Prosecution.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  For the Defence?
MR. SONGA:
Good afternoon, Madam President; good afternoon, Your Honours.  My name is Nyairungu Mwene Songa, professor of criminal law in Kinshasha, lawyer at the Kinshasha bar, and lead counsel for 
Mika Muhimana.  To my left is my legal assistant, Leopold Munderere, and to my right, legal assistant, Mathias Sahinkuye.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have the floor for remaining cross-examination, please.  Continue.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, when we wrapped up yesterday, you allowed me to ask the last question on distances.  I think that was yesterday.  Today I would still like to ask a first question on the distances.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, yes.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
ANTONIUS MARIA LUCASSEN
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Lucassen.  When we parted company yesterday, I was asking you whether, during your contacts with witnesses, you met some who were nevertheless capable of giving objective distances, and your answer was as follows: "Of course."  

Now, this is my question:  Who are the witnesses among those you met who are capable of objectively perceiving distances?
A.	Good afternoon, sir.  In this case, my mission was to meet the witnesses, usually in Kibuye town and to ask them to go with me to the places.  I don't remember having asked any figures that were confirmed or not confirmed.  When you asked me yesterday to say yes or no to the question when if I remember a witness, I was remembering of another witness in another trial who did indeed give me the exact distance from his town to Kigali.
Q.	In your report, you make mention of a certain number of witnesses you met, and it happens that in one of the conclusions, you said that the Rwandan, in general, does not have an exact perception of distance.  My question is whether, among the witnesses you met, we can rely on anything one said with regard to distances which -- since there are not many of them, we have one, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.  Out of 11 witnesses, if we go by your experience, you should be in a position to tell us which of those witnesses we can rely on as people who can give accurate distances and those who would be like the average Rwandan who doesn't know how to give objective distances?
A.	For none of the witnesses that I met in the Muhimana case I would dare to ask them a distance and to trust it.  I would always double-check it by either going there myself, or by, for instance, making them point at some place that can be seen so that, myself, I can estimate whether their sense of distance is correct.
Q.	I take it, therefore, that in general you deal with witnesses who give estimates of distances and that you think their estimates are objective?
A.	I don't know if I made myself -- if I expressed myself well.  I mean that, generally, if a witness tells me a distance, I want to check it.  I don't see their estimation as objective unless I have more information to check it, so I do not see the distances that witnesses tell me as objective.
Q.	Has there been any difference between the distances given by witnesses in the case of Muhimana and your own estimates?
A.	Sir, I can't answer your questions because I haven't asked them.  This problem existing, known to me and to the trial team, I have been asked to go with them to the place.  One exception is what we came across yesterday, one witness who told me about the house of Interahamwe Mugonero, that it was a few kilometres away.  There I just wrote down the words of this witness as "a few kilometres away".  Apart from that, the distances in this document are the distances that I measured, measured or estimated with my professional knowledge of estimating distances.
Q.	You have not answered the question I put to you.  My question has to do with the disparities between the statements, specifically distances, given by witnesses, and your personal estimates.  Are there any disparities between statements of witnesses and your own estimates?
A.	There may very well be.  My own estimates are in the part of the binder called "Witness locations".  I don't have with me what the witnesses said in their statements, sir.
Q.	To end this line of questioning to deal with distances, don't you think that if that had been done, that is if you had measured or assessed disparities between what was stated and what you measured yourself on the ground, this would have enabled you to have a more accurate idea of the Rwandan's perception of distances?
A.	That could be true, sir.
Q.	Thank you.  Let us go back to Mika's house, and specifically if we go by your numbering, K0286281.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, you must have noticed that I am referring directly to the English version.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you repeat the number, please? 
MR. SONGA:
K0286281.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, I fear I don't have that number.  We don't have that number.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Repeat the number, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
The number is K0286281.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, we don't have that number.
MR. SONGA:
If you will allow me, I will verify at my level.  I will return to the French version which is more user friendly for me.  Thank you.

Madam President, we have found the references in both documents.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	My question is as follows, Mr. Lucassen:  How possible is it for a person who is in one room to see what is happening in another room?
A.	There are many rooms.  I don't know which ones you mean.  To give you an example, between 
room 6 and room 7 is a door.  One can look if the door is open.  Between rooms 7 and 8, there is no door.  There is a wall.  One cannot look from 7 to 8.
Q.	Thank you.  Witness AQ told you of a room in which Mika allegedly raped a girl, and another room in which she, herself, was raped.  What is the position of each of these rooms in relation to the other?
A.	In the sketch that we have in front of us, room No. 7 is the room where, according to AQK, Mika raped a certain girl, who is now dead.  The neighbouring room, number 8, is the room where AQK told me that she, herself, has been raped by Mika.
Q.	Between those two rooms, how possible is it to see what is happening in the other room from the other, if you are inside the other room?
A.	Visually, that is not possible.  One cannot see from one room to the other.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Even if the door is open in between room number 6 and 7.
THE WITNESS:
From 6 to 7, one can see.  I thought Professor Songa was talking about room 8 and 7.  Between 8 and 7 one cannot see.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you.  I do not know whether AQ told you where she was at the time of the events.  Is it possible that she was one of the occupants of the building on that plot?
A.	She told me that at a certain time she was in this plot, in room number 8.
Q.	You eventually must have spoken about other rapes that she saw with her own eyes in that area; is that correct?
A.	She didn't tell me that.  She told me of another girl being with her in room number 8 being taken away by Mika to room number 7, being raped there and afterwards coming back to room number 8 where AQ still was.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, when she was telling you all this, were you with her inside the house?
THE WITNESS:
That's correct.  I was with her in these rooms, especially in room number 8.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When you presented the photograph, I hope the reference will be correct -- K0286193.  K0286193.  Are you there?  I have not yet put my question to you, excuse me, Mr. Lucassen, I only gave the reference.  My question is as follows:  You stated that AX was tied up and beaten up when her children were killed.  This was your statement of yesterday; is that correct?
A.	That is correct, sir.  That is what she told me.
Q.	Did she tell you who tied her up?
A.	She didn't mention a name, but it was done by attackers, and Mr. Mika was present.  That is what she told me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, what did you say it was done by?
THE WITNESS:
It was done by attackers, attackers in the presence of Mr. Mika.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You say that you were given a name.  Can we see it?
A.	Sorry, I did not say that.  She told me that she was attacked by attackers in general -- she didn't specify -- and that Mika was there kind of supervising the attack.
Q.	I did not quite understand your response.  What is certain is that you said Mika was present.  Is it certain that Mika was present?
A.	That is what she told me.  To be specific, she told me that Mika was on the road, and to show Your Honours the relationship of the road to the place of the events, I took the photograph that is down on this page where we can see part of a car.  This is our car which was on this road, so this is the road, and my person in the middle of this photograph is where the witness was standing at the moment that attackers were killing her children.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that building there Mika's house?
THE WITNESS:
Not at all.  I can show you the location of the house, if you want.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The location of the house of Mika.
THE WITNESS:
It is not Mika's house.  It is the house, if I remember well, of the parents of AXK.  This house is mentioned on this map, map 147, as location number 10.  It is maybe two kilometres away from Mika's house.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You say that Mika was on the road.  Could you please be more precise as to the place where Mika was standing and the position on which AX was tied up?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I have to object to my learned friend's line of questioning.  Witness AXK exists.  She will be called to testify in this Court in due course, and this witness's job is not to give evidence on her behalf.  His job is simply to outline the location where she claims attacks took place, and I think he's done that.  My learned friend has to limit his questioning to matters that concern the physical nature of the crime scene as opposed to the evidence or anticipated evidence of that witness.  It's not right, what my learned friend is doing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor Songa, what do you have to say? 
MR. SONGA:
The objection cannot be retained for the simple reason that the question I'm putting to the witness is based on the statement of this witness here present.  Yesterday, he, himself, stated that AX was tied up, so it has nothing to do with the questions we will put to AX.  We are putting this question to the investigator who stated during yesterday's session that AX was tied up and beaten up.  He should be in a position to defend his statement.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, this witness has not seen the victim being tied up.  He was just narrating the stories given by the witnesses to him.

We have deliberated and we rule that you should ask questions from the witness to the extent he gave his evidence.  The objection is upheld.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, you stated that you prepared sketch K0286158 last year with one of your colleagues; is that correct?
A.	Sketch of Mubuga church, yes, that is correct.  We signed it together in April last year.
Q.	You also said, Mr. Lucassen, that you prepared sketch K0286160 last week; is that correct?
A.	Yes, 160, I prepared it last week.  And if I may add something to sketch 158, I prepared it in 2003.  I added the characters A, B and C last week on this existing sketch.
Q.	Did you ascertain and draw up an inventory of what may have changed between 1994 and the date on which that sketch was prepared?
A.	The sketch is of what I saw at that moment.  I don't have a systematical difference with the situation in '94 because I wasn't there in '94.  Of course, one can see from some information, for instance, from the video and the photographs in this binder that have been taken in '95.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Does your sketch represent what was in 2003 or what was in 1994?
THE WITNESS:
In 2003, sir.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	May we know what would be the interest in your preparing sketches that do not correspond to the site at the time when the events took place?
A.	It would have been better to prepare a sketch at the time of the event, but I wasn't there.  I think that the recent sketch can help Your Honours in getting an idea of the location.  As can you see from information from '95, there is still an awful lot of relevance in it.
Q.	I thank you.  On the photos, on the pictures, for example, of picture number K0286201 or K0286202, on these two pictures we have evidence of destruction, we have traces of damage to the buildings.  Looking at this picture, or looking at the whole building in question, are you able to attach a date to the impact that we see?
A.	No, sir, I cannot do that.  These same images are also in the video of '95 that we have seen yesterday -- the same door and kind of the same damage.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, when did you take these photographs, photograph number 13 and 14?
THE WITNESS: 
My colleague took them in my presence in 2000, Your Honour.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I don't know whether you understood.  Can you date the impact?  Yes or no.
A.	No, sir, I cannot do that.
Q.	I thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Except to state that they appear in the 1995 videos.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, in the 1995 video that we have seen yesterday.  There are images inside this church.  You may remember the coffins, one of the coffins had been opened for the purpose of that video, and then also this part of the interior is visible.  I can replay it if you want.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So then it is safe to state they pre-date the video.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
JUDGE SHORT:
The damage -- we're talking about the damage.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The damage predates the video.
THE WITNESS:
The damage predates the video because the damage is visible on the video.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Based on such photos, or based on photographs of the buildings, are you able to determine the cause of this damage?
A.	No, sir.  I'm not an expert in deciding whether damage has been caused by bullets, grenades or any other impact.
Q.	Would you be more able to describe the nature or the quantity of the weapons that were used to cause such damage?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, he has already replied that he's not an expert to assess the -- to say the damage was caused with which weapons, whether it was with grenades or with guns.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	During yesterday's session, Mr. Witness, the Prosecutor asked you what the functions of a secteur councillor was or were, is that true?
A.	Yes, I remember Mr. Kapaya asking that question.
Q.	In your response you referred to article 3, which gives the composition of a communal council.  You also referred to article 8 regarding the election of the communal council, article 12 on allowances, and article 13 concerning meetings with the bourgmestre; article 37 on the duties of the conseiller; is that true?
A.	Yes, that was my answer, except for that I didn't refer to article 8 only, but 6 to 8 -- 6, 7 and 8.  I also said yesterday that I'm not a legal expert who studied this text that I have in French in front of me, but this is the answer to the best of my knowledge.
Q.	If I refer to this issue, it is because it did not seem to me to be a response to the question, so much so that the Defence was not satisfied.  Would it be too much to ask of you to request that you answer the question again to ascertain your knowledge of the organisation of communal councils?
A.	I don't understand your question, sir.
Q.	It is simple.  Could you allow us to ask you the question once more regarding whether you have some idea of the functions of a communal council; that's all?
A.	Of course, can you ask me any questions and I will reply to the best of my knowledge following the sermon that I gave yesterday.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He's not actually seeking your permission to ask you a question; that he can seek from us.  What he is telling you is can you confirm that you know the functions of the communal council.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour, for clarifying.  The answer is no, I don't know.  I have attached these documents because I think it is relevant.  It is a document that I came across in my investigations.  That is what I have to say.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I thank you.  In your experience of Rwanda, based on your general knowledge, did you ever hear about victims of the RPF between January and December 1994?
A.	Between January and December 1994? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, I'm sorry, the question of RPF victims did not arise in examination-in-chief yesterday and we understand cross-examination under Rule 94 -- 90(D) should be limited to matters which arise in examination-in-chief.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, we see this objection is very relevant.  Please move on to another question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Yesterday I believe I heard a comment and a picture of corpses, corpses seen in 2000; is that correct?
A.	If we are talking about -- yes, if we are talking about the video from '95, in the school church of Mugonero complex, a couple of coffins.  One coffin has been opened for the purpose of showing the corpses to the cameraman.  I have been to Mugonero several times and I have seen those coffins and again they have opened one for me to show that there were bodies inside.  It was not this year, I haven't been there this year.  I was around.  I haven't been into the church.  I don't know exactly when that was.  I suppose it was in 2000 because that is when my colleague and me were taking these photographs.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, you saw the coffins for the last time in 2000; is this your statement?
THE WITNESS:
Well, that's the last time I'm sure of because this photograph is there and we were there together; a photograph taken in 2000 on page 200 showing the coffins.  Maybe they are still there today.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
Maybe not also, because the current government is reburying a lot of bodies.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When you actually say there were bodies, were they preserved in any form or was it merely the skeleton?  What are you calling bodies?
THE WITNESS:
I saw decomposed, smelling bodies, and it was very unpleasant for me to look at them long.  It was, I guess, something in between skeletons and bodies.  It was not just skeletons.  There was still some human remains and some clothes.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I ask this question because, personally, I do not understand what was going on to cause the presence of bodies on the surface relating to events that took place six years ago, so what is the present relevance of the presence of these bodies in 2000?
A.	I can tell you what I think.  I think that a terrible massacre took place in this church; that afterwards the bodies have been dumped hastily, and at some stage, symbolically, as a kind of monument and as a way to honour the death and to honour whatever happened, a symbolical few coffins have remained there covered with some sheeting as a kind of honour to the death.
Q.	I thank you.  Were you able to acquire certainty regarding the identity of these bodies?  Were they Tutsi, Hutus or moderate Hutus?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor how could he answer this question?  How could he assess the ethnicity of a dead body?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
A decomposed body.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, a decomposed body.
MR. SONGA:
I believe that the President's opinion will spare you the effort to identify them, but I asked the question, Madam President, because this is evidence to determine genocide, and you, yourself, know, 
Madam President, of the importance of identity regarding the identity of victims.  

That said, I shall move on to the next question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You said that Rwandans have a problem with assessing distance.  Based on your experience, are there any other specific problems that could have a bearing on this case?
A.	You may have seen in the beginning of the document, in page 143, that I wrote one page about my experience with Rwandan witnesses in general, not specifically in this case, and how my experiences in interviewing them in dealing with distances with sketches and maps and with photographs, sir.
Q.	I can understand that this answer means that your experience did not allow you to note any other specific problems; is that right?
A.	I did not express myself clearly.  Apart from estimating distances wrongly, witnesses can have problems identifying locations on sketches or on maps, and witnesses can have problems recognising the situation on photographs.
Q.	Do they have a problem with the perception of time?
A.	I have no specific thoughts about that.  I'm not aware of that, sir.
Q.	I thank you.  Important questions, especially those regarding your CV, remained unanswered yesterday, and you responded that you would be able to provide answers given a little time; is that true?
A.	That's true, sir.
Q.	Today, 24 hours later, what questions will you be able to answer at this time?
A.	To make my study clear, I wrote for you a description of the two theses that I wrote to finalise my study and I wrote the names of three professors who either helped me in the study or are experts in this field, sir.
Q.	May we have them?
A.	Yes.  I wrote a thesis based on a literary study plus my own theoretical analysis, and that was about the influence of the horizontal or vertical position of the body on the maximum oxygen intake.  And then I did an investigation with a follow-up and preparation.  This lasted about one year, together with a colleague, that was with a group of below-knee amputees, and the investigation was to compare the results of isolated strength straining of their muscular quadriceps femoris to compare the result of this straining on the easy working speeds, the comfortable walking speeds of these patients, compared to other patients who did not get this training.
Q.	May I have the topic of your thesis?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, again I'm going to have to object to my learned friend's line of questioning.  I thought this matter had resolved yesterday.  This witness is not an expert.  He's an officer of our office, and by virtue of the powers of the Prosecutor, under the Articles of this Tribunal, he's empowered to carry out investigations on our instructions.  That is what he has come here to talk about.  Whatever prior qualifications he has before joining this office is absolutely irrelevant.  Unless my learned friend has some objectionable issues as to his job whilst in the Office of the Prosecutor, I would ask that those questions be disallowed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, we have deliberated.  We uphold the objection for the reason that he's not an expert and he's employed by ICTR.  He's employed by the Prosecutor, and his thesis is not relevant to the work he's been doing.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.  I have concluded my cross-examination.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor Songa.  

Yes, Prosecutor, any re-examination? 
MR. KAPAYA:
No re-examination, Your Honours.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Lucassen, you met Witness APK, right?  APK.  Page 220.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's right, sir.
JUDGE SHORT:
And on page 221, you said, "APK showed me the house from where Mika took girls."  What does that mean?
THE WITNESS:
You know, Your Honour, when writing these notes, I tried to be careful not to be the witness who saw it, but nevertheless, I want to make the link between the location that I want to give you information about and what happened, otherwise, just the location is no use.  So she told me a story, and I guess that is in her statement, and to refer to that statement in her statement I just wrote, "The house from where Mika took girls."
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, you also said that, "This house is neighbouring APK's house."  This house, APK's house, does it belong to APK or to somebody else, or was she just residing in that house?
THE WITNESS:
She was residing in that house, sir.  I didn't inquire if she owned it or not.
JUDGE SHORT:
And that is the house which you say is less than 30 metres from Mika's house.
THE WITNESS:
No, sir.  Can I read the paragraph in my wordings to make it clear?
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, please go ahead.  
THE WITNESS: 
"APK showed me the house from where Mika took girls.  I saw -- I, investigator -- saw that this house is neighbouring APK's house, or APK's residence, and then APK showed me another location where APK was when APK saw the girls again, and that is in front of Mika's house.  So Mika took the girls and then APK saw the girls again later in front of Mika's house."
JUDGE SHORT:
Can you show me in the diagram?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can show you the best on the map on page 147.  On page 147 here is number 9, and, as I write in the legend, that is the Gishyita communal office, also the house of APK and the house from where girls were taken, according to APK.  So that's the place from where the girls were taken.  Then the same witness t ells me that later she saw the girls again in front of Mika's house, which is inside number 11.  That's a distance of about one kilometre, sir.
JUDGE SHORT:
Can you relate it to the sketch of Mika's house, or the houses that are neighbouring to Mika's house?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can relate to it this sketch in the sense that the girls were taken from a house about one kilometre away from here.  Apparently they have been taken into the house and then APK told me that she saw the girls again when they were in front of this house, taken out of the house under terrible circumstances, is what she told me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The house from where the girls were taken, that house is neighbouring APK's house?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the girls were taken to Mika's house.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the girls were again seen by APK in front of Mika's house.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I have one or two problems with your sketches which I would like to clarify with you.  Starting with the sketch 158, you say that was drawn in April of 2003.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I made the sketch in April 2003.  I added the characters A, B and C two weeks ago in Kibuye.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where was it drawn?
THE WITNESS:
I prepared this sketch by making drafts at Mubuga church, then I drew it later in the office, partially on the computer and partially by hand.
JUDGE MUTHOGA: 
So you sketched it while at Mubuga?
THE WITNESS:
Well, I make a basic sketch in Mubuga in 2003, and later I went into the office and I made it more nice looking, but the same sketch according to my notes.  As you may see, this part has been done on a computer which I didn't have with me in Mubuga.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And A, B, C were added.  Why did you have to add them last week?
THE WITNESS: 
Because it was last week that I saw this witness, AVK.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You had not seen the witness when you were drawing the sketch.
THE WITNESS:
No, I did the sketch just as a general reference for whenever it would be necessary.  At that moment it was not related to this witness, sir.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What about sketch 160?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
About this sketch, who added and provided you A, B, C?  Which witness?
THE WITNESS:
That was AVK, Your Honour, as it is written in the legend immediately afterwards, here the A, B and C are mentioned.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And that was done last week, is that what you said?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, two weeks ago by now.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What about sketch 160?
THE WITNESS:
It was only two weeks ago that I learned which house is Mika's house, so I made the sketch two weeks ago, and as you see, it has just been made in the field.  I didn't have the time to make it nice looking on the computer.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where did you sketch it?  Where were you when you sketched it?
THE WITNESS:
Inside the house, sir.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In Rwanda.
THE WITNESS:
In Mika's house.  I have been in room 8, in room 7, in room 6, in room 4, in room 10, in room 11.  I have walked in these corridors.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Last week.
THE WITNESS:
Two weeks ago, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that was when you were with which witness?
THE WITNESS:
As I wrote in the legend, I was with AQK, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who was the person who identified the various positions in the house? 
THE WITNESS: 
All of that was AQK, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was the house in the state in which it was in 1995, or did the witness say it was in the same state as it was in 1995?
THE WITNESS:
She told me that, what I'll call the behind house, the house that is not on the street, but behind, was in '94 under construction, and I could see that it was a more recent house.  Apart from that, she didn't mention any differences to me.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On the sketch, what do you call the behind house.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's house number 10?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, exactly.  The house with room number 10.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So the house with room number 10 did not exist in 1994.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it did exist, but I don't know exactly in which form.  It was under construction, I don't know how far the construction was ongoing.  For instance, I don't know if there was already a roof on it or not.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you find out whether it was occupied by anybody at that time?
THE WITNESS:
I have been told that another witness was hiding in this house.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, I mean number 10.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have been told that another witness was hiding in this house, but that she died, and that, nevertheless, she is on your witness list.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you didn't find out the state of completion of that house at the time.
THE WITNESS:
Well, sir, I had no reasons to doubt the situation, so I didn't inquire.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not to doubt.  I mean, you don't have to doubt.  Finding out something you don't know doesn't depend on doubting.  If somebody says, "This house was incomplete," the next question you ask them, "How incomplete?  Was it just the foundation or had it been roofed?" or something like that.  In that case, or in the circumstances of this investigation, you then have asked if the witness knows who completed the house; is it Mika or  is it somebody else?
THE WITNESS:
You're right, Your Honour.  All of these questions, in the physical circumstances of being with the witness in the house, I had no opportunity to ask them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And Mr. Investigator, from where did you learn that this house was under construction in 1994?
THE WITNESS:
AQK told me, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And AQK didn't tell you who had completed the construction?
THE WITNESS:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, this brings us to the end of your evidence.  We thank you very much for your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe trip home.  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, who is your next witness?  In the calendar it's AP.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that's correct, AP.  

Your Honour, whilst Witness AP is being brought into the courtroom, can I deal with some housekeeping matters in relation to our timetable?  

Your Honour will recall, yesterday I informed you that we have five witnesses in the country.  In terms of our scheduling, we sincerely hope that we would be able to complete the five this week, and Your Honours would understand why next week on Friday we have another five being brought, but next week is a very short week, so if we don't complete the witnesses we have assigned for this week, and we have a short week next week and a short week the week after, inherently we are going to come into problems, and we just need to be mindful of that in relation to the time we take.  We certainly are, and I hope my learned friend is as well, that we have to complete ten witnesses between now and next Thursday.  That's the long and the short of it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, to be a bit frank, the estimated time given for this witness was one hour.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 This witness, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, according to your table, and you have taken more than two hours, and in all fairness, the Defence should be given the same amount of time, so you should be careful with your time.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, we are both guilty of that.  I'm grateful.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And we all intend to wrap up this case within the given time.

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  We proceed to record your evidence under your pseudonym, AP.  You are a protected witness, so please do not disclose your identity.  Don't reveal your name or place of residence that may lead to your identification.  

You shall speak the truth and for that you have to take a solemn declaration.  
Yes, please, swear in the witness.  
(Declaration made by Witness AP in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness, sit down.  Madam Witness, may I remind you that in answering the question asked, please look at us.  Look in front of you.  

Mr. Phillips, can we go with this sheet of paper?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you have a sheet of paper in front of you.  Do you have a sheet of paper in front of you?  Go to the particulars mentioned in the sheet.  Read the contents of the sheet, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The witness is illiterate, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She's signed it.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, it was read to her.  That's why I was going to deal with it, if she can confirm her signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is this your signature at the bottom of the page, Madam Witness?  Do you see your signature at the bottom of the page.
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Should we ask the translator to explain to the witness?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I think I should do it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.




WITNESS AP,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon Madam Witness?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Could you look at me, please?  I'm over here, Madam Witness.  Can you see me?  Madam Witness, I've had placed in front of you a document.  Can you confirm that you recognise the signature on that document as being yours, Madam Witness?
A.	(No interpretation)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Prosecutor, that would not be sufficient confirmation.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I haven't finished, Your Honour.  I'm just basically going into it. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you confirm for me that that is indeed your signature on the document?
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
For some reason I'm not getting any translation of the witness's answer one way or the other.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there a translation problem?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 Is there a problem? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
We are not getting the Kinyarwanda booth, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you hear me now, Madam Witness? 
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you see the piece of paper you've had placed before you?  Just answer me yes or no. 
A.	Yes, I can see a document in front of me, but I neither know how to read nor to write.
Q.	That's correct, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, do you recall that my assistant and I went through that document with you yesterday going through your personal identification details with you, your name, your place of birth and other such matters?  Do you recall us doing that?
A.	Yes, I do acknowledge that your assistant came to assist me read this document since I am illiterate and I do not see properly.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that you thereafter appended your signature on this document confirming its contents as being accurate; is this not the case?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Prosecutor, I think you didn't get my interruption last time.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 Perhaps not, sir.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If you or your assistant has gone through this document with this witness and confirmed everything that is confirmable, that is good for you, but it's not good for the Court.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is essential that someone actually asked the witness to tell the Court -- not to tell you -- to tell the Court, after it is read to him or to her that, "It has now been read to me and I confirm that every aspect of this document is correct."
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that is indeed correct, but there is some premise and jurisprudence to this measure.  The reason why we adopted this measure some four or five years ago was to save the Court's time in going through the personal identification details of the witness, and the idea was for us to go through it with her before she enters the courtroom, put the document to her, enter it into evidence and move on.  But, Your Honour, I can spend the next ten minutes going through her personal identification details with her, and that would consume the Court's time because literally we would have to go through everything here.  We have done this in the past, Your Honour, in most of the trials that I have handled in this office.  I thought that procedure was established, that's why I did it.  If it isn't, I will go through the old fashioned way.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It probably is, but there is a problem in it.  Suppose she wants to tell us that that is not the case.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would have made that represention to you, Your Honour, because I would have discovered that before now and I wouldn't have procured her signature if there were errors in the document.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you would ask the Defence to take your word for it?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The Defence have a copy of the document, and that's the first thing we did.  We gave it to them, and if they had a problem, they would have raised an objection.  That's how we assume.  I have no problem going the long way, Your Honour.  I am just trying to be of assistance to the Court, and if the Court would rather it the other way, I'm quite willing to do that, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Our concern is just the short-cut, that you might short-cut it, and someone somewhere might say this witness was not well apprised, especially if indeed it turned out, as it has turned out in some other trials, that the information wasn't accurate.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Then that would almost have made a farce of my reconfirmation yesterday, which would I hate to anticipate.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, please proceed.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness, I had asked you a question.  I didn't quite remember if you answered me, but the question was as follows: is your signature on this document an indication that you have had read to you the facts, the contents of that document, and that you confirm that they are true and accurate?
A.	That document contains my signature and that signature and the contents of that document are mine.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This will be exhibit --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I think it's P. 3.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 6, I think.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It should be 5.  You were asked by the President to mark Exhibits 3 and 4, but you marked A and B -- 3A and B, instead of 3 and 4.  On the minutes of these proceedings yesterday, the exhibits are indicated as 3A and B, and they were expected to be 3 and the other video cassette 4, so that this will be 5.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 5.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honour, thank you for the correction.  That was not our understanding yesterday, but we will correct that immediately.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I did tell the Court officer to mark as Exhibit 3 and 4, to Mr. Juma.  You will confirm it.  So this is entered and exhibited as P. 5 under seal.  
(Exhibit P. 5 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, I am going to ask you some questions in relation to your statements to ICTR investigators on three occasions, do you understand that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, before we proceed with the examination-in-chief, how many statements do we have of this witness?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Three, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you leading evidence on all of them?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Pretty much.  I'm leading evidence on all of them, Your Honour, yes, at least by implication.  Some of them by implication; some of them direct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you recall making those three statements?
A.	Yes, I do remember.
Q.	Madam Witness, can I ask you to glance in my direction from time to time?  I need to be able to communicate with you.  Can you do that for me?  I'm over here.  You are not looking at me, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I will do that, Counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	Thank you.  Would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that you heard of the president's death on or about 6th April 1994.  Would I be correct in saying that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, this is a kind of leading question.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Again, Your Honour, it's designed to save time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Why don't you ask her --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If the witness is going to dispute that the president died, Your Honour, then I'm not going to get out of here in four weeks.  I could ask the question in a different way, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you hear of the death of the president in 1994?
A.	I heard.  I was told of the death of the President Habyarimana on the 7th April 1994, and it was in the morning.
Q.	Whereabouts were you, Madam Witness, when you were told of his death?
A.	Nobody told me, but I heard the news on the radio.  It was in the morning, just after I woke up and I was at home.
Q.	Did you remain at home throughout the remainder of that day, the 7th April, after you heard the news?
A.	I stayed at home, and around 9 o'clock I felt that there would be a problem and I took our cows and I took them to Bisesero.
Q.	When you refer to 9 o'clock, do you refer to 9 o'clock in the morning, Madam Witness, or in the evening?
A.	I am referring to 9 o'clock in the morning.
Q.	Having taken your cows to Bisesero that day, what else did you do on 7th April, Madam Witness?
A.	I did nothing else, I stayed at home and about 10 o'clock Conseiller Mika called the communal office and the communal police took me and detained me.
Q.	Why were you detained by the communal police on this day?
A.	They arrested me because I had taken my cows and they claimed that in taking my cows, our cows, I could be at the origin of a poor climate within the population.
Q.	The person you referred to as Conseiller Mika --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, we have not understood the answer given by this witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I was actually going to come back to it.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, when I asked you why you had been imprisoned, can you repeat your response?  Why had you been imprisoned on 7th April by this policeman?
A.	Conseiller Mika Muhimana asked the policeman to detain me because I was at the basis or the root of the insecurity of our region because I had taken our cows to the Bisesero region.
Q.	What did you understand him to mean by you being the basis of the problem by taking your cows?  What had you done wrong by taking your cows to Bisesero?
A.	For me, I told myself that after the death of the president, they were going to take our cows and eat them, so I decided to take them away.
Q.	Why was that an offence that resulted in your imprisonment on 7th April?
A.	I did nothing bad, and the reason why I took the decision to take our cows away was that my husband was not present, and we were living near the communal office, and I took this decision.
Q.	And the person you referred to as Conseiller Mika, does this person have a second name?
A.	He's called Muhimana.
Q.	How long did you remain in custody at the commune office following your arrest on the 7th?
A.	I was detained for three hours.
Q.	So what time were you released about?  Can you tell me what time you were released?  Do you recall?
A.	I was released at 2 p.m.
Q.	Why were you released at 2 p.m., Madam Witness?
A.	I was released after the arrest of Mr. Nkundiye, who was an agronomist.  Also Mr Murindiahabi was also an agronomist.  After their arrest, they were immediately killed and I was asked to go back to the house.
Q.	These two people that you mentioned, you've described them as agronomists.  Can I talk to you about the first one?  Why was he killed, Mr. --
A.	He was killed because he was a Tutsi.
Q.	Can you give me the names again, these two men that you refer to because we need to spell it into the record.  What were their names again?
A.	N-K-U-N-D-I-Y-E.  The second was Murindiahabi.  The second was Murindiahabi -- 
M-U-R-I-N-D-I-A-H-A-B-I, Murindiahabi.
Q.	Now, you describe these two men being killed, Murindiahabi and Nkundiye.  Why were these two men killed?
A.	They were killed because they were Tutsi.
Q.	Were they killed in your presence, Madam Witness?
A.	After my release, I went home and I came back because I live very close to the communal office, and when they were being beaten with clubs, I could see them, and they were beaten to death, and the massacres began with the death of these two persons.
Q.	Now, let's go back to the time of your release.  In terms of the time you were released from prison, were you released before these men were killed or were you released after they were killed?  Let's deal with that first.
A.	When I was released, these men were not yet killed.  They were killed afterwards.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, who had killed these two men?
THE WITNESS:
These men were next to the communal office.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, who was the killer?
THE WITNESS: 
It was Mika and Sikubwabo, the former bourgmestre, who killed them, and these two men who killed them were accompanied by other Interahamwe.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, following your release from prison, Madam Witness, at 2 o'clock or thereabouts on the 7th, what did you do once you were released?
A.	I did nothing.  I prepared a meal for the children because I was telling myself that if we had to run away, the children had to eat first.
Q.	Did you see Councillor Mika again on that day, Madam Witness, following your release from prison?
A.	Later I saw him at 7 p.m.  He came to visit us.  He was a friend of the family.  He came to my 
father-in-law and he brought two of his daughters.  He brought them.  He took them to his house.  I followed him because I wanted to ask him whether he could take my children and hide them, and when I got to his house, I saw how he got them into the house.  I could hear voices of many people, and amongst these voices, I could hear the voice of the bourgmestre.  I stood apart somewhat, two or three metres away from his house, and I remained standing.  I heard children, actually young girls, I heard them screaming and calling Mika's name.  They cried -- they screamed horribly, and I did not move.  I said nothing.  We could see -- one could see his house because he had electricity.  At a certain time, the cries, screaming stopped and I saw how they were taken out.  They were taken out stark naked.  He called young people who were in the house and he told them, "Go out, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to show you what a Tutsi girl looks like."  None of them was dressed.  They were not even warring their panties and they were walking -- their legs were apart as they walked.  I stopped.  I saw how they fell to the ground.  These girls -- these young men fell on them with clubs, and I ran.  I understood immediately that the war had begun and there was no refuge for us.  I took my children and I ran away.

When I got to the bottom of Mika's house, I saw the bourgmestre who was waiting, a certain Ndahayo -- N-D-A-H-A-Y-O, and we ran.  The bourgmestre fired, and he shot at three of my children who fell to the ground.  I continued with two of my children.  I spent the night on the road and I arrived at Bisesero in the morning, or rather at night, but already it was the 9th.  I arrived at 3 p.m.  I mean I arrived the next day at 3 p.m.
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm now going to talk to you and take you through what you have just testified about in a little bit more detail.  Do you understand that?
A.	All right.
Q.	You started off by telling the Court that Mika came to -- the man you describe as Mika came to your father-in-law's house at 7 p.m. on 7th April; is that correct?
A.	That is right.
Q.	First of all, how far was this house from your house, this house that you say Mika came to?  First of all, how far was that house from your house?
A.	It was in the same compound.  It was my father-in-law's house.  To go to the road you had to pass in front of my house when you left my father-in-law's house and you wanted to go to the road, you had to pass in front of my house.
Q.	The second think I want to ask you is this: did Mika arrive at that location, at that house, with two girls, or did he take two girls from that house?  Did he bring the two girls or did he take the two girls from that house?  Did can you help me understand that, please?
A.	He took them away from this house.
Q.	Very well.  Do you recall the first names of these two girls that you have just described to the court?  Their first names, don't tell me their surnames, just their first names.
A.	One of them was Immacule, and the other was called Languide.
Q.	Do you recall how old the two girls were?
A.	One of them was 25 years old and the other was 18 years old.
Q.	Which of them was 18 years old and which of them was 25 years old?  Can you help me with that?
A.	I think that it was Immacule who was 25 years old, and Languide was 18 years old.
Q.	And the two ladies, the young girls that you talk about, did they live in the same locality, or were they from somewhere else?
A.	These children were children of this family.  They were studying far from their home, but at that time they were in that house, it was during the school holidays.
Q.	You testified that the person you describe as Mika then took them away from that house and took them where?  Where did he take them after having taken them from that house?
A.	He took them to his house at the commercial centre, which is quite close to our house.
Q.	Approximately how far was the house of the person you describe as Mika from the house where the girls were taken on 7th April?  Do you know?
A.	One can estimate that between our home and the home of Mika is about 30 minutes by foot -- on foot.
Q.	How had Mika arrived at the location where these girls were before he took them away?  Had he come on foot?  Had he driven?  Can you help me with that?
A.	He came on foot that evening.
Q.	Why did he take the two girls away from that house on that occasion?  Do you know why?
A.	Mika was a very close friend of the family.  We thought that he was going to hide them.
Q.	When you say "we", who exactly do you refer to?  You and who?
A.	Me and the family of my husband.
Q.	Were you all present when Mika took the two girls away, Madam Witness?
A.	We were present except for my husband, who was somewhere else working.
Q.	Did you follow, Madam Witness, Mika and the girls?  Did all of you follow them on to Mika's house after he had taken them?
A.	I followed them to see where he was taking them.
Q.	And I think you testified a while ago that he took them to his house; is that not correct?
A.	Yes, he took them into his house.
Q.	Had you known, Madam Witness, Mika's house before that day?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Had you in fact known Mika before 7th April 1994, Madam Witness?
A.	I knew him.  He was a neighbour.
Q.	Having arrived at his house with the two girls, did you go inside the house with Mika and the two girls, Madam Witness?
A.	No, I did not follow them into the house.  They went in and I stayed outside.  I think I was three metres away from the house.
Q.	So when Mika took the girls from their parent's house to his house and you followed, was Mika aware that you were following him and the girls?  Did he see you following them?
A.	No, he did not know.  He was looking straight forth ahead of him and I had maintained a certain distance between myself and them.
Q.	And as the two girls walked with Mika from their parent's home to his house, did they appear to be following him voluntarily?  Were they being dragged along?  Can you help us with that sort of situation?
A.	The two girls followed him as a friend who could hide them.  I could notice that they were happy because they did not suspect him of any evil doing.
(Pages 1 to 26 by Trevor Gerbes)

























	1600H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	What ethnic group were these two girls, Madam Witness?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	Having arrived at Mika's house, you testified awhile ago that you saw the girls going inside.  Is that correct, they went inside the house?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What time of day was this?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness answered the first question that Mika took them into the house, and she answered the Judge by saying that it was about 7 p.m.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And, having taken them into the house, what were you able to observe next, Madam Witness?
A.	I heard these children screaming, calling Mika's name, asking him pardon, telling him that they were not expecting him to do that to them and that these screams continued.  I waited for about one hour, and when they came out they were totally naked and they were walking with their legs apart.  And at that time he called young persons who were in the house and he told them, "Come out I want to show you what Tutsi girls look like."  I saw how one of them received a blow from a club.  She fell to the ground.  At that time I ran away.  I took my children and I ran away.
Q.	Now, can you tell me when Mika arrived at the house with the two girls, was there anybody else present inside that house, at that time, apart from Mika and the girls?
A.	Listen, I didn't enter the house.  I can only say that there were many people.  The only person whose voice I recognised was the bourgmestre.  I was able to recognise his voice because he was one of our neighbours.
Q.	And did you hear what the bourgmestre was saying?  Did you hear him say anything, since you recognised his voice?  Can you help us with the sort of things he said and to whom he said them?
A.	I heard him asking the girls to shut up, and the children were crying, were screaming, regardless.
Q.	So you waited outside Mika's house at a distance of --
A.	Yes, indeed.
Q.	You waited outside his house at a distance of about how many metres, madam?  How close were you to his house as you waited and heard these girls scream?
A.	I was, say, between here and his house.  It was about -- I was here and his house was about the wall that is opposite me.
Q.	Madam Witness, if you show me that again, so that I can reflect it in the record.  You were where, Madam Witness?  From where you were sitting, to which wall?
A.	Over there.  I was, I would say, around that wall, that wall on which books are stacked up.  I could see the house because his house was well-lit.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let the record reflect that the witness has indicated the wall where the translation booth is to where counsel for the Defence --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have a diagram of the courtroom?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We used to have one.  I don't know if we have it in this courtroom.  We have it in Chamber I.  I think it was for Chamber I.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you get it for us from Chamber I?  What would be the distance?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I wouldn't give -- hazard a guess, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She said from wall to wall.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour, from this wall to Defence counsel's bench.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are not pointing from where she is to that wall?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
From this wall to the bench.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you assist us in that exercise again?  From which wall to which location, so we have a better idea?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Has it been translated?
THE WITNESS:
It is from the interpreter's booth up to the middle bench.  I indicated with my fingers, that's the distance.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yeah, which is --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is from the booth to the Defence?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
To the beginning of where the Defence counsel are seated, yeah, that's what she's indicating, which is about ten metres.  Could be more but a little bit more than ten metres.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
More like 15 metres.
THE WITNESS:
Excuse me, I am not in a position to give such estimates, but I have given you more or less the distance between me and the house.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay, thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, how long after the girls went into the house did they re-emerge, in your estimate?
A.	They spent two hours in there.
Q.	And if they went in at seven o'clock, which is what you testified in response to the learned Judge's question, would I be correct in saying they re-emerged around nine o'clock in the evening?  Would that be about correct?
A.	I was unable to estimate the exact time.  I did not have a watch, but I believe they spent a lot of time there.  I wasn't wearing a watch, so I can't give the exact time.
Q.	What was the lighting condition like at that time, was it dark, was it light?  Can you help me with that sort of thing, please?  How were you able to see the girls re-emerge from where you were located?
A.	Mika had electricity.  The area was well lit.
Q.	And having re-emerged from the house, you testified that the two girls were naked.  Is that correct, Madam Witness?
A.	I do confirm that.  They came out stark naked and I said that they were not walking normally.  They were walking with their legs apart.
Q.	And what, in your opinion, did you think had happened to the girls whilst they were inside Mika's house.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You can't ask a question like that.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My learned friend from the Defence has raised no objection.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I have.  There's no way, until they came out, for this witness to know as to what happened inside, it cannot be evidence.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's one thing for it to be evidence, in my respectful submission, it's another thing for the words to be attached to evidence.  Certainly, standing outside the door she's in a position to form an impression as to what may have occurred in the house, and that's the very essence of her testimony, in my respectful opinion.  That's why she's here, in my opinion.  Perhaps, according to what weight you attach to it, under Rule 89(C), matters can be admitted under Rule 89(C) as long as they have rules of probative value.  Those are rules of the Tribunal.  That's a matter of weight.  That's a matter for Your Honour's deliberation.  That's my submission.  Your Honours may think different.
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, wouldn't she be speculating as to what occurred inside the house?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Again, Your Honour, it would be a decision that Your Honours would make in deliberations.
JUDGE SHORT:
What I'm asking you is, are you not asking what occurred?  Wouldn't it be better to ask her what -- exactly what she heard?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
She has.
JUDGE SHORT:
Which is what she has done -- for the Chamber to determine exactly, you know, what that constitutes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
As Your Honours please.  I can address it in closing and draw my own conclusions or ask the witness for the conclusion, but I make the point if Your Honours are conveniently satisfied by the evidence.  So  I move onto another matter.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In fact, Counsel, she did say she heard them say to him, "you could not do this to us."
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, but that could mean a lot of things.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But whatever it was, there is no basis on which she can narrow down to it, but it must be something that the girls did not like to be done to themselves.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You can leave us to think what that might be when you have a witness; what opinion he forms, that goes to another level of evidence, which perhaps goes to complicate the matters.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm happy Your Honours are satisfied so far.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, you then saw the girls come out of the house and you testified about the fact that some people beat them up.  Can you help us about that?  What happened after the girls came out of the house and came out naked outside of the house?
A.	They came out of the house, their legs apart.  Mika, accompanied by Sikubwabo, called the youngsters who were inside the house.  The two girls were thrown to the ground and the youths were asked to come and see what Tutsi girls look like.  After some time one of the youngsters hit the girl with a club -- one of the girls with a club and that is when I fled and, thereafter, I did nothing else.
Q.	Now, the comments, "Come and see what Tutsi girls look like."  What did you understand that to mean, Witness?
A.	It was because they were stark naked and they couldn't stand on their feet.  They couldn't remain on their feet.
Q.	Were you able to identify any of those who subsequently attacked these ladies, after they came out of Mika's house, any of the attackers?  Were you able to identify them?
A.	No, I could not -- I was not in a position to observe what was happening.  All I did was to flee.
Q.	But would I be correct in saying that before you fled the area you actually witnessed these two women being attacked with clubs; is that right?
A.	Yes, I saw that.  I saw how one of them was hit with a club, and that was the precise moment when I fled.
Q.	Okay, now, was Mika present when one of the girls was hit with a club or was he still inside the house?
A.	He was there.  He was the one who took the girls out.
Q.	And the comment that you heard, "Come and see what Tutsi look like."  Who made that comment, and in what language was that comment made?  Can you help me with that?
A.	It was Mika who took them out, and he was the one who made those statements.
Q.	Now, you fled the area and you testified to us earlier that three of your children were shot by Sikubwabo.  Now, when you fled the area of Mika's house, where were you heading and with whom did you flee that area?
A.	I left in the company of my children.  The old women who had been with me chose to go to the communal office.  They were killed very close to Mika's house.  As for myself and the children, we headed towards Bisesero.
Q.	And how many children did you have in April 1994, Madam Witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We didn't get the translation.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Neither did I. 
THE WITNESS:  
	I had five adult children.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	In terms of their sexes, can you tell me how many were boys and how many were girls?
A.	I had (........) girls and (......) 
Q.	And you testified that three of your children were killed.  Now which of your children were killed on the 7th of April as you fled Bisesero, Madam Witness?
A.	It was (.............) of my daughters who were killed.
Q.	And having been shot, as you testified, what did you then do?  Did you continue on your way or did you remain in the area?
A.	I left with the two children who were remaining and I went with the other refugees who were heading for Bisesero, and we spent the night on our way to Bisesero.
Q.	So you were left with a daughter and a son.  Would I be correct in saying that, after the shooting?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And did you spend the night at Bisesero or did you spend the night on the way to Bisesero?
A.	I spent the night on my way.  I only got to Bisesero on the 8th.
Q.	Now, the people you referred to as having fled with you to Bisesero, were they fleeing from attacks in the area as well?
A.	Yes, we were fleeing the attacks which were being organised in Gishyita.
Q.	You arrived at Bisesero on the 8th of April, as you testified.  Do you remember what time on the 8th of April you reached Bisesero?
A.	I arrived in Bisesero at 3 a.m. 
Q.	Where was your husband at this time, Madam Witness?
A.	My husband was working in Gisovu in an area called (........)
Q.	And for how long did you and your (......) children remain at Bisesero, Madam Witness?
A.	My children died in May.  That was the end of May, but I don't know the exact date, because during that period we lost a notion of time.  We could not even make out the various days.
Q.	And did you, whilst you remained at Bisesero, did you witness any attacks in Bisesero area?
A.	As regards the attacks that were launched in Bisesero, during the last two weeks in Bisesero, one attack was launched against the Kaninya area, but when we were forewarned or informed that they would provide us with drugs and food, that they would provide drugs and food to the hungry, drums were beaten.  We refused to heed the call.  It was only one Ruzindana (phonetic) went to meet them and he asked us to assemble saying that the following day he would give us food and drugs.  It was only the following day that he organised the attacks that was attacking us.  That happened in the second week in the month of April.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam, would you clarify who gave you food and drugs?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has said that it happened in the last two weeks of April.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That wasn't the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
My question is who gave them drugs. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you give the translation?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, your microphone was not lit, that is why we could not hear what you were saying.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are seeking clarification who promised to give them food and drugs.
THE WITNESS:
It was Mika, he came on board a vehicle at about 2 p.m., he beat the drums and called us to come to a meeting.  We refused to heed his call.  A certain Ruzindana went to Mika.  He had the courage to go to Mika, and Mika told him, if there are people who have been wounded, there are people without food, he promised that the following day he would go to the Kanyinya hill with white persons and bring food and drugs to them, and Mika left immediately.  

I don't know whether I should continue narrating what happened thereafter.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, the events that you are describing, Madam Witness, where did this take place?  Where in Bisesero did this take place?
A.	This happened on Kanyinya hill, K-A-N-Y-I-N-Y-A.
Q.	And just remind us, when, in terms of dates, do you say this took place?  I know you said it was in May but when in May?
A.	Well, we could not recall dates.  We do not even know the day of the week.  Night followed day.  We didn't know which day it was.  It was in the month of May.  We had just spent a month in Bisesero.
Q.	Okay.  Now, you then testified that Mika came back the second day; is that correct?
A.	You are saying second day in relation to what day?
Q.	Yes, you testified that he came and offered you food and medicine and you didn't heed his call.  And then he came back the second day.  Do you recall you saying that?
A.	He came the first day and he beat the drum.  He was accompanied by a communal police officer.  He asked the police officer to call all the refugees to come to Kanyinya, where he had parked his car.  When we realised we were dealing with Mika, we refused to heed his call an old man called Ruzindana was Ruzindana had enough courage to go meet Mika.  And Mika asked him to tell us the following day he will return with drugs, and food and he promised to appear at about 9 a.m.
Q.	Now you've talked about a vehicle.  Can you describe what vehicle Mika was in when he came to Kanyinya hill on this day?
A.	It was a red Toyota belonging to the commune.  Mika used to go about on board that vehicle.
Q.	Did he return to Kanyinya hill the following day, Madam Witness?
A.	He came.  Some people took courage and went close to him.  People who were wounded remained in their hideouts.  And on our way we saw many buses carrying many people.  Some people fled, others couldn't because they were wounded.  Some were killed on some hills.  Many people were killed on that hill.
Q.	Now, the attackers that took part in the attack that you just described, do you know how they arrived at the Bisesero area the following day?  Do you know how they got there?
A.	They came on board buses.  I couldn't count the number of buses.  There were many buses, as many people as the people sitting in this courtroom.  There are also pickups, and in those pickups there were clubs and guns.  There was also a man known as Nyagihigi who was killed there 
N-Y-A-G-I-H-I-G-I.  I can identify that person.
Q.	Can you give us a rough estimate of how many attackers you might have seen on this day on Kanyinya hill?
A.	No, I would be lying if I were to try to give you the number of assailants.  They occupied the entire hill, and the refugees told us to try to escape from them, try to mix up with them, that way they won't know who is a refugee and who is not.  And to know -- I knew that this person was killed by Mika because Mika shot at him.  The person did not die immediately, and he asked him to come closer so that he should kill him.
Q.	Madam Witness, how were you able to recognise Mika during this attack, amongst all these attackers that came in buses?
A.	We could identify Mika because he was wearing red clothes and he was also wearing banana leaves. 
The other assailants were wearing white clothes, but their leader was wearing red clothes.  Some assailants were wearing coffee leaves.  We could identify the various groups of assailants.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could this be a good time for a short break?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'm almost through with my direct, so maybe I have another five minutes of direct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, continue, please.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam, what time of day did this attack occur?  Was it in the morning, the afternoon or the evening?
A.	It was at about 11 a.m.
Q.	And you survived the attack, obviously, didn't you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And would I be correct in saying that you survived the attack by fleeing the area, would that be correct, or hiding?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Then, at what stage, then, Madam Witness, were you able to identify Mika as being part of the attackers, before you fled, whilst you were fleeing or afterwards?
A.	Are you referring to the time when I went to seek refuge in Bisesero?  I recognised him while I was in Bisesero.
Q.	I'm talking about the attack that you've just described to Your Honours at Kanyinya, and I'm asking you at what stage you were able to recognise Mika Muhimana as being one of the attackers that attacked at Kanyinya hill?  Was that before you fled the area to seek refuge or afterwards to hide?  Can you help us?  How were you able to identify him?
A.	Mika caught up with us in Kanyinya.  I was one of those who was waiting for drugs and expecting drugs, and when we saw him we fled.
Q.	Madam Witness, would I be correct in saying that you testified in another ICTR case previously?
A.	That is correct.  You would be right if you said so.
Q.	What trial was that, Madam Witness?
A.	The Musema trial.
Q.	And do you recall how long ago that was, Madam Witness?
A.	I believe that was five years ago.
Q.	The events you described to the Court this afternoon, were they before or after the events that you described during your testimony in the Musema case?  Can you situate this event for us?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't follow your question.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The reason I ask, Your Honour, is because of the witness's failure to recount the date of this particular event --
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- particular event and I'm just asking her for clarification, whether or not this event that's she's testified about was before -- there are two separate events there's no doubt about that.  I'm just asking her to situate it in time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, I have a problem.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I withdraw the question.  It's more for your clarification.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Unfortunately, it is seeking not to clarify, because we are not yet aware of what was testified to in the Musema case, so as we can place a time difference.  It is better to put the events, then put the events in sequence.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's not of material importance for me to deal with that matter.  I just wanted it in terms of the sequence of events to situate this event and that event, because I am convinced they were two separate events but anyway the Judges don't want to address that. 

There's only one final matter, Madam President.  I want to put a photograph from Prosecution 
Exhibit 2 for the witness.  It may take some time and maybe we should do it when we return.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'll take a short break for 15 minutes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful.  
(Court recessed from 1637H to 1653H) 
   MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Proceedings in the Court are resumed.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, with your leave, I would like the witness to leave the witness box -- and that's why we've left the curtains drawn -- to come to this projector here.  I want her to look at a picture there and I'm going to ask her one or two questions to lay a foundation for it.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you hear me?  Now, first of all I've asked that a picture be placed on that projector.  As you look at that picture, can you tell me if you recognise what is in that picture?  Do you recognise the house?
A.	Yes, I recognise the house.
Q.	Can you tell me how you recognise the house, please?
A.	I see the house before me.  I see the picture.  May I go on? 
Q.	Yes.  Do you know whose house that is and, if so, can you tell us?
A.	The house belonged to Mika.
Q.	Now, looking at that picture, Madam Witness, I see some windows and some doors on that picture.  Can you mark an X with the pen that I've given you which door you saw the girls enter through and which door you saw them exit from on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	They came in -- they went in there, through that door, and it is through that same door that they came out.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, looking at the same picture, Madam Witness, are you able to show us -- first of all, does that picture indicate the area where you were standing when you saw the girls enter and exit that building?  Can you answer that?  Does it show where you were, approximately?  Can you, by looking at the picture, say?
A.	Yes, the photo shows the place where I was standing.  I was standing here in this grass in front of this house.
Q.	And when you refer to the grass bit, can you indicate by pointing or marking an X to the approximate area that you were located?  Just put an X like you did before.  Thank you.  

Now when, as you testified, the girls left the building naked, wree clubbed and one of them were clubbed, can you see the area of the building where the girls were attacked in that picture?  Is it in that picture or can you tell us, please, the spot where one of the girls was attacked?
A.	When they were beaten, they were in front of this door where I put the X.  I was standing here and they had just been taken out of the house.
Q.	Very well, and can you finally help me by putting an X around the location where you think you saw the girl -- one of the girls being flogged or even both of them?  Can you put an X there, please, in the area, so that we know?
A.	I was standing here, where I put the cross, the X, in the grass.
Q.	And where was it that you saw the girl being attacked when she came out?  Where was the girl?  Can you put an X there to show us that?
A.	They were standing here on the stoop at the door through which they had come out.
Q.	Very well.  Thank you, Madam Witness.  You can return to your seat now.  Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, this is being entered as Prosecution Exhibit 2.  We would seek to rely on the markings in the document.  Previously the way we've done it in the Tribunal is to enter the picture within Prosecution Exhibit 2 as a separate exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So it should be Exhibit P. 2.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It should be, well, we can call it P. 2A, so everything that comes out of this will be P. 2 something.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 2A is admitted as P. 2A.
(Exhibit No. P. 2A admitted) 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Can I ask the registry to enter that for me, please?  The first mark on it being the door as indicated by the witness where the girls came out from, and the second mark being the location where the witness herself was located when she saw the events, P. 2A.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And this is page K026819.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, I'm grateful.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Finally, Madam Witness, you've spoken about Mr. Muhimana, Mr. Mika, at length this afternoon.  Do you think that if I asked you to try and find him in this room, do you think you would be able to do that?
A.	I know Mika well.  He was my neighbour.  I see him on that side.  He is wearing a black cap and he is fair-skinned.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I was about to seek your leave, Your Honour, but I think the witness has beaten me to it.  There isn't much dispute as how many people are wearing caps in this courtroom.  And if the record reflects the witness is pointing towards the Defence counsel's bench, and Mr. Muhimana is indeed wearing a black cap.  

I would like the record to reflect that she has identified him with little difficulty.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness has identified the Accused.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Finally, Madam Witness, when I asked you earlier, I asked you earlier what the names of the two girls were.  I asked you to give me their first names.  But do you recall what their last names were, the family names of these two girls, the two girls that were taken from their parents' house to Mika's house?
A.	One of them is called Mukakyilro M-U -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What are their names?
THE WITNESS:
One is called Mukakayilro and the other is called Kamukina, M-U-K-A-K-A-Y-I-L-R-O.  Kamukina is 
K-A-M-U-K-I-N-A.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The reason -- let us have the first names, both names of the two girls.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you give us the full name of the two girls?
THE WITNESS:
One is called Emaculate Kamukina.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the other (Interpreter's microphone on)
THE WITNESS:
And the other is called Languide Mukakayilro.  Languide Mukakayilro.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know anyone by the name Koretay (phonetic)?
A.	Koretay.  Are you referring to Gorety (phonetic)?  Gorety  is one of (...........)
Q.	I see. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have no further questions.  I have no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Madam Witness, you will now be asked questions by the Defence counsel on your left side.  Please answer the questions very briefly and precisely. 

Mr. Songa, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

We have the three witness statements as well as the statements of today and it is on the basis of these four statements that we will cross-examine the witness.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	When you learnt of the president's death on the morning of the 7th of April 1994 you stated that you were shocked; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I was shocked.
Q.	Why were you shocked?
A.	I was shocked because our president was dead, and we were expecting a difficult situation because people had been talking about it awhile before, beforehand.
Q.	People had been talking about it well beforehand?  What were they saying?
A.	People were saying that after the president's death there would be war.
Q.	 "People", can you be more specific?
A.	It was members of the population.
Q.	You stated that when you learnt of the president's death your husband went to work in Gisovu; is that correct?
A.	Yes, as a matter of fact he was in Gisovu in an area called (..........)
Q.	Witness, when did you (sic) have to return from that place?
A.	Return from his place of work?  In principle he went there on a Sunday and returned on Friday.
Q.	Witness, we are going to talk about the day of the 7th of April.  In your statement, given a while ago, after you learnt of the president's death, Mika allegedly telephoned the police to ask them to arrest you and detain you.  Could you please specify the circumstances under which that phone call was made?
A.	He phoned, simply.
Q.	What was the distance between you and Mika when he made that phone call?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We fear we have not heard her saying that there was a telephone call made by the Accused to the police.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On the other hand, we heard that Mika told the police to arrest her, but, no, I don't think it is correct that someone is now saying that, telling it was on the telephone and there's my -- the question is not accurate.
MR. SONGA:
This can be ascertained.  I was taking notes and I noted that he made a phone call.
THE WITNESS:
Indeed he made a phone call, and a communal police officer asked me to go to the communal office because I was being sought after.  And when I got to the communal police office, I was arrested and detained.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	So the witness hereby confirms that a phone call was made.  So I can put the question to her again.  What were the circumstances when that phone call was made and what was the distance between you and Mika when he made that phone call?
A.	It was a communal policeman who told me that Mika had just phoned and that he had asked that communal police officer to arrest me and to detain me.
Q.	So if we understand what you are saying properly, madam, you did not witness that phone call?
A.	When he phoned he was in his house, and I was in my own house.  He phoned, and the communal police officers came and told me that "The conseiller had called us and asked us to detain you because you made your cattle to flee."
Q.	I thank you. Still on the 7th of April, you decided to take your cattle to Bisesero; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	How many cattle, please, how many heads of cattle?
A.	Five heads of cattle and three cows.
Q.	Did you take the cattle alone?
A.	No, the cows were taken by the shepherd.
Q.	Were you together or only that particular shepherd accompanied the cattle?
A.	It was the shepherd who took them alone, because he knew the area very well and he often took the cattle to that area for pasture.  So he knew that area very well.
Q.	So if I've understood you correctly -- I'll have to correct my notes -- you did not take the cattle there yourself, but it was the shepherd who took the cattle to Bisesero?
A.	Yes, it was the shepherd who took the cattle.
Q.	I thank you. In the statement of the 13th of January 1999 you state that, much to your surprise, at about midday conseiller Mika came to arrest you on orders of Bourgmestre Charles Sikubwabo for reasons that were not given to you; is that correct?
A.	The reasons for my arrest were not given to me, and when I was released no reasons were given to me either.  I was arrested and released subsequently.  All they told me was that I was being arrested or had been arrested because I had taken cattle elsewhere, and they said this to me when I was coming out of the prison cell.
Q.	In this regard, Witness, the Defence would like to know what happened better.  Was it Mika who arrested you, as you have just stated when you were answering the Prosecutor's questions, or was it Bourgmestre Charles Sikubwabo?
A.	I stated that I was arrested on Mika's orders, who was also acting on instructions from Bourgmestre Sikubwabo, because I had taken my cattle to Bisesero.  Mika did nothing without having received orders from Sikubwabo and they were always together.
Q.	So we take it that it was the bourgmestre who gave the orders and Mika executed them; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct, because he was his subordinate.  He was his assistant.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please clarify that you were arrested by Mika himself -- by the communal police?
THE WITNESS:
I was arrested by the communal policemen on Mika's orders, and they informed me that they had received orders from Mika, the conseiller.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When you were arrested, was Mika present?
THE WITNESS:
He was in his house, but subsequently he came to see me when I was being released.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
See me where -- see you where?
THE WITNESS:
He came to take me out of jail, and on that occasion he was with the persons I mentioned, who were killed on the spot, and that was when I was released.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what about Sikubwabo, was he there, also?

THE WITNESS:
No, Sikubwabo was not there.  I believe he was in his house.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did anybody tell you it was Sikubwabo who had given the orders? 
THE WITNESS:
He told me that he was the one who had given orders to those police officers because I had taken my cattle to Bisesero, and that for that reason I was a course of insecurity.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And who was it giving that order, Mika or Sikubwabo?
THE WITNESS:
The orders to be detained?  The person who gave the orders was the bourgmestre.  I believe Mika could not have done it without having received instructions from the bourgmestre.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you leave before the killing of the two men or after the killing of the two men?
THE WITNESS:
I left when they had just been released and after they were killed in front of the communal office, while they were being killed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, please proceed.
THE WITNESS:
They were killed in front of the communal office, and subsequently I went home because the distance is a short one.  After their death I told the children, "Get ready, we have to flee.  Those people have been killed for no apparent reason."
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, if I were to sum up what you've said, we could say that the orders were given by bourgmestre Sikubwabo and not by Mika, this is the first point; is that correct?  Do you agree with me on that matter?
A.	Those two persons were collaborators, because they were always acting in one accord.
Q.	But we can take it that one of them gave orders to the other, even if this was done in collaboration with one another?
A.	They always acted in concert because all the crimes that were committed in that area were orchestrated by Mika and Sikubwabo.
Q.	What is of interest to us, Madam Witness, is to know what happened.  We are talking about the orders that were given for your arrest. 

I think we can agree that the bourgmestre was Mika's superior and we can imagine that it was his superior who gave the order to the other, unless you have more specific information in that regard. 
A.	No, I have nothing else to add, because all what happened in our region happened under Mika's and Sikubwabo's supervision.  Either both of them were there or one of them was there, on the spot.
Q.	The second aspect I would like us to retain, following your explanation, is that you observed that Mika was not there on the spot at the time of your arrest; is that correct?
A.	Mika phoned the communal officer, who arrested me and detained me.  I cannot deny that.  And when I was released he also came and asked them to release me and he asked me to go back home.  I asked why I had been detained, and I was told that it was because I had allowed my cattle to be taken out of the region.
Q.	The statement of the 13th of January 1999 gives us information that is contrary to what you are saying; notably that the reasons weren't given to you.  Can you enlighten the Defence in this area by telling us which version is closest to the reality?  After your arrest, were orders given or not at all?
A.	Counsel, I told you that I was arrested and detained and I spent the day in detention.  I was released at about 5 p.m., and after my release I was informed I had been arrested because I had allowed my cattle to leave, but no reasons were given for my arrest.
Q.	Let us move on, Witness. When you make mention of orders given by the bourgmestre, for instance, how did you get to know that those were his orders?  How did you get to know that the bourgmestre gave orders?
A.	I believe I have explained to you that the police officers informed me that it was Mika who had made the phone call instructing them to arrest me for having moved the cattle away.
Q.	The policeman who arrested you, did they have any documents in their possession?
A.	No.  What kind of documents?  They did not give me any documents.  All they did was to arrest me as if I were a thief and thrown in jail.
Q.	Thank you. How many police officers came to arrest you?
A.	I was arrested only by one police officer whose name was Ruhindura.  Ruhindura is spelled as follows: R-U-H-I-N-D-U-R-A.
Q.	Madam, you state that he took you to the communal jail and detained you there.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Who received you at the entrance to the prison?
A.	I was received by a police officer by the name Charles.
Q.	Madam, were you asked to fulfill any particular formalities before going to the prison?
A.	There were no formalities at the time.  Tutsi was were arrested.  I was in prison.  We had no rights.
Q.	At the entrance to the prison did you not give your name to anyone, to any official?
A.	Nothing of the sort.
Q.	What time was it when you crossed the threshold of the prison, madam?
A.	It was between 9:30 a.m. and 10 a.m.
Q.	Perhaps I could refresh your memory, madam, by pointing out that in your statement, in your statement of the 13th of January 1999, you state that, much to your surprise, at about midday the conseiller of your secteur, Mika Muhimana, came and arrested you.  You are arrested, therefore, at midday.  How can you, therefore, tell us that you entered the prison at about 9, 10 a.m.?
A.	When that question was put to me -- I lost my mind.  I did not know that I would one day see Mikal.  I knew he wasn't resident in Rwanda.  I was speaking in passing to someone who was accused -- about someone who was accused.  We did not know the time when we were imprisoned.  When we were released we were very afraid, but the essential fact is that I mentioned that I was in prison and that is a fact.
Q.	Thank you, madam. 

While in prison, were you detained in a private cell?
A. Yes, I was locked up in a cell. 
     (Pages 27 to 44 by R. Lear)


























	1730H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	My question to you is whether you were locked up alone or with others; were they private cells?
A.	A prison -- as a matter of fact, it is only a jail, and that is where I was locked up, and I came out at about 2 p.m. as I stated earlier.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, is this prison in the vicinity of the communal office or is it at a separate place?
THE WITNESS:
That prison is situated very close to the communal office.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it a police cell or is it a separate institution? 
THE WITNESS:
It is a cell in which policemen detain people.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Okay. Continue. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In that jail, Witness, are men separated from women?
A.	Today that is the case, but at that time during the war -- I mean, at the beginning of the war, men were not separated from women.  As a matter of fact, I must add that during that period, it was only the Tutsis who were detained in the prison.
Q.	I'll now put another question to you, madam, still regarding that date of the 7th of April.  When you were returning, you met Nkundiye, the agronomist, and Murindiahabi.  Up till now, what we've heard is not very clear regarding the place of the meeting or the time when you parted company.  Let us start with the beginning by asking you to talk about the meeting.  Do you remember that?
A.	I remember those two people; they were agronomists.
Q.	Can you please describe the place where that meeting was held?
A.	When Mika came to order that I be released, I saw him outside with handcuffs and they were beating them. 
Q.	If you allow me, madam, I will read a passage from your statement, your statement of the 13th of January 1999:   "I was taken to the communal jail and locked up.  That is where I met two Tutsi men, Nkundiye, an agronomist, and Murindiahabi." 

If we understand your statement clearly, it was in prison that you met those two persons; is that correct?
A.	No; it is when I was getting out of the cell, when I was going to my house, that I saw them.
Q.	You also state in the same statement that it is in your presence, at about two in the afternoon, that the two men were killed.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, I saw how these two men were killed.
Q.	Can we be a little bit more precise as to the time?  In your statement today, you say that you were freed at 2 p.m. and you went home.  Before you came back to the prison to witness the death of these two persons, was it still 2 p.m.?
A.	I went out, and I saw Nkundiye receive a blow from a club and I saw how Murindiahabi was hit in front of the communal office.  

When I reached my house, I told my children, "Let us flee because I think the war has really begun.  Murindiahabi and Nkundiye have just died, and you see that we live close to the communal office."  That is what I said.
Q.	Madam Witness, I think that we have to be able to define a version of what happened.  In what we heard today -- we have heard today, you stated that when you were freed, you saw them being beaten; you went home, and you came back to the prison.  It is at that time, based on your statement today, that you witnessed their murder.
A.	Why would I have come back to the prison?  I had just been freed.  The truth is that I saw them when I was getting out of the jail.  I did not come back to the prison.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE WITNESS:
You have just been imprisoned and then you are freed, and then you come back to prison? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
From where did you get this statement, the statement that you just read out to the witness?
MR. SONGA: 
Madam President, I took notes, Your Honour.  May -- did I take them wrongly?  I cannot tell.  But I am afraid that the transcript will show that she did indicate that she returned to the prison.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We heard her saying that when she came out of the prison she saw two persons --
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We heard her saying that when she came out of prison, she heard two persons arrested by the Accused; they were in the company of the Accused. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I might say that it is not very important, considering that the transcript will always clear up the matter.  We may move forward, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, we shall continue.  

We are still on the day of the 7th of April.  The men that you saw first arrested, were you able to talk with them?
A.	No, I did not go near them.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that at about 2:30 on the 7th of April, Mika and a policeman, Ruhindura, cut the two men up with machetes; is that true?
A.	Mika was accompanied by several Interahamwe.  They were cut up with machetes, and they were hit with little hoes.
Q.	I am sorry, Madam Witness, I am referring to the witness (sic) of 13th January -- to the statement of 13th January 1999.  You said this: "Conseiller Mika and a policeman called Ruhindura, who is now dead, in my presence killed at about 2:30 in the afternoon, the two men."  That is your statement.  But on this day, we are asking you -- we asked you who killed them --  these are my notes, I hope they are accurate: "It is Mika and Sikubwabo who, accompanied by Interahamwe ..."  I would like to understand why these two versions, and which of the versions is correct.
A.	I said in the declaration -- did I say in the declaration of 13th January 1999 that it was Ruhindura who killed them? 
Q.	Indeed, Madam Witness, if you consult your statement, the second paragraph --
A.	So, there will be a mistake.  I said it was Ruhindura who took me out of prison.  It is he who opened the door for me, the door of the jail. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, Counsel, the English translation goes like this: " The two men were killed about 2 p.m. that day in the presence -- in my presence by Conseiller Mika and the policeman named Ruhindura, who is now deceased." That is the English version.  That version doesn't say that it is Ruhindura who killed them; it says it is Mika in the presence of Ruhindura. 
MR. SONGA: 
I don't know which version will be adopted, but I am going to read the French version literally: "The Conseiller Mika and policeman called Ruhindura, in my presence, killed at about 2:30 in the afternoon."  It is the witness's place now to tell us which of these versions is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry, are you translating the French version again, because it says the same thing as the English version?

Professor, did you get me?
MR. SONGA: 
I followed you, and I can repeat, "Conseiller Mika and -- Conseiller Mika and a policeman called Ruhindura" -- in text we have Ruhindu, but we have found it is Ruhindura -- "now dead, in my presence, killed at about 2:00 in the afternoon, the two men; they were cut with machetes."  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So in that statement, it is the two persons who did it.  So it is merely a question of asking the witness which of the two persons did it, assuming of course, they didn't kill one each, which is possible. 
THE WITNESS:
May I explain?  I said -- unless there was a mistake in the translation, I said that Ruhindura got me out of prison.  When I found -- when I went out, I saw Mika, Ruhindura and many other Interahamwe killing these people, and I went away immediately.  I did not go back to the communal office.  You understand that I was afraid.  I would not come back because I was targeted.  I had already been warned that I should not leave my home. You understand that what you are saying does not reflect what I had said.  Ruhindura only freed me, that is all. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, there seems to be a mistake because in your last statement you associated Mika and Ruhindura.  I don't know if I am the only one who noticed this. 
A.	Indeed, it is true; they were together.  When I was freed, Mika was present and Ruhindura was also present. It is Ruhindura who had the keys to the cell.
Q.	May we move forward, Madam Witness?  

We shall suppose that the two men were killed by Mika and Sikubwabo (sic); is that right?
A.	Yes, and Interahamwe.
Q.	Since you were there, which of the persons hit the two victims?  How did it happen?
A.	Mika raised the club, and he said, "This is how you kill a Tutsi", and he hit him on the head.  I didn't stop to watch the rest of the scenes, but it is he who started the massacre.
Q.	Did you say club?
A.	Yes; he hit him with a club, and I ran away immediately.  I went home.  I don't know who did what after that.
Q.	But the statement indicates that he was cut into pieces with machetes and thus was killed.
A.	It is the other ones who had machetes, the other persons who were present.  They were all armed with machetes at that time.
Q.	But you were no longer there when the machetes were used?
A.	No, I had already gone.  I was in my home.  It is those who buried them the next day who explained that the bodies were bearing signs of machete blows.
Q.	So, you did not see the machetes cutting up these two people?
A.	What I saw was the club -- the blow from the club; I did not see the rest.
Q.	I thank you.  

What was the situation at the prison?  Were there other people when you arrived at the prison?
A.	There was nobody else.
Q.	When you arrived at the prison, were there any authorities or prison administrators at the prison?
A.	There were only the policemen.
Q.	Did you say one policeman?
A.	Ruhindura, the policeman, was present, and Charles was also present.  It was he who opened the door of the cell.
Q.	We are still referring to the statement of 13th January, and it has, according to -- following the instructions of the bourgmestre that you were released; is that correct?
A.	Ruhindura came.  He said to me, "Sikubwabo has just ordered Mika to ensure your release". 
Q.	You say that you were released that evening.  What time was it then?
A.	I said 2 p.m.
Q.	In Kinyarwanda or in Rwanda, can you call 2 p.m. evening?  Can you say that 2 p.m. is the evening?
A.	Yes, it's possible, because in my home it is -- at two o'clock, we have only two more hours till nightfall.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  

You state that you were released that afternoon because your husband had not been found; is that correct?
A.	It's possible.  I noted that I had been released, that's all.
Q.	I'll repeat the question.  You say that you were released because your husband had not been found.  It is because your husband had not been found that you were released; is that so?
A.	I was just released; I don't know why.
Q.	Should we conclude that this is a poorly drafted statement, once more?
A.	Did I say that I was arrested because my husband was a -- absent?  Did I say that?
Q.	It is not your place to ask me questions. 

On the 7th of April, in the evening, you returned to your home.  You took your (.......) children and you fled in the direction of the thickest wood in the secteur; is that correct?
A.	I explained to you that I fled when I came back from Mika's.  I explained that Mika was a friend of the family.  I explained how he had come to us in the evening.  I thought it was for love or friendship that he came.  I followed him when he took away my sisters-in-law.  When I ran away, I was coming back from Mika's house. 
Q.	We shall have the opportunity, Madam Witness, to ask questions about another statement, especially that in which you talk about your children who were abducted by Mika.  For the time being, we are still focusing on the statement of 13th of January wherein I note that you accepted that this was your statement, and so I may question you thereon.  I don't know where -- whether there is any reason to cease to believe that this is your statement. 
What answer do you have to the question that when you got back to the house, you took your (........) children and you ran away to the thickest woods in the secteur?
A.	I fled with my (.........) children.  I explained that when I arrived below Mika's house, Sikubwabo followed us.  He shot at us and by that means killed (.......) of my children, that of my daughters.  That is what I said.
Q.	You arrived at the house that evening at 7 p.m.; is that right?  
A.	You mean my place in Bisesero? 
Q.	When you arrived at your house, when you meet the children, what time was it?
A.	I arrived at my home at 2 p.m.  We stayed there.  We ate, and then we stayed for a while in the house.  While waiting to learn whether one authority or another might be killed or to find out whether we the members of the population were not targets.
Q.	Thank you.   

You did, indeed, refer to the thickest woods of the secteur in which you hoped to find refuge; is that correct?
A.	I went through this wood with two of my children, and it is these two children who were with me when I arrived at Bisesero.
Q.	Let's go back to the house first.  You arrive at the house, you find your children; what was the atmosphere in the house when you got there?
A.	We had realised that there was a climate of war that was pervading the town.
Q.	Did you cook for the children, as you said today, or as you said before, did you quickly take the children away and escape to the Bisesero?
A.	No, I did not take them immediately.  We waited till evening.
Q.	Madam Witness, why did you change your mind about going to this wood and go to Bisesero instead?
A.	The war had just started.  Assailants were attacking people, were killing them with machetes and were burning houses.
Q.	On what hill of Bisesero did you take refuge?
A.	I was on Muhira hill, M-U-H-I-R-A.
Q.	I believe that in another place you referred to Rwirambo.  Are Rwirambo and Muhira the same hill?  Can you explain that?
A.	These are two opposing hills.  We first stopped at Rwirambo, and in due course we took refuge in Muhira wood when the assailants threatened us.
Q.	On the 8th, when you say that you were in Bisesero, were you in Muhira or Rwirambo?
A.	On the 8th, we climbed; we stopped at Rwirambo.  When the assailants approached us, the Interahamwe, we sought refuge in Muhira, and it is on Muhira that we stayed for a long time, about a month.
Q.	I am looking for a document, madam, which will give us more details on Rwirambo.
In a document that is a transcript of your statement during the Muhima (sic) case --  I think Madam President will authorise me to quote from the document?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is your reference; which document?
MR. SONGA:
I am referring to a transcript of the Muhima case, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we have it? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, let's just get it clear.  You want to refer to the transcript of the case she has previously testified in; is that correct?
MR. SONGA: 
That is exact, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And do you want it put -- to enter that document? 
MR. SONGA: 
That is correct, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And do we have copies?
MR. SONGA: 
Of course.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have extra copies for us? 
MR. SONGA: 
We are going to count them.  I am sure that there will be a copy for the Judges. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This transcript is in French.  We don't speak French.
MR. SONGA: 
Madam President, this is the problem that I face every day.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you are returning the courtesy. 
MR. SONGA: 
There is no vengeance in this Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, do we have it in English?
MR. SONGA: 
No, unfortunately, we don't have it, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We believe the English transcript has been provided by the Prosecution. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We actually disclose in both languages, ma'am.  The obligation is upon him to actually furnish it, because we gave him both languages, the English and French. 
MR. SONGA:
Documents are disclosed to me in both languages, Madam President.  But I brought a document in the language I understand.  I didn't think of the difficulty that would arise if the document were presented in French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 You should have brought the document in the language which we speak.  So we are having difficulty. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am sure, professor, you have some interest in our understanding the case, and you would want us to do that by providing a document in the language which we could easily understand.  It helps your case.  So although, as you say, you suffer this prejudice every time yourself, if you really want to advance your case and make it understandable to us, you should make the effort to provide a document in a language which we also can understand, hopefully, so that we can follow you. 
MR. SONGA: 
I was convinced, Madam President, Your Honours, that all the Judges spoke the two working languages of the Tribunal. I crave your indulgence.  I don't know how we can make amends for this. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
For this particular one, we will authorise it being translated through the booth, but in the future, when you want to produce a document, do what you can to ensure that we have a copy in English.  The three Judges who are listening to this case, unfortunately, are not conversant in the French language.  I'm the best one, and all I know is bonjour.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you for your indulgence.  In future, we will do our best, hoping that I will not mix up passages, since I don't understand English, I would have difficulty identifying the appropriate text. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So this document can be given to the interpreter for the purpose of interpretation.
MR. SONGA: 
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We already have it, Your Honour.

The Kinyarwanda interpreters would need a copy, Madam President.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, proceed.
 MR. SONGA:
The reason why I thought of this document is that on page 67 of the transcript the witness says absolutely something contrary to what she is saying.  She says that Rwirambo was only -- a question was asked:  

"When you left your place of residence, you say you went to Bisesero to seek refuge there.  Can you tell us exactly where you got to?

"Answer:   We sought refuge in an area called Rwirambo, below an area called Mutiti. 

"Question:   Did you get to that place on the same day, the day you left your place of residence fleeing from the bourgmestre?  

"Answer:   Yes, we arrived on the same day.  

"Question:   And in Wirambo, for how long did you stay there?  

"Answer:   We spent about three months there by and large, but the children, the two children who were with me, stayed there for a month only.  

"Question:   And in that area where you arrived, is that the area which is close to Muhira hill?  

"Answer:   Yes.  That is very close to Muhira hill. "

Witness, could you therefore clarify this matter by telling us clearly where you sought refuge in Bisesero?
THE WITNESS:
As you have just said, we sought refuge in Rwirambo while there were still people -- still houses inhabited by people.  Otherwise, as regards Rwirambo, there was a forest where we used to hide, and we were flushed out of that forest, and I was frightened of being killed.  Otherwise, we hid in houses that were half-destroyed.  That's why I sought refuge in Rwirambo.  That is all. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	We shall leave all these contradictions behind and move on. 
MR. SONGA:
I now turn to Madam President to ask whether the indulgence I enjoyed a while ago with regard to the Musema case can be extended to all transcripts relating to the Musema trial, since I prepared my case on the basis of those transcripts, in French. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 Since we don't have the copies and you have not provided one to us, I think there will be difficulty in referring to those statements -- to the transcript in the Musema case. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you have much to refer to in the Musema case?
MR. SONGA: 
(No interpretation)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you have much to refer to in the Musema case transcript? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honours.  It is probably two short passages only.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Those two passages are in this transcript? 
MR. SONGA: 
No, they are, Madam President, in two separate documents which are part of the same transcript, which we are also in the position to distribute to the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And they are in French, no doubt.
MR. SONGA: 
They are in French, but very short passages.  They have to do with names of places and the age of children.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the time being, the interpreter can translate it to us, but subsequently, you should provide the English transcript of those relevant portions.
MR. SONGA:
I promise to do that, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please give copies of those transcripts for the interpreters. 

Professor Songa, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President, for your understanding.

I will now turn to the witness.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In the document we have before us, you granted an interview to Radio Rwanda, and in that interview you did not make reference to the killings that you witnessed at the prison, whereas you were asked to present your experiences and sufferings endured in the month of April.   On page 91 of the document, a question was put to you, and it is on the sixth line on page 91.  The question is as follows: "Did you not observe any killings, Witness, while you were in prison?"  Whereas you told this Chamber that you were present and witnessed those killings.  That is correct, isn't it?  We have heard you say -- and your answer was, "I said, and I have told them that two men died at the time."

"Question:   You mentioned two other names, other than the name you mentioned today, the names were Aloys Kanyinamura and Sanani Kamandwa."  

Let me explain the problem.  The problem is that in your statement, the statement that was disclosed to us by the Prosecution, you make mention of Nkundiye and Murindiahabi, who were killed before the prison, but in your interview with Radio Rwanda, you did not mention those names, instead you mentioned Aloys Kanyinamura and Sanani Kamandwa.  When you were asked why was that so, your answer was, "The names of the two people I gave the radio are the names of two people who died on the 7th, the day after the death of President Habyarimana.  "And the question we are putting to you is, whereas you were free to speak to Radio Rwanda, why did you not mention the two names mentioned in your testimony today, the two other names?  Do you have any explanation for this?
A.	This is my explanation.  The reason why I mentioned Aloys Kanyinamura and the person who killed him is because when Mika carried out those acts, we did not know that we were going to see him again.  That is why I mentioned Kanyinamura and the person who killed him.  And that person was arrested.  And when I made mention of the two other persons, it was because the person who had killed them had been arrested.
Q.	Are you saying that in that interview with Radio Rwanda, you did not mention anything other than the acts for which people had already been arrested?  What meaning should we give to this omission?
A.	This is the explanation I have for not having mentioned those facts.  We did not know that Mika was still alive.
Q.	Thank you.  If we go by the statement of 30th of August 1999, you did not discuss what you knew about Mika Muhimana the last two times you met the investigators of ICTR; is that correct?
A.	I have not quite understood your question. 
Q.	I will take it over again, madam.  We are now dealing with the statement of the 30th August 1999.  When you begin that statement this is what you say, "I did not discuss what I knew about Mika Muhimana.  On the last two occasions I met the investigators, I spoke of Musema.  I did not see the need for discussing what I knew about Muhimana because he was still at large.  I did not know that that was important for this Tribunal.  Neither were any questions put to me in this regard."  Those are passages from your statement, and I would like you to confirm them. 
A.	Yes, those were my statements.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  How then do you explain the fact that on the 13th of January 1999, in your statement of the 13th of January 1999, you make very serious accusations, such as your arrest of the 7th of April and your detention in the communal jail as well as the murders of Nkundiye and Murindiahabi?  Why did you talk about that on the 13th of January 1999, you mentioned them, and on the 30th of August, you talk about new things and you had no reason not to have mentioned them earlier?  Why did you talk about Mika on the 30th of August 1999?
A.	I spoke about Mika because we had been told that Mika had been arrested, and I told myself that, at last, I was going to meet him and talk about everything he did against us, and that is why I spoke of him.
Q.	Now, my question:  Why did you not -- why did you talk about him on the 19th of January 1999, whereas he had not been arrested, and you talked about him then?
A.	I wanted to inform the investigators and the judges that if he were arrested -- if ever he was arrested, I would already have testified against him.
Q.	Thank you.  

You know that several meetings were held before the war in the building where Gishyita prisoners are held.  According to your statement, four meetings were held in March; Muhimana, Ruzindana and Sikubwabo took part in those meetings.  You state that they were organised by all communal workers; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I used to live very close to that building and the conseiller was our neighbour.  By the way, the persons I mentioned who were killed, namely, the bourgmestre, the agronomist, there was an agronomist who passed for a Hutu, and he took part in those meetings.  Besides, there was a building in which they were detained for the first time.  We asked ourselves a question why Tutsis were not participating in those meetings and we kept wondering.
Q.	Witness, can you be more specific as to the dates when those meetings were held?
A.	Frankly, I do not recall the dates because that was long, long time ago.
Q.	Thank you.  Do you confirm that all workers were invited except for Tutsis?
A.	Yes.  All workers were invited, every Thursday and every Saturday.
Q.	Including or except for Tutsis?
A.	The meetings were for all workers in the commune, but excluding the Tutsi. 
Q.	You cited Ruzindana's name as one of the participants at these meetings.  Was he a communal worker?
A.	No, he was not a communal worker, but he was a conseiller, the adviser of Mika.
Q.	Were communal conseillers entitled to advisers of their own?
A.	At the beginning of the war, shortly before the war, communal conseillers had advisers.
Q.	Can you name those advisers?
A.	The question was whether they were paid.  I don't know whether they were paid, but what I noticed was that Ruzindana was often with Mika.
Q.	Now, maybe I should ask a clarification question or a question for purposes of clarification.  Is being with somebody frequently a reason to call a person an adviser?  Does that make the person an adviser? 
A.	What made us believe so was that Mika was always with Ruzindana whenever he was going about acting.
Q.	Where was Ruzindana residing? 
A.	Ruzindana was resident in Mugiranero (phonetic).
Q.	He never resided in Kigali, according to the information you received?
A.	No, I am not aware of that.  I only saw him when he was preparing for the war.  I don't know whether he was resident in Kigali or elsewhere.  I was not aware of that.
Q.	Did you know him?
A.	Yes, I knew him.  I knew Ruzindana.
Q.	Since when?
A.	I knew him since the period before the war, and during the war I used to see him.  I knew him.
Q.	Let me take the question again.  You said you knew him since the period prior to the war; is that correct?
A.	I knew him during meetings held in our secteur, and he was introduced to us as Ruzindana.  I also saw him again during the war and people would point at him saying, "That is Ruzindana from Mugerinero."  That is how I got to know him.
Q.	We take it then, that you knew him shortly before the war?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Thank you.  Where were you, Witness, when those meetings were being held?
A.	I was in my house.  I was at home.  My house was very close to the building in which those meetings were held.
Q.	Did you know for sure that those meetings were convened or you only knew about them when they had already taken place?
A.	When those meetings were held, I told you that Nkundiye participated in those meetings passing for a Hutu, but he was identified subsequently, and when he came back from those meetings he related to what was said at those meetings, and that created problems for us.  We had difficulties.  That was a very disturbing situation for us. 
Q.	Nkundiye participated in such meetings up to the time of the war, up to the 6th of April?
A.	Yes.  He was identified on the 5th of April, and he did no longer -- he no longer participated in those meetings.  He was accused of being a Tutsi from Rubengera.
Q.	What were your relations with Nkundiye?
A.	Nkundiye was our agronomist, and (.........) where he used to go for a drink in our house.
Q.	Is that all you can say with regard to your relations with him?
A.	No, there were no other relations between us, he was only our agronomist.
Q.	And how did he relate -- what happened at the meetings to you?  Did you (sic) visit you?  Did you (sic) give reports to you?
A.	He used to visit us, and he would speak with my husband because they were friends, and they would discuss the situation during the war.  

Mika used to train youngsters in the handling of weapons in a certain location in Mutiti.  Every Saturday he used to go and give information to the youngsters from morning to evening, and he would come home very late in the evening. 
Q.	Do you mean that Mika has received military training?
A.	He knew how to handle firearms.
Q.	Do you know a bit more about that?  Can you tell us how you came to know about this?
A.	I came to know about this because I saw them shooting at people in Bisesero.
Q.	It was when you saw him shooting at people in Bisesero that you realised or got know that he had been training youngsters earlier in Bisesero?
A.	No, we were aware of that fact.  We knew that he used to train Interahamwe in the handling of firearms in a certain location.
Q.	This is the thrust of my question.  How did you know about that?
A.	My husband used to pass through that area every evening when he returned on Saturday evenings.  He used to pass through that area and he saw the training going on.  He witnessed such training. 
Q.	We have three statements which you gave.  Is there any passage in those statements regarding Mika training youngsters?
A.	I don't believe I gave any statement to that effect.
Q.	Neither over radio Rwanda nor to the investigators of the Tribunal?
A.	Well, that was a long time ago.  That was five years ago, and I can't remember.
Q.	But today you do recall that he trained youngsters.  The day before the president's death they met once in Muhimana's house; they held a meeting there.  That was on the 7th of April, and according to your statement, Muhimana, Ruzindana and Sikubwabo were present at that meeting; the meeting was held in the afternoon.  Do you confirm that statement?
A.	Do you want me to confirm that meeting was held?  Yes, indeed, that meeting was held.
Q.	Apart from the three persons, who were the other participants at that meeting of the 7th of April?
A.	I had no opportunity to find out who were all the participants at that meeting.  I was aware of the participation of Mika, Sikubwabo and Ruzindana.  I did not know who the other participants were. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, how long would you take to finish your cross-examination?  If it is half an hour then we can go up to seven. 
MR. SONGA: 
When I look at my notes, Madam President, I fear that I will not be in a position to know exactly how much time I need, but we can always try to finish in an hour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So then we adjourn for the day and resume tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.  

The Court is adjourned.  

Witness we remind you that you are still under oath.  You are not to communicate your evidence to anyone outside the Court.  Thank you. 
(Court adjourned at 1838H)
