MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session now.  

The appearances for the Prosecution, Madam Madenga.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

And the Defence. 
MR. SONGA:

THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this is to remind you that you are still under the obligation to speak the truth.  

Professor, please go on. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  As you would recall, it was decided that when we get to questions that justify a closed session, we have to point it out before we proceed with examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how long will you be in closed session? 
MR. SONGA:
Less than 30 minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And that would end your examination-in-chief, right? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please arrange for the closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are now in open session, so be careful with your identity.  Thank you.  

Yes, Madam Madenga, please, go ahead. 
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I just want to thank you for your indulgence, and we will continue with the cross-examination. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am just looking on Defence Exhibit 82, and I am checking on your profession.  It's a very noble profession indeed.  Do you agree? 
A.	I was a ********
Q.	I know; that's why I said that's a very noble profession.  You used to work closely with the members of the community, is that not so?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Let me refer you to other personalities who were working with the community.  You mentioned one Emmanuel Murindahabi, spelled M-U-R-I-N-D-A-H-A-B-I, Murindahabi.  For how long had you known Emmanuel Murindahabi when the events of 1994 took place?
A.	I had known him well before then, because he lived in the border secteur.
Q.	Precisely.  What was his profession?  What was he doing in the community?
A.	At the time, he was an agric officer in Eliza Gakuta (phonetic) in Gisovu commune.
Q.	And also the person you refer to as Nkundiye, spelled N-K-U-N-D-I-Y-E, Jean Claude Nkundiye, what was the profession of that person?
A.	He was an agric officer in Gishyita commune.
Q.	For how long had you known Jean Claude when the events of 1994 took place?
A.	At the time he came to work in Gishyita, I had been transferred to Gisovu commune.  I had left there to go and work in Rwamatamu commune.  I believe he came to Gishyita between 1984 and 1985, unless I am wrong.  I don't know exactly when he arrived because I was working and I met him.  I knew he was one working in our commune.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I want now to take you to the events which followed the announcement of the death of the president.  Do you know what happened to Murindahabi and Nkundiye following the death of the president?
A.	I was working in my commune, Gishyita.  In 1994, on the 6th, when President Habyarimana died, Nkundiye was present.  That is what I know about those two men.  
On the 7th, Murindahabi was arrested by gendarmes in Gishyita.  Those gendarmes were with the brigadier and the judicial police officer of the commune.  I believe it was around midday or 2 p.m.  I did not have a watch.  Murindahabi went to Antoine Nzamurambaho's house.  He had a jerry can of petrol.  I was very close to that place on the market square.  I witnessed what I am relating to you personally.  He tied the jerry can on a motorbike.  The gendarmes called him.  He was coming from the commune office accompanied by brigadier.  They were opposite a shop.  They stopped him and asked him where he was taking the jerry can of petrol to.  What we heard is that he answered by saying that he was taking the jerry can to Antoine, at the Mugonero hospital.  They arrested him, took him to the communal prison.  It was the brigadier who took him to the communal prison.  That was the last time I saw Murindahabi.  

Regarding Jean Claude Nkundiye, he was not arrested on the same day, and I did not witness his arrest.  All I know is that he was arrested in my cellule of residence.  He was arrested in 
****************** house, who is still there.  Those -- I don't know those who went to arrest him.  I heard he was arrested and taken to the bourgmestre who, was standing very close to the bus stop opposite the school.  The bourgmestre was with the brigadier, and the bourgmestre asked the brigadier to take him to the communal jail.  It was on Friday, the 8th.  That is what we heard.  This is all I know concerning him. 
	(Pages 19 to 20 by S. Eboe-Osuji)



















	1045H
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for the clarification --
A.	This is all I know concerning him.
Q.	You referred to the judicial police officer.  Is that official the same person as an IPJ in your community?
A.	He was a person representing the prosecutor in the commune.  He used to be known as IPJ.  I don't know whether he still has the same name.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Let's focus on the people who arrested Murindahabi where you were a personal witness.  Besides the brigadier, was there another official you identified who arrested Murindahabi?
A.	The person -- the persons who were with the brigadier were the gendarmes who had come to the commune office during that period or at that time.  Another person who was with them was the communal judicial police officer.  Those are the people I saw.  They travelled together and they were going to the commune office.  There were three of them. 
Q.	What subsequently happened to them, do you know?
A.	To tell you the truth, those people were taken to the commune office according to information I received subsequently.  They testified to events they witnessed in Gisovu prison where we were.  A commune police, who was attending Gisovu, and that person explained on that Thursday that Murindahabi had been arrested and had been imprisoned in the communal gaol.  That police officer was going there from Kibuye, and in the evening he was informed that Jean Claude Nkundiye had been arrested and taken to the gaol by the bourgmestre as well as the gendarmes.  We were unable to find out what happened to them subsequently.
Q.	When Murindahabi was arrested by communal police and the brigadier, did you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	There were no police officers; it was only the brigadier, the brigadier accompanied by gendarmes.  As I stated to you I was present.  Mika Muhimana was at home.  He was at his house.  He witnessed what happened on that day.
JUDGE SHORT:
He who?
MS. MADENGA:
I did not get the last part of the witness's response. 
JUDGE SHORT:
The interpreter said he witnessed what happened that day.  And who is he referring to?
THE WITNESS:
You asked me whether I saw Mika during that period, and I answered by saying that I saw Mika in his house on the veranda.  When Murindahabi was arrested, Mika witnessed it personally just as we did.  Those men who arrested him immediately took him to the commune office.
JUDGE SHORT:
All right.  So Mika saw the arrest of Murindahabi and he was taken to the commune office -- just hold on a second.  Did Mika accompany them to the commune office? 
THE WITNESS:
No, he remained there. 
JUDGE SHORT:
He did not take --
THE WITNESS:
He remained indoors.  He did not go there.
JUDGE SHORT:
(Overlapping microphones)... on this matter.  It had nothing to do with him?  He did not take any interest whatsoever? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know what he was thinking.  I do not know what he was thinking.  We were close by.  We were eyewitnesses to those events, but subsequently we went about our own business.  I, therefore, did not try to find out what Mika was thinking.  I know nothing about that.  I know nothing about that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, what is the date of this arrest?  I'm sorry, but I seemed to have lost it. 
THE WITNESS:
That person was arrested the day after President Habyarimana's death; that was on the 7th of April.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What time?  What time? 
THE WITNESS:
If I were to make an estimate, that person was arrested between midday and 2 p.m.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that person when he was arrested, you, Mika, and who else was also a witness? 
THE WITNESS:
There were many people.  I am not in a position to say whether such-and-such a person was present.  That was a long time ago.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And these many people were from that centre or were they from far away? 
THE WITNESS:
We used to obtain supplies at the centre.  Even if anybody wanted to have a drink, he went to that centre.  If he wanted food, he went there to fetch food.  People came in different ways and for different reasons.  Some people came to buy food while others came to get a drink.  I don't know why each and every one went there.  Each and every one went there for his or her own reasons.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that is the day on which you had all been told to stay at home? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot lie to you.  I did not hear anything being said about that, but people had to stay indoors or very close to their houses.  You couldn't go very far from your house.  I can confirm this.  However, I did not hear any communiqué to that affect.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you: the centre was running as usual.  People were buying food and buying things from the centre on the 7th of April 1994.  Is that what is your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
It was business as usual at the centre.  I believe problems arose at that place.  The traders went about their duties as usual, buyers did the same.  If you remember correctly, I stated yesterday that disturbances started on the Friday, in the evening, at about 6 p.m.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, Counsel. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Witness, you indicated that Mika Muhimana saw the arrest of Murindahabi and he remained indoors.  Can you assist me with this?  Did Mika say anything or do anything when Murindahabi was being arrested?
A.	I know nothing about that.  I witnessed that person's arrest.  I went to buy what I had to buy and I returned home.  I don't know what happened thereafter. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I want you to assist me with this document.  It's --
MS. MADENGA:
I will ask the assistance of the registry to place before you a document in Kinyarwanda.  This is the original document in Kinyarwanda.  Three copies for Your Honours and another copy for the Defence.  It's contained in the confession bundle on page 11 to 12.  Can I just ascertain from registry whether you have placed before Your Honours the confession statement in English? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
They have been placed before Your Honours, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, I'm advised by Mr. Issa that he has not yet distributed the documents I am referring to.  At this stage, I just wanted to refer to page 11 of that document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, this English version is the translation of this document?

MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, that is -- the Kinyarwanda is an extract from the English translation on pages 11 to 12.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Right.  Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You mean the other way around, actually.  You mean the English version is an extract from the Kinyarwanda version.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour, that is correct.  

So maybe for ease of reference, I could just start by outlining all the documents and also put before Your Honours the complete original of the Kinyarwanda, which is the original document.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What do you want to do, Counsel, to get the witness to admit the original Kinyarwanda version document and then you introduce this translation?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	So, Witness, do you have before you in Kinyarwanda a police statement dated the 9th of April 2004 -- the 9th of April 2004.  That is the date of that statement.  I'm looking at the Kinyarwanda version.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, what did you say?  This is the 4th of September.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, if I can start with the English version of the statement, a police statement reported on the 15th of September 2000.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This date written on the top of the English version, "9/4/2004". 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, if for the time being we can disregard this so we refer the witness with the Kinyarwanda version, which starts with the 15th of September 2000, for ease of reference. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you say 4th September?
MS. MADENGA:
The 15th, Your Honour, one-five of September 2000. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Two thousand, not 2004.

MS. MADENGA:
Two thousand, Your Honour.  And I'm looking at the original Kinyarwanda version, the very first page.  Then if we go to the English translation, it's on page 11.  There are no K-numbers to the document, but its reference is WSO4/454E.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	So, Witness, are we there on the document of the 15th of September 2000?  Are you looking at that document?
A.	Yes, I see the date of 15th September, but I don't see the year.
Q.	Okay.  Let's proceed and also look at other aspects to establish whether you know the document.  Do you recognise your signature on the second page of that document of 15 September?
A.	Yes, it is my signature.  Thank you.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I just want you to confirm whether you gave a statement on the 15th of September 2000 in Kinyarwanda.  Did you give this statement?
A.	The last time that I met the deputy prosecutor, that was on the 13th of June 1995.  I was in Gitarama.  Regarding other facts, I had to fill certain forms, and when I met the deputy prosecutor for Kibuye, within the confession procedure, I think I wasn't interviewed by the prosecutor regarding the other questions.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've just confirmed that this is your signature.  What I want you to confirm now is the content of the document.  So I'm going to ask you questions from this document which you --
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, have you read the document?  Have you read the document which you say you signed? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have read it.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you have --
THE WITNESS:
Can you give me a few minutes so that I can finish reading page 2 of the document?  

I am through.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, I am going to read part of your interview.  
MS. MADENGA:
If we can start on the very first page, the equivalent page, Your Honours, will be page 11. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Let him confirm that this was his interview because he seems to -- not to recollect that he had an interview on the date mentioned. 

Witness, you've read the document, you have read the questions and the answers.  Do you recollect having this interview having read the document? 
THE WITNESS:
Those questions were put to me.  However, I do not agree with one aspect.  These questions are found on the documents that were filled in Gitarama in 1995, but it would appear the date on this document is the 15th of September, but there's no year that is mentioned thereon.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Overlapping microphones)... Mr. Witness.  The year is 2000, the 15th of September.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'll just read out to you the second question which was asked to you during the course of the interview, and I'll also read out to you the response.  You were asked a question relating to charges and the question was: "What were the charges?"  Your response to that question was, "I was charged with the murder of two agricultural officers: one called ************************ who worked at the ************************************************** and the other one was called ************************, and he works in the Gishyita commune.  The other person is ********************************* is spelt, 
**********************************************************************************.  "My mother-in-law."  Do you confirm the question and the answer?
A.	That is correct, I was asked that question and I answered as it is written.
Q.	Let's go to the English translation which is page 12.  That is the second question after the question I've just read out to you.  Another question was put to you.  When you said you denied the charges and the question was, "On what basis do you deny them give (sic) the evidence of eyewitnesses?"
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Given.
MS. MADENGA:
Given the -- thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	"Given the evidence of eyewitnesses?  Who killed those people?"  You answered, "Emmanuel Murindahabi was arrested the day after President Habyarimana's death.  He was coming from Mugonero hospital.  He had a jerry can of petrol tied on his motorcycle.  Two gendarmes called him.  The commune police had a police officer, and Conseiller Mika asked him where he was taking the petrol.  He said the petrol belonged to Antoine Nzamurambaho", spelt N-Z-A-M-U-R-A-M-B-A-H-O, "and he was taking it to him at Mugonero.  They made him sit down and burnt him against the house.  Later they handed him to the commune police head who took him with a motorcycle and the petrol jerry can.  He was detained in the commune prison cells" - "commune prison cell.  Jean Claude Nkundiye was arrested the following day, on the 8th of April 1994, at the home of ************************ where he was hiding.  The bourgmestre Karoli Sikubwabo sent two men to bring him; namely, ***************************************************************************************************.  "These two took him to a commune prison cell."  

So this is the explanation you gave relating to the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the two men.  Do you understand?
A.	I have heard you well.
Q.	This explanation --
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, this is not a question if you have heard counsel.  Do you admit that this is the explanation you gave?  Not that you heard counsel.  Was this not the explanation you gave? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you a while ago that a person had a jerry can of fuel that was hung until his bicycle -- on to his  motorcycle.
JUDGE SHORT:
Don't repeat your testimony which you gave to the Court today.  You have been asked whether this is the statement you made.  The answer you give to the question is either yes or no.  Later on you can give an explanation if you want, but for the time being don't you admit that this is the answer you gave to this question? 
THE WITNESS:
As concerned that question, I did not mention Mika's name because I know that those who arrested that person were those whose names I gave you before.  I told you that Mika was at his house.  I don't know how he was included in that document.  He was not amongst those who arrested that other person.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you not sign this statement?
THE WITNESS:
I signed it, but during that period the situation was very bad for us.  Those of us who were under detention from 1994 to 1997, we were living under very adverse conditions and we were made to do just about anything. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, go ahead.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then why didn't you not implicate yourself if you were forced to make this statement? 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that I was in the vicinity, but sometimes you could be coerced into doing things they wanted you to do.  What I'm telling you is the truth.  During that period, when you were arrested, and that you didn't acknowledge having killed anybody, you even run the risk of being killed.  I'm telling you, and God knows this, you could say something and those who were listening to you would be writing whatever they were writing, and if you didn't sign you run the risk of having problems.  I signed that statement in 1995 and the situation was dangerous.  Besides, the person who was asking me questions was someone who was living in the area.  He saw me and called me.
JUDGE SHORT:
Earlier on, I asked you whether you had read the statement, and you said yes.  And I asked you whether the questions and the answers reflect the interview you gave, and you said yes. 
THE WITNESS:
I am telling you the truth.  I did not see -- that name did not feature in the document.  I have told you that those people who were with the commune brigadier with the inspector of judicial police -- and I told you that Mika was in the vicinity, but at his house, and it's as if he was sitting, for instance, where I am and you are, where you are, Your Honour.  It's only a road that separates the road where I was from where he was.  I don't know why his name was mentioned.  I know that Mika was not amongst those who arrested the other person.  He did not accompany the people who arrested that person. 
JUDGE SHORT:
All right.  So you accept everything else in the statement except the portion that mentions Mika's name; is that what you're saying? 
THE WITNESS:
In the document it is mentioned that Mika was amongst those who arrested that other person.  I didn't say that.
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm asking you, is that the only portion of the document that you object to? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do not acknowledge that portion of the document.  
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

Mr. Issa, can you place before the witness the second set of documents.  It's written Roman numeral three eight four, respectively, for his (unintelligible).  It is a single document.  It is a single letter with copies for Your Honours and the Defence. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, before you is a handwritten letter in Kinyarwanda.  That is the original in Kinyarwanda, dated the 11th of December 1994.  Can you confirm your signature on that letter?
A.	I am not the one who wrote that letter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm your signature at the bottom of the letter? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Forget about the contents of the document.  Just confirm your signature first and then we'll get to the document contents.
THE WITNESS:
That is not my signature.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	If that's not your signature, I'm just looking at the Exhibit D. 82 where you signed to confirm your identification and particulars.  I just want to give you a copy of D. 82 so that you can assist me in comparing the signature on what you have appended on Defence Exhibit D. 82 and the signature which appears on that letter which I have just given to you. 
A.	I can sign on a different sheet of paper and you compare the two signatures.  This isn't my signature.  It is a forgery.  And besides this is not my writing.  Let me sign on a different document.  Can you compare those two signatures?  There is no comparison.  I think there's a difference between the two.  It's not the same signature.  No, they can't be compared to one another. 
Q.	If it's not your signature, I'll just put the contents of this document so that I get your comment.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He does not accept the signature. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, I thought since I am not a handwriting expert, I will not agree with the witness, but then it will be a matter for determination by the Chamber.  What I wanted to do is to put the contents to the witness.  He said that someone forged his signature, so that he comments on the fraudulent document before him.
JUDGE SHORT:
Before you do that, Witness, on the 11th of December 1994, did you give a statement to the -- who was this statement given to?  Counsel, who was this statement made to?
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, it was a statement purportedly (unintelligible) by the witness.  It's Gishyita secteur on the 11th of December 1994. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes.  Witness, did you make a statement on that date, the 11th of December 1994 in Gishyita commune?  Yes or no. 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you at one time -- please listen to me -- I told you that you can write something and then what is written -- what you write is subsequently distorted.  I don't know how they do it.  This letter has nothing to do with what I wrote.  This is not my handwriting.  My signature has been imitated.  I did not write this document.  The answer is no.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You never made any statement on the 11th of December 1994; That is what you are saying? 

THE WITNESS:
I wrote to the prosecutor on several occasions.  I drafted a document after the 6th of December 1994 when I was in Gitarama.  I wrote a letter which requested that my file will be studied and that justice be done in my regard, but this is not the letter that has been presented to me here.  That is not my handwriting.
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, is this statement, the Kinyarwanda version, is it supposed to be in the -- the entire statement, is this supposed to be in the witness's handwriting, or was it written by somebody and signed by him?
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, the information we have is the letter was written and signed by the witness.  I have not ascertained from the witness whether he is the person who drafted the letter or whether he just appended his signature.  With your leave, Your Honour --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He has denied --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, on the 11th of December 1994, did you write any statement to the authorities? 
THE WITNESS:
I know that I wrote letters to the prosecutor.  I know that in November and December -- or in November or December, I wrote a letter when I was in Gitarama.  The document that I drafted is not the one that has been presented to me.  I don't know whether you have looked at this document closely.  I see words in English on this document.  I have never learnt English.  The signature that I see there is not mine.  You can compare the signatures that appear on my document.  So this is a person who has taken a sheet of paper, has drafted something, tailored to suit his needs, and has signed.  You may examine this signature and you will find that it has no relation to my signature that you see elsewhere.  This letter K that appears in my signature, and the other letters, are not things that I recognise.  If you look at this document closely you will see there is no link.  One person may imitate your signature, but there are always differences.  That is not even my handwriting.
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, the witness denies authorship of this document.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You can still put the contents to the witness.  The fact that he did not write it, you can still put those -- the facts stated there to the witness.
THE WITNESS:
Excuse me.  I would like to go and relieve myself, please.  I would like to go out.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Take him out for a while.
(Witness excused at 1137H)
(Witness ushered in at 1140H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Madenga.
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, what do you want to do with this document, first of all?  Let's know from you what you want to do with the document.  The witness has denied authorship of the document.  What's your position?
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, I agree with you but -- the witness denies the contents.  But the fact that he's denied the contents, in my humble opinion, does not bar me from putting to him the contents so that he comments, because what I'm trying to do is to present the prosecution case and to highlight what is relevant in our case.
JUDGE SHORT:
I mean, don't put questions as if you are relying on this document because he's rejected it.  So it will not be proper for you to put questions to him based on this document which he has rejected, but you may ask him questions as to whether he made a statement on this date in which he said matters are contained here, and see what his answer will be.  And then after, based on his answers, you will know what your next step will be.
MS. MADENGA:
Indebted, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you indicated that you wrote several letters to the prosecutor in Rwanda; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I said so.
Q.	Can you assist me with this one: were you the person who was drafting the letters or someone would write on your behalf and then the document is read out to you and then you append your signature?
A.	I know how to write.  I can write.  This is not my handwriting.
Q.	I will be referring to other documents, so I just want to ascertain from you whether all the letters you wrote to the prosecutor, you wrote them yourself in your own handwriting.
A.	To tell you the truth, at one point in time I was ill.  I asked someone to write a document for me, but this is not the document that I have before me.  And the person who wrote this document gave it to me to sign.  It is I, myself, who signed it.  All the signatures that appear on my documents are the same.  The document that I have here before me was not dictated by me and was not signed by me either.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what would you say about the previous document which was put to you, the document dated 15th September 2000?  Was that document written by you, or it was drafted by somebody else for you, and then you had signed it? 
THE WITNESS:
I signed this document, but I did not draft it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which document? 
JUDGE SHORT:
The previous document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The one dated 15th September 2000. 
THE WITNESS:
I am not the one who wrote the document.  Somebody wrote it for me and I signed it.
JUDGE SHORT:
(Overlapping microphones)... and lets see.  Okay, that one.  Okay. 
THE WITNESS:
The signature on this document is mine. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, the question counsel is asking you is: all the statements you gave to the Rwandan authorities, were all the letters, were they written for you and then you signed; is that the case?  That all --
THE WITNESS:
There are documents that I wrote myself and there are others that were written for me, but all the signatures are mine.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What are the occasions where you had written the documents yourself? 
THE WITNESS:
I think I wrote about nine letters.  I don't remember the dates on which I wrote these documents.  I no longer remember.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	I want to ask you, Mr. Witness, whether on the 11 of the 12th 1994, you provided a statement, and the contents of the statement I will read out, and then you give me a comment on that.  I am proceeding to read the statement which I am referring to.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are making a mistake, Counsel.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, I'm not referring --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What the Judge said is that you can put what is stated here.  Did the witness ever tell anybody what is (unintelligible) to anybody what is stated here.  You cannot read this statement because it has not been accepted into evidence.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I will put the contents, not the statement.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Didn't you provide at any one stage a statement where you indicated that the IPJ arrested the person who we are referring to as Mulindahabi?
A.	When I was interviewed in June 1995, the judicial police officer put questions to me and he was writing down what I was saying.  He had a document which listed the charges against me, and I explained what had happened.  The judicial police officer who was putting the questions to me was our neighbour but he had his office in Gitarama.  I do not know how this person knew that I was being detained in Gitarama.  He called me and he told me that he came from our area.  He put questions to me regarding an investigation.  He put these questions to me, and I answered them.  He was using a typewriter.  I answered his questions.  That is the last time that I talked about Murindahabi, Jean Claude.
JUDGE SHORT:
Listen to the questions and answer the questions that you have been asked.  The question is: did you at any time give a statement in which you said IPJ arrested Murindahabi?  Yes or no? 
THE WITNESS:
I made a statement like that.  Since I was accused of having killed these people, I drafted a document wherein I requested that an investigation be conducted in respect of these events, but I did not see the document amongst those that were presented to me.  If you do have it with you, I'd like to take a look at it.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	In the same statement we're referring to, did you proceed to say, I'll read again, "IPJ arrested him," that is Murindahabi, "and with the help of Mika, they killed him at the commune."
A.	No, I never said that.
MR. SONGA:
Objection, Madam President.  I would like to know -- thank you, Madam President.  I would like to know what document is being referred to here because I hear the Prosecutor saying, "I read."  I want to know what document this is.  If this is a document that has just been rejected, then I do not think that it would be well to refer to this document.  Thank you, Madam President.
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, if you said you read, then you put the question properly because we have already told you that.  You cannot read anything from that document which he's rejected.  You can ask questions as to whether he ever made a statement in which he said A, B, C, D, E.  And wherever you get that from, the Court will not be interested in finding out. 
MS. MADENGA:
Indebted, Your Honour, because I thought I made a foundation by saying to the witness whether he actually made a statement on the 11th of December 1994 and whether the statement contained, among other things, the content that I have just read out to him.
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, but when you start saying, "I read", then Counsel would want to know where you are reading from, and if you are reading from a document which has been rejected, then he has every right to object.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Witness, I want to take you on a mental voyage.  You have been in detention; is that correct?
A.	I have been in detention for a long time, it is true.  I know that I have done nothing else.  There are crimes I have been charged with and that's all.
Q.	You also indicated that you have written to the prosecutor in Rwanda to review your file; that is correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You have proffered explanations for the charges levelled against you, is that not so, for the consideration of the prosecutor?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	It is also correct that your explanations have been believed by the prosecutor and he accepted those explanations?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Microphone not activated) 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I'm trying to ascertain whether he knows it so that I can confirm the information I have.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Ask him whether he knows and accepts it.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Do you know whether your file is under review with the prosecutor in Rwanda?
A.	I have told you that when such a file is compiled against me -- or, when the file was compiled against me, I was presented to the people within the gacaca session so that these people would say what they knew about me and about the crimes I am charged with.  The person who accused me in 1994 is the same person who continues to accuse me.  I was given an opportunity to explain myself in front of everyone, and the people confirmed what I said, but because the person who accuses me is influential, my explanations were not accepted and I returned to prison.  And I am still awaiting trial.
Q.	I want to refer you to your confession.  The original is in Kinyarwanda.  I marked it one.
MS. MADENGA:
If, Mr. Issa, you can assist me by placing before the witness -- it's the entire criminal file which has all the records.  So it's the first document. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will just explain the document to you before I will ask questions.  I will wait for you to get a copy of the entire file. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, document one is the original document in Kinyarwanda, and the equivalent is the document marked "II" for ease of reference, which is the criminal file in English.  It is a translation of what the witness says before him.  The document before Your Honours and the witness consists of the witness confession, the statement of confession, and it's dated the 19th of December 2002.  It also contains the alleged offences confessed by the witness.  It also consists of letters, numerous letters, purportedly written by the witness to the prosecutor in Rwanda.  It also contains witness statements that is -- witness statements for the witness in the dock.  Those witnesses are exonerating him from the allegations.  It goes on at the very end to contain an application for bail from this witness, and the application is based on the explanations, which include a document we have referred to; that is the statement to the police dated the 15th of September 2000.  At the very end of the document, it also contains considerations by the prosecutor in which the prosecutor indicates that he believes the witness's explanations; therefore, he considers him a candidate of bail and categorises him as category two.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Generally, do you understand the file?  Do you have that file I have referred to?  Then we can go to the specific areas in the file I want to refer you to.
A.	I have not very well understood your various explanations because I was reading the file before me. 
Q.	Maybe we'll do it aspect by aspect.  We'll, first of all, just focus on the letters contained in that file which letters are purported to have been written or signed by you, written to the prosecutor to explain the allegations.  Do you understand that so far?
A.	I do.
Q.	Thank you.  What I want you to do is to identify for me those letters which you personally wrote to the prosecutor.  And maybe to assist you, we can go to the first letter; then you can indicate whether you personally wrote that to the prosecutor, or whether someone drafted that letter for you, and whether you appended your signature.
A.	I wrote the first letter.
Q.	Is it the letter dated --
A.	I confirm that I am the person who wrote that letter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the page of the letter?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  It is on page 5 of the English translation.  And it is a letter dated the 24th of July 2003.  It's the first letter in the bundle, and the first letter in the Kinyarwanda bundle, the witness criminal file.  The subject matter "circumstances surrounding the death of people I allegedly killed."
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	So you confirm this one?  You drafted the letter and you actually signed it?  So the letter dated 24th July 2003 to the public prosecutor is confirmed that that's your signature and your writing?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do recognise that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This letter of 24th July 2003, you admit that this letter was drafted by you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is indeed my writing.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Let's going to page 6, a letter dated the 10th of December 2000. 
MS. MADENGA:
Mr. Issa, can you confirm that he's looking at the correct letter?  The Kinyarwanda version letter dated 10th December 2000. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Did you write this letter?
A.	Yes, I admit to having written that letter.
Q.	Did you sign the letter yourself?
A.	I signed it myself.
Q.	Let's go to the next letter on -- the English version, it's page 9.  This letter is undated, but I want to confirm whether you wrote the letter and whether you signed that letter.  It is also a letter to the public prosecutor in Rwanda.
A.	It is my letter.
Q.	You wrote it and signed it?
A.	It is my letter.  Even though I don't find any signature on that letter, below that letter, the handwriting is mine.  However, it is not signed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Though it is not signed, you still admit that this was written by you? 
THE WITNESS:
I wrote that letter myself.  I admit to having written that letter.  The contents are mine. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Let's go to the letter dated 6th August 2000, on page 16 of the English translation, which is a letter seeking justice.  Did you write this letter to the prosecutor in Rwanda?
A.	I am not there yet. 
Q.	You'll get assistance.  This is the letter of 6th of August 2000.  Are you there now?
A.	I am there.
Q.	Did you write that letter?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you also sign that letter?
A.	However, I signed on carbon paper.  That is why it is not very visible. 
Q.	So you wrote it and you signed it on carbon paper.  You said the signature is not visible because you signed on carbon paper.  Is that the position?
A.	I am the person who wrote that letter.  I admit to having written it.
Q.	Let's go to the next letter which is dated the 18th of May 2000, and it's on page 18 of the English translation.  You are being shown the equivalent in Kinyarwanda.
A.	Yes, I have seen that letter.
Q.	You wrote and signed that letter?
MS. MADENGA:
Has he identified the -- the 18th of May 2000 before we go to the next one?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see the letter.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	You agree it's you that wrote that letter and you signed it?
A.	I found it.
Q.	Can you confirm --
A.	It is indeed my letter.  I am the author of that letter. 
Q.	Lastly, let's go to the 29th of September, 2001, the letter addressed to the director of the Gisovu prison. 
MS. MADENGA:
It's on page 20 of the English translation, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You should have numbered the Kinyarwanda version too.  It would have made the job easier. 
MS. MADENGA:
I agree, Your Honour.  What we're doing now is to give an equivalent of those pages to Mr. Issa so we are on the same page as the witness.  Does the witness have 29th of September 2001?  He has the copy. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you write and sign that letter?
A.	I am the author of that letter.
Q.	We'll show you another one, the original in Kinyarwanda, the 10th of December 2000.  It's on page 22 of the English translation. 
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, that's correct.
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to the letter of the 10th of December?  
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, the 10th of December 2000.  Did you write that letter?
A.	I am the author of this letter as well.
Q.	Did you sign that letter? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That one is on page what of the English one? 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, it is on page 22 of the English version, reference WS04/454E.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Witness, we are now on the last letter dated the 28th of November 2002, which is on page 25 of the English translation, reference WS04/454E.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do we have it in Kinyarwanda?
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, we have an equivalent, which the witness is looking at, with a heading, "Request for release from prison."  
THE WITNESS:
This letter is mine.  I am the author thereof.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This letter --
THE WITNESS:
I am the author of this letter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This was drafted by you too? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I recognise that this letter is mine.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	So among the letters that I've shown to you, the only one which is not yours is the statement relating to the 11th of December 1994.  Is that so?
A.	I am not the author of this letter.  Besides, the writing is not mine. 
Q.	That's okay, Mr. Witness.  I just want to refer you again to the police statement contained on page 11, reference WS04/454E, the one which is dated the 15th of September 2000.  You already have an extract from the main file.  Mr. Witness, the document I've just referred you to of the 15th of September 2000 is one of the documents which you submitted to the prosecutor in your application for bail; is that not correct?  That is one of the supporting documents?
A.	After looking at the contents of this document, I realise that those questions were put to me by the public prosecutor.
Q.	That's correct.  We've already gone through the document.  What I wanted you to confirm is that this document is one of the supporting documents in your criminal file which you submitted to the prosecutor for him to consider to release you out on bail.
A.	I confirm that this document was written.
Q.	Thank you for that.  And you also confirm that it is this document, one of the documents which the prosecutor considered in categorising you in category two as a candidate of bail; is that correct?  The consideration I'm referring you, you will find the last document in your file which is in the Kinyarwanda file.  It is on page 27 of the English version. 
MS. MADENGA:
Can I assist you by going to page 28, Mr. Issa.  Can I show you the Kinyarwanda.  You have got the portion I'm referring to on the prosecutor's remarks?  I'm reading from the English version, page 28, reference WS04/454E, where the prosecutor's remarks reads: "You could be granted bail since there's no evidence against him considering that he's explained very well the circumstances surrounding the death of the people he's alleged to have killed."
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Do you see that portion of that document in your Kinyarwanda file?
A.	Yes, I have found it.  I have found it.
Q.	You found it?
A.	Yes, prosecutor.
Q.	Considering that the prosecutor's remarks is based on the totality of the documents you submitted to the prosecutor, including the explanation you gave for the death of the two people we've been discussing, Murindahabi and Nkundiye.  How do you explain the fact that you allegedly don't know the circumstances under which these people were killed and who actually arrested them and killed them?
A.	I have explained to you the circumstances under which those people were arrested.  Murindahabi was arrested by the brigadier, the gendarmes, and the judicial police officer.  He was thrown into the commune gaol.  As for Jean Claude Nkundiye he was arrested by the bourgmestre, as well as people who had been sent by the bourgmestre to flush him out.  He was arrested and detained.  During gacaca sessions a commune police admitted to having put people in gaol, and when he got back to the commune office on the 8th he realised that those people had been brought by the bourgmestre and gendarmes on board a vehicle.  I therefore do not know the circumstances under which those people were killed.
Q.	Mr. Witness, the question is: in the documents you submitted to the prosecutor to support your bail application, you included a statement implicating Mika Muhimana in the killing of these two persons, and the prosecutor came to the conclusion that because you submitted that document, you have explained well the circumstances surrounding the death of the people you are alleged to have killed.  So the question is: to the prosecutor you said you know the people who killed the victims.  Now you are saying you don't know the circumstances.  What is the position?
A.	What letter are you referring to?  A letter which states that Mika participated in the murder of those people?  I'd like you to show me that letter, the letter in which I state that Mika was one of those who killed those persons.  I personally did not accuse him of having participated in the killing of those persons.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am referring to the document which you admitted -- you submitted to the prosecutor of Rwanda.  The one which I said reference 15th of September 2000.  It was a supporting document to support your bail application.  That is the document I'm referring to, and that is the copy I gave you in Kinyarwanda, the extracts of the document dated the 15th of September 2000.  That is the document I'm making reference to.
A.	I did not state that Mika had those people killed in that document.  I rather explained that that person was arrested in front of Mika's house by gendarmes and a brigadier.  I stated that during the arrest Mika was in his house.  I never stated that Mika participated in the murder of those persons.  Those persons were arrested and taken to the commune office where they spent the night, and the following day they were taken away.  I did not state that Mika played any role whatsoever in the killing of those persons.  If I stated that Mika witnessed the arrest of Murindahabi, just as I myself witnessed it, I did not however state that he participated in the murder of Murindahabi.  I have never mentioned that in any document.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, did you say that one of *************************? 
THE WITNESS:
*********************************.
JUDGE SHORT:
Is it the same -- it's not the same prison in which you are, is it? 
THE WITNESS:
I am detained in the*********************
JUDGE SHORT:
How long have you been together?

Leave them there. 
	(Witness excused)
	(Witness ushered in)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness.  Therefore, you will be called Witness ARI, which is your pseudonym. 

Is it ARI or AR1, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the witness is code-named Witness AR1. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you will be referred to under your pseudonym AR1 instead of your real name.  You also make sure not to reveal your name or the name of your parents or any other information that may lead to identify you.  Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth. 

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness.

WITNESS AR1,
first having been duly sworn
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Madam President, I have an observation to make.  The Professor has not notified us whether this witness has or has not testified in previous trials before this Tribunal, and I have reason to believe that the witness has testified in the Ntakirutimana case.  I don't know whether he can confirm that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, go ahead. 
MR. SONGA:
I think, Madam President, that in answer to a question put forward by Honourable Judge Short, I was asked to make it clear whether, amongst the remaining witnesses, there were some who had already appeared in previous cases, and we confirmed by designating Witness No. 32 of your list and who is appearing in Court today under the pseudonym AR1, so that formality had already been fulfilled, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  Go ahead. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, in April 1994, were you in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Were you occupied?
A.	Yes, I was working.
Q.	In April, did you continue to carry out your activities normally? 
A.	At a certain point in April, my activities stopped.  I was no longer working.
Q.	And why, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Following security-related problems.
Q.	Can you talk to us about those security-related problems? 
A.	Those problems were due to the fact that there were people who wanted to attack the institution in which we were working.  And that led me to take the decision to leave my workplace.
Q.	Do you know the date on which you left your workplace? 
A.	I left my place of work on the 16th of April.
Q.	Who sought to attack your place of work?
A.	Bandits are those who wanted to attack the place because they wanted to loot ************.
Q.	What was the name of *************?   
A.	It was called the **************.
Q.	And when you left ***********, where did you go? 
A.	When I left ****************, after stopping work, I went somewhere.  That was on the 12th.  I stopped work on the 12th.  I went to hide somewhere and I left that place on the 16th. 
Q.	Can you tell us more about the bandits who sought to attack **************?  Where did they come from? 
A.	Those bandits came from Mpembe, others from Mugonero, others yet from Gishyita.  That is what I can remember. 
Q.	Did they belong to one of the ethnic groups recognised in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  Those bandits belonged to a known ethnic group in Rwanda.
Q.	And what is the name of that ethnic group?
A.	I do not know the ethnic group because I didn't have any interest in knowing their ethnic background.  As far as I'm concerned, I saw that they were coming to attack *************** and I took the decision to flee.  I wasn't interested in knowing their ethnic group.
Q.	Why were they seeking to attack *************? 
A.	They wanted to attack ************** because people had sought refuge there, and they also wanted to loot at *****************
Q.	Do you know the existing ethnic groups in Rwanda?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you list them to us? 
A.	There were Hutu, Tutsi and Twa.
Q.	And how about the people who had taken refuge at **********?  Were you able to identify them? 
A.	Those who had come to hide in *************** came from various directions.  There were some who used to live in Ngoma where I myself resided.
Q.	Did you know a person named Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew Mika Muhimana.
Q.	Can we say from 1994, or from when did you know him? 
A.	I had just spent two years knowing Mika before then.
Q.	Can you recall what was his occupation when you met him for the first time? 
A.	When we met for the first time, he was a trader, and conseiller of the Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Did you get to meet Mika Muhimana during the month of April?
A.	We met in April.
Q.	How many times did you meet in April?
A.	I don't know the number of times, but as I used to go to his workplace, I think I saw him on several occasions.
Q.	Where did you used to see him?
A.	Since I had taken refuge in Gishyita, I used to stroll at the Gishyita centre where he used to work.  I used to go there to buy brochettes and to drink beer.
Q.	I will give you the name of a person and you will tell us if you know that person.  Did you know a person by name Gafurafura?
A.	I know Gafurafura, because he used to live close to the school I attended and not far from where I used to live.
Q.	Can you tell the Court who he was?
A.	Gafurafura was a pastor in Ngoma, but at a certain point, he had a motorbike accident, which led to his death.  I therefore knew him in Ngoma.
Q.	Did he have children?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you know his children?
A.	I knew his children. 
Q.	Can you talk to the Court about them?
A.	Do you want me to give you their names or you want me to write down their names? 
Q.	Well, you can give us their names. 
A.	One was called Marthe Nyirahabimana, and then there was Mathias Habimana, Jerome, Emmanuel, Pierre, Marie Mukeshimana, Madeleine Nirere.
Q.	Thank you.  What was Nyirahabimana, Marthe's occupation in April 1994?
A.	Marthe Nyirahabimana in 1994 was a nurse in the Mugonero hospital. 
Q.	And where was she in April 1994? 
A.	In April 1994, Marthe had gone to take part in a training at Kabgayi.
Q.	How did you get to know this information?
A.******************************************************************************************************************	******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Q.	And how far was Kabgayi from the Mugonero hospital? 
A.	I never went to Kabgayi, but I think it was in the Gitarama préfecture.  The distance was pretty long.  It was in a different préfecture after Kibuye.
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be in a position to tell us, were it in approximative terms, the age of Marthe Nyirahabimana in April 1994?
A.	If I make an estimate, Marthe Nyirahabimana had between 35 and 40 years of age.
Q.	Was she married?
A.	Marthe Nyirahabimana was married, but in 1994 her husband died.
Q.	Do you know if she had children?

A.	Yes.  She had two children. 
Q.	Was there a person named Marie Gafurafura in the family?
A.	In their family, there was nobody who went by the name Marie Gafurafura.  There was only a girl called Marie Mukeshimana.
Q.	And Marie Mukeshimana, what was her occupation in April 1994?
A.	Marie Mukeshimana, I knew ********************.  She couldn't pass the official exam and had to go to Kigali, and in 1994 she was living with her brother in Kigali.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, it's 1 p.m. now.  We take lunch break and resume at 2:30 p.m.  Thank you. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
	(Court recessed from 1300H to 1435H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed. 
Professor, continue, please. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, before we broke for lunch, you were telling us about the person called Marie Mukeshimana.  You will forgive us for putting questions to you that have already been put, but it is in a bid to establish a link between what happened in the morning and what is going to happen now.  What was Marie Mukeshimana doing in April 1994? 
A.	Marie Mukeshimana was not employed in 1994.  At that time, she lived with her brother in Kigali.
Q.	Thank you.  You also referred to a certain Madeleine Nirere, who was also a daughter of Mr. Gafurafura.  What was she doing in April 1994? 
A.	Madeleine Nirere was not employed.  From time to time, she would be in Kigali or in Gishyita.
Q.	And where was she in April 1994?
A.	In April, around the 6th, I cannot say that I know exactly where she was, but she was often in Gishyita, and if -- when she was not in Gishyita, where they had a family house, she would be at her brother's place in Kigali.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In April 1994, did you know a person called Josiane?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell the Court who she was?
A.	Josiane was the daughter of Amos Karera.
Q.	We shall spell for the purpose of the transcript, K-A-R-E-R-A, Karera.  And who is this person called Amos Karera?
A.	Amos Karera worked in the hospital secretariat, so I would say that he was a secretary.
Q.	Did you know Amos Karera's family?
A.	I knew Amos Karera's family.
Q.	Can you tell us about Amos Karera's children? 
A.	He had Josiane Mukeshimana, Eugenia Murekatete, Jean-Bosco Kubahiro, a certain Louis, Albert Shingiro, and another person named Chantal.
Q.	Would you be so kind as to repeat the name of the first child you called?  Josiane what? 
A.	Josiane Mukeshimana.
Q.	Thank you.  You also referred to a certain Eugenia.  Would you please spell her other name for us, please, or would you please give us her other name?
A.	The name is Murekatete.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you have any news of Josiane Mukeshimana in April 1994? 
A.	The only news I had of her -- well, I'd say that I knew nothing special about Josiane Mukeshimana.
Q.	But if somebody told you that Josiane Mukeshimana was raped at the Mugonero hospital in April 1994, how would you respond? 
A.	I can't say anything about it, that I was neither a witness nor did I hear it said that she had been raped.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, tell us about Eugenia Murekatete.  Did you know of her whereabouts in April 1994? 
A.	In 1994, in April, what I knew about Eugenia Murekatete is that she was in Kigali.  She did not live in Mugonero.
Q.	And now, if somebody tells you that she was raped in Mugonero hospital in April 1994, how would you respond? 
A.	I wouldn't agree with this person, because this young lady had been in Kigali for some time.  She had not returned to Mugonero for a good, long while.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you yourself left the hospital, you said, on the 12th.  Is that what you said, the 12th of April? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I left the hospital on the 12th. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you didn't come back to the hospital in April, did you? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not return to the hospital in April.  It is towards the end of the month that I returned there. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you wouldn't know what was happening there between the 12th and the end of the month; is that not correct? 
THE WITNESS:
When the question was put to me, the precise dates were not given to me.  But while I was there, before I left the hospital, I did not see this young lady at the hospital.  I did not even see her amongst the people who sought refuge. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what is the distance between the Mugonero hospital and Kigali? 
A.	Between these two places, there is a great distance.  I cannot give you the number of kilometres, but you know that between Kibuye and Kigali you first of all have Gitarama préfecture.  So you cannot enter Kigali before crossing Gitarama.  So it is not close to Mugonero.
Q.	From the information you had at the time, in April 1994, was it possible or easy to make the trip from Kigali to Mugonero? 
A.	It was not easy during that time, because there was not much opportunity.  That is all I can tell you.  Given the prevailing security nation-wide at the time, it was not easy to leave Kigali town.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But people were fleeing Kigali town as they were fleeing other towns, like you yourself fled from your place to other places; is that not correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam, I did not hear the translation of Judge Muthoga's question; from the French, that is. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The interpreter in the French booth, please translate the question put by Judge Muthoga to the witness.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe there is a technical problem.  I believe the interpreter in the French booth is unable to hear. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Unable to hear what? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter has indicated that he did not hear the question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The question which I put to the witness, and which he answered, was:  People were fleeing from Kigali and also from other towns, like he, the witness, fled from his place of work to other places.  I asked the witness to confirm if that was the case, and he said it was. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know, or did you know, a person called Yohanita in April 1994?
A.	In April 1994, I knew Janette or Yohanita.
Q.	Who was she?
A.	She was the daughter of Amos Karera.
Q.	A while ago, you gave me -- you gave us the names of Amos Karera.  Did you refer to Yohanita?
A.	I did not call her name, and I did not refer to her as Yohanita or Janette, because, before, she was called Janette, but when she finished primary school, she was unable to pass the competitive entrance exam.  And if you did not go to school in Rwanda it would be like the world was collapsing about your ears.  So it was therefore necessary for this person to be called Josiane.  She changed her name to Josiane, and she went to Nyakanyinya school.  That is why she had two names, whereas she was just one person.
Q.	Thank you.  In April 1994, can you tell us how old Josiane, also called Yohanita, was? 
A.	If I have to give an estimate, I would say that Janette or Yohanita was aged about 26 or 27 years.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Twenty who?  What year did you say? 
THE WITNESS:
She was aged 26 or 27.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And she was doing a competitive entrance examination, entrance, at that time? 
THE WITNESS:
Perhaps you might remind me.  What date are you referring to? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
1994, what was her age? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that in 1994, she was aged about 26 or 27.  Regarding the competitive entrance exam, she did not write an exam at that time.  Regarding when she changed her name, it was when she changed or she finished the eighth year of primary school.  When she did not pass the exam, she changed her name, and she went and repeated that year in Nyakanyinya, because you cannot repeat in one school because the indications or the records would show the names and the various marks if somebody failed the entrance exam.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What was the year in which she repeated, when she changed her name?  Which year? 
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember in what year, but I know that she was two years ahead of me in our school, and if I left school in 1985, then she would have left in 1983. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You knew her when she was going by the old name, Janette? 
THE WITNESS:
I knew her. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you subsequently knew she had changed her name sometime in 1983? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  That is what I stated. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What name were you calling her in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
She was called Josiane. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead, Professor. 

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Let us talk about Eugenia Murekatete.  If somebody told you that she was a pupil in ESAPAN in April 1994, how would you respond?
A.	I cannot accept that, ***************************************************************************************** pass the official exam.  She went to the ESAPAN school in 1985, where she stayed for two years.  She failed in the second year, and immediately after, she went to live in Kigali, where she stayed until we left the country.
Q.	Mr. Witness, in April 1994, did you know a person called Kajongi?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Who was he?
A.	Kajongi was the accountant of Field in Ngoma.
Q.	And what is Field?
A.	It was the association of adventists in the region of Kibuye, Cyangugu and Gikongoro.
Q.	And did you know Kajongi's family?
A.	I knew Kajongi's family.
Q.	Did you know his children?
A.	I knew his children.
Q.	Can you tell the Court about them?
A.	There was one Muvunyi, Paul; Ngarambe, Vedaste; Josephine Mukarambi; and Joy Mukasine.  But to go back a little, you asked me where he worked.  I don't know whether he was still Field accountant or whether he had been transferred to ESI.  At some point, two years previously, in Mugonero -- I have a feeling that I'm confusing matters.  I don't know whether he was Field accountant or ESI accountant.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You referred to a person called Joy.  Is it Joy or Joyce Mukasine?
A.	I told you Joy Mukasine.
Q.	Do you know what she was doing in April 1994? 
A.	Joy Mukasine was a student in Butare university in April 1994.
Q.	Did she come on holiday in April 1994? 
A.	She did not come on holiday in April 1994.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, specify the date.  April, what date? 
MR. SONGA:
I shall do so, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you can hear that the Court wishes to you give details.  Are you in a position to say whether she was in Mugonero on the 16th of April?
A.	On the 16th of April, Joy was not in Mugonero.  She was in Butare, in the university. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor -
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How do you know that? 
THE WITNESS:
I know this because the people who came to seek refuge in ***********************************, amongst them I did not see this young lady.  I saw the members of her family, all members of her family, except this person whom I have just referred to. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You yourself were not in Mugonero on the 16th of April.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You left the hospital on 12th, 12th April. 
THE WITNESS:
I am relating to you the events that occurred while I was still there.  When I left that place on the 12th, I did not leave her at the hospital. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were asked whether she was in Mugonero on the 16th; 16th comes after the 12th, not before.  You then responded that she was not there on the 16th.  How would you know, if you were not there? 
THE WITNESS:
When I state that she was not present, I mean that I didn't leave her there on the 12th.  If she came during the period between my departure and the 16th, I am not aware of that. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, prior to the events of April 1994, when did you see Joy Mukasine for the last time? 
A.	I no longer very well remember the last time I saw her.  I cannot say anything definite.  But whenever she came home on holiday, I used to see her.
Q.	Do you remember the last holidays she spent there? 
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know another person from Ngoma called Mukasine? 
A.	I know no one else from Ngoma called Mukasine.
Q.	Did you know anybody by the name of Charles Ukobizaba?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	Did you know his children?
A.	I knew them. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court who they were? 
A.	One was called Charlotte Mukashema; another was called Musonera; one was called Uzie; another was Joseph Mundumukiza (phonetic); a certain Rutaganda; Vera Usabimana, and Esperance.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And if someone were to tell you that Ukobizaba had a daughter called Mukasine, how would you react to that? 
A.	I would say that that person is lying, because that man did not have a child bearing that name.  Mukasine was the daughter of Kajongi.
Q.	Apart from Eugenia Murekatete, of whom you have spoken at length, do you know another Murekatete?
A.	No. 
Q.	And if someone told you that a certain Murekatete ************************ as a maid or as a cleaner, what would your reaction be?
A.	I do not know any Murekatete who *******************
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like the translation to be more faithful.  I believe the witness said there was none -- no Murekatete **************************, whereas the translation comes across as, "I don't know any Murekatete who was *******************." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are getting proper translation.  I don't know about the French, but the English translation is appropriate. 
MR. SONGA:
That is what I've just said, Madam President.  It is -- the problem is with the French translation.  There is a difference between there was nobody by -- known by that name who was working as a cleaner.  It's different from saying that, "I don't know anybody by that name."  It is the French version that I am questioning. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, although you're making a big issue of that, you know it's really a matter of interpretation.  If he doesn't know of any Murekatete, it is free -- it is free to be translated that there isn't; and if he says there isn't, he assumes the responsibility of saying he knows ******************************************* *************, which he might not know.  So he's content to say, "I didn't know anyone under that name ***********************************."  And to me, it's the same, as far as the dynamics or the response is concerned, unless, of course, you want to send him through a mix of stating that he knows every ******************************************** and therefore he can exclude with certainty any person being called Murekatete, which he might not be free to do.
MR. SONGA:
I understand what you're saying, Your Honour, but I am concerned about faithful delivery of what the witness has stated.  I am concerned, and I would like the translation to be as faithful as possible, and this should be the rule for subsequent translations.  And if the interpreter is interpreting the thought of the witness, it's something we should avoid.  But if you maintain your position that the meaning is the same, we can move on. 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
My position, Professor, is the witness is speaking in Kinyarwanda, isn't he?  And therefore when he speaks in Kinyarwanda it's about to be interpreted in the best possible sense, either in English or French, but the best possible sense.  But translating languages doesn't always come the word you want or the word one would want.  It's a matter of which text conveys the thought of the witness, which is well conveyed. 
MR. SONGA:
We agree with you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, if someone told you that people were raped at Mugonero hospital on the 16th of April 1994, how would you react to that? 
A.	If I were told that rape was committed at the hospital, my initial reaction would be that I wasn't present at that hospital on that date.  But I believe people went there to loot or to kill others.  They therefore would not have had time to commit rape. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is what you believe. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  That is my opinion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is not your evidence; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
It is my point of view. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good. 

Professor, go on. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, was there a medical school in Mugonero? 
A.	There was a nursing school in Mugonero.  There was no medical school there. 
Q.	And were there theatres in that nursing school? 
A.	At that nursing school, *******************, there was no theatre.
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel is referring to operation theatre, not the kind of theatre you have dramas in.  Was there any operation room?  Let's forget about the word "theatre."  Was there a room where operations were held, conducted, in the hospital? 

THE WITNESS:
In that school, there was no operation room. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you asking about the school or the hospital? 
(Pages 41 to 55 by Mark Porter)

































	1515H
MR. SONGA: 
	I will try to explain to you, Your Honours, within the thrust of my question.  I believe that in the indictment it is stated somewhere that there were operation theatres in the medical school of Mugonero.  That is why I would like this to be clarified.  And we now understand that there wasn't a medical school but a nursing school.  So I maintain my question, which is with the indictment.  

In that school, we are not talking of the medical school, but in the nursing school, was there an operation theatre?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you hear of anything called Mugonero complex?
THE WITNESS:
I do not understand your question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is there anything referred to as Mugonero complex?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Honourable Judge's initial statement did not come through because the microphone was not lit.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The microphone is lit now.  And the question to the witness is, was there any institution referred to as Mugonero complex?
THE WITNESS:
There was no institution by that name  -- known by that name.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And no place known by that name?
THE WITNESS:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where was Mugonero hospital located? 
THE WITNESS:
Mugonero hospital was located in Gishyita commune, right there in Mugonero.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And where was the nursing school located?
THE WITNESS:
The nursing school was very close to the hospital.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How close?  Would it be in the same vicinity? 

THE WITNESS:
I would say that both institutions were at the same location because some of the classes in that school were located in the old building used by the hospital.  New classrooms had not yet been built.  So the building that was very close to the hospital was used.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did this school have any operation room, the nursing school?
THE WITNESS:
That school did not have an operation room.  When students had to do practicals, they went to the hospital.  The school did not have an operation room.
JUDGE SHORT:
So the hospital had an operation room. The operation room was in the main hospital, isn't it?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
And the nursing school, is it not sometimes referred to as a medical school? 
THE WITNESS:
Maybe the explanations have not been well understood.  Normally, when they talk of the school of medicine they are referring to the faculty of medicine; whereas the nursing school was only for nurses.  Those who are studying in Butare were referred to as students at the faculty of medicine.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were **************** -- 
THE WITNESS:
So what -- in Mugonero what ********** was a nursing school.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
*******************************? 
THE WITNESS:
******** ********************.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did the hospital have an operation room theatre? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the hospital had an operation theatre, an operation room.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did I understand you correctly when you said that the nursing school and the hospital were using, more or less, the same buildings? 
THE WITNESS:
Both institutions did not use the same building because the school was using a room at the hospital.  And that room was in the old buildings of the hospital.  And the other classrooms were elsewhere, outside of the hospital building. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What we mean is that the school and the hospital were in the same compound, on the same premises; is that not so? 
THE WITNESS:
There was no fence.  They were separate buildings that had been constructed.  There was no wall around that complex.
JUDGE SHORT:
What was the distance between the school and the hospital? 
THE WITNESS:
I would say that some of the classrooms were very close to the building in which the nurses lived -- studied.  And the distance could be covered in five or ten minutes.  There were other classrooms farther up.  If you wanted to go to school, I would say it depended on the location of the various classrooms.  The classrooms were scattered all over the place.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you have just made mention of the operation room.  I want to clarify one thing.  Was there any difference between the operation room and the classrooms? 
A.	As far as I am concerned the operation theatre and the operation room mean the same thing.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, let's get the translation before you move on to your next question.  Could I get the answer again, please?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He said there was no difference between operation theatre and operation room, that they were the same thing -- but in his opinion, they mean the same thing.
MR. SONGA: 
	(No interpretation)
JUDGE SHORT:
No, I only wanted the answer, and I got it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed.
MR. SONGA: 
	Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I think I heard the answer.  The operation theatre and the operation room represent the same thing to you.  
Now my question, Witness:  How many operation theatres were in the Mugonero hospital in April of 1994?
A.	There were two.  So I can say there were two operation rooms.  There was a small room for minor surgery and another room for major surgery.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us how the rooms for minor surgery were equipped?
A.	There are many devices in that room, Professor.  Unless we have to make an explanation, there is a very aggregated range of devices and equipment in that room.  I can't list them here.  

There are pencils, there are chairs, there are beds and there is a varied range of equipment.  So I don't know what kind of equipment you are talking about.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I am going to be a little more precise.  For instance, in the operation room for minor surgery, were there beds?
A.	There were no beds.  There was only one bed.
Q.	And for what purpose was the bed used?
A.	Minor surgical operations were conducted on that bed:  For instance, when boils had to be pierced, on that bed.  When you had a boil you had to sit on that bed for the boil to be excised as it were, or if a person had to be examined, it is on that bed that that was done.  And at times women who had to be sent to the maternity also were sat on it.  And wounds were -- wounds were treated there.  And if it became serious, that is when the patients were sent to rooms for major surgery.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What about the room for major surgery; did it have beds?
A.	There was only one bed in that room, which we used when we're carrying out surgical operations.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the operations were carried out on beds or on a table, operation table? 
THE WITNESS:
Operation tables are also called beds.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the buildings in which you had the operation theatres, were they storied buildings?
A.	Can you please repeat your question, Professor?
Q.	My question was to find out if the building in which you had the two operation rooms was a story building?  Did it have a single story or more than one? 
A.	Those operation rooms were in a building that had two stories; that is the ground floor -- or, rather, the basement and the ground floor.
Q.	Thank you.  And at what level, or on which story did you have the room for minor operations or surgery?
A.	The room for minor surgery and even for major surgery was in the basement.  However, it was in the basement and the (unintelligible).
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I'm going to give you a name and you will tell me if you have heard of it.  Did you know a certain Brumbe?   
A.	I don't know any person by that name, but I know a person that we used to call Byumve, but that was a nickname.  His real name was Samuel Singaye.  And he was a lecturer, or teacher at the EPAN -- at the ESAPAN.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have the pronunciation of the name.  Would it make any difference, Byumbe or Byumve, is that not one and the same pronunciation?
MR. SONGA:
Maybe I will have to spell the name.  The first name which I mentioned in my question, it is written as follows: B-y-u-m-b-e.  In light of the answer that the witness gave, we have the following name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What would be the spelling of Byumbe?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, what was the nickname you were calling that person?  Can you spell it to us?
THE WITNESS:
The name was Byumve, B-Y-U-M-V-E.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The division is the letter B and V; is that the division?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I will come back to your answer.  Mr. Witness, you said that Byumve was the nickname of a person called Singaye?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Singaye, S-I-N-G-A-Y-E.  And that person called Singaye, what did the person do for a living?
A.	Singaye was a teacher in ESAPAN.
Q.	Was he married?
A.	Yes, he was married.
Q.	Did you know his wife?
A.	I know her.  Her name was Ann-Marie.  And they used to work at the Mugonero hospital in the laboratory.
Q.	Did Singaye have children?
A.	Singaye didn't have many children.  He had only one kid.
Q.	Can you remember his age?
A.	I don't remember his age, but if I can estimate it, I think he had between five and eight years of age.

MR. SONGA: 
	Madam President, I bring to a close my examination-in-chief.

Thank you, Witness.  And thank you, very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Now, Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor for cross-examination. 

Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor to test the accuracy and the credibility of your evidence-in-chief.  Please understand the questions and reply to them very briefly and concisely.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.                
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Were you living with ************in April '94, at Mugonero?
A.	Yes, in April 1994 I was living with *********.
Q.	Did you move with ************ to Mugonero hospital on the 9th of April '94?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, could you please repeat the question?  I was not very attentive.
MR. KAPAYA:
That is all right, Your Honour.  I was -- I have just asked the witness whether he and his family moved to live -- or sought refuge in the Mugonero hospital building on the 9th of April.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What was the answer?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we sought refuge together at that location.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Did the family of Pastor Jacques Ushizimpumu also seek refuge in the hospital with you -- with your family on the 9th of April?  Ushizimpumu is spelt U-S-H-I-Z-I-M-P-U-M-U.
A.	Many people sought refuge at that location on that date.  I don't quite know if that family was there.
Q.	Did your family and Ushizimpumu's family seek refuge at Kabahinyuza centre on the 13th of April '94?
A.	On the 15th of April -- 
Q.	13th, 13th.
A.	On the 12th we were at Kabahinyuza.
Q.	Did you, ******************************************************************************************************** market?
A.	Yes, we were there.
Q.	On the 16th of April in the morning, did you walk to ********************************** or -- let me put this way:  Did you walk to the **************, or you went by car?
A.	On that date, I did, indeed, go to the centre, but I went on foot.
Q.	Now, while at the centre -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the date?  Sorry.
MR. KAPAYA:
16th of April, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, ************************************* came in cars, right; went to *************** in cars?
A.	You are correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So, is that an alteration from what you said before, that you walked to the centre -- sorry.  The witness said on the 16th he walked -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are sorry, the Honourable Judges are not speaking through the microphone so they cannot be interpreted.  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness said, he walked on the 16th to the centre.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And your question then was --
MR. KAPAYA:
	Whether ************************** went to the centre by car.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
To the centre?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, the same place that he went to the **********************.  And he said, yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
Is the *************** centre?
MR. KAPAYA:
It is located -- the ***************************************************, Your Honour, that is where he went to seek refuge.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is **********?
MR. KAPAYA:
The witness may perhaps know.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in what ********************?
A.	I was in ***********.
Q.	********** is an acronym.  Can you tell us the long form for those abbreviations?
A.	I don't know it.  I only know that ****************************************************, and, besides, students used to hold their meetings at the ************
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was it an official building?
THE WITNESS:
At the **************************************************, but I'm not aware if that building belonged to the state: that I'm not aware of.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, all of the people who stayed in the ********** were Hutus; were they not?
A.	I cannot know the ethnic backgrounds of all of those who were at that centre.  But what I know is that the people that I knew who were there were Hutu.  

There was another employee, another ******************, whose ethnic background I do not know, and who ensured protection -- or kept watch of the hospital.
Q.	Now, when you left the hospital, the hospital was operational; was it not?  I mean, people were being treated; refugees were being treated there?
A.	By the time I left the hospital, everything was going on as usual at the hospital.
Q.	But the nurses and doctors who remained there were all Tutsi; were they not?
A.	The nurses and the other employees who remained at the hospital were Tutsi, but there was no medical doctor at the time.  There were only three doctors, two of whom had left, and a third one was Dr. Serod (phonetic) and he was with us.
Q.	Witness, why didn't you go with some of the Tutsi ***************** centre?
A.	When a person is seeking refuge he is the one who chooses his place of refuge.  We left Mugonero because there was some suspicion between ***************************.  Accordingly, when we left the hospital to take refuge at Gishyita, we were not with **************************.  It was, therefore, necessary for us to go by ourselves because we -- there was no longer any collaboration with **** *************

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How many families took refuge in the ************? 
THE WITNESS:
About four families.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Those four families were all Hutu; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were Hutu families with the exception of the single individual I mentioned to you.  I cannot say if he was a Tutsi or Hutu since one of his parents was white. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Then he was Twa.
THE WITNESS:
I won't be able to say.  I don't know if he was Twa.
MR. KAPAYA:
He was other.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He was other.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know the ethnic group that is indicated in his identity card.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, you were asked about the whereabouts of four or six women.  And you said that they were either in Kigali, in Nyakanami (phonetic) or Butare.  Now, between -- let me take you -- let me take you through each one of them. 

Now, did you go to Kigali between the 13th and the 16th of April to see whether Maria Mukeshimana was where you said she was?  Did you or did you not go?  Just tell me simply.
A.	I did not go to Kigali to ascertain as to where she was.  But that wasn't within my prerogatives; that wasn't within my briefs.  But in any case, what I know is that before I left Mugonero on the 12th, she was in Kigali. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before, you said "before"?
THE WITNESS:
I said that before I left the hospital on the 12th, that girl was not in Mugonero.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was not in Mugonero; not that she was in Kigali.  She could have been in Burundi or Nairobi.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, we have had witnesses here who told us that on the 13th or 14th, one of the two dates, Muhimana took Maria and Marianna to his residence in Gishyita.  They spent the night there and they came back the following day.  You were -- no, you were not at the hospital to see whether or not Muhimana took those girls on those two days; were you?
A.	You are correct.  On the 13th I wasn't in the hospital.  But up -- but on the 12th, right through to the evening I was there, but I didn't see those two girls in the hospital.  But I cannot know what happened after the 12th.
Q.	Yeah, because you were also not at Muhimana's residence to see whether or not those girls actually were there?
A.	I wasn't in Muhimana's house.
Q.	Likewise, you didn't go to Butare to see whether Joyce Mukasine was there between the 13th and the 16th; did you?
A.	I did not go to Butare during those dates, but what I can tell you is that I never learned that during those dates they came back.  Besides, the witness who appeared here, I don't know if the said witness had gone to Kigali or to Butare to know whether they were there.
Q.	Right.  Now, Witness, in times of trouble is it not normal for people to go back to where they come from?  Just a common-sense question.
A.	That is normal.  It would depend on the opportunity that you may have of trouble, because I remember in 1994 when we went into exile there were people who were working at the border post, and those people could not return to Mugonero.  But they choose to cross the borders in order to go to the other side of the border -- I mean, to the other countries.  So it depends on the circumstances under which you find yourself.
Q.	And it wouldn't be abnormal for these young ladies to go back to your place -- their places of origin following the insecurity that came about in consequence of the death of the president?  It would be normal; wouldn't it?
A.	That would not be surprising.  But I know that in -- by the time I left Mugonero I had not heard that the young girls had returned.
Q.	Witness, where is your father now?
A.	I can give you the answer in writing, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. KAPAYA:
Kindly, with leave, Your Honour, I would ask them -- request the registry to supply the necessary paper for the request. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And where is Pastor Jacques Ushizimpumu?
A.	Pastor Jacques -- I have no information about Pastor Jacques Ushizimpumu.
Q.	All right.  Let me move to a slightly different area. 

Witness, you testified --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us enter this document as an exhibit.  This will be entered as Exhibit P -- this document is entered as Exhibit P.  82.
	(Exhibit No. P. 82 admitted)
MR. KAPAYA:
As indicating the location of the  -- it is indicating the location of where the father of the witness is.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, you testified that there was one operating table in the Mugonero complex, the Mugonero hospital.  My question is, were there recovery rooms in the operating wing?  Were there any recovery rooms?
A.	The patients who had just been operated were taken directly to rooms, wards that were set aside for this.  These were wards for people who had just undergone operations. 
Q.	And these rooms were located within the basement, within the surgical ward; were they not?
A.	Yes.  These wards were in the basement, but they were set somewhat aside, or apart.  However, they were quite close to the normal wards.
Q.	And each of these rooms had a bed; is there not?
A.	Yes, most of these wards had beds; especially, intensive care wards had two beds, but other rooms or wards had more beds.
Q.	And actually, I mean, after you had returned to Mugonero in May, the beds -- you found that the beds were not looted?  They were still there; weren't they?
A.	When I returned to Mugonero, the beds were still there but the mattresses and other equipment had been looted.
Q.	Witness, while you were at the *********************, did any communal authorities -- by that I mean Sikubwabo, Mika, your conseiller, did you see them there?  Did they come to visit you?
A.	I did not see them at this place.  It is possible that they came there in my absence because I used to go out for walks.
Q.	So, if someone says that Sikubwabo or Mika or some other guy from the communal office came to see you at --  between the 16th -- or on the 16th, he would be lying, wouldn't he?
A.	I cannot answer this question because I did not see them, myself.  If I say that that person would be lying, it would be that I, myself, who am the lier because I didn't see them.
Q.	Witness, let's talk about -- a little bit about Muhimana now.  When did you know Muhimana, first?
A.	I knew Muhimana for the first time in 1992 when I began ************.
Q.	Under what circumstances did you meet him?
A.	He met me in the **********************.  I was having a drink with **************.  Mika found us where we were sitting.  He was coming to buy something to drink.  And the *************who were with us introduced him to me.  That is how I knew him for the first time.
Q.	Now, he was not conseiller of your secteur; was he?
A.	Yes, you are right.
Q.	Who was the conseiller for Ngoma secteur in '94?
A.	It was a man called Abel Bahundi.
Q.	What was his ethnic group; do you know?
A.	He was Hutu.
Q.	Do you know where he is now?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Now, while you were at the CCDF in Gishyita on the 16th, do you know what happened at Mugonero?  Did you come to learn what happened in Mugonero complex?
A.	I learned of it, also I heard screams coming from Mugonero on that 16th.  So, I heard about the events that had taken place there.  And I, myself, could hear the screams.  And it is the people who came from Mugonero who told us about these events.
Q.	Now, what happened?  Can you tell us what happened?
A.	Between 10:00 and midday, there were many screams coming from Mugonero.  And in the evening we saw people passing by who were carrying equipment of the Mugonero hospital.
Q.	Now, do you know -- did you learn who -- who took part -- who participated in the attack in the hospital?
A.	I heard that these were people who had come from Cyangugu and other people coming from Rubengera, and yet others came from the north of the country.

	1615H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Did you hear that the people who were responsible for attacking the hospital were Interahamwe?  Did you hear that? 
A.	I heard of it.
Q.	Did you hear that one of the leaders responsible for the attacks was Obed Ruzindana?
A.	I didn't hear about it.
Q.	Did you hear that the other person who took part was Charles Sikubwabo? 
A.	I didn't hear about it.
Q.	And the others were Pastor Elizaphan and Gérard Ntakirutimana; did you hear that? 
A.	No.
Q.	And that Mika Muhimana was also amongst them; did you hear that?
A.	I didn't hear that.
Q.	You testified in the Ntakirutimana case as a Defence witness, did you not?
A.	Yes, I did give testimony in this case.
Q.	And you were given the pseudonym 32, were you not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And the essence of your testimony was that you were with ********************** from the 16th of April through June 30th at the CCDF and at the hospital; wasn't that the case?
A.	I don't think I heard the dates that you mentioned clearly.
Q.	Okay, to which did you testify that you were with ****************************** were with you?  Which dates did you testify to?
A.	I stated that I was with them from the 16th in Gishyita.  We left Gishyita at the end of this month and we left Mugonero between the 15th and the 20th of July 1994.
Q.	Where is ******************* now?  Do you know where they are? 
A.	I think you are in a better position to answer that question. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are a better position to know.  You came here to testify for them.  I thought you would be interested to know where they are now.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are coming close to being unfair.
MR. KAPAYA:
I won't pursue that line of questioning any further, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Don't.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you. 

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Finally, Mr. Witness, did you know if anyone ever accepted responsibility for the attack on Mugonero complex on the 16th of April? 
A.	I do not know anyone who has admitted that these events took place.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  No further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kapaya. 

Mr. Witness, you testified that you -- yes, any re-examination?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in answering a question put to you by the Prosecutor, you mentioned the words "built for people who had just undergone surgical procedures and which were near the normal wards"; is that correct?
A.	That is correct, they were wards in which people who had just undergone surgical procedures were placed.  They were quite near to the wards where ordinary patients were kept.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned a while ago that, in your view, the surgical wing or the operating theatres are the same thing, and you indicated that there were two operating theatres.  May we therefore take it that it is these two wings that were called the surgery?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now you are going to help us.  The wards that were built for people who had just undergone surgical procedures, can we consider that they were part of the surgery?
A.	No, these wards were not in the surgery wing.  They were outside because you had to go back to the counter first where the other patients were received.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

Madam President, I have concluded my re-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Witness, you testified that you left the hospital on 12th of April and returned at the end of the month.  Therefore, you would not know what had happened in the hospital during that period; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
There are some things that you can learn through other people.  Questions were persistently put to me regarding whether I had learnt of things that happened during that period.  There are things that you can -- you can hear from people and there are things to which you are an eyewitness yourself.  So there are things that I heard from other people.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But personally, you would not know what happened in your absence.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you left the hospital on what date? 
THE WITNESS:
I left the hospital on the 12th.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On the 12th.  And you went where on the 12th? 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to answer this in writing.  Besides, I think you know where I want -- where I went.  I really prefer to put this in writing.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If I did know, I wouldn't ask you, but if you don't -- if you don't wish to tell me -- is it CCDF? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not immediately go to the CCDFP.  There is a family to whom I went.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When you testified in Ntakirutimana's case, what date did you tell them you left? 
THE WITNESS:
I told them that I had left the hospital on the evening, in the evening, after work, after 4:30 p.m.  I did not return to that place.  So I left the hospital --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You did not tell them --
THE WITNESS:
-- to go to this family.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You did not tell them that, "On the 16th  when I got up, my father came and told me that we had to go to Gishyita and he told us that the people had informed him that the hospital was going to be attacked"?  You didn't tell them that? 
THE WITNESS:
I remember saying that he came and told us that we should go to Gishyita on the 16th, in the morning, at about six, and that was because there were security problems in Mugonero.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And he told you that he had been informed the hospital was going to be attacked? 
THE WITNESS:
During my testimony I said that he had told us that we should go to Gishyita for security reasons and that rumours, persistent rumours, indicated that there would be an attack against the hospital.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So before you went on the morning on the 16th, you knew the hospital was going to be attacked; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Before we left -- I cannot say that I knew that it was going to happen because there were persistent rumours that said so.  If I were to say that I knew this for sure, it wouldn't be right.  In any case, I heard people say that the hospital would be attacked.  If I say that I knew, it would mean that I myself had planned the attack.  The verb "to know" is very complicated.  I'm telling you that I had learned that the hospital could be attacked.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were you invited to become one of the attackers? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was done.  For a long time, even after our departure from Gishyita, and even before, people asked me.  But when we returned to Mugonero, attacks continued in Bisesero and I did not agree.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, I'm asking you about the attack on the 16th.  Were you invited -- did Sikubwabo invite you to become part of the attackers? 
THE WITNESS:
Nobody asked me on that date.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When were you asked? 
THE WITNESS:
When I met bandits the day before our departure to Gishyita --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On the 15th --
THE WITNESS:
We were leaving the place where we were lodged -- yes, that was the 15th.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On the 15th you were invited to join the attack on the 16th? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  People threatened us by saying that we weren't helping them.  These bandits were saying that.  I believe I said so in my previous testimony.  We paid money to these bandits and they did not threaten us, and we returned to our lodging.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I think you are deliberately misunderstanding me.  I'm asking you, were you invited by the bandits, or whatever you call them, Bourgmestre Sikubwabo, to be one of those to attack the hospital, one of those thousands of people who attacked the hospital? 
THE WITNESS:
Sikubwabo never asked me because I did not meet him often.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who asked you? 
THE WITNESS:
In addition, he was a highly placed authority.  I explained to you that it is these thieves who I met who threatened me and the people who were with me.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Has any of the thieves got a name? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Would you like to write down --
THE WITNESS:
One of them was called Reuben.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Reuben.  And another one? 
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember the others. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters would be grateful if His Honour gave a space between his questions and the answers because both channels are occupied now. 
THE WITNESS:
I met them on the evening of the 15th. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where did you meet them? 
THE WITNESS:
I met them in the Kabahinyuza market square, quite close to where we were lodged.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And why did you refuse to join them? 

THE WITNESS:
Why instead would I have agreed to work with them in their macabre plan to kill people?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Well, they have asked you.  They must obviously have thought that you were one of their kind. 
THE WITNESS:
People are not the same, Your Honour.  People are different. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, did you inform anyone in authority about what the bandits had told you? 
THE WITNESS:
We were used to this kind of thing.  We used to meet such groups.  Some could frighten you.  So it was not necessary to report that to the authorities.  Even the authorities didn't have anything to say any further.  They were powerless.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Can Issa please give the witness Exhibit P. 2?  And open for him photograph 41, K6210.

Give him the coloured one. 

Witness, look at the photographs that you are being shown.  Look at photographs -- between photograph No. 41 to No. 48, slowly and carefully.  

You have seen?  Tell me when you have seen. 
THE WITNESS:
From which photograph to which did you say I should look? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Look from photograph No. 42 to No. 48. Have you looked at them? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, are you able to identify the places depicted in those photographs?  Do you recognise them? 
THE WITNESS:
It is somewhat difficult.  However, for instance, photograph No. 45 --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes.  You have never seen that place? 
THE WITNESS:
Sorry, sorry.  I mean photograph No. 43 instead.  I can see -- no, I cannot tell, given the way the photographs are arranged.  I have the feeling there were some changes.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You don't recognise any of that part, any of those photographs? 
THE WITNESS:
I have the impression that I can recognise photograph No. 47.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No. 47.
THE WITNESS:
Which is the corridor of the basement.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You can recognise photograph No. 47.  What about 48? 
THE WITNESS:
No, the photographs were not properly taken.  It is not easy to recognise this location.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It's not easy to recognise this location.  Let's look at photograph -- go now to photograph No. -- let's go to photograph No. 4; 4.  Are you able to recognise that? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not recognise this location.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You don't recognise that location?
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, you are -- you returned to the hospital at the end of April ; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And *************************? 
THE WITNESS:
Do you mean after we returned there? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
After you returned at the beginning of May, for how long ****************************************** ****************? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe we left the hospital between the 15th and the 20th of July.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Of July.  So during the period beginning of May to about the 15th of July, ************************** *************************? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, could you repeat your question? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Between the beginning of May and 15th of July, ************************? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, *********************.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How far is Mugonero hospital from Gishyita centre? 
THE WITNESS:
It all depends on the speed with which you walk, but you cannot cover that distance in more than 50 minutes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How far? 
THE WITNESS:
The distance is roughly five to seven kilometres.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you go to Gishyita centre yourself during that period?  Did you visit the centre? 
THE WITNESS:
I went there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How many times?  Many or few or -- ? 
THE WITNESS:
I went there often.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you on any occasion encounter Mika?
THE WITNESS:
During what period, please? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
May --
THE WITNESS:
Before 1994? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry? 
THE WITNESS:
During what period --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Beginning of May 1994 to 15th July 1994. 
THE WITNESS:
During that period, I did not go to Gishyita often because I was working. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So does that answer my question?  Did you, on the one occasion or the few occasions you went, encounter Mr. Mika Muhimana? 
THE WITNESS:
During that period when people resumed work, I did not go to Gishyita.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
At all? 
THE WITNESS:
Not at all.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony.  We wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are free to go now. 
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please call in the next witness. Professor, who is your next witness? 
MR. SONGA:
The next witness is NM6, and on the list it is No. 34.

Do you see a sheet of paper in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.

Can you read the information contained therein?

Yes.

Don't read it out loud.  Did you confirm that the information is in respect of your personal particulars?

WITNESS NM6,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Witness, we'll put a few questions to you regarding the events in Rwanda in 1994.  Under what circumstances did you learn of President Habyarimana's death?
A.	I learnt of President Habyarimana's death over RTLM Radio.  That is on the 6th of April 1994 at 8:30 p.m.
Q.	How did you spend the day after President Habyarimana's death?  What were your activities the day after President Habyarimana's death?
A.	The day after President Habyarimana's death, there were no problems where I was on that day.  Problems cropped up the following day.  Unless I am mistaken, it was a Thursday.  And on the Friday, there were insecurity problems.  On that day, soldiers, six soldiers, came.  They wrought havoc in the institution where I was.  I had left the house where I was working.  I was with other employees and students.  On that day, no one was killed.  I witnessed the beating of one person who sustained fractures.  That is all I can say regarding the events on that day.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In April 1994, did you know a man called Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	Can you tell the Court the circumstances under which you knew him?
A.	I had known Mika Muhimana since childhood, while I was in the primary school.  I saw him again in 1994.  Since 1980, I only saw him again in 1994 when I left where I was working to go to my commune of origin to get administrative documents.
Q.	We shall try to be more precise, Witness, when we answer the next question.  In April 1994, did you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	I saw him.  I saw him 15 times; that is, from the 8th up until the 27th, the 27th of April.
Q.	And in May, did you see him?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you keep a record of meetings with Muhimana in April, the month of April? 
THE WITNESS:
Excuse me, I did not see Mika Muhimana in April.  I instead saw him in May, but the dates remain the same.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Didn't you say that you saw Mika Muhimana for 15 times from 8th April 'til 27th April? 
THE WITNESS:
It was instead in the month of May.  I had just said that I was mistaken.  I have just said that I was mistaken.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
May -- from 8th May to 27th of May (sic) you saw him 15 times; is that what you are saying? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The presiding Judge asked you a question; you didn't reply.  Did you keep a record of your meetings with him in May? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not keep a record of those meetings because I had no reason to do so.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
	Did you see him at one place or several places? 

THE WITNESS:
On the 8th of May, I went to get administrative documents at the commune office; namely, the identity card, the birth certificate, a certificate of good conduct and a certificate of identification.  And when I went to the commune, I saw him.  I saw him opposite his house at about twelve noon when I came back for the break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So on the 8th you met him to get -- to collect a certificate from Mika, and this was your first meeting? 
THE WITNESS:
I went to get the certificates from the commune office, and at midday I went for break.  I went to see a man called Jean Nziraseka (phonetic).  I greeted him, and I saw Mika in front of his door.  I recognised him and I greeted him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That was the first time? 
THE WITNESS:
This was the first time.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Tell us the other 14.  Go on to the second time. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not recall all the occasions on which I saw him, but I can state the important occasions when I saw him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you already said --
THE WITNESS:
I saw him the second time on the 13th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The 13th of May?
THE WITNESS:
What I mean is that from the 8th up until the 27th, I saw him on at least 15 occasions.  I did not take note of the specific dates on which I saw him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you were very specific about the number of meetings, right? 
THE WITNESS:
I am not entirely sure.  There are occasions when I saw him and I remember those occasions very well, but there are times when I only make estimates.  There are some dates I recall the hours or the time that I saw him.  I remember those dates because those dates ring a bell.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thirteenth of May is one of those dates? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is a particular date as far as I am concerned.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Okay.  Which are the others that you remember?
 THE WITNESS:
The 25th, the 25th of May, and the 27th of May.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What other dates ring a bell?  What other dates ring a bell? 
THE WITNESS:
Those are the dates I have just mentioned.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So there are four dates that ring a bell ...(overlapping microphones)
THE WITNESS:
The 9th. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The 9th is one of them? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the 9th is one of those dates.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So if I can just recap your evidence so that I make sure that I understand you, is the days that ring a bell out of the 15 times you saw him, the not-less-than-15 times that you saw him, 8th rings a bell, 13th rings a bell -- 9th rings a bell -- 13th rings a bell, 25th rings a bell and 27th rings a bell.  Is there any other date which rings a bell? 
THE WITNESS:
The dates that ring a bell are the 9th, the 13th, the 27th.  That is four dates.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Twenty-fifth is out now?  And 8th?  What is the bell rung by the 13th?  What does it remind you of?
THE WITNESS:
I would like to go through those dates again.  It was the 9th, the 13th, the 25th, and the 27th. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Tell us what -- tell us what the 13th rings a bell about. 
THE WITNESS:
It was on that date that I received the identity card that I have been looking for since the 9th.  That was the day I received the much-expected card. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
All right.  Twenty-fifth.

THE WITNESS:
On the 25th I received other documents I had been looking for, namely, the birth certificate, the good conduct certificate, as well as the complete identification certificate.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That was on the 25th; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Okay, now 22nd -- 27th. 
THE WITNESS:
I remember that date because that was the last day I saw him. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where did you see him on that last day? 
THE WITNESS:
On the last day I saw him in front of Senani's  bar at the commercial centre, very close to the commune, the commune office.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On the 9th of May, where did you see him? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw him in front of his house, as I stated earlier. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, why did you --
THE WITNESS:
I saw him in front of his door.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why did you note the 9th?  What bell did it ring? 
THE WITNESS:
It was on that date that I saw him again after so many years when I hadn't seen him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And now -- these are the dates when -- which don't ring a bell.  These are the 14 or 10 or so occasions.  Where did you see him?
THE WITNESS:
Each time I left my house to go to the commune office.  I used to see him at the commercial centre where he was.  At times he was in his house.  At other times he was in a cooperative or in Senani's bar.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did you meet him?  It was 8 or 9?  When did you meet him for the first time? 
THE WITNESS:
When I saw him for the first time, it was during the daytime.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What date it was?  It was 8th May or 9th May? 
THE WITNESS:
It was on the 9th.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did you meet him in June or July or August? 
THE WITNESS:
As I have told you, I only saw him in the month of May.  I never saw him again.  I saw him on the dates that I have mentioned. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And you did not meet him on 8th, as you said earlier on? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not see him on the 8th because this is the date on which I left my home.  Therefore, I saw him from the 9th to the 27th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, it is over five so we will continue with your evidence-in-chief on Monday, Inshallah.

Mr. Witness, we are still continuing with your --
MR. SONGA:
I beg your pardon, Madam President.  I just wish to ask for two or three minutes to give you an update on the witness list. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we had planned for this week that we would have the witnesses that we have heard so far, in addition to the current witness and which should have been followed by DEY -- DY and DW.  These are the witnesses that are currently here in Arusha for this week.  In the meantime, and taking account -- and the need to take account of the judicial calendar on the one hand, and on the other hand to enable the Accused to give testimony; Witness DW will no longer appear.  I have been told that Witness DY is unwell.  It is he who should normally have been giving testimony after NM6. 

The victims and witness protection section has informed us that Witness 30 and 31, who are respectively DR1 and DR2, no longer wish to appear in Arusha. 

Madam President, this is our current situation in regard to the witness list.  I wish to inform the Chamber about this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How many witnesses are remaining, including Mika? 
MR. SONGA:
Apart from Mika -- apart from Mika and if we set aside those who are here today, especially DY and DW, if we don't include those, we expect that seven witnesses will appear next week -- eight, I beg your pardon.  Eight.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Apart from Mika? 
MR. SONGA:
Apart from Mika, yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Including the present one who is in the witness box? 
MR. SONGA:
No, not including the one who is in the box and not including DY, who is unwell. That is the situation, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Witness, we are still continuing with your evidence.  You are under oath and please do not communicate your evidence or the proceedings of this Court with anyone outside the court.  We will adjourn and resume Monday morning at nine.
