MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session now.  

The appearances for the Prosecution are the same as yesterday? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, members of the Defence.  The appearances are as yesterday, yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The composition of the Defence team remains the same.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Before we proceed with this witness, Professor, may we ask you how many witnesses are remaining. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  In principle, we still have three witnesses, DU, DK, and DH.  But concerning DH, we have just learned that he is seriously ill, so we don't know how things will evolve. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you know today is the second last trial day?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, I am aware of that, and you will have noticed that the examinations-in-chief rarely go beyond 30 minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are grateful for that, Professor.  Okay.  Then we go ahead with this witness.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are continuing with your cross-examination.  We remind you of the oath you have taken to speak the truth.  

Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor for the cross-examination. 
WITNESS DT
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good morning, Witness DT.
A.	Good morning.
MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Issa, could you kindly place Exhibit D. 100 before the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Exhibit? 
MR. KAPAYA:
D. 100. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is the place that you said the killings took place on the 9th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, in which secteur and cellule is that place?
A.	If I can be availed of a pen, I can write down the names on a piece of paper.
Q.	Witness, but nobody has seen that place.  How would that reveal your identity?  
MR. KAPAYA:
I don't know.  I'm in the Court's hands, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give him a piece of paper. 
THE WITNESS:
I am done.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, how far was the secteur you mentioned -- you wrote on that piece of paper from your -- how far was the cellule you have mentioned on that piece of paper from your cellule of residence?  How far was it?
A.	The distance is relatively long because the two cellules are found in the same secteur.
Q.	How long is it?  Is it a kilometre away?  Is it a distance you can cover in 15, 20 minutes, an hour?
A.	Somebody moving slowly would cover the distance in 30 minutes, but that is only an estimate that I am giving you.
Q.	You also mentioned a string of people who you say participated in the killings.  Can you tell us where those killers -- can you tell us from which cellule and secteur those killers came from?
A.	Those killers originated from that secteur, save for some who came from a neighbouring secteur, but a good majority of the killers were natives from that secteur.
Q.	Were you present at that location when the killings were taking place?
A.	Yes, I was there.
Q.	Did you participate in the killings?
A.	I did not participate in the killing, but I was a mere spectator.
Q.	Did you go there armed?
A.	No, I had no weapon.
Q.	Now, while you were there killing those victims, the Tutsi, why were those killers killing them?
A.	I was with the killers who attacked the Tutsi, since it had been said that in that cellule there were people who wanted to infiltrate it.  So we went to find out about the situation and see how those people were going to infiltrate the cellule, and that's the reason wherefore I went there.
Q.	What do you mean by infiltrate?
A.	What I mean is that those people had intention of attacking the cellule and to cause harm to the inhabitants of the cellule.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And knowing that, you went --
THE WITNESS:
And by those acts they would be threatening their security.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And knowing that they were coming to infiltrate the cellule, you went there to spectate, not to kill? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not to fight? 
THE WITNESS:
We did not have the intention of fighting.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You wanted to just talk to them or look at them or do what? 
THE WITNESS:
Our intention was to catch them, to stop them from entering into the cellule, but since we didn't have the intention of fighting, we did not have weapons, but I am speaking for myself, of course.  Personally, I wasn't armed.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What about the other people? 
THE WITNESS:
Amongst the other persons who were with me were some that were armed, but others weren't.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How many weren't armed? 

THE WITNESS:
There were very many of us, I couldn't count all of us.  There were very many of us.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And all of you were going to catch the infiltrators, the armed infiltrators? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we told ourselves, "Let us go and see what the situation looks like."
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, how many Tutsis were killed at that location that day?
A.	I think that seven persons were killed there.
MR. KAPAYA:
Now, Mr. Issa, could you kindly place Exhibits 98 and 99 before the witness.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, have you seen the two names?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, why did you accompany the person mentioned on Exhibits D. 98 and D. 99 to the residence of ******************?  What was the reason that took you there?
A.	I accompanied them because the person whose name is on D. 90 had requested me to do so.
Q.	Did you perform any role when you reached the residence of *********?
A.	I played no role except to accompany the persons.
Q.	Was there some ceremony of some sort at ***************'s place that night or on a subsequent day?
A.	No, there was no ceremony as such.  People just conversed.
Q.	You are not being very clear, Mr. Witness.  Why did the two people go to *************?
A.	I explained to you that those persons asked me to accompany them there.  In other words, they had the intention, as far as I am concerned, to only accompany them because they had asked me to do so, and that is what I am trying to explain to you.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, the question is, what was the purpose of the visit?  Were you told what you were going to do there or what was going to be done at the place?
THE WITNESS:
The person whose name you have on the document, D. 98, explained it to me, and I accepted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was she related to you? 
THE WITNESS:
The relationship with the person with document D. 98? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.

THE WITNESS:
Is that what you are referring to? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there is a family relationship between that person and myself.
JUDGE SHORT:
What was the explanation about the purpose of the visit?  That was my question. 
THE WITNESS:
The person explained to me that she was accompanying her sister-in-law to her husband's home.  He was accompanying the bride.  Accordingly, I accepted because I felt that if that person was asking me to come along with him, their plan must have already been set, and I knew that it was his sister-in-law that he was giving away in marriage.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you were there throughout the meeting? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
And all that took place is that you all sat around and had a conversation and that's it, nothing else took place? 
THE WITNESS:
Nothing happened further.  After the wedding, we returned -- after the ceremony.  Nothing else happened. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What ceremony?  What?  Can you describe the ceremony you are talking about?  What exactly -- how did this ceremony take place?  How did it take place?  When you talk about ceremony, what do you mean? 
THE WITNESS:
When I talk about a ceremony, what I mean is that the event -- I'm talking about the event and the trip that we made, that we made right to its conclusion. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Go ahead.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, do you see *********** pay dowry to the person on D. 98?
A.	I didn't see him handing over any dowry to that person.
Q.	Was there a celebration, co-relations, women and men singing, merry-making at **********'s place?
A.	There wasn't singing.  Things were rather calm.  There weren't many people.  There wasn't dancing; there wasn't singing.  People were holding conversations in serenity.
Q.	Witness, had you known the person on D. 99, the lady on D. 99, before that day?
A.	I hadn't seen the person yet.
Q.	Are you aware that that person has testified before this Tribunal as a Prosecution witness?
A.	Are you referring to the person whose name is on document D. 99? 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	No, I am not aware of that.
Q.	Haven't you heard that this witness was captured by Mika and *************** in Bisesero area on or around the 22nd of April?  Have you heard that? 
A.	I never heard of that.
Q.	And the reason you probably went to ************** was to go and guard this woman because she was staying there to let ****************go on his escapades in Bisesero, went there to guard this woman so that she did not escape.
A.	No.  After the day on which we accompanied her, I never went there again.  Besides, I am not ************'s neighbour.
Q.	In which secteur and cellule did *********** live?
A.	If it is necessary, I can write it down on a piece of paper.
Q.	******** is not a protected witness, you can just say it through the loudspeaker -- microphone. 
A.	Thank you.  He resides in the Rwaramba cellule.
Q.	How far is that cellule from your cellule of residence?
A.	There is a great distance, not very long because he lives right in the middle of his cellule and I live just on the edge of my cellule.  Between the two places, there is a fairly long distance.  So he's not my neighbour.  So Rwaramba is R-W-A-R-A-M-B-A, Rwaramba.
Q.	Very well. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Issa, could you place D. 97 before the witness.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, would you focus on the part where your occupation is listed for the year 1994.  Did you hold any other occupation in '94, apart from cultivation?
A.	I cannot see what you are indicating to me.
Q.	Witness, there is a column on D. 97 which talks about -- in which you indicated your occupation or employment in 1994.  Here, we read "cultivator" or "peasant".  My question is this:  Did you hold any other occupation apart from cultivation in 1994?
A.	Actually, for us, when a person performs tasks for which he does not receive remuneration, this person is considered as a farmer.  I did not have work for which I received remuneration.  That is why I said that I was a farmer.
Q.	What is the work that you did -- that you did not receive remuneration?
A.	I would say that I was an *********************.  When we are asked what we do, we say that we are farmers because we do not receive a salary for this work.  So I shall not avoid telling you.  If you consider that to be an occupation, then perhaps you -- it is your place to explain it to me.  However, that is how things were.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were a ***************, were you not?
A.	No.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let the witness write what he was. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the information I have is that he was ************.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He says no, so let him write what it is he was doing for which he was not getting remuneration but which made him an ************, because he said he was an *************.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it's okay. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Write your position, your *********** which you said you were not being paid for.

That's a long story which has to be translated. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, your position didn't have a title?  Did you hear my question?  The position you held, did it not have a title or designation? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that I was a farmer but that ************************************************************* and not an ****************************.  In my view, my occupation was farming.  But the work that I did as a *********************** did not earn me anything. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did **************** have a name?  I'm not asking you to mention it, but if it had a name, then if you haven't put the name on the paper, you should put the name of ************** name on the paper.
THE WITNESS:
I was ******************.  I do not know exactly what I was in charge of. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And on the piece of paper the witness has written as follows.  "I would like to say that the work that I was doing in *********************** did not earn me a salary at the end of the month.  Instead, I was a farmer.  That is what I wish to explain to you." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please go ahead. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, do you recall having been interviewed by the prosecutor of Kibuye on the ***********?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document has not been translated.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, it has been translated on record. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
On record, yes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can I get a response to my question, Mr. Witness?
A.	(No response)
Q.	Did you say yes? 
A.	Ask me questions, I will answer.  If you could repeat your question; I no longer remember what you asked me.
Q.	I asked you whether on the *************** the Kibuye prosecutor, 
	Mr. Papias Habinshuti, interviewed you. 
A.	I remember that I met a deputy prosecutor.  I no longer remember on what date I met him, but I know that the deputy prosecutor put questions to me.
Q.	I'll show you a document and ask you whether it rings a bell.  Kindly refer to the Kinyarwanda version of that document and tell me whether you recognise that, that interview. 
A.	All right.
Q.	Have you seen the document, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Since I cannot read very easily, I cannot know what is contained in this document.  I do not read very well. 
Q.	There is a Kinyarwanda version, Mr. Witness.  I believe you can -- you have been to school, you can read Kinyarwanda at least. 
A.	You might have noticed that I write with difficulty also.  Reading is even more difficult.  If someone can read this document to me, then it might be useful. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you telling us that you can write but you can't read? 
THE WITNESS:
You also notice that I write with difficulty.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you do write. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
May the document be read through the interpreter.

MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, can you give the copy to the interpreter, the copy of the Kinyarwanda version. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, do you wish the interpreters to read the entire document to the witness or do you just wish portions of the document to be read, asks the Kinyarwanda interpreter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, what do you wish to be read?
MR. KAPAYA:
I think he should read the first part and ask the witness whether he recalls the opening paragraph, without reading the name of the witness, of course, and ask him whether he recalls.  And if he doesn't, then we may have to go to the contents in some of the questions to see whether he can recall them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, can you --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Maybe you should start by asking the witness whether he remembers thumbprinting a document.  This is thumb-printed, which means somebody who couldn't write was asked to make a thumbprint.  He should be able to remember that.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, following the interview with the deputy prosecutor at Kibuye, did he ask you to sign or thumbprint the contents of your interview?
A.	I have always used a thumbprint on my statements.
Q.	I am talking about the particular interview you had with the prosecutor of Kibuye on the **************  Did you thumbprint that document?
A.	I am asking you instead to read it to me, the contents of this document, in closed session.  If I realise that this is my statement, then I will answer your question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the document be read to the witness without mentioning his name.  Yes, Mr. Interpreter, please go ahead.  Let the interpreter come to the witness box and explain the document, translate the document to -- read the document to the witness.  

Mr. Kapaya, it's a long document, and reading the whole document will take some time.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.

JUDGE SHORT:
If the witness gets to a point where he recognises the document, then Mr. Kapaya can pose his questions. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Actually, I only have one item to ask. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So there is no need for the interpreter to read through the entire document.  

Witness, do you recognise this as your -- the questions that you were asked and the answers you gave from what you have read so far?
THE WITNESS:
The interpreter has just read a few words to me, but I didn't understand beforehand.  Now I understand that this is a statement that I made when I was in the communal jail.  I have just remembered the person who put the questions to me.  I have already perused the document, so if you put questions to me now, I shall be able to answer them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter, please resume your seat. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, I refer you to the thirteenth question in this interview.  There is a question and answer, question and answer.  Now the thirteenth question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How would he know what is the thirteenth question?
MR. KAPAYA:
By counting from question one, two, three, four, five.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it on the first or second page?
MR. KAPAYA:
In the English translation, it is on the second page.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In the Kinyarwanda version. 
THE WITNESS:
Do you wish me just to count the questions, Mr. Prosecutor? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Let me read you the question.  That question reads as follows:  "At that time, what was your position ******************?"  Answer --
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, hold on.  If you read this answer into the record, it will disclose his identity.  So ask him, you know -- let the interpreter come and tell him in the box what his answer was, and then you can ask him whether that was not what he said.  We don't want to disclose his identity. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Actually, I didn't want to read the whole response, Your Honour.  I just want to note what is said there.  But maybe the interpreter can come and assist us.
JUDGE SHORT:
Let the interpreter come and read the answer to him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we ask the interpreter to come to the witness box once again. 

	Actually, the second page.  In the middle of the second page. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Halfway down, Mr. Kapaya.  Going by your counting is question number one, two, three, four, five, six from bottom, on second page.  That's the question, and the answer is the one below it.  You found it? 
MR. KAPAYA:
I found it, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, please read out the question and answer to the witness. 
	
	Thank you, Mr. Interpreter. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  I'll explain things to you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, hold on.  

Mr. Kapaya, proceed with your question.
THE WITNESS:
I'll explain things to you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, is that not the response you gave when you were asked the position you held in ** *********** at that time, during the war?
A.	When I gave that answer, I explained that after the war I was ******, but before the war, I had never served as **********. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, first of all, confirm whether you gave that answer, and then you can give your explanation later.  Was that the question that you were asked and was that the answer that you gave at the time?  Answer yes or no, and then you can give your explanation after that. 
THE WITNESS:
If you look a little towards the top, you will notice the reason why that question was put to me.  Please look at the previous question.  You'll find that there is no relationship with the period prior to the war.  That question is instead with regard to the period after the war.  What I mean is that after the war --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When did you become ***************, Witness?  What year? 
THE WITNESS:
It is after the war.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What year? 
THE WITNESS:
In ******************. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on. 
MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Let me move to another area.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, do you know a person by the name of Ntoranyi, Eliezer?
A.	Did you say Eliezer? 
Q.	Yes, Ntoranyi, N-T-O-R-A-N-Y-I, Eliezer.
A.	The person I know is, instead, Ntoranyi, Elizar, Ntoranyi, Elizar. 
Q.	I am referring to the same person.  Where did he live in April '94, April, May, '94?
A.	He lived in the same cellule as myself.
Q.	Is it true that he was killed during the war?
A.	Yes, he was killed.
Q.	Can you tell us how he was killed?
A.	I can tell you, but I made an application which has not been determined. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which application? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that in order to answer such questions, and I would like to do so, I would rather do so in a closed session, and my request was not granted. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)...disclose your identity or put you at risk?
THE WITNESS:
Regarding the question you put to me on that person, I will answer it, but I would like you to grant my request so that I can speak freely. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us go into the closed session.  

Mr. Issa, please arrange for the closed session. 
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 14 to 21] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in closed session)

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the names that he just mentioned belong to -- are the names of a protected witness.  If that can be expunged from the transcript, that would be welcome.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The names may be expunged.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It can't be.  It cannot be expunged, Your Honour, because that is part of his evidence.  So he should find another way to deal with it.  If you expunge it from the record, then the evidence is incomplete.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The names will be kept under seal.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you've just mentioned a name, and to the best of your ability, please don't go further than that.  But then you say that xxx xxxxxx those xxx xxxxxxxx.  How old were the xxxxxxxx?

A.	I knew Mika in 1980.
Q.	You knew him in what capacity?
A.	He was a conseiller.
Q.	You gave the names of those who forced you to go and kill, and if somebody were to say that you forgot to mention Mika's name, how would you respond to that?
A.	You are saying if somebody told me what? 
Q.	That Mika was one of those who put you under duress to go and kill the children, how would you react to that?
A.	I never saw Mika and he gave me no orders.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, when did you say you knew Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
In 1980.
JUDGE SHORT:
How old were you then? 
THE WITNESS:
I was born in 1977.  Today I am 26 years of age.
JUDGE SHORT:
I said how old were you in 1980 when you knew Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
In 1980 I was 12 years old.  I was about 12 years old, if I can recall well. 
JUDGE SHORT:
1977 to 1980, that makes you 12 years? 
THE WITNESS:
Since things are not clear in my mind, I think that was my age, but I was still a child.  But I know that he was our conseiller.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any ties with Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	The fact -- is your having killed **************** the only crime for which you are in prison?
A.	Yes.  I didn't commit any other crimes.
Q.	And there are no other offences for which you are being accused?
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, this brings my examination-in-chief to a close.  And thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Songa. 

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor for cross-examination. 
MS. MADENGA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. DU.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	The person you are referring to as the xxxxxx of the xxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxx, let's refer to her as AX for purposes of the record, so that we don't jeopardise your security.  Do you understand?
A.	I didn't quite understand you.  Can you please repeat what you said.
Q.	In your evidence-in-chief, you told the Court that you xxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx belonging to a certain woman, so I am saying let's refer to this xxxxxx as AX. 
A.	Okay.
Q.	You xxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx belonging to AX and you also xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx; is that not so?
A.	Yes, but I did this along with people whose names I mentioned.  We committed the act together.  Besides, I was being issued orders.  I was still a kid.  I was therefore forced to do it.  I know what they did in that location.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let me get it clear.  You ********* and you killed AX.  Is that the correct understanding? 
MS. MADENGA:
No, ************, not AX.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
AX's ********.  Not the mother. 
THE WITNESS:
I xxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx of that mother and the xxxxxxx of that xxxxxx.  I xxxxxx the xxxxxxxx of the woman and her mother as well.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that one of the accomplices was one ************************************.  Did this person also --
A.	That is correct.
Q.	I want to know, this person, does he come from the same cellule with you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you assist me with this?  Can you confirm that ************** at one stage was working closely with *****************?
A.	I was not witness to their working together.
Q.	What was ************** occupation in 1994, do you know?
A.	I know that he was a farmer.
Q.	Do you know what ********** was doing, one of the accomplices?
A.	******** was a military man in the previous government.
Q.	And in that capacity he was also working closely with the leader -- ****************************** in ********************; is that not so?
A.	I wasn't witness to any working relationship whatsoever between those two persons.
Q.	Let's go to ***********, one of the killers, one of your group.  What was his occupation in 1994?
A.	He was also a farmer.
Q.	Do you know or you don't know that he was also working closely with **************** in 
*****************?
A.	I know nothing of it.
Q.	What was ************ doing in 1994?  What was his occupation?
A.	It was the same case for him.
Q.	The four persons you have mentioned as your accomplices were influential people in your cellule; is that not so?
A.	They were very influential.
Q.	The reason why you followed their orders; is that not so?
A.	They coerced me and I yielded to their coercion.  After xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx and the xxxxxx of the xxxxx I talked about, I got scared and I returned home.  And that group continued on its way and I don't know where they went.
Q.	The accomplices were getting their orders from the conseiller of Gishyita; is that not so?
A.	No.
Q.	And among the orders, they were supposed to recruit people from the population, civilians, Hutus, who would go and kill Tutsis; is that not so?
A.	Even the Hutu who didn't speak the same language as themselves were killed.  Besides, the authorities had no say any more during that period.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You said your accomplices were not receiving their orders from the conseiller? 
THE WITNESS:
No, the conseiller never issued any orders or instructions to them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were receiving from who? 
THE WITNESS:
It is the bourgmestre of Gishyita who gave the orders.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not the conseiller.
THE WITNESS:
He is the one who used to bring them.  But the conseiller wasn't part of that group.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were you present with them when they got their orders from the bourgmestre? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I wasn't with them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were not present.  How then did you know that they did not get orders from the conseiller?
THE WITNESS:
That is what they themselves were saying.  The conseiller never gave any orders.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You say the conseiller never gave them orders.  Did you ask them?  Did you ask them who gave them orders? 
THE WITNESS:
It is the bourgmestre at that time who was leading.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you --
THE WITNESS:
All those things.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, did you ask all your conspirators who it is was giving them orders? 
THE WITNESS:
It is the bourgmestre who gave them the orders or they themselves took the decisions themselves because they were independent.  They used to take initiative themselves.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How did you know it was the bourgmestre who gave them orders? 
THE WITNESS:
They themselves used to say so.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	You xxxxxx AX's xxxxxxxx because their father was Tutsi and they were regarded as Tutsi; is that not so?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You also xxxxxx AX's xxxxxx because she was Tutsi, was she not?
A.	She was Tutsi.
Q.	You said the Hutus were also killed.  Did you personally kill any Hutu?
A.	No.
Q.	Among the accomplices, do you remember a man called Burabyo, spelt B-U-R-A-B-Y-O?  Was he one of the killers?
A.	Did you say Burabyo?  Yes, from time to time, he was with that group.
Q.	Burabyo used to work in the secteur office with Mika; is that not so?
A.	No.
Q.	Let's go ahead and look at a man called Mugonero.  Did you identify him as one of your killers?  Mugonero. 
A.	Yes, he was one of the killers.
Q.	Is it correct that Mugonero was a notorious Interahamwe and he hailed from Rwaramba cellule?  
	R-W-A-R-A-M-B-A.
A.	He used to go all over the place and he was known everywhere.
Q.	Do you know where Mugonero is as we speak now?
A.	He went into exile.
Q.	Did you ever hear from anyone that he married and wedded someone during the war?
A.	No, I didn't learn of anything like that.
Q.	Lastly, is it not correct that since you were recruited to be part of the killers, you were led by influential members from your cellule who were drawing those orders and instructions from Mika Muhimana?
A.	No, he didn't give them any instructions, nor did he issue any orders to them.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I have no further questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Madenga.  

Professor, do you have any re-examination?

testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Mr. Witness, in April 1994, did you know a person named Mika Muhimana?
A.	In April 1994, I knew a person named Mika Muhimana.
Q.	Can you tell the Court in what circumstances you got to know him?
A.	Mika Muhimana was conseiller of Gishyita secteur in Gishyita commune, Kibuye préfecture.  I also know that he married a woman who comes from our secteur.  That is how I know Mika.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When we look at your particulars, we realise that your current address is the prison.  Can you tell the Court why you are in prison?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I am in prison because of the crimes that were committed in Rwanda, specifically, the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity.  That is why I am detained in Gisovu prison.
Q.	Thank you.  What exact acts did you commit that caused you to be put in prison for genocide and crimes against humanity?
A.	Thank you.  I committed crimes in various secteurs.  I committed bloody crimes in my secteur; the same thing in the neighbouring secteur.  And I also committed crimes of blood in Bisesero.  That is why I am in prison.
Q.	All these crimes that you have referred to, did you confess to them to the Rwandan legal authorities?
A.	In fact, we committed horrible crimes.  We killed our brothers, our neighbours with whom we lived in peace and harmony.  But I have acknowledged these crimes that I have committed.  I have asked for forgiveness from everyone through the Rwandan government and all Rwandans, and I have even tried to ask for forgiveness from victims.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You named Bisesero as one of the places where you were.  How many times did you go to Bisesero?
A.	The truth be told, when we were going to Bisesero, it was upon the instructions or the leadership of someone else.  I went to Bisesero three times. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you remember the precise dates on which you went to Bisesero?
A.	Thank you.  Concerning Bisesero, I went there in May.  I do not remember the dates on which I went there.  I also went to Bisesero in June, but I cannot tell you the dates.  But I remember that in May, on the 20th and the 15th --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And witness corrects, between the 10th -- on the 10th and on the 15th of May. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to put to you a question still on this matter.  Do you know a place called Muyira?
A.	I hear that Muyira is in Bisesero.  Bisesero is a mountainous region, and in these high mountains it is difficult to know the various hills because I did not often go to Bisesero.  However, when we did go to Bisesero, it was to hunt our Tutsi brothers.  I do not know Muyira very well, but I know that this entire region was known as Bisesero. 
Q.	When you went to Bisesero for the first time, do you remember how many of you there were?
A.	Bisesero was a place where the secteurs of Gishyita commune met.  Also the natives of the prefectures next to us, that is Gisenyi and Kibuye as well as Cyangugu, came to join us. 
Q.	And who were the assailants, in your view?
A.	From what I know, it is we who killed people, but there were also people who gave us orders.
Q.	You talk of people who gave you orders.  Do you mean orders to launch attacks?
A.	I would have liked to give their names in a public hearing, but it's not very easy.  But I shall begin with the former bourgmestre, Charles Sikubwabo.  I can call his name in public, but I would prefer to give the other names in a closed session.  Of course, if you allow it. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, why are you protecting them if you don't think you did a good thing?  Why do you want to give them only in closed session? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Actually, in my view, if I give these people's names, it might jeopardise my security and the security of my family.  That is why I do not wish to give their names in public.  I do not personally have a problem because I am in prison, and I have stated this before, but the security of my property and my family might be jeopardised.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Your own identity is concealed.  Nobody knows who is talking, who is giving the names.  You don't give us the name or the name of your relatives or the name of where you stayed or anything which would identify you.  You are just giving us evidence and nobody knows who is giving us evidence.  Why do you object to giving us the names of the fellow -- those who gave orders in open?  It is not going to identify you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  In my confession, I decided to tell the truth out in the open because it is a decision that I took after reflecting at length and after noting that the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity are ignoble crimes.  That is why before you, before this Court, I am prepared to tell the truth, because you have guaranteed me that my security is protected.  So I can give you names.  

So as I told you, Sikubwabo was leading the attacks.  He was bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.  There was also a person coming from Cyangugu who used to bring the Interahamwe.  He is called -- it is a person who came from Cyangugu and who also came with a gentleman from Mugonero who is supposed to be detained here, who is called -- listen, I've forgotten the names. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness --
THE WITNESS:
There was also another person who accompanied them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will give you a piece of paper and you write down the names of those persons.  

Mr. Issa, please give him a piece of paper. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have just written down on a piece of paper a list of names of people who were leading the Bisesero attacks.  If it were put to you that Mika was also amongst the leaders of the Bisesero attacks, how would you respond?
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  If somebody was to tell me that Mika was one of the people who were leading the Bisesero attacks, this person would be lying because I went to Bisesero, as I told you before.  I committed the heinous crimes that I have mentioned to you.  So if somebody were to claim that, I would say that he's lying. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Can you tell the Court how the assailants reached Bisesero? 
A.	Thank you.  To go to Bisesero, we had to be made aware of certain things, and it is the leaders of the attacks who raised awareness amongst us.  To go to Bisesero, we used to go in a compact group of persons, and when we arrived at Bisesero, at the crossroads with the road coming from Gishyita and the other one coming from Mubuga, people would come together.  

The leaders of the attacks would gather us.  We would be divided into groups so that we would go in different directions so that we would hunt down the people whom we referred to as enemies, our Tutsi brothers.  That is how the leaders of the attacks sent us out. 
Q.	On the sheet of paper you have indicated a first name.  Can you identify this person?  I'm referring to the first name that you indicated on the sheet of paper.  Whose name is it?
A.	Thank you.  If you give me back the document, I can see whether I can remember the person's other name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give him the paper back. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What did this man do, this man whose name you have refused to name directly?
A.	The person appearing as No. 1 is Charles Sikubwabo.  He was bourgmestre of Gishyita commune in Kibuye.
Q.	Do you know how he went to Bisesero?
A.	Thank you.  This is how he went to Bisesero:  When he came to Bisesero, he came with soldiers who were his bodyguards.  He was on board a green -- or, rather, blue vehicle.  This blue vehicle had been seized by him from a Mubuga trader who was called Rulinda.  This is how he came with soldiers.  Besides, sometimes he was in the company of -- or he had another big, yellow vehicle which carried Interahamwe coming from Mugonero and Cyangugu.  So he would come on board this vehicle with soldiers and the communal policemen who were his bodyguards.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that you went to Bisesero three times.  Can you tell us whether the first time you went you -- there were victims, and how many there were?
A.	Thank you.  When I went to Bisesero for the first time, I think it was in the month of May.  I was accompanied by my colleagues.  We killed three people.  I think that those are the people we killed, if I remember correctly.
Q.	And the second time?
A.	The second time we went to Bisesero, when we reached a school in the Bisesero region, a place whose name I no longer remember, the bourgmestre found us there.  He was on board a vehicle.  And he said to us, "Do not go to Bisesero because I have not been able to find policemen and soldiers to help you in this attack.  So you may be killed.  So we are going to give you advice regarding your conduct for the next day, but what you are going to do now is to try and go down and go in towards those bushes and flush out the enemy.  Those who are able may harvest."  

The third time we went to Bisesero, and once more we met Sikubwabo and other persons whose names I have called; they ordered us to go and kill our brothers.  And we went to hunt them.  So those are the three times on which I went to Bisesero.
Q.	And the third time, how many victims were there?
A.	The third time, I did not kill anyone, but those who were with me caused victims because there were people who received bullet shots and they finished them off.  I remember there was a young man and a woman who had been shot but who were not yet dead, and those who were with me finished them off, but it is possible that there were other victims, because we used to go in different directions.  Thus it must be understood that there might have been other victims on that day.
Q.	Witness, did you know one another in the gacaca in your prison?
A.	Thank you, Madam President, thank you, Your Honours.  In the Gisovu prison where we are detained, we organised gacaca sessions and we talk about what happened.  Those who have testimonies to give, do so, and those who can make confessions also do so.  So in Gisovu prison, we organise gacaca sessions. 
Q.	In the gacaca sessions, did you confess the massacres in Bisesero?
A.	Whenever we organised gacaca sessions, in previous years it was difficult to confess those crimes, but we were gradually sensitised on the organic law and that is why I could do so.  In the framework of the gacaca sessions, I confessed to crimes I committed elsewhere as well as in Bisesero region.
Q.	In those gacaca sessions, did anyone accuse Mika of committing massacres in Bisesero?
A.	I thank you.  As a matter of fact, we organised several gacaca sessions in Gisovu prison.  I was transferred to Gisovu prison **************, and that was when the gacaca sessions were in full swing.  Since that day, up 'til now, we organise sessions, and those sessions can each last a whole week.  People from the same secteur and the same cellule accuse their mates.  So we have always organised gacaca sessions, and in our midst there are people who confess their crimes and others who accuse other inmates.
Q.	So are you in a position to answer my question; namely, that during those sessions has Mika's name ever been mentioned?
A.	I thank you.  As a matter of fact, if I were to say that I heard anyone mention Mika's name during those gacaca sessions which we have been holding since 2001 up to today, I would be lying.  I have never heard anyone mention Mika's name during those gacaca sessions.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know a place called Mubuga parish?
A.	Yes, I know that place because Mubuga parish is situated very close to the commercial centre, and at that location there was a market square, and that is where we used to go to buy supplies, so I know that place.
Q.	Did you learn, Witness, of what happened in that place; that is, Mubuga parish, in April 1994?
A.	I thank you.  During the gacaca sessions, that place is often mentioned, such that many people confess crimes that they committed at Mubuga parish.  I have never heard anyone mention Mika's name as being one of the assailants at that place.  As you know, we organise gacaca sessions according to cellules and secteurs.  
	By the way, people talk about events at Mubuga parish, but I have never heard anyone mention Mika's name, be it those confessing the crimes they committed there, be it those accusing others.
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Do you know a place called Mugonero hospital? 
A.	I also know that place because that is where we used to go for health care, all of us, so I know Mugonero hospital.
Q.	Did you also learn of what happened at Mugonero hospital in April 1994?
A.	Thank you.  As I stated earlier, wherever large-scale massacres were carried out, we tried to know the truth about the events at those various locations, so we talk about what happened in those locations.  The persons who committed crimes there talk about it.
Q.	Still the same question:  Did you hear Mika's name mentioned with regard to the massacres at Mugonero hospital?
A.	Thank you.  To tell you the truth, if I had ever heard anyone mention Mika's name, I would have told you.  I have never heard anyone mention Mika's name during the gacaca sessions we organised.  So I can say that I never heard anyone mention Mika's name in connection with the massacres at Mugonero.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  During the gacaca sessions, are any persons accused of rape?
A.	During those gacaca sessions, cases of rape are not often mentioned.  I mean cases of rape in Gishyita.  But I would like to point out that in my confession I made mention of cases of rape.
JUDGE SHORT:
I didn't hear the end of the last response, when he said that in his confession of --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Of cases of rape. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which is the rape you have mentioned in your confession, in what place? 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  The case of rape that I mentioned occurred in a cellule that is next to mine.  That rape was perpetrated by my co-detainee, and the victim was a girl whose name I do not recall.  The person who committed that crime of rape is my co-detainee.  I don't know whether my explanations are satisfactory to you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That was the only case of rape you heard of?
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Madam President. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Has your fellow detainee confessed to that offence of rape? 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  As a matter of fact, my co-detainee did not confess that fact because at the time he 
	was 17.  I would like to point out that we participated together in murder, but not in rape.  He has not yet confessed that crime of rape.
JUDGE SHORT:
And why do you think he has not yet confessed --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness added that that person has not yet been arrested.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How is he not arrested if he is your fellow detainee?  What are you talking about? 
THE WITNESS:
He has not yet been arrested.  He is with his parents in their home.  I don't know whether I mentioned his name.  It's a young man who is probably married already.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How is he your fellow detainee? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not say that he was my co-detainee.  I meant to say that he was my co-perpetrator, which means that we committed the crime of murder together.  But there's another specificity about what he did, the fact that he raped that girl.
JUDGE SHORT:
And why has he not been arrested? 
THE WITNESS:
	I don't know why he has not yet been arrested, but at one time the deputy prosecutor came to the prison.  We showed him the document containing our confession, but he has so far not been arrested, although the deputy prosecutor said he was going to arrest him. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And in your confession, did you make mention only of one rape or several rapes?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  In fact, the rape case I mentioned is that one because I witnessed it.  He was with me.  It was at night, at about 1 a.m.  It is the only case of rape I am aware of, and that is the only person I saw commit rape.  Besides, during gacaca sessions, no other cases of rape were mentioned. 
MR. SONGA:
Witness, I thank you. 

Madam President, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Kapaya, go ahead with your cross-examination. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good morning, Witness DK.
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	Witness, you have testified that you were a witness to a rape and that you confessed this before the prosecutor in Kibuye.  Is that the position?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.
Q.	I'll show you a document and ask you whether you recognise this to be the confession that you made as regards the rape.  Just look at the opening paragraph there and the signature at the top -- at the bottom, and tell me whether you recognise the signature and the writings before we proceed.  The signature on page 2 and -- page 2 of the Kinyarwanda version of that document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, before you proceed.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us enter this document containing the name of the persons mentioned by the witness.  Professor, this is your document, and it is entered as Exhibit D. 103. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 103 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Thank you, Mr. Kapaya, go ahead. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, the first part contains your name and your signatures on the second page and the last page.  Do you recognise that document?  And the date is ************* -- 03. 
A.	What did you say?  I did not quite understand. 
Q.	I'm telling you that -- I want you to tell me whether you recognise that document.  If you look at the first paragraph there, it contains your name, the date of the interview, and your particulars, actually, and then there are signatures on the second page and on the last one.  Do you recognise those signatures and the contents of that document? 
A.	I thank you.  I would like to first of all ask that you give me time to carefully read this document before confirming its contents. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I believe, when you see your signature, you can recognise it as yours.  We are not concerned with the contents at present. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You must allow the witness to read and make sure that what he has signed is what he actually -- the contents of the document reflect what he actually signed.  You can't deprive him of that opportunity. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It could be substituted. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  Let the witness read whatever he wants to read.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, go ahead and read a portion of the document and see whether that is a document you signed.  
	(Pages 23 to 38 by Karen Holm-Porter)






























	1225H
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  I have finished reading this document.  I confirm that the signature is mine, and I recognise the contents of this document. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, there are parts in the Kinyarwanda version of that document, which I have highlighted with yellow, and they relate to rapes.  There are questions.  The first one is on the first page of the English version, question no. 3:  "Tell me the people you know were raped."  The second question is on 
page 3 of the English version, the question on the top which says, "How come it is stated those girls were two?  How did you take them so that they were not killed together?"  Have you seen those parts, Witness?
A.	Yes.  I have seen the two parts.
Q.	And then on the third part, the English version, the second question immediately after the one I have read, it says, "How then did you find out these others raped that wife of Peter and then they killed her?"  Were you asked those questions and were these the responses you gave? 
A.	Yes, I have seen the part in question.
Q.	So on the basis of this, would I be correct in saying that rapes took place during April, May, June and July in Gishyita and in Rwanda -- in the Gishyita commune?  Would that be a correct statement of facts?
A.	I thank you, Your Honours, Madam President.  I cannot refute that because I said that I was never a witness, so I cannot deny then -- I cannot deny them.
MR. KAPAYA:
Did he say he was never a witness or he was a witness? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Did you say you were a witness or you were not a witness to the rapes?
A.	I state that it happened.  I witnessed that crime.  And for that reason, I cannot refute that such crimes occurred.
Q.	So if anyone comes across here and says that no rapes took place in Gishyita commune, that person would be lying, wouldn't he?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are you also in that, Prosecutor?  Are you also in that scheme?
MR. KAPAYA:
What scheme, Your Honour?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Of accusing your own witness, that the person would be lying because the witness has said something different.

MR. KAPAYA:
He is stating his opinion, Your Honour.  
THE WITNESS:
Could you repeat the question and I will answer it?
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, apart from this rape which you have mentioned in your confession, do you want this Court to believe that throughout the war, April, May, June, that you never heard of rapes committed elsewhere, before or after your arrest?
THE WITNESS:
In truth, I did not hear of any other cases of rape, and I said so, and I said that during the gacaca sessions that are organized in the Gisovu prison.  I did not hear anyone talk of other cases of rape, save the one I talked to you about.  And to come back to the question that was put to me, if anyone were to state that there were no cases of rape, he might be right, but I who was witness to the case of rape, I would also be indebted to say so.  So the person who saw it and who was a witness of a case of rape will be right in saying so because he would have been an eyewitness to the act.  But a person who wasn't a witness would also be right in saying that there were no cases of rape.
JUDGE SHORT:
Would I also be correct in saying that in your culture, people are very reluctant to speak about rapes? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  In reality, things like that are not spoken of publicly, so you are correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, I heard you say that you cannot rule out the possibility that rapes had occurred in April, May and June in Rwanda.  Is that not what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I think you did not quite understand my answer.  I said in the explanation I gave that if someone wasn't an eyewitness to a case of rape and if this person says that there was no rape, he will be right in saying so.  Just as I who witnessed a case of rape, if I say therefore that there was rape, I would be correct.  So everybody will only testify to what they witnessed.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That's correct.  But what I'm asking you is, you did say earlier on that you cannot rule out the possibility that somebody else somewhere at least acted the way Peter acted, took a girl to himself and raped for himself -- and raped?

Go on, Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, I have another document placed before you.  Do you have it already?
A.	No.  I only have the document that was sent to me before.
MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Issa, give him the document, please.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	That document contains an English translation, French and Kinyarwanda.  Would you go straight to the Kinyarwanda version, and then I will ask you a few questions on that one.  The Kinyarwanda part is the last bit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, have you highlighted the portions in the Kinyarwanda version in which you're interested?
MR. KAPAYA:
Actually, it's the parts -- all parts, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, have you -- do you have the Kinyarwanda part before you now?
A.	I haven't seen the document yet.  

I have seen the portion you are referring to.
Q.	Okay.  Now, on the very first page, do you see names there that purport to be yours?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And would you go to the very last page?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is dated ****************, Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
It is dated --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The date of the confession.
MR. KAPAYA:
The **************, yes.  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Are you on the last page, Mr. Witness?
A.	(No interpretation)     
Q.	Have you seen the signature there and the name?
A.	Yes, I have seen them.
Q.	Do you recognise that as your signature, Mr. Witness?
A.	It is my signature.
Q.	And you signed that to acknowledge that this is your confession as regards the crimes you committed in April, May and June '94; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, let's go to part 2 of that document.  Do you find that the crimes for which you committed, you allege -- the offences which you confessed to have committed were committed in Mara, Mara secteur and Murangara secteur; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Let's go to part 3.  There are six victims there; five are shown to have come from -- are we together, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	There are six victims there, right?
A.	There aren't only six persons, but 16.  If you start from the first part, you can see from No. 1, and there are 16 persons, some of whom haven't been identified.
Q.	Right.  They all show that they come from Mara secteur and one from Murangara secteur; is that correct?
A.	All those people were not residents of Mara because we didn't know their names.  Those people were killed in Mara, but they came from elsewhere.
Q.	Now, let's go to part 4.  You have witnesses there.  There are seven witnesses, right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	They all come from Mara secteur, right?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And then part 5 contains the list of your accomplices, your co-perpetrators, the people with whom you committed the crimes.  There are 43 accomplices listed there.
A.	That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is part what?
MR. KAPAYA:
Part 5, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
My document says part 5 is identity of witnesses, and the other part is unnumbered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Identity of the co-authors.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
This is not numbered.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, there is an error on the English translation, Your Honour, but if you  -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So what is the correct position?
MR. KAPAYA:
Four is identity of witnesses.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Five is identity of --
MR. KAPAYA:
-- co-perpetrators.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	There are 43 in all, Witness.  They all come from Mara secteur, where you come from, don't they?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Then under part 6 -- part 6 is a summary.   Are you there?
A.	Yes, I am.
Q.	Now, it shows a summary of the crimes you committed and the places where those crimes were committed, right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And the places shown there are Mara secteur and one incident in Murangara secteur; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Under part 9, it is shown that you are listed as a category 1 offender; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the category?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
On page 7 towards the end.  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And there it says that -- have you seen the place?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, immediately before that, there is your name and signature and the words that you have read the statement and found it to be correct.  Is that your position?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, in your testimony a couple of minutes ago, you testified that you went to Bisesero on three occasions in May and killed people.  Can you show me anywhere in this confession where you confessed to having gone to Bisesero and committed crimes?
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  To tell you the truth, the confessions and guilty plea procedure has come a long way, and besides, it is a very complicated thing for someone to acknowledge killing persons.  It is a problem.  There were therefore stages in which one accepted to confess, to make confessions.  The person who was accused would confess to certain crimes and keep others to himself, and that is why I confessed to certain crimes, but I did not confess to the crimes of Bisesero, and that is why you don't find in that document the crimes that were committed in Bisesero.  But I would like to explain to you that I've also given explanations regarding Bisesero.  I have a copy thereof.  I have already confessed to the Bisesero crimes.
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that Bisesero is not mentioned there because you never went to Bisesero at all.  You operated in your home secteur, that is, (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).
MR. KAPAYA:
I don't know whether that may identify the witness, but I believe there are hundreds of people who lived in (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) secteur in 1994.  If it stands that there is risk of identifying the witness, then --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then the name of the secteur will be kept under seal.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, what do you say to that proposition?  You never went there; that is why it is not in your confession.
A.	Thank you, Your Honours.  To tell you the truth, as I said before, it should be understood that accepting to confess wasn't easy.  The accused were confessed  -- confessed to crimes of which they were accused, and after examining their consciences and after realising that the crimes that they committed were odious crimes and having internalised the benefits that I would have in confessing, I decided to confess to all that I had done.  Because in the gacaca prisons, the law states that if a person does not confess to his crime, that person may find himself in the first category, wherein you find people who may even be sentenced to capital punishment.  And that is why I took the position to confess to all that I had done, and I forwarded a letter to the office of the prosecutor to say exactly what I did.  So it should be understood that I did confess to the crimes committed at Bisesero.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did you confess to the crimes committed in Bisesero, and before whom? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Regarding the crimes in Bisesero, I confessed to them on the ************************ when the deputy prosecutors came and pointed out to us the various categories in which we had been put.  It is then that I confessed to the crimes of Bisesero before the deputy prosecutor.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, and when in 2002, ***************, when you signed this confession, you decided to omit Bisesero; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And when in 2003, *****************, you were interviewed by the Prosecutor, and you again decided to omit Bisesero?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  But I would like to explain to you --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Just tell me, is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
-- concerning --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You deliberately decided to omit Bisesero.  You hadn't forgotten about it, had you? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  When I decided to confess to my crimes the first time around, this was of my own volition, because what I felt was it may not be useful for us -- for me.  But when I realised that there will be a benefit to confessing, I talked about Bisesero.  Regarding what happened in March, when the deputy prosecutor came to Gisovu, he asked me questions solely on the young girl who had been raped in our cellule.  He asked me questions only on that matter, and I only gave him answers in respect of the questions he asked.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:  
All right.  What I'm asking you, Witness, is that on both occasions, you had not forgotten about Bisesero.  You knew it, it was in your head, but you decided, "No, Bisesero, I will not talk about it."  Is that a correct position? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  I had not yet understood the advantage of confessing, because I felt that anybody who was going to confess to his crime was going to be condemned to death, and we decided not to confess.  That is what happened at that location.  Because we felt that if anybody confessed to crimes committed on that location, that person will run the risk of being sentenced to death.  So you should understand that my colleagues and myself, we took the decision to supplement or to complete our confessions when we understood the benefits that you would have if you gave a full confession.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But you confessed to killings in the year 2002; at that time you didn't care about being subjected to capital punishment.  Your 2002 confession is about killing people, isn't it?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is no different from killing in Bisesero.  If you had killed in Bisesero, you would have confessed it with the other confessions; is that not the case? 
THE WITNESS:
As I have been explaining to you, I would like to say this:  It is not easy to take the position to confess to your crimes.  We decided to confess later to certain crimes or offences because the law that had just been adopted stated that anybody who would confess his crimes will have his prison term reduced.  And subsequently, when we understood the benefits of confessing, and after having seen that some of our friends who had confessed had been released and had joined their families, we decided to confess to all the crimes that we had committed, following the explanations that were given to us on this, of course, after understanding the benefits of the confessions and the prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What benefits were given to you after you confessed to the crimes committed in the Bisesero area? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honours.  To tell you the truth, after having decided to confess to all the crimes, to the crimes of Bisesero, and after having testified to what I had seen at the Gishyita commune where I had gone, I felt some inner peace, and I asked for forgiveness, for full forgiveness from God, and I am still waiting for the Rwandan government to extend its pardon and forgiveness to me, and I'm still waiting for this.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, when you made your first confession in 2002, it was made clear to you that you had been placed in the first category.  Is it not so? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you understood the consequences of being placed in the first category? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
And then how can you say that it was only in 2004 that you appreciated that you would get certain benefits by confessing all your crimes?  Category 1 is the highest category in which you can be placed, and that was made clear to you in 2002 when you made your confession which did not include the Bisesero killings. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honours.  In truth, we were notified of the categories into which we had been put or of those who would be released to go and join their families.  I, on my part, was told that I was put on the category 1.  I felt calm, and I said if I am released and I'm sent to my cellule and if people end up  saying that I was at Bisesero, that this would be a problem for me.  So I felt that it would be better for me to explain that I had been to Bisesero, and I would have a reduced sentence.  That is 25 years.  Therefore, I decided to talk about the crimes that I committed in Bisesero with the hope that I will be given a 25-year sentence and escape the -- or dodge the capital punishment.  As stipulated on the law, if a person was found to be guilty of crimes he hadn't confessed to, that person will run the risk of being given capital punishment, and that is why I confessed to the Bisesero crimes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you want to go now, Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
No further questions, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But how about your documents?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  The first one is the Pro-Justice document, dated 1st August 2003, the English and Kinyarwanda versions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The English document is entered in as Exhibit P. 90, under seal, E for English. 
JUDGE SHORT: 
And K for Kinyarwanda.  There is no French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
K for Kinyarwanda, under seal.
(Exhibit Nos. P. 90(K) and P. 90(E) admitted, under seal) 
   MR. KAPAYA:
The other one is the confession dated 12 November 2002.  It is in three languages, K, E and F:  Kinyarwanda, English and French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is entered as Exhibit P. 91.  E for English, K for Kinyarwanda and F for French.  All documents under seal.
(Exhibit Nos. P. 91(K), P. 91(E) and P. 91(F) admitted, under seal)
   MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, any re-examination?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  I simply want to ask one question.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did I understand or hear you well when you said you made a confession on ************ ************ regarding Bisesero?
A.	You are correct.  On the *************************, I confessed to the Bisesero crimes, and this was on the occasion of the visits of the deputy prosecutor who came to tell us the various categories under which we had been placed.  And besides, he had told us that those who would not have confessed to the crimes concerning those events would remain under the first category, and that is the reason wherefore I made the confession.
Q.	Did you have any cause to believe that your confessions of ******************* would be entered in your records in Kigali or in Rwanda? 
A.	I think I can confirm this.  Given that that document was in the deputy prosecutor's hands, and he is the one who therefore took it, I therefore confirm this. 
Q.	Would you also confirm that you kept a copy for yourself?  
A.	I have a copy of that document, but I didn't bring it with me.  The said copy is in the prison where I'm under custody.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to make an application.  I think you would recall the appearance of Witness DZ in this same case.  It is a similar situation whereby witness confessions were produced only in part and where, upon our application, you --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, as you make your application, are you proposing as a proposition that in all your discussions with this witness, he's never told you that he confessed in 2003 -- in 2004?  Is that the claim that is coming out of the dock; you are hearing it for the first time?
MR. SONGA:
If the truth be told, I spoke about it for the first time yesterday, and he talked about his confessions in respect of Bisesero.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
All previous to yesterday when you have talked to him, he has never told you about Bisesero or told your people, your investigators?
MR. SONGA:
I can only tell you what I know, Your Honour.  As for what he might have told the investigators, I don't have any report filed to me in that respect.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, when you spoke to him yesterday and he told you about Bisesero 2004, did you ask him, "Why did you not tell my investigators about this before?" Because it's your obligation to get these documents fast.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, I've already told you one thing.  My investigators cannot have access to documents that are on examination in the legal department in Rwanda.  Secondly, I think the witness mentioned Bisesero to my investigators, and that is why it is mentioned in the summary statements that we have submitted, a copy of which was sent to the Prosecution.  And I was also convinced that the Prosecution would bring a complete document.  I think it's a complete file, but if the witness says that there are documents that are not in the file, I would like to crave the indulgence of your Honourable Court so that I be granted leave to contact the authorities in Rwanda for the purpose of retrieving that document.  And where it becomes necessary, you give me assistance in that regard.  That is the application I wanted to make, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, did you know about the existence of that confession of 2004?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, we got all what the ten witnesses had in their files from Rwanda, unless those were maybe placed somewhere else.  But if you go by the file that our investigators went to get from the Rwandan authorities, we brought all the documents that pertained to all the ten witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Professor, you are done with your examination?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But before we finish, I think this particular matter -- if this witness told you he has a copy of that confession with him, I can't possibly see how you would avoid asking him to give you a copy, on the basis that the Prosecutor will bring it.
MR. SONGA:
I said, Your Honours, that the witness said he had a copy, but that copy was in Rwanda; he did not travel with that copy.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm talking about when he spoke to your investigator and told him, "Yes, I confessed of my guilt about Bisesero.  I kept a copy of the confession.  The other one went with the Prosecutor," and so on and so forth.  I can't see that your investigator on your team would not have asked him to let you have a copy of the copy -- a copy of the copy he kept.

Professor, did you tell us that you put the Bisesero confessions in the summary?
MR. SONGA:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which summary?
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President, Your Honours.  If you look at the document that I had forwarded to you on the 18th of June 2004, the witness here present appears on No. 11 and is assigned the pseudonym that we are still using today; in other words, DK -- No. 11, DK.  The summary states that he pleaded guilty before the Rwandan courts of three attacks carried out in Bisesero.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And I'm saying to you, when he said that to your investigator, he must have told him, "Yes, I kept a copy of the confession."  And I can't see that you didn't ask him, "Can I have a look at it?"
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, were you given copies of your confessions? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honours.  The person who came to contact me contacted us at a time that I had the document -- I'm talking about Leopold -- but when that person came back, I had gone to play football, but I had a copy thereof.
JUDGE SHORT:
You went to play football?  Where?  While you were in detention? 
THE WITNESS:
We have a football pitch where we do play football.  And on that day I had gone to participate in the football game, and on that day he didn't find me in prison.  When I got there, my colleagues, 
co-detainees, told me that that person had come to take a copy, but I told him that it was impossible for him to have that copy then.
JUDGE SHORT:
So you have copies of these confessions that you made?  All three confessions, you have your own personal copies; is that the case?
THE WITNESS:
I have three copies.  There is a copy of the first confession, there is a copy of the second confession concerning crimes committed in Bisesero, and there is a third copy which is the summary of all those confessions.  And that is -- that copy seeks to explain and to assemble all the confessions.  So those are the three copies, the three documents that I have in my possession.  However, I do not have a copy of the first confession or the second confession, rather, which is the interview that was led by the deputy prosecutor.  The first copy is that of the confession of **********; the other copy is the one that explains my confessions and which puts together the various confessions.
JUDGE SHORT:
And did you give the first confession to the investigator when he came on the first occasion? 
THE WITNESS:
When he came to see me the first time around, he did not ask us to give him copies of confessions.  Rather, it is when he came the second time that he asked us to provide him with those copies.  Unfortunately, he didn't find me on the spot.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, Professor, what do you have to say?  You don't need to indulge us.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, what is the assistance you are seeking from the Chamber?
MR. SONGA:
As you are aware, Your Honours, I never ask for too much of it.  I simply would want that we take the same solution that we retained when DZ appeared and who talked about confessions that were not in his file as presented by the Prosecutor.  And the solution that you had adopted would be that the Defence should write to the judicial authorities of Rwanda in order to request for those documents, including, in particular, the confessions.  And that in the event that we had any problems, we could appeal to the assistance of the Honourable Tribunal.  And it is the same solution that I would like that we retain in this respect so that we write to the Rwandan authorities.  And in the event we are faced with some difficulties, you can bring us assistance.  That is my application, Madam President, 
Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But the witness has the copy.
MR. SONGA:
In Rwanda.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, it is the same place where the Rwanda government authorities are.  Your witness gives you a copy, and you know how to get it in the proceedings, which I don't know myself, but you do, so -- but I don't think that there is anything the Chamber can give you at the present moment at the close of your case which is due to close in a few minutes. 
MR. SONGA:
Exactly.
JUDGE SHORT:
This application you are making, assuming you got this confession, how do you intend to make it part of the record?
MR. SONGA:
You will still assist us here.  Would justice not try to address situations where there are omissions in certain cases for some days, for instance?  I think you will authorise us to reopen the debate -- the case file. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you object to the confession made in 2004?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Do I object to --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
To the request to try --

 JUDGE SHORT:
     -- to the request to try and obtain that confession that was made in 2004, if it exists?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Of course we do.  We don't --
JUDGE SHORT:
How can you object if it exists?
MR. KAPAYA:
Well, the matter is an ethical one, Your Honour.  My learned friend -- this witness is called by my learned friend, and under normal circumstances, based on the status of this witness, is he saying that the first time that he is hearing that this witness has a confession statement is in this courtroom?  And that, in any event, it would seem that all the 15 detained witnesses that he called, he never made it his business to obtain their criminal antecedents.  I mean, that is a separate ethical issue, which we don't accept anyway.  In any event, he should have made it his business to disclose to the Court, based on their status, their entire criminal antecedents.  Now, he can't for any reason claim that the first time he was hearing it was yesterday or the day before, and that on the basis of the witness being cornered in cross-examination and making an allegation that there are three or four statements lurking in the wings somewhere there the whole process comes to a standstill.  We don't accept that, first of all, that my learned friend has no access to documents in Rwanda.  Your Honours would realise, if you look at the motion to transfer the detained witnesses themselves, that he got an order from the minister of justice one month before he even made the application to Your Honours.  Now, based on that, we don't accept that he is not aware of the real situation with his witnesses.  We just think it is a cover up.  I don't accept that.  I do not accept that.  If you can obtain an order to transfer witnesses before you make an application in Arusha, then you must have some connections in Rwanda.  In any event, it is ethically correct that he ought to have made it his business to make himself aware of the antecedents based on their status.  So just a mere statement in court would not suffice to put this whole process on a standstill, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
The process is not being put on a standstill.  He is saying that they have encountered difficulties getting these antecedents.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, assuming that this document exists, assuming it exists --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
-- is it not in the interests of justice that a document should be put before it?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If it exists, yes.  Then we recall the witness.
JUDGE SHORT:
It wouldn't necessarily be recalling the witness.  But if you agree, it could be admitted and placed on the record.  It doesn't necessarily have to recall the witness.  Unless, of course, you want to 
cross-examine the witness on the document.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Not without recalling the witness, Your Honour.  It would be our position -- it's been done once before in Bagilishema, and it was a ground of appeal, and the Appeal Chamber took great objection to that practice, to consider -- to admit as part of the court record a confession statement of a witness after the proceedings have closed.  The case of The Prosecutor versus Ignace Bagilishema.  That was the subject of appeal on that matter.  And the reasoning of the Appeal Court was that that process in itself was wrong and that the witness should have been recalled.  Albeit, the appeals chamber took the view that the prosecution should have requested the chamber to recall the witness, rather than raise it as a ground of appeal.  So we will be saying now that you -- if you are of the mind to consider admitting such a document, we will be asking for this witness to be recalled.
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, I mean, I was asking you if you consented to having the document received without calling the witness, but you say you don't -- 
MR. KAPAYA:
We don't.
JUDGE SHORT:
-- so that's a different picture.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes.  But, I mean, if you were ready to agree to have it admitted without calling the witness, that would be a different situation.  But you say you don't agree to my proposition.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, we don't.  No, we don't.  We don't, Your Honour.  We don't.  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, you definitely heard what the Prosecutor said, and that would mean that if we were to accede to any of your intonations, we would be giving an opening to reopening the case for the purposes of recalling this witness.  And we don't really see that as any justification for it, because we would think it was competent of you to get this document long before now.  And, two, you are making an application right at the end of a trial.  And it would not be in the interests of justice to leave the case unclosed for several months just because you failed to do your duty properly or even correctly.  So I would like that -- the Chamber takes the view that we really can't be of much assistance to you in that regard.
MR. SONGA:
I will have to bow down to your decision.  I will rely on your decision, Your Honours.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, if you had made attempts earlier and then you had encountered difficulties, then you should have approached the Court for assistance, but you haven't done that, you didn't do that, you see, and so it's sort of late for you to make this application.  This should have been done earlier, and you should have demonstrated the efforts you've made to get certain information from the Rwandan authorities and the problems that you had encountered and then indicating that because of that you were seeking assistance of the Court.  At that time, the Court could have given you assistance, but at this eleventh hour, when you are ready to close your case, it's kind of too late in the day. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, with your leave, I would like some clarifications.  I have recalled that there is an identical case that is regarding Witness DZ, and you took a Defence solution.  Should we consider that that solution is no longer applicable, and that even for that witness, if we had the guilty plea, you will not take account of that since we've already written to the prosecutor -- the public prosecutor in Kigali?  I would like to know your determination in this case.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your right to enter documents --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Your right to enter documents exists only up to and not after you are closing your case.  So if you are closing your case today, which we understand to be the case, that's it.  You can't really bring evidence after you have closed your case, and our offer to assist you was to assist you while your case was still opened to get the documents in.  But we can't keep the case open for the rest of the year to await a possible document from Rwanda.  Purely, that is the procedure.
JUDGE SHORT:
Unless, of course, Professor -- no.  No.  No.  It's okay.  Unless, of course, Professor, you can show us authority that you can reopen a case after you have closed it to introduce evidence which was available at a trial, but you took no steps to get that evidence.  See, that is the position we are dealing with.  This is not evidence that has come to your knowledge, you know, after the close of the trial.  This is evidence that was available all along, and you did not take the necessary steps to get this evidence before.  So, the situation is that your case has to be closed now.  When your case is closed, you can go and do your research and find out if there is anything you can do.  But, at the moment, it doesn't seem to us that there's much that you can do about this matter.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, Your Honours --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Go ahead, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
I simply wanted to say that I'm confused between the situation of DZ where, Your Honour, you've already taken -- retained a solution, and the case of today would not be very correct, because as far as DZ is concerned, you have already made a determination, and I think we should draw the consequences attendant thereto.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, that decision was made on the assumption that you would get this information and bring it to the Court's attention before you close your case.  That was the assumption under which that decision was made.  Now you are ready to close your case.  Surely, you are not suggesting that your case should be left open indefinitely for us to wait for this information which may or may not exist, because that is the basis under which that earlier decision was made.  That is why I'm saying that now that your case has come to an end, there is nothing that we can do, except if you can come up with some authority which would entitle us or compel us to reopen this matter, if and when you do get this information.
MR. SONGA:
I have understood Your Honours.  In the event there would be a legal authority on which I could base my application, I will do so.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for your testimony.  

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness to the elevator.
(Witness excused)
   MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Professor, this Witness DK was your next -- is your last witness?  He was your last witness, right?
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So, is this the close of your case, Professor?
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Therefore, the conclusion of the evidence of this witness brings us to the end of the trial in 
Mika Muhimana's case.  The trial in this case commenced on the 29th of March, with the first session of Prosecution evidence, and ended on the 30th of April.  During the first session, we heard 19 witnesses in 20 trial days.  The second session started on the 16th of August for the Defence evidence, and today was the last day -- trial day.  During this session, we have been able to hear 33 witnesses in 14 trial days.  The total trial days come to 34.  Let us express our gratitude to counsel for the parties, the Prosecution and the Defence, for making the proceedings run smoothly and also making it possible to conclude the evidence within the targeted time.  We also appreciate and thank the support staff of this court, that is, the interpreters, the translators, the court reporters, the members of the registry, the members of the security, the technicians, the witness support section, and all others, and all ALOs too, for their able assistance and contribution for the efficient running of the trial.  Thank you once again.  

Now we may consider the schedule for filing the written briefs and the oral arguments.  If it is agreeable, we have set dates for filing the written briefs and the oral arguments.  If it is convenient to the parties, the written briefs would be filed in the first week of October, the 4th, 5th of October, and the oral arguments then can be submitted from the 26th to the 28th of October.

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you for that, Your Honour.  Sorry.  Has Your Honour finished, or can I make some representations here?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, today is the 8th of September.  The 4th would give us approximately four weeks, give or take.  It may or may not be possible, Your Honour, to do this.  We may be asking to crave your indulgence to let us file -- at least give us 'till the 11th of October.  We may well file by the 4th, but if we could just have that added leeway as far as our filing was concerned.  Once we file, Your Honour, we have no problems making closing submissions on the 26th or 28th, as -- or between the 26th or 28th of October, as you've indicated,.  But if I can just suggest that the reality of the situation is that if we file a 300-page closing brief, which we often do, it is almost impossible for the language section to translate that document within a month or less -- sorry, in a period less than a month.  So I have been thinking about some dates, and we had -- we will propose that if you allow both parties to file on Monday, the 11th of October, which is just slightly more than a month or just about a month.  If you then let us address you, assuming that we receive the translations, because my learned friend will be filing his document in French, I will be filing mine in English, if we give the language section between the 11th of October and round about the 8th of November to translate those documents, then we can address you in closing any time after the 8th of November.  We can address you the week commencing the 15th of November to the 19th or the week commencing the 22nd of November to the 26th.  But the most important thing, Your Honour, which I want to emphasise is the reality of our colleagues in the language section to be able to translate that document within the time period that you've indicated, and I would suggest that we give them at least one working month.  If we file simultaneously on the same day, then they are changing from French to English and English to French.  They will need about a month to do that, and we can address you the day that those documents are ready, if need be.  But, you know --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you suggest for the oral arguments?  The 8th of November? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Any time after -- if you give them a month, Your Honour, from the -- well, if you insist on the 4th of October, and you give them a month after that, then we are talking the first week of November for translations.  So I would suggest the week commencing the 15th of November for oral arguments.  It just depends on what their workload is like and how soon they can work. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, what do you have to say to the proposition made by Mr. Phillips?
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.  My comment would be that we should give ourselves a realistic time frame.  The date of the 11th of October gives us barely a month, Madam President.  As you know, just as much as we know, this trial has been conducted under pressure, considerable pressure, at breakneck speed.  We need, therefore, a bit of time to breathe.   The 20th of October gives us a month, Madam President.  So, we should add 15 days to the time frame proposed by the Prosecutor so that we could really be sure of being ready.  Because, as you know, we've listened to the three (sic) testimonies in this trial.  Beyond the factual findings of this case, which we have to prepare, we have to write our oral arguments, and we need the time therefore to do our work properly.  So we should add, Madam President, 15 days to the time frame proposed by the Prosecutor so that we shouldn't work under excessive pressure.  I think this would be the right approach to adopt.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, today is the 8th of September.  Don't you think that one month is enough for filing written briefs?  The 8th of September.  And you will be filing the written brief on the 11th of October.  And then if we agree to the proposition of the Prosecutor, you can argue the case after the 15th of November.
MR. SONGA:
We will do our best, Madam President, but if there are any hitches, I hope you will be willing to give us some additional time frame.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, what are your dates?  Don't say add 15 days.  Just say proposed dates and then we look at them on the calendar. 
MR. SONGA:
I crave your indulgence to give me three minutes to work out the dates in line with the schedule.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Three minutes.
MR. SONGA:     
I thank you.

Madam President, this is the Defence's proposal:  The filing of written briefs could be on Monday, the 25th of October.  Allowing sufficient time for translation, we expect those translations to be ready on Monday, the 30th of November.  As for oral arguments, we could file them -- we could present them on the 10th of December, shortly before or shortly after, and it will fall on a Friday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, that is Friday.
MR. SONGA:
Could we schedule that for the next Monday, which would be the 13th of December?

Madam President, excuse me for disturbing your deliberations somewhat.  I would like to ask a question regarding principle.  Between the dates when the Prosecutor files his written briefs and the dates of the Defence's closing briefs, is there no official time frame for such matters?  Because I have not had time to familiarise myself with the practice in that particular area.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think there's a particular time frame for --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The practice varies, Your Honour.  The practice varies.  I mean, this is our fifth closing argument that we will be making, and it's very -- in the very early days, we used to file simultaneous closing briefs.  In other words, we would file on the same day.  In the last two cases that we've done, we have filed on one day and the Defence has filed on another, which, in essence, actually makes nonsense of the closing arguments, actually, because the idea is that we are meant to respond to each other's briefs in arguments, so it then makes the differential in the time unnecessary.  If he has one month to respond to my brief in writing, then what do I do in closing arguments?  The idea is to actually respond to each other's briefs in oral arguments as opposed to -- so, I mean --  but if we even try that here, we are not going to be out of here until January.  I considered that option, and the best option is to file simultaneously and then respond to each other's briefs orally.  

Just another calculation that may help, because we've done this often enough.  And, again, in terms of computing the amount of time you need for translations, Your Honour, the language section has informed us that each translator has to translate a minimum of five pages a day.  So if you assume that they detail four bodies to do the work, that would be approximately 20 pages every day.  If I file a brief of 400 pages, that gives you an idea of how long it takes for them to translate it, let alone revise it.  And it helps to have those figures just to have an idea of how they work.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have deliberated and also considered the submission of the parties.  So considering the submission of the parties, we have decided that the 25th of October should be the last date for filing the written briefs, so the parties --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Simultaneously.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Simultaneously, the parties shall file their written briefs by the 25th of October, and the oral arguments will be on the 7th, 8th and 9th of December.  It would start from the 7th -- maybe the 7th or 8th.  So the Prosecution arguments will be on the 7th of December, and the Defence will be on the 8th of December, and the rebuttals -- and if any rebuttals, that would be on the 9th. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
As the Court pleases.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have obliged you this time.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
As always.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.  As always, I always have confidence in you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will stop here, and we thank you once again for all the efforts put into the conclusion of this trial, the Prosecution team and the Defence team.  Have a nice break.  Thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1405H)
