MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session now.  The appearances are the same as before?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, the appearances are the same.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  The Defence team is the same as before.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Professor, please continue. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I don't know whether you gave me the floor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I did. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, when we broke up yesterday the Defence was making a representation on applicable law and its relation to the categorisation of genocide.  I had already started talking about what we call the requirement for the establishment of the offence of genocide; that is, the existence of a particular context that should be marked by a discriminatory policy that is pre-existent as far as the rights of the Accused are concerned.  It is important that a relationship should be established between a person prosecuted for genocide and the policy of discrimination.  It would not be admissible, for instance, that someone should be convicted of a crime he committed solely because that crime is concomitant with the commission of genocide.  Furthermore, it should be shown that the person was aware or conscious of the fact that those acts are part of that more general context.  That is why Raphael Lemkin, mentioned yesterday, and who is considered as one of the drafters of the convention on genocide -- Lemkin is spelled as follows:  L-E-M-K-I-N -- Raphael Lemkin defines genocide as a coordinated plan of different actions --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You had gone as far as telling us why the persons who were being tried, the 12 persons who have been tried, the reason why they were not convicted.  That is where you were yesterday.  Can we move on from there? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I will try to move on.  What I was merely doing was to give an introduction.  

I will continue therefore in saying that this prerequisite condition which you have already properly understood can be achieved for three reasons.  I said it before; I'll just say it again very quickly and be more explicit.  It must be proven that the Accused was in a position of authority and that on the basis of such a position he enforced the policy in question.  

And, lastly, I said that the Tribunal had relied on elements of direct proof of evidence, and I will be more explicit.  The Nuremberg Tribunal convicted the accused because they had used signed decrees, public statements and confessions.  In the present case, Madam President, Your Honours, certain questions can be raised.  For instance, did the Prosecutor in the instant case produce a document such as a decree or an order, an instruction, signed by the authority called Mika Muhimana who was a conseiller de secteur.  In the case file, is there a public statement?  I ask this question because, so far, Mika's public is people hiding in the bush, sometimes 15 metres away, three metres away.  When can such a public be categorised as such, and when was a statement made to hidden people whom he didn't even see?  Can this fall on the public statements that could reveal the intention or the desire to exterminate Tutsis?  When did the Prosecutor raise Mika to the status of the accused who signed decrees in the Nuremberg case, made public statements loudly and in an intelligible manner?  When, for instance, did the Prosecutor produce a single tape recording in which 
	Mika Muhimana's voice was heard?  When did the Prosecutor produce even a single statement made by Mika and which was published by a newspaper, even an old newspaper at the time?  After almost 10 years of investigations by the Prosecutor, nothing was produced to that effect.  And the Defence is surprised that the Prosecutor persists in categorising Mika as a major personality, like those in Nuremberg.  Perhaps Mika could be compared to the accused I mentioned yesterday, the man called  Fritzsche, a man of honour and against whom there was direct and unquestionable evidence, but he could perhaps be compared to Fritzsche in the destiny that was reserved for him.  In fact, before the Nuremberg Tribunal, the Accused Fritzsche, who was a German radio commentator who was prosecuted for having falsified news and incited Germans to commit crimes against the Jews, he was nevertheless acquitted because the Tribunal considered that his post was not all that important; that by virtue of his position, he was not amongst those who could be regarded as having participated in the preparation of the campaign against the Jews.  The second reason which I had to give yesterday, but which was put off until today, is that the accused was considered as an anti-Semite, but the Tribunal acquitted him because his statements did not lead to persecution; these statements did not lead to what happened to the Jews.  Furthermore, the massacres for which he was tried were not known to him.  

I laid a lot of emphasis on this Nuremberg Tribunal, Madam President, for a very simple reason.  To my knowledge, the Nuremberg Tribunal was the first international jurisdiction to try the most serious crimes which were known in the status as crimes against peace, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Furthermore, its case law was raised by the international assembly to the rank of international criminal law.  These major principles were recommended as rules of law to the international community, and these are the principles that are at the heart of the code on crimes against peace and preservation of humanity prepared by the International Law Commission.  It is, therefore, very important that we should pay particular attention to the manner in which that Tribunal tried the first international humanitarian crimes in modern times.  In the same vein and following or concurrently with the activities of the Nuremberg trial -- tribunal, tribunals established under Control Council law number 10, the allies expressed themselves regarding genocide and they identified in the adoption and enforcement of decrees aimed at exterminating a group use of the judicial system for this purpose, mass killings in concentration camps or conducting medical experiments to find the best way of destroying the reproductive capacity of the targeted groups.  In all these acts, they identified genuine genocide, because all those acts were part of the genocidal policy of extermination.  The American military tribunal of Nuremberg laid down the principle that for an accused to be found guilty of genocide, the following evidence must be adduced:  Evidence of a policy of racial persecution and extermination, and that the conduct of the accused was aimed at implementing such a policy.  

I state all this, Madam President, in a view to convince you that the duty of the Prosecutor in the instant case should consist in establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused consciously participated in a plan and that he did so actively.  

The last aspect on this prerequisite ingredient in genocide should be sought in the spirit of the convention on genocide in the sense that the charges should always bear in mind that since genocide is the mother of all crimes it should never be trivialised.  The definition of genocide should not be stretched arbitrarily.  We should avoid making genocide a catchall and accusing people arbitrarily.  In so doing, we would be trivialising that offence.  Genocide should not be restricted solely to the material aspects, as this would be a major departure from the spirit of the convention which was condemned in the most unambiguous terms.  In view of the conduct of those who had real authority but who abused it by concealing off and preparing and implementing plans for the destruction of human groups, in whole or in part, it would be difficult, or I would say it was difficult -- it was even insurmountable for the Prosecutor to establish that this conseiller of Gishyita secteur was one of those who designed, prepared and implemented the plan for the destruction of Tutsis.  I would like to explain to the Court that for us to understand how impossible it was, we should bear in mind the fact that the Accused was illiterate, and that he only went as far as primary school, and that such an achievement was impossible for him.  

I now come to the actus reus of genocide to say a couple of words.  The actus reus of genocide was defined by the 1948 Convention as concisely and as precisely as is required in criminal law.  As a matter of fact, as ICTR rightly observed in its first genocide judgement, the crime of genocide is committed when one of the acts referred to in Article 2.2(a) of the Statutes has been committed.  The material ingredients of genocide are expressly provided for in the ICTR Statute, and this list of material acts in the ICTR Statute are culled from the genocide convention which is part of customary law.  I will go through the list.  A --
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, we have read your brief.  It is not necessary for you to go through all the jurisprudence which you have expounded in your brief.  You should just summarise your submission.  For example, you are talking about the actus reus of genocide and you are going to tell us the physical acts that constitute genocide.  All of them have been listed -- you are about to enumerate them.  All of them have been listed in your brief and we have read them.  So if you want to make a submission that the Prosecution has not -- has not met any of those ingredients, just make that submission.  But take it for granted that we have read the jurisprudence which you have clearly articulated in your brief, and then move on. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Your Honour.  I will do my best whenever it is possible to spare you a reading of what is already in the brief, but I wanted to get to what is important.  

Apart from this explicit list of acts, the Prosecutor prepared an indictment which has no relation to any of the material acts defined in Article 2.2.  That is why I conclude that since he did not do this and expressly or involuntarily violated the principles of legality since he didn't read the exact categorisation, the Prosecutor places the Accused in a position in which he is unable to defend himself, and we propose that the Chamber should dismiss count 1 and, in the alternative, count 2 in the indictment, which have to do with genocide and complicity in genocide.  

Your Honours, I was talking about the material acts.  I have not started talking of intent.  However, as Your Honour has paid homage to the quality of our brief as far as all these elements of law are concerned, indeed at the time when that was written and read, there was -- there's no reason why we should dwell on them, Your Honours.  I trust your discretion.  I will not read any passages by heart when I have them before me and I can read them.  

With your leave, therefore, we can talk about crimes against humanity.  In this regard, I believe I have expressed my opinion sufficiently and very clearly on the points of law.  But I would like to point out that yesterday, Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor referred to paragraph 125, if I noted it correctly, that there was a convergence of views between the Defence and the Prosecution as far as the gravity of the crimes are concerned and as far as justification of the sentence that should be applied is concerned.  He cannot rely on my opinion in proposing what sentence should be imposed.  The crimes are serious.  I agree with him.  But those serious crimes were not committed by Mika, so a serious intent cannot be applied to my client.  

Madam President, following the discussions that were raised yesterday and the day before yesterday, based on the definition of rape, based on Akayesu case law, I would just like to draw the 
	Trial Chamber's attention to the fact that the Defence is in entire agreement with the definition given by the Prosecutor and considers that any act of physical penetration of a sexual nature committed on another party by force is considered as rape.  

Before going further, I would also like to say something on the indictment.  We have already expressed the principles, but it is the Prosecutor who has enriched the discussion.  The day before yesterday, he said -- Madam Prosecutor stated that from the time she became aware of the Ntakirutimana judgement, she had set aside all allegations that did not appear in the indictment.  We are of the opinion that this is the only possible avenue of law, and we are grateful for that.  And we of the Defence will try to set aside the confusion about the indictment that was obvious yesterday.  We would like to return to allegations that are not -- or we would not like to return to charges not in the indictment which are raised because they seem to -- they are claimed to be based on new information.  The indictment was amended on the 22nd of January 2004, and since that time the Defence has not received disclosure of any proof.  All the material that could have been invented, discovered, added during the pre-trial brief, I should say in this regard that the Defence and the 
Trial Chamber should ignore them because your case law provides, at the very most, that the pre-trial brief may provide clarification, but the pre-trial brief cannot be used as an opportunity to modify or to amend the indictment.  Similarly, I heard the Prosecutor insisting on the fact that on his statement that allegations or charges that would be removed from the indictment could be used as evidence to establish the existence of a deliberate line of conduct.  The Defence would like to point out that it opposes this procedure because the existence of a deliberate pattern of conduct is considered under Rule 93 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence which provides as follows:  Evidence which enables the determination of a deliberate pattern -- consistent pattern of conduct which includes serious violations of international humanitarian law as per the statutes may be admitted in the interests of justice.  Any acts which tend to demonstrate the existence of such a pattern of conduct shall be disclosed to the Defence by the Prosecutor under Rule 66.  I shall end with a quote.  This means that for the Defence the Prosecutor must produce -- disclose a document establishing such acts.  He cannot resort to referring the Trial Chamber and the Defence to Prosecution statements or witness statements to identify these acts, nor can he refer the Defence and the Trial Chamber to the ramblings and the sudden inspiration of Prosecution witnesses who remember rapes and murder for the very first time when they come to give evidence before the 
Trial Chamber.  It is therefore the Prosecutor's duty to provide proof that such disclosure has been made with a view to establishing the existence of a consistent pattern of conduct.  

To conclude on this matter, I should like to say that the first indictment was issued on the 22nd of November 1995.  That is over nine years ago.  What are these -- what is this new material that would surprise the Prosecutor to the extent that he would try to convince the Trial Chamber that they should be considered in the interests of justice?  Nine years after, what is this material that could not be included when the indictment was being amended?  Madam President, Your Honours, this is therefore an attempt either to distract the Court or to distract the Defence, and in any case it cannot be considered as to seeking to establish the truth because the truth has been there for nine years.  

With your leave, Madam President, Your Honours, I shall now move on to factual conclusions.  I shall not bring up anything new.  If the Trial Chamber assures me that they have read the introduction, especially Montesque's sentence which states that natural equity requires that the degree of evidence be proportionate to the magnitude of the charge --
JUDGE SHORT:
(Microphone not activated) ... that we have read and taken note of that statement.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And anything which hasn't been read will be read.  So don't worry, we are not throwing these things away as soon as we finish. 
MR. SONGA:
In return, Madam President, Your Honours, I shall make an effort -- that I will try to limit myself to innovations and additions, and I shall not focus on what has already been written.  

Madam President, we now come to the indictment itself.  I am referring to paragraph 5 of the indictment.  As introduction, each time I shall read the terms of the indictment, even if they have already been included in the closing briefs.  "These are the terms of our reasoning.  
Mikaeli Muhimana intended to destroy the ethnic Tutsi group or the Tutsi ethnic group as such.  By virtue of his authority, he both individually, and acting in concert with others, caused many Tutsis to be killed."  In this paragraph, I contest the clause attributed to Mika Muhimana.  I developed my arguments based on the Rwandan law to organised communes yesterday.  And as to the facts, we referred to the Akayesu case where it is stated that the bourgmestre is the most important or powerful person in the commune and, on the contrary, the conseillers could not be that powerful.  We would like to speak out against the Prosecutor's general trend, wishing to make Mika appear to be a powerful man, stronger or at least as strong or as powerful as the bourgmestre, and whom he has described as a member of the interim government based on a government -- a list of government members which has never been shown, and this is an incorrect statement in any case.  Still within the same paragraph, I believe I can say that the Prosecutor could have been more exhaustive in respect of the persons living in Rwanda.  He should have referred not only to the Hutus and the Tutsis but also the Twas, which were described -- who were described by AV in his testimony before this Trial Chamber.  

In paragraph 5(i), Madam President, we would like to refer to the distribution of weapons in Kiziba using the terms of the indictment itself.  "On the 8th of April 1994 -- or on or around the 8th of April 1994, Mika Muhimana and other people, including Charles Sikubwabo, mobilised civilians and gendarmes and commune policemen at the Kiziba commercial centre and gave them weapons, arms and ammunition for the purpose of killing Tutsi civilians.  The said arms and ammunition were deployed to exterminate the Tutsi population in Gishyita and Gisovu communes."  To support this accusation, the Prosecutor called Witnesses AP, W, BI, BB and BC, if I remember correctly.  And it so happens that Witness BB does not say at any point that Mika distributed weapons.  However, he does say that he saw Mika out in a crowd of 200 people, that he was carrying a gun and that he was shooting at Tutsis.  He does not name any victim.  He says the events occurred on the 9th of April, on which date the Accused was watching over the mortal remains of his son who had died the evening before and who was to be buried the next day.  During the cross-examination, Witness BB stated that it was the policeman Rwingimba who was leading the attacks, burning the houses of Tutsis in Kiziba and shooting at Rwakayiru.  This appears in the transcripts of that session.  As to determining how Mika arrived in Kiziba, may I have your ears, Your Honours.  Witness BB has two versions.  The first version says this.  I shall quote from the transcript.  "In Kiziba we found him there, and on the road there was a motorcycle.  There were two people on that motorcycle.  There was Mika and another person whom I did not know."  That is the first version.  But the main point is that we found him at Kiziba, as the witness says.  When the Defence asked him to provide further clarifications, this is what he said.  This is the second version.  The Defence says to him, "Let us try not to answer several questions at once.  When Mika came on a motorcycle, did he meet you?"  And BB answers, "Yes.  He found us there."  First, for Witness BB, in one version he and his family met Mika in Kiziba, and in the other version it is Mika who came on a motorcycle and found them there.  This is a witness who makes two contradictory statements after taking an oath to tell the truth.  What credibility can be attached to this witness?  I know enough of the case law of the Tribunal and the indulgence which is extended to witnesses who have lost their memory, but there are inconsistencies that cannot be ascribed to time.  Whatever the number of years, such situations cannot be confused.  Witness BB could not have seen Mika on the 9th of April in Kiziba because Mika was not there.  In any case, I have read out this passage of the indictment for a reason.  A close reading would show that the Prosecution or the indictment is based on the distribution of weapons in Kiziba and not on murders that may have been committed in Kiziba.  If the Prosecution intended to charge with murder or massacre -- to charge my client with murder or massacre, he would have been explicit and would have indicated the scene of the crime, precisely where the murder took place, by indicating the place, by indicating the identity of the victims in the indictment, and he would have indicated other circumstances that would have given the Accused room for defence.  In the particular case of the scene of the crime, you will agree with me, Madam President, Your Honours, that reference to the communes of Gishyita and Gisovu is not precise enough to enable the Accused to put up a defence.  The Prosecutor should have indicated the scenes both in Gishyita and Gisovu communes.  As to the weapons and ammunition distributed by Mika, the Prosecution did not indicate to the Trial Chamber the type of weapons and the quantity.  What did Mika distribute?  Missiles?  Missiles?  Kalashnikov guns?  Clubs?  Machetes?  Pangas?  What exactly did Mika distribute?  And how much of that was there and to how many people did he distribute it?  What is more, the Prosecution did not attempt to establish whether or not these weapons were used on such a date, at such a place, by such a person to kill Tutsis.  This is nine years after the initial indictment.  Madam President, Your Honours, what credit can be attached -- what credibility can be attached to Witness BB and how can the Prosecution theory which has not established anything whatsoever be believed, especially in respect of 
paragraph 5 of the indictment?  No Prosecution witness could answer these questions, be it AB who never referred to the distribution of weapons in Kiziba, nor can it be W who refers to an attack on the 8th of April in Dukoni and who claims that Mika was with the assailants there, but we can see that Dukoni is definitely not Kiziba.  BI does not refer to the distribution of weapons in Kiziba.  In short, I saw no witness who answered any of these questions.  

First, we must say that the Prosecution who has tried for nine years has not succeeded to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the charges in paragraph 5(a) of the amended indictment as we have understood it.  I might even say that in the statements of Defence witnesses, we have further reason to understand why the Prosecutor was unable to establish these factual matters beyond a reasonable doubt.  I shall not quote all the Defence witnesses because I have written all of this down.  However, I should like to refer to a comment made by the Prosecution regarding the testimony of Witness DM.  DM had stated, regarding the distribution of weapons in Kiziba, that at that location no distribution took place because the inhabitants of this place were illiterate shepherds.  Their work were cow herds; their work was to herd cows.  There were no literate people; there were only the soldiers of Habyarimana's army.  What did the Prosecutor try to do?  How did he try to use this passage?  He tried to suggest that DM stated that Kiziba was inhabited by soldiers, first seeking to insinuate perhaps that Mika Muhimana tried to supply the soldiers with weapons and ammunition.  This is so unrealistic, but honestly, logically, based on common sense and good reason, can a conseiller of a secteur be the best person to supply Habyarimana's army with weapons and ammunition?  I think that DM should have been understood to be saying that only the Habyarimana soldiers were carrying weapons, and these soldiers did not need to be supplied with weaponry by a civilian in order to hold a front.  That is my first clarification from the Defence witnesses.  

Regarding Witness DT, I should like to point out that he also stated that he was in Dukoni on the 
9th of April to stop the aggression in Bisesero.  However, Mika was not there and that he instead saw him at Mika's home.  Mika had stayed at home while they went up.  This is corroborated by 
Witness DI who also states that he was in Dukoni on the 9th of April but that Mika was not there.  

I would like to add one testimony by AF, a Prosecution witness.  When AF gave testimony before the Trial Chamber, he was questioned on the events of the 9th of April, and the answer of this witness was that he was not aware of attacks in this region, and the witness adds that he had had no information to that effect.  

I shall end with one last remark on this matter of Kiziba, Madam President.  I would like to say that the Prosecution sought to charge Mika Muhimana with genocide and, in the alternative, complicity in genocide, and that this was made possible through the powers that were vested in him.  We have already demonstrated that these powers were small and limited.  We might also add that during the events these powers were null.  What I would like to say, however, is that the role of Mika which has been increased or out of hand by the Prosecutor is not obvious in the events that occurred in his own secteur.  If Mika was a genocidaire, based on the powers that were vested in him as a 
conseiller de secteur, I think that these powers would have been exercised in Gishyita secteur.  But the Prosecutor has found nothing, nothing at all.  He has tried, by all means, to cling desperately to something.  Nothing happened in Gishyita in Mika Muhimana's secteur.  We can look at the case file.  Nothing happened in his secteur.  So why would this powerful man who is unable to exercise his power in his own secteur, why would the Prosecutor want to take him to Mubuga, Mugonero and Bisesero where his power could not be established either in law or in fact?  

Madam President, Your Honours, this is why I shall ask you to listen carefully to those who say -- for those who wish to say that they were there when the Prosecutor wishes to locate Mika but that Mika himself was not there.  That is the explanation.  Why did Mika not start with the Tutsi population of Gishyita?  Why did he go elsewhere to attack Tutsis there?  This is well nigh impossible.  

We now move on to paragraph 5(b).  Everything has been written down.  What I can say is that the witnesses cited by the Prosecutor, that is AV, or one of the witnesses, Witness AV, never supported this allegation.  Perhaps the Prosecutor was a bit distracted when he tried to delete the allegations that had no proof.  He should have deleted this one as well.  But in his response he might ask the 
Trial Chamber to delete this allegation.  In his rebuttal he might ask the Trial Chamber to delete this allegation.  

In paragraph 6 it is the looting of food in Mubuga parish that is at issue.  I will say in that case also that everything has already been written down.  I should however like to return to Witness DC, the cherished witness of the Prosecution, who stated that he saw Mika on the scene but he did not see him steal or kill.  

Similarly, I should like to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to the credibility of Witness AF.  As far as credibility is concerned, I would like to insist or emphasise the contradiction between the testimony of AF who saw the assailants from Mubuga come on foot and the testimony of AV who saw the Accused arrive in a Suzuki Jeep that was blue in colour.  I know that the argument of the Prosecutor is that Rwandans didn't have watches and they could not make the distinction between various things, including distances.  But to confuse trekking with arriving in a Jeep is something really outrageous.  

Let us now come to the distribution of firearms in Mubuga Catholic church.  Again, in this matter, Madam President, in line with your instructions, I would say that everything is well written in the brief.  However, we cannot avoid making reference to the testimony of Witness AV who did not see 
Charles Sikubwabo and Mika distributing weapons.  I would even draw the Court's attention to Witness AV's inability -- that is the girl whose intelligence was hailed.  She talked of having seen cattle with her own eyes but she couldn't give the size of that cattle and the quantity of its contents.  I called Defence witnesses to corroborate the argument of the Defence that there was no distribution of weapons in Mubuga Catholic church.  

Madam President, if we proceed at this rate, such as said by you, I will be through in 30 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Merci. 
MR. SONGA:
I hope you don't take my word for it.

We are dealing with the attack at Mubuga Catholic church.  Everything has practically been written in this brief, but I would like to emphasise the fact that the two witnesses, AV and AF, that their testimonies are marked by contradictions, and that all that should be taken into consideration is as stated in the brief.  These witnesses will go back on what they say regarding other allegations in the same sites.  Let me simply make reference to AF who states that Mika Muhimana sent him on an implied use to work with Interahamwe in the forests.  I would like to say that all this is a bundle of lies, all the more so as Nungwe forest is not in Gishyita commune, nor is it in Gishyita préfecture, but rather in Gikongoro.  To get to Nungwe they had to cover almost 200 kilometres, either by crossing Cyangugu préfecture or by crossing Gitirama préfecture and Butare préfecture to get to Gikongoro.  And, lastly, once you get to Gikongoro préfecture they would have had to continue to get to Nungwe forest.  In any case, this matter is unmentioned in the indictment, and the Chamber therefore has to make absolutely no findings on this matter.  

When I (sic) read my brief, Your Honours, you will find -- in reading my brief, Your Honours, you will find that Witness AF stated that Mika was at the same time chief or the leader of the CDR and leader of Impuzamugambi.  But yesterday, in referring to this, the Prosecutor said yesterday that Mika was a member of the MRND, which is, by the way, true of all Rwandans at the time.  Since the government was one party, it was a one-party state.  I would also like to point out that --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor?  Is it correct that in '94 all Rwandese were MRND?  The government of one party had long ceased.  The MRND government as a single-party government had ended well before 1994.  Is that not the correct position? 
MR. SONGA:
You are right, Your Honours.  This will enable me to make the clear distinction, because there was the advent of multi-party politics in the meantime.  Some people joined new parties, but those who did not join the new parties are supposed to have remained in MRND.  That is why we consider that Mika was a member of the MRND.  So I am not trying to change the course of history.  I thank you for the clarification.  

I was therefore saying that to assess the evidence of Witness AF, the two statements which are at odds should be considered, and this will enable the Bench to understand the calibre of the witness they are dealing with.  

I would also like to talk about Defence witnesses who testified in respect of the attack at 
Mubuga church.  I would like to say something regarding Witness DZ.  When he was asked the question as to the circumstances under which he used to see or knew Mika Muhimana, that witness stated that he knew Mika Muhimana -- let me repeat the question that was asked.  "Why did you know Mika Muhimana and not the other conseillers?"  The witness's explanation was as follows.  He said that he first knew Vincent Rutaganira, who was the conseiller of his secteur, but as regards Mika he stated that he knew him because he was conseiller of Gishyita secteur.  I would like to point out that Gishyita is not a secteur like the others.  It is in fact a key secteur in Gishyita commune.  That is why DZ was able to go there regularly and therefore was able to know that conseiller, even though he wasn't the conseiller of his secteur.  In short, after listening to the evidence of both Defence and Prosecution witnesses regarding the attack at Mubuga, the Defence requests the Chamber to find that the Prosecutor did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt the -- that the allegation regarding the attack at Mubuga Catholic church was not well founded.

Accordingly, we can talk about the attack at Mugonero complex.  As regards this paragraph, 5(c) of the indictment, the Prosecutor called Witnesses BJ, DG to testify against Mika Muhimana.  He also called Witness AT.  One of the questions that we asked ourselves, one of the issues that came to mind, is notice of the fact that the Prosecutor makes reference to Kayishema; whereas Prosecution witnesses do not refer to him.  For instance, Witness DH mentions Mika, Sikubwabo and Ruzindana.  And so we wonder why they do not make mention of Kayishema.  And that question was put to the witness: "Witness, were there only three people, the three people you referred to?"  The witness's answer was:  "He was not alone.  He was accompanied by many Interahamwe and soldiers I did not know.  I couldn't know the names of all those people, but what I noticed was that there were many of them, and they had surrounded the area."  I would like to point out that Kayishema was not just anybody.  He was the préfet of Kibuye préfecture.  However, the same witness refers to Kayishema as regards to his sighting in Muyira, and he states he was the préfet of Kibuye.  If we think carefully, we will find that BH was in Mugonero, and if he showed that Kayishema was in Mugonero, 
Witness BH would therefore have seen, and if he did not see Mika, it means that Witness BH was not there.  

Witness BG -- all this is written but I want to add something to what is written.  This is the notorious witness who states that he was -- that there was so much blood in Mugonero hospital and that the blood quenched the fire from the petrol that was thrown by the assailants to burn the area.  And I will say that it is pure lies because it goes against nature.  We've heard of planes that were destroyed with 500 passengers, like the Israeli airlines which fell on Amsterdam.  The blood of the 500 people on board that plane was not able to quench the fire, unless such Rwandan blood is particular.  

I would like to say something as regarding BG.  BG made prior statements before appearing before the Court, and the Defence identified so many inconsistencies, and yet the Prosecutor vehemently supported what he said and even referred to prior statements, saying that the inconsistencies were the result or the effect of traumas suffered in 1994 and that the witness had suffered some mental dementia.  The question which cannot be answered is this:  How do you know that -- in the meantime, he was killed.  How do you know that this time this witness was coming to tell the truth before the Chamber?  We believe that once we admit that the witness is sick, the witness should have produced a document to the effect that the witness had been healed and that he was now able to testify before the Chamber.  If we consider that there were traumas and we accept that he was sick in 1994, we must also find out whether he was healed.  This explains inconsistencies and accounts for the fact that the testimony should not be considered as credible and reliable, and consequently the Chamber should discard BG's evidence.  This is supported by BG's statement, which we analysed, particularly in light of the charge of rape as a crime against humanity.  

We should also talk about Witness BI.  The following question was put to Witness BI regarding his presence in the church.  This is a question the Prosecutor put to him.  "Did the members of your family accompany you to the church?"  And this was his answer, which is not at all appropriate, as mentioned.  "During the attack on the 16th of April, two of my sisters escaped that massacre but I didn't see them.  Among family members I was able to see were my father who was shattered and he didn't die, so I took him away."  He did not answer the Prosecutor's question which insinuated that he was in the church.  The Defence, in cross-examination of this Witness BI, presented his written statement of the 25th of October 1999.  And in that statement we read the following, in which he confirmed that he was in the church, that he sought refuge in the church but that that did not prevent him from testifying to what happened in Mugonero hospital.  This is what he states regarding his stay in the church on the 15th of April.  I say it because it is not in my closing brief.  "Women married to Tutsis and employees who were working in the homes of Tutsis, staff members at the hospital came out; then they threw grenades into the church.  Survivors were killed with machetes.  I survived because I hid under bodies.  The church was packed.  There were still about a thousand refugees there.  Late in the night I came out of the church, I passed close to the church, and I heard my father call me."  This will be the cornerstone of the Prosecution's argument, and it is used by the Prosecutor to say that he saw everything regarding the killings in the church.  And the Prosecutor relies on this to qualify Mika as rapist number one in the 1994 events that occurred in Rwanda.  

I would also like to dwell somewhat on Defence Witness BH, Madam President.  In reading his statement before the Chamber, I was very worried with the attitude and the arrogance of this witness, his bad faith and tendency to tell lies.  From the very outset of the cross-examination, the question as to whether he had already made a statement or given a statement to an ICTR investigator, the witness said that people came and met him and asked him questions, and that he was not in a position to say who those people were, and he wants us to believe him.  When the Defence showed him his statement of the 11th of November 1999, Witness BH is reluctant to recognise his signature.  "Even if I recognised this signature, whereas I'm not the person who prepared this document, I cannot be sure of its contents.  I am not the person who wrote down this statement.  Perhaps my signature features on this document.  However, if I had been -- if I was the person who wrote down this statement, I would help you, but I'm not the person who wrote it down."  This is a witness who challenges a document prepared by investigators and which is very important in respect of the charge against the Accused, and the witness goes on to say such that the Chamber called him to order at least ten times.  The witness said, Madam President -- Madam President said, "You should answer all questions as by Defence counsel as you did in the examination-in-chief."  The President told him again, "If you know the answer, give the answer.  If you do not know it, say so, as well, but you must answer the question."  The Chamber made the following remark to Witness BH:  "Mr. Witness, if the Professor puts a question to you and you don't want to answer it, the Tribunal has to tell you so.  The questions that he is putting to you have been put by the Chamber.  You should give an answer to the Tribunal unless the Tribunal decides otherwise."  To that comment -- that is a wise comment by the Tribunal.  This is the answer of Witness BH.  "I will answer that question if it's convenient for me to do so."  When the Defence put to him his statement of November 1999 as to who were the members of his family that had taken refuge at Mugonero, he retracts his statement by saying that maybe the person who wrote down the statement made a mistake. 
(Pages 1 to 14 by Leslie Todd)


























	1100H
MR. SONGA: (Continuing)
Having talked about the Interahamwe, who during the events were supervising the Lake Kivu vicinity, the question was put to BH if he saw the Interahamwes with his own eyes, and this is his answer: "I don't know if this is the case which is bringing us together here.  I am talking about events that took place at the hospital.  I must not give answers concerning Lake Kivu because Lake Kivu is not of concern."  Madam President had to call him to order by asking him once again to answer the question.  

When the Defence counsel asked him to confirm his statement, in connection with Kagaba and Mathias who were employees at the Mugonero hospital, who were leading the assailants and were carrying weapons, this is the answer that Witness BH gave:  "But those people are not present here.  It is not necessary to dwell on those persons unless you must have arrested them."  Madam President had once again to step in to ask him to merely answer the questions that were put to him.  

And to your questions regarding his statement of 11th November 1999, his answer made the President to tell him the following:  "Mr. Witness, once again, we would like that you address the questions that are put to you.  Please refrain from making comments in respect of those questions."  

Faced with such arrogance and bad faith, the President made the same comments a few moments later. "Mr. Witness, please give brief and concise answers and refrain from telling long stories."  

Whereas Witness BH had just retracted his statement of 11th November 1999, regarding the 
so-called cloakroom of the operation room, which was the hiding place that he used, the President was compelled to tell him the following: "Mr. Witness, why, therefore, can't you give brief and straightforward answers?"  When the Defence made his contradictions clear to him, the contradictions between his statement of 11 November 1999 and those that he made before the Chamber on the persons that were carrying firearms, Witness BH started relating a long story that was unnecessary and inappropriate as following: "Please, do not dwell on that statement.  Listen, I am not the one who committed that statement to paper, and the interpreter could have written down just anything.  I did not know that interpreter.  I don't know if he actually wrote down my statements as I made them, but here I am telling you that those who were carrying firearms were Gérard and Mika; the others were carrying other weapons.  I couldn't identify them clearly.  Now, if this witness who wrote down that statement and if I knew how to read and write, I would be in a position to answer your question."  

Here, once again, Madam President fulfilled her duty by enjoining Witness BH to answer the question. The Defence is asking Witness BH, if on the Muyira hill, amongst the persons with whom he was hiding there were some whose names he knew, and this is his answer.  "There is no need to know their names since they were dead.  I know that there were people who were with me.  Whether I can give you their names or not, since these people are dead, how can that be of any use to you?" It is at this point that Honourable Judge Muthoga enjoined the witness.  "Mr. Witness, please try to make an effort, avoid going astray in your statements.  Please help us to expedite matters; avoid making those long and unending explanations."  

And later, Madam President called him once again to order. "Mr. Witness, you are too talkative.  I think now you should understand that your long answers call for questions that are not useful.  Please try to be concise in your answers."  Now, this is Witness BH whose statements will be useful in assessing his personality and in determining the weight to be given to his testimony.  As far as we of the Defence are concerned, our conviction is made up.  Witness BH, with all the contradictions that we have pointed out to you in writing and with what I have just read to you, and regarding his arrogance before this Chamber, Witness BH cannot be deemed to be credible at any rate.  And when you reach his relation concerning the attack on Mugonero, he says things that are unbelievable.  For instance, he says when there were lapses of fire explosions, explosions of grenades and people who were cutting down others with machetes, he claims that he went there at ESI, and that is where the assailants found him.  ESI is the Mugonero nursing school.  He claimed that this is where the assailants found them, and that is where his family was, and that is where the members thereof were killed.  But forgetting what he had just said, he continues by saying that his family was killed at the hospital, as if the ESI, that is the nursing school, and the hospital were one and the same location.  

BH went to the basement of the hospital where he got there in the evening.  There was still daylight, but it was around the evening.  The basement became a surgical unit.  He was lying down there, but he was able to see three young girls enter another room which had a door that opened to the operating room.  If we have to sum up his inconsistencies and contradictions, what are we going to retain?  If the attack began at 9 o'clock in the morning, how could the witnesses and the Prosecutor explain that BH reached his hiding place only in the evening?  How can BH confuse the nursing school and the hospital, whereas everything points to the fact, including the statement made by the Prosecution expert, Lucassen, that the nursing school is different from the hospital?  I am talking about his family.  How can his family be at the same time in the hills, at the nursing school and at the hospital all at the same time?  If the basement means the operating room and that the girls were in another room, this would mean that they were not in the operating room or in the surgical unit or room.  He therefore could not be an eyewitness of what happened to the girls at a location where he wasn't.  Certainly, this is a witness who, unfortunately, we will be meeting in other locations, but he will also exhibit the same weaknesses.  

As for the Bisesero location, we also think that we are going to dwell a bit on the love for the Tribunal's work which has made it possible for us to read from the beginning to the end, and we will talk about other locations that are devoted to other Bisesero hills.  This is, we saw the massacres of Tutsi civilians at Uwingabo as stated by witnesses W and BI. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how much more time would you take to conclude your submissions? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am still talking about the first and second counts.  So we are far from being in a position to assess when I will wrap up so long as I haven't started talking about the two other counts; these are rape as a crime against humanity and murder as a crime against humanity.  And believe you, me, I am doing all, as you must have noticed, to talk only about innovations. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then we will take a short break for 15 minutes. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
(Court recessed from 1115H to 1147H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed.  

Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I think we took our break when we were mentioning the massacre of 20 Tutsi civilians in Uwingabo.  The Prosecutor referred to Witness BI, Witness W.  For Witness W, we shall refer to what I have written down.  For Witness BI, what has been said before has demonstrated to what extent his testimony is lacking in credibility.  

In respect of the Nyarutovu attack, I shall also refer you to the written brief, except for the fact that I would like to add a word in this respect.  I would like to say that Witness BB, who talked about victims, especially in Ngendombi, I believe this is on paragraph 192 of my written brief, and I would like to add a word to that.  Witness BB is not at all clear as to the identity of victims, especially when he talks about a certain Camile Ndayimana, who is one person and uses the very names, that is Ndayimana and Camile to refer to two different persons.  

Witness BB states that he and his fugitive companions found the body of Camile on the 9th of 
April 1994.  The Defence confronted him with his own written statements, where he says that this event took place the following day.  "It is on the next day that we found the body of a certain Camile who was amongst the fugitives."  But BB talks to the date of 9th of April without further explanation.  
We should also note that this witness claims that he was 20 metres away from Mika and so it is difficult to explain that he was not killed by this man who was carrying a firearm and who was hunting Tutsis.  

For the attacks on Gitwa, Kabakobwa, Kanyinya and Ngendombi hills, I shall refer you to the written brief.  For the attacks on Gitwa and Muyira hills -- I shall come back to the credibility of Witness BH.  I would like to point out in this regard that -- to point out his bad faith -- because under the pretext that he could neither read nor write, he did not wish to recognise his signature which was on his statement of 11th of November 1999, because we the Defence, feel that whether one can read or write and write or not, an honest man who is credible and of good faith, who has freely appended his signature to a document cannot react like this, especially if he has taken an oath to tell the truth.  

Still in regard to Witness BH, he gives the distance that separated him from Mika.  "There was a small stream that was between us.  It was not far.  We were surrounded on all sides.  I could see him as I can see you here before me."  First, from the distance which is the breadth of a riverbed, from a distance that separated the Prosecutor from the witnesses, surrounded on all sides, Witness BH was able to spend the entire 13th day of May calmly watching the actions of an armed man who was carrying a gun, who was busy exterminating Tutsis, and he BH survived this.  From the distance that we have mentioned, Witness BH was not only facing an armed man, but other armed men as well.  He refers to, amongst others, Ruzindana, Kayishema, many other Interhamwes and soldiers, and Witness BH survived at this place until evening.  What Judge could possibly believe such a story?  This statement should be set aside.  

We are still at Muyira hill.  Witness AF claims that he was on Muyira hill on the 13th of May, but did not stay there all day because there were attacks that drove him to various places.  He is the only witness who stated that the Tutsis were hunted by dogs.  That alone, should cast doubt on his testimony.  Indeed, that is why even the Prosecutor did not base his case on Witness AF, AF's testimony in regard to the events of Muyira because this witness lacked any credibility whatsoever.  

Witness BB states that Mika supposedly led an attack on Kigarama in the company of 150 people.  Kigarama is supposed to be a 15-minute walk away from Muyira and cannot therefore be confused with Muyira itself.  Kigarama does not appear in the amended indictment.  That means that nine 
years -- after nine years of investigation by the Prosecution, it has not been able to inform the Accused about the existence of this place and the actions that may have been committed there.  

Firstly, the Defence requests the Trial Chamber to draw -- make no findings on this matter.  In addition, the Defence would like to point out the inconsistencies and contradictions that start the testimony of Witness BB in regard to the events that are supposed to have happened in Kigarama.  

The Defence maintains that Witness BB did not witness the rape or murder of a woman called Mukabitega for several reasons.  The first reason is that Witness BB states himself, that the assailants, who were 150 in number, surrounded the victim and he himself was 50 metres away.  So he couldn't see Mukabitega under the circumstances, since between here and the assailants there were three bushes.  This applies also to Berth Mukalibanje, M-U-K-A-L-I-B-A-N-J-E, because 
Witness BB was not able to witness what happened because of the trees that reduced his view of the scene.  He himself states:  "I told you that after the departure of the Interhamwe, I left my hideout and I noticed that she had been killed horribly."  He adds, "They had surrounded this woman in a way that did not permit me to see what they did to her."  The third reason Witness BB gives two different versions as to whether he succeeded in identifying any of the assailants who were raping Mukabitega.  This is the first version:  "Apart from Mika who was leading the assailants and Kabanda and Sandayiheba" -- I shall spell Sandayiheba, S-A-N-D-A-Y-I-H-E-B-A.  So this is the first version:  
"Apart from Mika who was leading the assailants and Kambanda and Sandayiheba, I recognised no one else and they were many."  

Second version now:  Witness BB ends up stating clearly that he did not see the rape that he is giving testimony about, and his next statement shows that he saw neither the rape nor the murder of Mukabitega or Mukalibanje.  This is the passage of his statement of his testimony, rather. "What made me see that she had been raped after the assailants left, it was in the evening -- I tried to find out.  I tried to see what the situation was and I approached Therese Mukabitega.  I saw that her throat had been cut and that her skirt had been torn and that a stick had been driven into her private parts.  Some 10 metres away I saw the body of Mukalibanje who was lying down, her legs were spread out and her baby's body -- the baby who had been killed had been pushed up into her private parts as if the baby was having sex with its mother."  

In addition, it is important to highlight the passage of the testimony of Witness BB before the Trial Chamber, which should show again that the testimony of Witness BB is not reliable or credible.  BB states that in May 1994, when he was hiding in a bush in Gitwa cellule, Kigarama, in the company of his three-year old son, he heard the noise of a vehicle engine, a vehicle that was parked in Kanyinya about a kilometre away from his hiding place and he saw people coming down a hill.  This is an extravagant statement.  Although the acuity, the individual acuity of BB was not evaluated by a doctor, the Defence feels that to say that one can hear the noise of a car engine a kilometre away and still be able to perform the considerable feat of seeing people come down from the vehicle completely negates the credibility of the testimony.  

Witness W mentioned the events of Bisesero, but his testimony is neither reliable nor credible, if one takes account of a certain number of factors.  First, he contradicted himself regarding the Bisesero hill where he went for the first time.  Before the Trial Chamber, he stated that the first hill on which he took refuge was Nyirandaganu, whereas in the Kayishema case he mentioned Bisesero.  There is a hill called Bisesero, and it is on this hill that we -- it is to this hill that we went.  

Second factor:  In his previous written statements, he claims that he saw the Accused in Gitwa and Uwingabo in June 1994.  This is the statement of the 22nd of March 1995, 14th October 1997, and the 29th of August 2002.  These two statements indicate that Witness W saw Mika once and it was in June.  But before the Trial Chamber, suddenly, he claims that he saw him first in April and afterwards in June of 1994.  

Third factor:  Witness W claims to have seen Mika kill a baby by throwing the baby against a stone -- against a rock, whereas he had said nothing about this in his prior statements about the fate of the child's mother before he came to the Trial Chamber, and remembered that the mother also had been killed without saying by whom, and concludes that Mika was present when in Nyamurego, Ruzindana flushed out two young women and killed them after having cut off the breasts of one of them named Beatrice.  

In saying the foregoing, Witness W is telling tales because based on his own testimony before the Trial Chamber, the refugees were hiding in the mines and others were in the forest, and he 
Witness W, was not in the mines but he was hiding in a bush, which means in the forest.  He could therefore not give testimony as to what happened in the mines because he wasn't there.  

Fourth factor: Witness W claims that Mika Muhimana killed his elder sister in Nyamurego, whereas in his prior statement of the 22nd of March 1994, he gives the list of victims of an attack and at no time did he say that he witnessed the death of an elder sister.  What is more -- you will remember the Defence had asked the witness expressly to state whether he was an eyewitness to the murder of each of the 10 victims that are on the list, and it was a surprise.  In the end, he only claims that he was an eyewitness in two cases; the death of or murder of number 4 and who was his uncle, and the death of number 10 who was also his uncle.  But at no time does he give the circumstances of the death in these statements, whereas he claims that number 10 was the father of the child that Mika supposedly threw against the rock.  

As to the elder sister, it has been proven that W never witnessed her murder.  We can understand the foregoing when we learn that Witness W is part of the gang of Pascal Ngusi, who is still greedy and wishes to keep Mika's property at the expense of truth and justice.  
To conclude, the witness -- the Defence considers that Witness W is not credible and that his testimony should be set aside because it is not reliable.  Through the testimony of W, the Prosecutor has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the events alleged to have taken place in Kiziba, Nyarutovu, Ngendombi, Gitwa and Uwingabo.  Let us add that this event took place on the 9th of April, the date apparently which the Defence is asking or is requesting the Chamber to retain and to understand that that is the day following the death of Mika's son and the day that comes before -- the day on which the son was buried, and that it is unbelievable that Mika could have been found elsewhere other than at his house killing people.  

Witness BI, thus Prosecution Witness BI has already shown his or her limits, especially when he testified on the events at Mugonero.  And I don't think it is in reference to the Bisesero locations that he will do any better.  We have already requested from the Chamber that Witness BI should not be given any credibility, given the various lies, inconsistencies and contradictions that she has made.  

We are going to reiterate our request, and to support our request, we have an additional ground therefore.  We are talking about the chronology of events as related by that witness.  

With the leave of Madam President, although I am not a doctor in the sciences of movement, I have tried to imitate the Prosecution witness and I have also drawn a programme.  I don't know if we can read the chronology of the events as related by BI and in which we find various contradictions therein.  You do not have that in the brief that was filed.  I have made a request to the effect that the table be projected using the overhead projector.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you want this document to be placed on the projector?
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But this is in French.  Anywhere -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now will it go into our records?
MR. SONGA:
It may be entered into the record or not.  It is only a sketch of what is in the transcripts of 
30th April 2004.  It may be entered into the records or not. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why can't you read it into the record yourself? 
MR. SONGA:
I will be in a better position to read it if it were projected, and I think you will understand better if it were projected, especially as it is in French.  I will try to explain the table.  If we proceed horizontally, we have three parts to that table.  The first part gives an account of the testimony of BI as it appears in the transcripts of the 30th April 2004, on pages 18 and 19.  And the events allegedly followed the sequence shown, that is, there was first the murder of Thomas at the same time that BI was -- as BI fled.  This was the sixth time that Mika allegedly was met by BI.  Kanyinya is alleged to have been met by the witness at the same time that he was meeting Mika for the seventh time.  And, finally, BI met Mika for the eighth and ninth times respectively at Muyira on the 13th of May and at Muyira on the 14th of May again.  That's his explanation of the first column if read horizontally.  

Now comes the second column.  Still if you read it horizontally, and when we read the transcripts of 30th April 2004, what came before was Muyira, that is on the 13th and 14th of May.  And then came the murder of Thomas and on that same day, the witness, Witness BI fled.  So you can already see here that Muyira came before the death or the murder of Thomas and the flight of BI, whereas in the previous column, Muyira was the last event.  

Now, we move down to the third column, still doing a horizontal reading thereof, and this time around when we read the transcripts of 30th April 2004 on page 61 thereof, line number 6, the first event was the meeting of Kanyinya.  The second event was the murder of Thomas and the escape or flight of Witness BI.  And, finally, it is Muyira that intervenes on the 13th and the 14th of May.  This is a table which clearly shows the inconsistencies of BI's testimony, and the artificial nature of his testimony and the need for him to have us -- what he would have shown by having his testimony lose all credibility.  

And then we have the nine meetings with the witness.  I think this deserves some comments.  This is a man who was blessed by God, who had an appointment with death nine times and was able to survive for the ninth time and he wants us to believe him.  We will give his testimony the weight it deserves, but insofar as the Defence is concerned and on the basis of our assessment, I think the weight of his testimony is zero.  

Madam President, we will now move on to the massacre of the 2,000 persons in the entire 
Kibuye préfecture.  This portion of indictment also --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, which portion of the indictment?  
MR. SONGA:
That portion is on page 2004 (sic), paragraph 200 of my brief and it is at page 5 (d)(vii) of the indictment -- paragraph 5(d)(vii) of the amended indictment.  I was saying, therefore, 
Madam President, that I am sure that this portion was ignored by the Prosecutor when he was drawing from the indictment the allegations that have no grounds or proof.  It would suffice to read that portion to understand that it cannot have any place in criminal trial in an indictment.  

You reckon, for instance, Madam President, Your Honours, that the location of the crimes is called the entire Kibuye préfecture.  How does the Prosecutor expect or intend to address the legal concerns according to which the location of the crimes should be investigated?  Is it possible that 
Mika Muhimana, on a date in June, could be found on the entire territory of Kibuye massacring 
2,000 people?  How do you expect the Accused to defend himself against such a charge?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which portion of the indictment?  5(d)?
MR. SONGA:
I think I referred to the indictment that is paragraph 5(d)(vii).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't see that allegation on itself.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Your number 2,000, that is the only thing that is missing from that paragraph.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, it's not, Your Honour.  I disagree with that.  My learned friend seems to allude to the fact that not only do we mention the word "2,000", we also claim that his client was busy chopping up people throughout Kibuye préfecture, but that is not what that paragraph says. In actual fact, the allegation that is made there is that the Tutsis had been injured in attacks that took place throughout Kibuye préfecture before they congregated at the location where they were led out.  It is a misrepresentation of the facts. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are misinterpreting the paragraph, Professor.  Can you read the relevant paragraph loudly?  
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  This is what I have before me.  "On the 20th of June 1994 -- that is, on or around 20th June 1994, Mikaeli Muhimana, in the company of Oberd Ruzindana, lured Tutsi civilians who had been injured out of their hiding place in the course of attacks launched against civilians throughout Kibuye préfecture with the pretext that they were going to receive medication."  And the sentence continues:  "After the Tutsi civilians had come out from their hiding places, 
Mika Muhimana and Oberd Ruzindana brought armed assailants, including Interhamwe, gendarmes and soldiers to attack them.  The attack resulted in over 2,000 -- resulted in the killing of over 2,000 and the injuring of 1,000 or so others."
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Where exactly is it mentioned that he was killing 2,000 people all over Kibuye préfecture, considering that that paragraph is under the section saying Bisesero secteur -- Bisesero area?  Where is the inference that he was killing people throughout Kibuye préfecture? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I don't quite understand the objection raised by my learned  colleague.  I am not the one who talked about the 2,000 persons that were killed.  I have the same document; it is written even in Kinyarwanda.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, Counsel, just read the portion in Kinyarwanda.
MR. SONGA:
So I don't understand what the objection raised is about.  I am not Witness BH.  I can't say that.  I am not the one who drafted the indictment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, can you clarify the objection to the Professor?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, the objection simply is that my learned friend --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Counsel.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My learned friend seems to suggest to Your Honours that we claim that his client was involved in attacks on 2,000 people throughout Kibuye préfecture.  That is not correct.  Indeed, if you look at page 79 of his brief, at paragraph -- just above paragraph 200, that is the allegation that he makes and that's wrong.  There is no suggestion of that in the indictment. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I think what Professor Songa is saying is that how is he to investigate the allegations contained in this paragraph, in view of the wide area in which this event is supposed to have taken place?  If I understand his submission correctly, that is his point that these Tutsi civilians were led out of wherever they were attacked throughout Kibuye préfecture, and after they had come out of their hiding places Mika and Ruzindana brought armed attackers, including Interhamwe, gendarmes and soldiers, and attacked Tutsi civilians, killing over 2,000 and injuring 1,000 or so others.  And his submission is that, how was he going to be able to investigate this particular allegation having regard to the vagueness of the location in which these events took place?

	1230H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, if that is what you indeed understand by his submissions, then I would represent to Your Honours that that matter has been dealt with at length on page 72 of our closing brief at chapter 4, at paragraphs 326 and 327, and I remember that when I addressed the Court in relation to the events at Bisesero, rather than go into the particular evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, I chose to deal more with the vagueness of the area and proffered reasons why it may have been particularly difficult for Prosecution witnesses to pinpoint where they were located at each time:  First of all, that the attacks took place over three months, they were not native to the area of Bisesero, and just kept fleeing from hill to hill.  And that's why I actually outlined that because I appreciate, myself, that, you know, this Bisesero area has been difficult in all the Kibuye cases that I've prosecuted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I believe I am going to be indulgent again vis-a-vis the Prosecutor's thesis, if indeed that paragraph was limited to the Bisesero region, because an effort would have been made to limit the location so far as the alleged charges are concerned, but I deplore the fact that the location should be the entire Kibuye préfecture, which is the most important administrative subdivision in Rwanda.  It is an entire province that is designated as the location of the crimes.  

I believe, if I understood the construct and logic of the Prosecutor well, I don't know if we have to target all the attacks that took place on the Bisesero hill.  Those hills have already been mentioned in all the previous paragraphs.  We, therefore, did not need to add a paragraph that would talk about all the killings of Bisesero and that will mention the entire Kibuye préfecture.  

If it is an error, I think discussions are still on and the Prosecutor can withdraw that, and we make progress.  But if he maintains that paragraph, then I think I am entitled to make criticism thereto.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, my understanding of this paragraph, it doesn't give you the place where the luring took place.  It gives you the place where the civilians were injured.  The civilians were injured in various places within the Kibuye préfecture.  It doesn't say at which point in Kibuye or wherever else that the luring occurred.  That's what is not there.  

The passage seems to state that the injured had been injured in the course of attacks, several, not just one attack but several attacks, on Tutsis, which were taking place within the préfecture.  And these are the people who were persuaded to come out of their hiding to make them available for soldiers and gendarmes and Interahamwe to attack in the company of Obed Ruzindana. Now, what isn't stated is where the killing occurred. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, in my respectful submission, it is actually stated that the killings occurred in Kibuye, in Bisesero.  If you look at the heading of that section, it says, "The events in Bisesero area."  And we give the particulars.  So everything we allege under paragraph -- subparagraph D has to be assumed took place in the Bisesero area. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you have not specified the area in Bisesero hills.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We make no bones about that, and we've said that right from the opening statement that it is almost impossible to do so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that clear, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
It cannot be, Madam President, unless we state that it is clear that the Prosecutor was unable to designate the location of the crime.  That is what would be clear.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is clear and what the Prosecutor is saying, 2,000 civilians were not killed on the same day at the same place, at one moment.  Two thousand civilians were killed and approximately 1,000 others injured, within the Kibuye -- within Bisesero, at certain places within Bisesero, and he is not in a position to say it is place X in Bisesero because it is likely to be X, Y, Z, and so many other things that he is not able -- because of the mobility of the Tutsis hiding, because of the nature of the terrain of Bisesero, because of all those other factors which he is saying, he's not able to tell you exactly that these events took place on day 1, day 5, day 6, at four o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, at places 1, 2, 3, or 4.  And once he has said that, it is up to you now to leave it to us to understand it in the course of the rest of the evidence. 
MR. SONGA:
I understand your point, Your Honour.  I will make one little point before we move on.  If such is the explanation, all the passages of the indictment that came before made mention of various locations in Bisesero.  There is no reason why this paragraph should feature in the indictment because it will only be meaningful if it was a specific location, different from all the others that were mentioned earlier.  

Now, since we have to make a summary of the entire Bisesero, it appears that, of the 2,000 dead mentioned here, there are others who were counted in previous locations.  I believe intellectual honesty and humility in all we do requires the indictment or, rather, this paragraph 5(ii) subparagraph 7 should be expunged from the indictment, which goes over sites that were mentioned earlier. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, proceed with your arguments.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We have understood your argument, Professor, to be that this particular indictment defies investigation because of weakness.  That's all.  And that is one of the things we will take into consideration.  That's what we understand you to be saying.  If you are saying different, tell us. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank you.  Madam President, I therefore think no one has discounted my question.  To accuse someone of all sorts of crimes in Kibuye is a violation of law, unless the location is specific.  The location should be so clear and precise as to enable the Defence to investigate the charges and defend itself fully.  I also wish to point out that this passage in the indictment should be expunged from the indictment so that Mika Muhimana shouldn't be charged twice for the same offence. 

Lastly, I insist that this passage should be expunged from the indictment for the reason that Kibuye préfecture consists of five to six communes -- rather, nine communes, as my legal assistant has just whispered to me.  And to come here and allege acts supposedly committed by my client, acts which occurred in Gishyita commune, Gisovu commune and Mubuga commune, an arbitrary extension of the charges which would be a manifest violation of the rights of the Accused. 

In the alternative, the Defence has identified a certain number of inconsistencies and contradictions, but suffice it to mention a few aspects which do not feature in the closing brief.  

The Defence would like to highlight the passage in which AP is the only person to state that the commune had a red Toyota, thereby referring to a vehicle which never existed and which Mika therefore did not use.  His statement that Mika used such a vehicle has not been corroborated by any other witness.  This is certainly a pack of lies again which is a ploy traditionally used by AP, an obvious accomplice of Pascal Nkusi, whose policy is as proven by both Prosecution and Defence witnesses AH and BM.  These witnesses -- or this witness, this particular witness should not be taken seriously.  

For instance, AP claims that he saw Mika shoot at a certain Nyiranedy (phonetic) in Kanani .  This witness, who was a woman, stated to the Chamber that when she saw Mika, they fled.  When they saw Mika, they fled.  Yet, later on, she claims that she heard tom-tom beats.  She refused to draw near to the person who was delivering this message.  That person was Mika.  She came to obtain the drugs.  When she saw Mika, she fled.  And we do not understand why she went to get drugs, whereas she knew fully well that Mika was the one who had issued the message.  Why did she go there and yet decide to flee?  These are all speculations of a person who was not there.

The Witness AW relates a similar story, the only exception being that the episodes, according to her, are in May, whereas she has said that the events occurred in the second week of April.  This Witness AW, Madam President, Your Honours, is a witness whose evidence should be taken with a grain of salt.  This is a witness who in the Musema case had tried to convince the Court that the rapes she had suffered had lasted four hours.  This is a witness who said in the Musema trial that the girl of 18 was raped, whereas she had previously stated that all the children of -- who were underage had been killed by Mika and that she was left only with two children, the eldest of whom was 12.  The Chamber had decided not to concede to her statements because the Chamber was of the opinion that it caused considerable concern to the Chamber. 

As for Witness BH, he makes reference to a meeting between Mika and refugees.  This notorious BH, whose arrogance I have dwelt on and which was proof of her bad faith before the Chamber, this is the dialogue she testifies to.  "Mika" -- we are in the month of June.  "Mika was pursuing Tutsis armed with -- "  " -- has been pursuing Tutsis armed with a long gun for the past three months."  And here is Mika who comes to say to her, "On Monday, I should find you here.  Are there any wounded persons?"  And she answers, "Yes, there are."  "On Monday, let us meet here.  I'll give you food, drugs and plastic tents."  And the witness goes on to say, yes, he spoke to us.  

How can we believe that said dialogue occurred in June 1994, that the Tutsis, who had been pursued by Mika since the 7th of April 1994 were able to heed his call, the tom-tom beats, the coordinate (as interpreted) over the megaphone and approaching very close to him?  The first reflex of a man before an assassin whose crimes were well known to Witness BH, had been known for at least two months before, specifically in Mugonero hospital, was the reflex to chat with him or to flee?  And what calibre of assassin is this, coming to meet his attackers armed?  He was not alone, he was accompanied by other assailants, and yet the victim, the supposed victim, talks with him.  The Defence is of the opinion that that dialogue did not take place.  It is impossible and very unlikely.  In any case, Witness BL states before the Chamber that he and the other refugees did not believe what Mika had said, and that when he returned, as part of the major attack that occurred the following Monday, all the refugees had gone into hiding because they state that, "We knew that he was deceiving us."  So there were therefore no victims, neither on the day of the visit nor on the day of the so-called attack. 

Witness BI alleges that when he met Mika for the second time, that was in Kanyinya, a vehicle arrived and was parked 30 to 40 metres away from where he and the other refugees were.  Mika, who was amongst the people who alighted from the vehicle, called them, asked them to draw near, and they refused.  He asked them whether they recognised him, and they said no.  Those who had been on board the vehicle allegedly told him, "We have come to reassure you; to tell you that there aren't going to be any other problems.  Go and rally all the refugees, meet us at Mubuga school, and we will give you food and medication."  So they took an appointment to meet very early in the morning of the following day.  Still, according to BI, they never went to the appointment the following day because "We realised that it was a trap."  

He nevertheless claims that the next day, a large-scale attack was launched in Muyirwa.  This attack has already been covered in the amended indictment elsewhere.  If we focus on the relevant paragraph of the amended indictment, we will find that there was no attack in Kanyinya and the following day the refugees did not show up at the place of the appointment.  How then can the Prosecutor try to have the Accused convicted of genocide or complicity in genocide without there having been any victims?  So the charge can only be based on the statements of Witness BH and BI before the Chamber to corroborate the allegation in paragraph 5(d)(vii) of the amended indictment, and this allegation, if at all it were to be addressed by the Chamber, should be discounted. 

To conclude, therefore, the Defence is of the opinion that none of the Prosecution witnesses supported the allegations in paragraph 5(D)(vii) of the amended indictment and that the Prosecutor failed to establish the occurrence of this beyond any reasonable doubt. 

This brings us, Madam President, to rape as a crime against humanity.  I will, to the best of my ability, go through it without reading what is already in the brief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, before you go to the rape, I think it's a good time to take the lunch break. 
MR. SONGA:
Okay, Madam President.  Okay.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We hope the half an hour, the 30 minutes offer is still valid. 
MR. SONGA:
That's fine, Madam President. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So we can expect you will deal with this between 2:30 and three o'clock, and let Mr. Prosecutor respond to you.  Because we would like to tie up this whole thing today, if it's at all possible. 
MR. SONGA:
I would request a minimum of two hours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A minimum of two hours means the whole day.  We resume at 2:30. 
	(Court recessed from 1300H to 1435H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed.  Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  In line with your instructions, we shall only refer to new facts or any matters that require particular comment.  We are now talking about rape as a crime against humanity.  In paragraph 6(a)(i) of the amended indictment, which refers to the rape of Gorreti Mukasine and Languida Kamukina, this is paragraph 2-2-4 of the Defence brief, I would just like to observe that when I looked at the Prosecutor's brief, or when one looks at the Prosecutor's brief, it might be said that the Prosecutor had enormous difficulty in identifying these persons.  

First, in paragraph 34 of the Prosecutor's brief, there is reference to Gorreti Mukashyka and Languida Kamukina.  But in paragraph 13, instead we see Immaculée Kamukina and Languida Mukakayilro.  Thus, up until the end of this trial, the Prosecutor has not been able to identify these persons without losing sight, of course, of the fact -- the testimony of Witness AP, who before this Trial Chamber claimed that *********************.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which paragraph of the Prosecution brief? 
MR. SONGA:
Paragraph 13 and paragraph 34, which should be compared so that we can see that he himself does not know the exact names of the victims referred to in paragraph 6(A)(i) of the indictment, paragraphs 13 and 34. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thirteen of chapter -- of chapter 5? 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, I shall look at the copy that is available to me. 

Madam President, I'd like to have a little more time because the Prosecutor begins the numbering of the paragraphs at each section, so perhaps I might be allowed to refer directly to the events of Gishyita to find where the paragraphs are. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think, Professor, it's paragraph 17, under chapter 5. 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Page 90, the bottom of the page.  At the top of page 90 and page 93, also at the top. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Page 90 of the Prosecution brief.
MR. SONGA:
Have you located it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We are asking you whether those are the paragraphs you are referring to, paragraph 17 and --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
34 and 36.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it before 36? 
MR. SONGA:
Please let me verify.  I told you that I gave the wrong paragraphs because each part -- each section of the Prosecutor's brief begins the numbering anew because 13 and 34, therefore, mean nothing much.  So we have to refer to the events that occurred in Gishyita.
JUDGE SHORT:
You should give us the page, and then when you give us the page, then you give us the paragraphs.  It will be easier to locate that way. 
MR. SONGA:
I know that in respect of the events at Gishyita, they begin on page 18 of the Prosecutor's brief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are giving us the page number of the French version.  It is 87 in the English.
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Under chapter 5, it's paragraph 17, 34 and 36, where the names of these two ladies are mentioned. 
MR. SONGA:
I have just identified a passage on page 83 of the French version; that is paragraph 25, where mention is made of Immaculée Kamukina and Languida Mukakayilro.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's the same paragraph number in the English version too.
MR. SONGA:
You will have observed, Madam President, that these names have nothing to do with Gorreti Mukashyka and Languida Kamukina, nor do they have anything to do with what is recounted in the beginning of the narration of the events in Mugonero.  

The main contradiction in these passages is that, after having stated that it was Gorreti Mukashyka and Languida Kamukina, especially in the indictment, it seems that the Prosecutor himself is uncertain as to the names of these victims because he refers to two girls -- two sisters, Immaculée Kaukina and Languida Mukakayilro.  That is what I was referring to, Madam President, Your Honours. 

For the rest, we shall refer to the Defence brief, and I would just like to say something regarding the murder -- the rape and murder of Esperance Mukagasana.  It is just to recall the testimony, the Defence testimony, of DA.  Witness DA is *****************************************************.  She had sought refuge at Mika's home on the night of the 15th, dawning to the 16th of April 1994, and stayed at his home until the middle of May.  She lived with other people in the company of Espérance Mukagasana in the same hide-out in a house that is located behind the main house of Mika.  It should be pointed out that DA is Tutsi.  She is *********************************************** Esperance.  Her testimony is essential and key in the sense that, apart from the truth, she has no other interest in giving testimony for the person who supposedly raped -- caused the rape of -- and killed ****************.  DA stated before this Trial Chamber that Espérance had moved toward the main house when Interahamwe, who came on board an Abakiga vehicle, abducted her in the absence of Mika Muhimana.  Witness DA also maintains that she never witnessed any rape in Mika's home and that she never heard anything about it. 

We shall move on now to the abduction -- we move over to the rape of Witness AX and we shall just refer to you what we wrote about that.  The abduction of Collette, Agnes Mukagatare and Alphonsine.  We also refer you to what was written in our closing brief as to the rapes in the presbytery.  This is on page -- paragraph 261 of the Defence brief.  We would like to talk a little more about the testimony of Witness AF.  Witness AF is categorical.  He was not an eyewitness to the rape that occurred in the presbytery.  He did not see the assailants and does not know when they left the premises.  AF himself states, "If you ask me when the people who raped the girls left the premises, I would not able to tell you.  I was not with these girls."  

Can he say whether Mika was amongst the assailants?  Witness AF says, "I told you that when they attacked the rooms where these girls were on the night of the 14th, some of the assailants first came to loot the property that was in the presbytery, and amongst the looters there was Mika, Sikubwabo, Vincent and the others.  If they came to loot property and foodstuff, it is proof that they did not feel pity for the people who were in the church."  That is Witness AF who affirms that he saw people looting and he deduces that if they looted, then they killed.  We call that speculation.  He goes on to say, "Otherwise, asking me whether I saw them, I told you that I was not present, and I told you how we were informed."  With reference to his informant, Claudine, Witness AF is unable to say clearly where he met her.  At one point he says that it was in the banana plantation opposite the church.  On the other hand, Witness AF states that this does not mean that he had left the church to go to the banana plantation.  He does not know Claudine's name, did not know her father or her mother, the number of brothers and sisters that she may have had.  In short, it must be said that he did not know his informant.  Better still, we might say that this informant never even existed. 

What is more, Claudine was in a state when she -- in what state was Claudine when she spoke to Witness AF?  Witness AF answered himself as follows, "I explained to you that one of the victims had been raped and cut up with a machete."  "I explained to you that one of the victims had been raped and cut up with a machete and spoke with us."  That's a witness for you.  This is a witness who speaks with a person who has been raped, but who had been cut up already with a machete.  This testimony should receive the credibility that it deserves. 

As to the abduction and rape of Josiana, Marianna Gafurafura and Martha Gafurafura, of course the main aspects of this argument have already been included in the closing brief.  However, one must emphasise that the Defence put a question to the witness, Witness BI, as to who was driving the vehicle that brought Sikubwabo -- that brought the girls, and he said, "I think that it is Sikubwabo 
that -- who was driving."  One cannot think that it is Sikubwabo, whereas one was close to the vehicle -- one went closer to the vehicle in order to determine who was driving it.  Instead of saying that he thinks that it is Sikubwabo, he should have been certain and say -- and said, "Yes, it is Sikubwabo, because I saw him."  When he says that he thinks that is Sikubwabo, this is speculation and it revealed that he was giving the testimony of one who was not an eyewitness. 

Witness BI did not see where these girls were within the vehicle because he does not tell the Trial Chamber what he saw about where these girls were inside the vehicle.  He says this instead, "But I think that they were in the back." Can you give such testimony if you are an eyewitness?  

The witness TQ8, Prosecution witnesses -- Prosecution Witness TQ8 observed that the person about who he was giving testimony was called Maria Mukeshimana and that he did not know Gafurafura.  But the Prosecutor attempted to state that Witness TQ8 was not credible, and that between the 13th and the 19th of April, the witness had not seen Maria Mukeshimana and that this girl was in Mugonero on the 16th of April.  Madam President, I do not think that the Prosecution, which has the burden of proof, should be allowed to say that since the witness did not see this person except before the 12th of April and after the 19th of April, this is proof that between these two dates Maria returned to Mugonero, that Maria made a return journey from Kigali to Mugonero.  

The proof that Defence can offer is to give material -- furnish material that will enable to set the claims and the certainties of the Prosecution in their proper perspective.  And one of the ways of reducing these claims and to cast doubt on these certainties is to say that before the events, we have witnesses who saw Maria in Kigali.  And we have witnesses who said on the 20th, Maria was still in Kigali.  The Prosecution evidence is that since we did not see her between these two dates, she must have been in Mugonero.  And is that how the Prosecution should be upheld?  In addition, this is a context of war where the Tutsis are being hunted down, manhandled and killed.  How can it be believed that since Witness TQ8 did not see her between the 12th and the 19th, it was proof that she was in Mugonero?  Did she go to Mugonero only to be raped and killed?  What security could she expect in taking the road from Kigali to Mugonero between those two dates?  I think that the witness instead sufficiently demonstrated that we should have every reason to believe that this lady was not in Mugonero because the security situation, the distance, the means of transport, were not favourable to that. 

I don't know, Madam President, whether my -- when I flip my pages I make a lot of noise into the microphone. 

We should move on.  We are still at Mugonero.  In what is written, Madam President, you will see the portion that we devoted to the testimony of Witness AT and to the insurmountable contradictions that he makes insofar as the location of the crime is concerned.  He allegedly was at a certain point in room number 3 in an upper floor and some other time in room number 3 in the basement and at some other time in the operating room and in a hall near the operating room.  So I will simply refer you to the records.  But what I would like to say is I would like to show that Witness AT was in complicity with the witness who claims to have been raped by Mika.  

What do we mean by complicity?  What I mean is that he conferred with this woman insofar as their testimonies are concerned, and consequently, therefore, this is one more reason for AT's testimony to be rejected.  

I am going to prove this by referring to the oral evidence of 19 April 2004, evidence tendered in this Court.  The Defence confronted Witness AT with the following question: "You stated to the Prosecution investigator as follows.  As concerns rape and sexual assault, which is the subject of your investigation, I knew of a number of cases, in particular, three cases of rape and a case of sexual mutilation."  What was Witness AT's answer?  "I made that statement."  But then he continues, "Haven't you heard women who came to give testimony?  I think you listened to their statements."  The question that the Defence would like to ask is, if there is no collusion, what therefore was the other occasion for Witness AT to be aware of the testimony given by women who were victims of rape?  He was not in the courtroom when these women were testifying and therefore could not be aware of what the women must have testified in Court. 

The least that can be said is that Witness AT does not deserve any credibility.  Who can forget that Witness AT, before this Trial Chamber, rejected his own wife?  And what are the words he used?  I will refer to Exhibit D. 22 concerning his particulars and to the transcript of 19 April 2004, the delegations (as interpreted) or statements made against his own wife that took eight pages, and the words used by Witness AT are to this effect, were categorical.  

Looking at the name of his wife on a piece of paper that was tendered to him -- or tendered by the Defence, he who did sign that statement with his own hand, his first reaction was to say that he did not know how to read and to ask that the whole name be given to him and read out to him.  And when the interpreter read out the name to him, both the -- his wife's name and the first name, he asked that he should be told where she was living.  And it was only then that he would be able to identify the person.  Lastly, after reading his wife's address, he admitted to knowing her.  So much time and so many manoeuvres that you talk about somebody that you not only know but who is also your wife. 

Now, before this Chamber, Witness AT had to talk about his relationship with that person.  The answer was straightforward.  The witness said that there was no relationship between him and the person in question.  He did not even have the honour of recognising that his wife was even a mistress were it only because they were living under the same roof.  

The Defence tried to confront him with his own statements, in particular, his statement of 
20 June 1999 and of 27 August 2002.  Witness AT was categorical, he was persistent in saying that there was no relationship between him and that person.  And yet even BJ recognised in his statement, in his previous statement, the status of a husband of Witness AT, and when the Chamber asked him to give the name of his wife, he gave the name of a woman who had died in 1994. 

The Defence will now like to ask the question as to if since 1994 he had remarried.  The witness's answer was categorically negative, in the negative, and yet the Prosecutor himself, when asked for assistance by the Defence, confirmed that the relationship of wife and husband that we find in the other statements was correct unless there was contrary information to that effect.  This is the kind of witness that you are dealing with, Madam President, Your Honours.  He's simply a liar. 

Now, what should we do with his testimony?  You, the members of the Chamber, will give the weight that he deserves; that is, zero.  For us, the difference, the testimony of Witness AT should simply be dismissed because it comes from a person who lacks any credibility, who is even a liar, as we have just shown, and as we will show even further when we will be dealing with the details of his testimony in respect of facts and events. 

Witness AT, in one way or the other, is implicated in the death of a certain Elam Munana, the director of ESAPAN, and of a certain Rose Nyabunyana, who were murdered after power was taken by the FPR.  According to his own statements, he was part of nightly patrols.  He heard gun shots, was able to call in soldiers to find the occupants of the vehicle were dead, and to realise that the assailant had gone into thin air.  

In his testimony before your august Chamber, he first of all tried to refuse that he knew Elam Munana, and when the Defence put the question to him he answered as follows, "There are many Munana.  If you give me his mother and his father's name, I probably could tell you if I knew that person or not."  And yet he lost sight of the fact that a few moments earlier, he had just said that the director of the school, ESAPAN, had, in the company of Rose Nyabunyana -- I am sorry, I have to spell out that name.  Nyabunyana is N-Y-A-B-U-N-Y-A-N-A.  

I'll go over what I said before.  So while refusing to know Alain Munana, he lost sight of the fact that he had just said a few moments earlier that the director of the school had, in the company of Rose Nyabunyana had been attacked while they were on board his vehicle by assailants and that all the occupants had lost their lives.  And that director of ESAPAN was none other than Elam Munana, whom he tried to -- not to know earlier.  How can Witness AT, who had just given the circumstances surrounding the death of the director of ESAPAN could a few moments later, be beating about the bush as far as his name is concerned, especially in the terms -- in the words that he used before the Chamber?  

Beyond what is written in the closing brief, the Defence hopes that when the Rwanda judicial system would have been strengthened, it will not fail to give us some -- shed more light on the personality of that person and on his role in the death of Nyabunyana and of the director of ESAPAN, Elam Munana. 

I would like now, Madam President, to talk about the rape of Mukasine Kajongi, also called Joyce.  At this point, I would like to refer to the Defence witness, Defence Witness AR1, and to Witness TQ7.  Witness AR1  knew the Kajongi family and knew the children of that family who were called, respectively, Muvunyi, Paul; Mukangarambe, Vedaste; Mukangarambe, Josephine; and Joyce Mukasine.  I will spell the surnames.  Muvunyi is spelled M-U-V-U-N-Y-I.  Ngarambe is spelt 
N-G-A-R-A-M-B-E.  Mukangarambe is spelt M-U-K-A-N-J  -- G-A-R-A-M-B-E.  Mukasine is spelt 
	M-U-K-A-S-I-N-E.  

In April 1994, Joyce Mukasine was a student in the Butare university.  She did not come on holidays in April 1994.  On the 16th of April it 1994, she therefore was at the university of Butare.  TQ7 was aware of this.  I am sorry, I will have to start all over.  It is not TQ7.  Yes, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any evidence that this witness -- this lady, Joyce Mukasine, did not come to his home town during the vacation,during the Easter vacation? 
MR. SONGA:
I will get to that.  I will discuss that matter in a short while.  But it's just as I was saying when I was making my general considerations.  What the Defence is saying is that before the events, she was not in Mugonero.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She was not in Mugonero --
MR. SONGA:
That is what is certain.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She was not in Mugonero because she was not seen by this witness? 
MR. SONGA:
Before the events.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's the evidence.  There is no concrete evidence that she did not come home.  She was not in the town because she was not seen by the witness. 
MR. SONGA:
I understand your logic, Madam.  Please, let me cover some ground.  I'm sure I will get to that argument. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, go ahead. 
MR. SONGA:
I was giving the contents of Witness AR1's testimony, who stated that he saw all members of his family to come and seek refuge in the hospital where he was working, except that girl.  Those are the words that were used by Witness AR1:  "When I left that place on the 12th of April, I did not leave her at the hospital.  If she came to the hospital between the period that elapsed from the time that I left and the 16th, I don't know."  I think that so far the witness is speaking honestly.  The witness is saying only what he knew, and what he didn't know, he also said he didn't know.  He continued by saying that usually he used to see her when she came home for holidays. 

Witness AR1, was he at the hospital on the 16th of April to be able to bear testimony regarding that date?  All that he said was, before the events, Joyce Mukasine was undergoing training on the 12th of April and was not yet at Mugonero.  That is all the witness said.  We, for our part, we are saying, is this not useful information?  

Now, this is our own view.  The Prosecutor's evidence must show, must establish beyond any reasonable doubt, that Joyce Mukasine, more than a week after the president's death, left Butare in spite of the circumstances, in spite of the insecurity problems that she would have encountered on her route.  The insecurity was all the worse for her because she was Tutsi.  And that she came and sought refuge in Mugonero.  So if you can understand what I am trying to say, Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, it is the statement of this Witness AR1 that he or she left the hospital on 12th and did not come back.  So how could she know that Witness Joyce Mukasine was not present at the scene on the 16th of April? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In other words, Professor, you are placing her being not in Mugonero basing it on the fact that that witness is -- as at the 12th, she was not there.  But you can't -- there is no evidence that it is not possible for her to have come after that time or, indeed, that she was at a certain known place by any witness who says that -- who is able to testify factually as to where she, in fact, was. 
MR. SONGA:
I do understand you, Your Honour.  This is logic that should be inferred from available facts.  I don't think that the witness came here to show that Joyce Mukasine was in Butare.  She did not say so, and I don't want to put those words into his or her mouth. 

AH7 knew Joyce Mukasine and confirms that in 1994 she was a student in the Butare national university and that in April of that same year she was still in Butare.  The witness's father and Joyce's father were friends.  And this is how, in May 1995, Joyce's brother came to the area and told Witness AH7's father that Joyce was in Butare, where her junior -- her father's junior brother was working. 

TQ7 knew Kajongi, Issacar's family, knew his children whose -- all of whose names that she gave, and Joyce was the youngest of them all.  In April 1994, she was in the Butare national university, where she was studying public health in the second year.  And the latest information that the witness had of her was that she was in Kigali. 

Madam President, Your Honours, all I'm trying to trying to do is to relate -- or to give an account of the testimonies that we collected on that subject.  

Now, regarding the rape of Mukasine, Gorreti and BJ, it will be an uphill task for us to make a distinction between the different Mukasines here.  We are no longer talking about the Mukasine we talked about a while ago; it is the Mukasine whose name appears in the indictment that is under paragraph 6(C)(ii).  I'll refer you once again to the closing briefs.

	1530H
MR. SONGA:
But I would like to make a comment under something that is in the brief when, according to 
Witness AT, BI, and BU, Bourgmestre Sikubwabo allegedly communicated with the refugees in the Mugonero church to the effect that all the Hutus had to come out before he settles the Tutsi question.

Now, by using his Prosecutor -- his witness, this is what the Prosecutor's witness says:  "The bourgmestre was standing in front of the door, and he was talking to the refugees who were inside the church, and he was saying, 'If there are Hutus inside this church, let them come out.'"

And the Witness BI continues as follows: "Yes, I saw people come out.  Hutu women who were married to Tutsis were asked to come out.  I saw people come out and was able to identify two young women who were married to Tutsis.  The two women were called Nyiraguza and Nirere."  Nyiraguza is spelt N-Y-I-R-A-G-U-Z-A, and Nirere, N-I-R-E-R-E.

What are we to make of this?  Are we to understand that in spite of this call made by the bourgmestre, BJ failed to come out?  Did she not hear the call made by the bourgmestre, or should we think, rather, that she was not inside the church?

AT, BH, BI, and BJ were at the hospital in the surgical unit, but they never mentioned the case of the rape of BJ -- of BG.  How can we explain this?  A question was put to AT on that day.  I quote:  "One expect people to pass by that place."  Answer:  "Normally the assailants went from hall from hall, from room to room to see if there were no survivors."  That was the witness's answer. 

Now, the question can be asked as to how, in that case, while Mika was raping one of those victims, the others were not killed by the assailants who were going from one room to the other in the hospital.

Now, this takes us to Johaneta's rape.  The rape of Johaneta, Theresa Mukabutera, and Eugenia.  Here we would like to say something regarding BH's testimony, indications of which we have already made with respect to the credibility or to the weight that it should have.

I drew a diagram, however.  I wanted to pretend that I was Lucassen.  Unfortunately, I do not have a copy of my diagram.  I shall try to describe it, as can be seen from the transcript of the 8th of April 2004.

If one is to go by what BH says when he talks about the rape of these three girls whose names I have given, that is, Johaneta, Mukabutera, and Eugenia, he says this:  "I did not get into the surgical ward room.  I only went into a room near to that one."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you kindly lead us to the pages? 
MR. SONGA:
This is on paragraph 300, but as you know, I only see what is not in the documents that you have before you.

So I was referring to the transcript of the 8th of April 2004.  This transcript says the following, and this is Witness BH who is speaking:  "I did not enter the surgical ward room.  I instead went to a room near this one."  So he tells us that he's between the pharmacy room and the surgical ward room.  I did not have -- I do not have a copy of my diagram, but the -- it is as follows:  The first room is the pharmacy, the second one is the neighbouring room wherein the girls entered, and the third one is the surgical ward room.  This is the statement on page 33 of the 8th April transcript. 

So we have the pharmacy, the room where the girls are, and the surgical ward room.  And, of course, we don't know where Witness BH himself is located.  Is he in the pharmacy from where he can see into the neighbouring room where the three girls are, that is, to his right?  Is he in the surgery room where he can see the room wherein the three girls are hiding by looking towards his left?  The surgical ward room cannot be this room because he said he did not enter the surgical ward room, which means -- which leaves the pharmacy.  But Witness BH says that he was opposite the surgery, and the pharmacy is not opposite the surgical ward room.  So where was BH? 

Madam President, I don't know whether you understand me.  Is it possible for me to be allowed to draw this diagram quickly so that it can be viewed by other means? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's in evidence so...
MR. SONGA:
It is a pedagogical explanation.  It is a method that makes more visible what the transcript says. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And then you will tender that diagram as  evidence -- as an exhibit? 
MR. SONGA:
No, that is not necessary.  As I told you, it is just a visualisation of what already appears in the transcript.  But if you allow that it should be entered into evidence, then that's fine.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we don't think there's any need of drawing the diagram.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The drawing you are seeking to do is what you understand the transcripts to give for -- to give, and that, I think, you can put in words.  You don't have to draw that up, because if you draw it up and you don't give it in as an exhibit, it is of no use to us because we will not remember it when we are considering the evidence.  And this wouldn't be an appropriate time for you to tender further evidence. 
MR. SONGA:
Most obliged.  In any case, it was to assist you further.

May I proceed, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you proceed.  And you must try to conclude your submissions by the end of the day.
MR. SONGA:
I think this is possible, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Go ahead. 
MR. SONGA:
So from his first description of that location there is a pharmacy, followed by a girl which -- a room that contains three girls, there's the surgical ward room.  And he's not in the surgical ward room.  We do not know whether he is in the pharmacy, however, because where he is is opposite the place where the three girls are located.  And where is he?  He himself says in response, "I do not know the difference.  I cannot distinguish between the two rooms.  All I know is that the room in which the people who were killed were found was opposite me and opposite the surgical ward room.  So it seems to me there is no difference.  If I at least worked there, I might have been able to distinguish between the two rooms." 

What is he saying in this statement, that the surgical ward is the place where -- and the place where the three girls are is the same -- are the same, whereas he said a while ago that these were two different rooms?  

And he continues bravely.  Question:  "You state that in the room opposite, there were two -- three women.  Is this a room opposite the operating or the surgical ward?"  Answer:  "There were two doors, one of which was next to the other.  It was not opposite." 

Thus, once more we have a room with three girls and then another one about which he cannot tell whether it is the surgical ward, the operating theatre, or whatever.  He doesn't know the difference.  These are the three scenario that came from one person, that was -- this person was giving his account of what happened at the scene of the crime. 

It is a pity that this drawing cannot -- you cannot view this drawing; however, you do have an idea on the fact that the witness does not say the same thing.  He has three different versions as to what happened at the scene of the crime.

Witness TQ7, and we are still referring to this paragraph.  As for Witness TQ7, she knew Eugenia Murekatete, one of the daughters of Amos Karera, sister of Johaneta.  She was unable to say what Eugenia Murekatete was doing in April 1994 since the latter lived in -- since she lived in Kigali.  What Witness TQ7 also says is that in April 1994 Eugenia Murekatete was not a pupil in ESAPAN.  She had been dismissed from there, and she never returned. 

As to the possibility of having been raped in Mugonero hospital, this is what TQ7 states:  "If someone says that Eugenia Murekatete was raped, I would tell you that this cannot have happened because she wasn't there." 

The rape of BG in respect of that, which I refer to the brief, the rape of Virginie Gasherebuka, if I understood correctly, the Prosecutor had deleted that from the indictment, and rightly so, I might add. 

As to the rape of Pascasie Mukarema, this is on paragraph 318 of our brief.

May I proceed? 

I shall refer you to the brief in this -- in respect of this paragraph, but I should like to comment on the words that my -- on what my learned colleague the Prosecutor said, who was surprised at my surprise, who was surprised that I said that Witness AW said unbelievable things, wherein he demonstrates how the Accused succeeded with the aid of a machete in taking out a living baby from its mother's womb. 

I think this is fairly unique.  This has not happened before up till the beginning of this 21st century.  I don't believe that many instances of this have occurred, but my colleague maintains that these things happened often in Rwanda, that it was -- there is a case where a fetus was seen to have been taken out and eaten.  But in reference -- in referring to a fetus --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
There's a lot of things that are possible, to giving birth up trees in Mozambique and other places.  So don't put anything beyond a human possibility.
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honour.  I know that there are many things that never happened that happened for the first time.  Humanity is full of surprises, and certainly there were surprises in Rwanda.  What I would like to challenge, however, is that the Prosecutor talked about a fetus, but whereas I was talking about a child who was born alive.  He should have said something comparable to extract a fetus.  I have never tried it myself, but it is an ordinary fact.  But to use a machete to extract a child that is alive and viable is a feat.  That is what I wanted to say.  However, the world is full of extravagant and surprising things, and it shall always be.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I agree it is not a daily occurrence.
MR. SONGA:
I am most obliged, Your Honour.  I hope that this will -- this is what will happen for the little time that is left for me.

I am referring to paragraph 325 of the Defence brief, and at this point I would like to say -- I would like to say something about the rape of Josephine Uwamariya as reported by Witness BU.  This testimony calls for much comment.  Based on his own testimony given before the Trial Chamber, BU was in Bisesero from the 9th of April 1994 until the French arrived in June.  BU claims to have seen attacks in Bisesero every day, and that he saw Mika there.  He always saw them, he says, "but I cannot remember the dates.  Mika was present at all of the attacks." 

This is in stark contrast with the following statement which was made on the same day at the same time before this Trial Chamber.  He says this: "However, sometimes he could come or he could participate in these attacks without my seeing him, because from time to time I went to hide elsewhere, and sometimes I could not recognise him because he was in the midst of a large number of assailants.  However, I saw him on several occasions." 

So BI has moved forward.  She can no longer -- the witness can no longer testify to the presence of Mika Muhimana in Bisesero on every day and in all the attacks.  This apex of these contradictory statements is reached when, in response to a precise question during cross-examination, BU only says that there were four occasions on which the witness saw Mika Muhimana, from the statement Mika was there every day, and then he moved on to the time when he saw him on several occasions, not every day, and then he reduces this to four occasions.

And the rape of Josephine Uwamariya, for someone who was in Bisesero every day and who is only giving testimony on Uwamariya, there is a certain number of questions that are raised.  When he talks of these rapes, it is in response of a general question put by the Prosecutor as follows:  "What did you see Mika do when you see -- you saw him in Bisesero in May, Mr. Witness?"  Answer:  "I saw him leading an attack, carrying a gun, and he came with these assailants to participate in the massacres," which would be a very good introduction if he was referring to the massacres. 

The second question, as it is put, requires a more precise answer.  It is as follows:  "Can you tell us what he did exactly, at least what you saw him do exactly?"  One would have expected that he would talk about the attacks in greater detail, but no.  BU answers:  "At that time, he was raping a young lady who was a teacher."  In what way can this act be used as evidence that Mika was leading the attacks?  Mika was presented as an army commander.  Who is this army commander who -- out in the open, who in the fighting front leads attacks by committing rape? 

To the questions that were put to him, the most natural, the truest answer for someone who had initially claimed to have come to talk about the attacks in Bisesero, especially attacks that he had experienced on a daily basis, for such a person the first response would not have been to talk about rape, but instead to talk about attacks that were as numerous and as murderous as the Prosecutor would have us believe.  And even the Prosecutor, who now has a star witness, because he has been a witness to all the attacks in Bisesero, only puts questions to the witness about the rape of Josephine Uwamariya.  And since the witness wished at all costs to talk about the rape, one would have hoped, at least, that he would have details about this rape that would remove any shadow of doubt as to how they were committed, but this is not the case.  In any case, Witness BU did not say -- admits that he did not see Mika's private parts, did not witness any sexual penetration whatsoever.  And this is an excellent line that the Prosecutor took in deleting all these allegations that do not appear in the indictment, including the allegation of the rape of Josephine Uwamariya.

Madam President, we have talked about Witness BI who claims that he witnessed a rape committed by Mika in Nyakiyabo when he saw Mika for the fifth time.  This is the same witness who has already proven or demonstrated that he met Mika on nine occasions.  The first time that BI refers to these rapes he states that he saw Mika at this place where Mika committed obscene acts and with Gisambo where he raped a girl called Mukasine, another Mukasine, and killed the child that this girl was carrying. 

Madam President, I should like to point out that Mukasine is the joker in the Prosecutor's pack when it comes to finding victims that are difficult to identify.  Any victim that cannot be identified who probably does not exist is called Mukasine because one is at least sure that it is a Rwandan name.  Thus, he purportedly saw Mika killing a girl called Mukasine and killed the child that this girl was carrying, that this girl had picked up when she was fleeing. 

The second time that BI refers to this rape, the name of the victim changes or the witness changes the name of the victim.  He says this:  "They came chasing people who were behind us, and it is at that time that he and Gisambo took this girl called Helena, raped this girl called Verene, and they were with other people."  Mukasine is no longer Mukasine.  It is now Helena; it is Verene in the same testimony, at the same time before the Trial Chamber.  And the Prosecutor himself could not help starting on -- when he noticed the rambling of the witness, he tried to bring him back in line with the Prosecution's strategy.  And so the Prosecutor says this:  "Mr. Witness, I am not sure that I have understood the names of young girls that you have mentioned.  Could you please recall them for us?"  And so this is a rope, a straw sent out to the drowning witness who did not know what else to say.  Instead of saying what he had just said, that is, Helena or Verene, he changes tact completely and says this: "This girl was called Mukasine."  And apparently the Prosecutor was satisfied with his attempt to take the witness in hand, but that is where the problem begins.  For having misused the name Mukasine, who has been indicated as being the victim of a rape twice in Mugonero hospital, the Prosecution has a problem with attaching this new Mukasine to any family whatsoever.  Is it Mukasine Kajongi here who was raped in May, whereas the Prosecution has already said that she was raped and killed in April?  I think it becomes very complicated, indeed.  So a solution is attempted by inventing a family for her.  A family is found.  It's called Charles Ukobizaba, U-K-O-B-I-Z-A-B-A.

But the solution does not limit itself to inviting -- inventing a family, because Charles Ukobizaba has no daughter called Mukasine, so what can be done?  Witness BI tries to save the day.  Why not say that the girl was called Verene, because at least this name has one advantage:  It is one of those borne by one of the children of Charles Ukobizaba.  But, Madam President, Your Honours, as the Chinese say:  What you do not see belongs to you, and what you see no longer belongs to you.

The Defence had the Prosecution name the victim first as Mukasine and as Verene.  Mukasine, daughter of Charles Ukobizaba, never existed.  Witness TQ7 and AR1 were categorical and convincing on the subject.  They knew the -- they all knew Charles Ukobizaba's family.  TQ7 knows a person called Charles Ukobizaba who lived in the hospital building in the part known as Kaninya (phonetic).  He worked in the accounting service of the Mugonero hospital.  Witness TQ7 knew most of the members of his family.  Charles Ukobizaba had three daughters, Charlotte, the oldest -- the eldest, then Verene Usabimana, and Esperance, who was the youngest.  Witness TQ7 also knew the sons.  There was Rutaganda, R-U-T-A-G-A-N-D-A, Joseph Musonera, M-U-S-O-N-E-R-A, and Uziya, 
	U-Z-I-Y-A. 

"Charles Ukobizaba did not have a daughter called Mukasine" says -- "No", says the witness, "I know this girl very well, his daughters.  I know his daughters very well.  I have given you their names.  He did not have any daughters named Mukasine."

Witness AR1 knew Charles Ukobizaba and knew his children, whose names he gave without being asked, Charlotte Kayishema, Mukashema, that is M-U-K-A-S-H-E-M-A, a certain Musonera, which is the same name as given above, a certain Uzie, a certain -- a certain Joseph Nkundumukiza,  which is N-K-U-N-D-U-M-U-K-I-Z-A, a certain Rutaganda, name that has been given above, Vera Usabimana, and Esperance.

Witness AR1 states that if anyone were to say that Ukobizaba had a daughter called Mukasine, he would be making a mistake because this person did not have a daughter of that name.  Mukasine was, rather, the daughter of Kajongi, and the Mukasine, the daughter of Kajongi, has already been referred to. 

In the cross-examination the Defence asked Witness BI to explain on what occasion he mentioned the first name Verene.  And you would agree with me when I insist that this witness's testimony be discarded.  The answer showed the distress and disarray of the witness.  This is what the witness said:  "I don't know the Verene you are referring to and on what occasion I made mention of that first name.  I don't know anything anymore."  The Defence conceded to that and said no one could indeed understand anything in his statement.

The Prosecutor thought he had rescued the situation by blaming the interpretation, but the transcript for that day was unambiguous regarding that statement, because Verene is mentioned twice in that transcript.  Thus, Witness BI, still equalled to her reputation as a liar, gets confused on the incidents in Rekabo (phonetic) saying that the reason is she was -- the reason being that she wasn't there.  Someone who manufactures events.  As to the question who raped and killed Mukasine, also known as Verene, if at all such a name did exist, that question is pointless insofar as it is established that neither Mukasine nor the other Verene ever existed.  And in any case, not that person designated in the indictment as a victim of rape.  

	The dramatic events described by BI that in the arrests via Thomas, the murder of Thomas, the escape of BI and a meeting with Rachelle are completely irrelevant.  Besides, the Prosecutor himself stated during proceedings that is not in the indictment.  If at all it was in the indictment, it would be completely irrelevant because it would be based on a pointless testimony. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are we anywhere near the end, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
I share your optimism, Honourable Judge Muthoga.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Your answer to my question, therefore, is yes? 
MR. SONGA:
Absolutely.  I have no intention to contradict you this afternoon.

Regarding the rape of Esperance Mukagasana, I don't know what I ought to say on this subject.  The records refer to the indictment, but when we heard the Prosecutor in his closing brief, he had already given up on the argument in the indictment.  He himself has understood that the argument did not hold water.  He changed everything and said that Muhimana, Sikubwabo, et al, brought Esperance elsewhere, and when Mika came home in the evening, he was no longer with Esperance, so Mika killed her -- or killed him.  These are new passages that they want to insert in the indictment.  I believe the Judges will not fail in finding that the closing brief is not the time when the indictment ought to be amended.
	(Pages 40 to 48 by Sherri Knox)





























	1630H
MR. SONGA: (Continuing)
This brings us to murder as a crime against humanity, and I am going through my closing brief to determine whether any remarks ought to be made.  Yesterday I heard the Prosecutor, referring to Witness AT, saying that he was credible in other trials.  It is possible but this does not necessarily make him credible in this case, and this is not the occasion to invoke res judicata because this concerns both parties, and we provided enough evidence to make this august Chamber understand that Witness AT is not at all and cannot at all be credible.  This was foreseeable if appearances were multiplied before international courts.  Whereas, at the same time the witnesses tend to tell lies, this was bound to lead only to contradictions.  This is a very good thing that such a witness is already known because the Tribunal continues its work.  It is right and fitting that they should be identified and they should know that this witness is only coming to deviate or to waste the Court's time telling lies.  I find that the Prosecutor, through this witness, makes mention of the murder of Ndayisaba who was a guard at the nursing school.  As a matter of fact, I believe the only witness who talked about this, which is good news for the Defence, is Witness BI whose capacity was someone who is inventing stories.  Witness BI states that he did not see these people arrive and therefore did not witness what he wanted to say regarding the murder of a man called Ndayisaba.  In any case, the murder of Ndayisaba, as far as I'm concerned, is not in the indictment, and consequently the Chamber should find it completely of no consequence.  Before the Chamber, Witness BH made mention of the murders of Jeannette, Eugénie and Mukabutera.  The Defence believes it has pointed out sufficiently that this allegation is not in the indictment,  It, therefore, requests that the Chamber should find it of no consequence.  BH gives evidence which is full of inconsistencies and contradictions, very much like what is said in the entire testimony, that it deserves no consideration whatsoever.  Still regarding the murder of Jeannette, Eugénie and Mukabutera, Witness BI states primarily that the Accused and his companions after the so-called rapes came out, leaving the girls in the basement, and the Interahamwe went in and killed those girls.  That is the first version.  Secondly, forgetting the first statement, Witness BH supposedly said they were not supposed to be taken away, and they were immediately killed and left in the basement, and the Interahamwe went into the basement and killed them.  If you have follow what I have said, Madam President, Your Honours, this Witness BH in his last version states that Mika killed those girls, and that once those girls had been killed by Mika, the Interahamwe went in and killed them.  This is untenable as an argument.  In what country are the dead killed?  If they had already been killed by Mika, how would they have been killed a second time by the Interahamwe?  In short, we have three versions on the same allegation by the same witness.  This is additional evidence that the Court is dealing with people who fabricate stories, so their evidence does not deserve any consideration.

We have taken note of the fact that Virginie Gesherebuka was withdrawn from the indictment.  Let me spell Gesherebuka: G-E-S-H-E-R-E-B-U-K-A.  The murder of Pascasie Mukarema, we should refer to the closing brief.  As for Felicité Kankuyu's murder and the father Gahinda, we should refer -- we should turn to the closing brief regarding those murders.  As far as the participation in the murder of Assiel Kabanda, I should first of all point out that several testimonies revealed that Kabanda was no longer going about his commercial activities in 1994.  He was no longer in Gishyita, but he was in Bisesero.  And those who wanted to insinuate or would like to insinuate that Kabanda was killed because he was a prosperous businessman and that Mika participated in these killings -- participated in his killing out of jealousy or competition, it should be pointed out that Mika at that time was not the prosperous businessman the Prosecutor wants to have us believe.  This trader we saw, thanks to Lucassen, was living in a building which was not quite that of a prosperous businessman.  No one, not the Prosecutor, in any case, was able to show how prosperous he was or what his prosperity consisted in.  No one told us what his business was, whether he was a wholesaler or a tailor.  No one told us if he imported goods or he had a bank account.  

Let us leave mythology aside and talk about realities.  If we start with the statement of Witness BE, who states that he saw Mika shoot at Kabanda, of course he is not aware that other witnesses saw other people shoot at Kabanda.  So he came, stating that Mika opened fire on Kabanda, and it was when Kabanda fell that BE looked behind him, saw he was not able to see Mika shoot at Kabanda, unless Mika was the only person armed, as he tried to have the Court believe.  However, according to AF, everyone shot at Kabanda, particularly Charles Sikubwabo, presented as an expert marksman.  BE claims that the Interahamwe were going in front of Mika when he fired the shot.  How is this conceivable that with the Interahamwe going ahead of him, that is the Interahamwe were between Mika and his target, how then could Mika have shot at Kabanda without shooting the Interahamwe?  BE states that he and his companions were in a hole that was three metres deep and they were lying low because they were afraid of being flushed out.  But BE, who was lying low in that hole which was three metres deep, claims that he could see the Interahamwe arrive first around Kabanda's body.  When they were asked to explain how this could come about, they claim that they went up the staircase that had been created by the miners and that they were able to see outside without being seen, which is technically impossible.  If he had said that he could see what was happening outside through a hole, that would have been conceivable; it would have been conceivable for him to see without being seen.  But to climb up a staircase and see someone outside and not being seen, whereas you are being sought after, I'm afraid I have to say that it is impossible to avoid a situation in which the Honourable Judges will try to question what I'm saying.  Let me say at least that it is very unlikely.  BE ends up saying that even from the staircase he was unable to see what the Interahamwe were doing nor see where Kabanda was lying, which becomes more realistic.  But what is very bothering is the fact that it is very contradictory vis-à-vis the previous statement.  BE states that Mika was behind the Interahamwe.  When the Defence asked him whether it could be inferred that the Interahamwe were in front of Mika, which looked evident, the witness now says they were on the side, that they were together.  He is free to move about the people he is referring to as he wishes, whereas justice requires the truth.  BE claims that the genitals that were hung on a pole from June to October had dried up, whereas like every other part of the body, the genitals are bound to disintegrate.  BE claims that Sikubwabo was leading the attack with Mika but that he didn't see him doing anything or say anything whatsoever.  Of course, all these lies can be explained as evident in the Exhibit D. 30.  He is a neighbour of Pascal Nkuzi.  This is the least that could be said.  I request you, 
Madam President, to consider the evidence of BE, because of his inconsistencies, his contradictions, as completely worthless.  

Witness AF was not in Bisesero when Kabanda died, so she is not in a position to say who killed him or who participated in his murder.  Witness AF heard the Interahamwe say that it was Sikubwabo who called Kabanda.  And he goes on to say that Mika also shot at Kabanda.  But when the Court puts precise questions, specific questions, to him asking him whether he saw the person who killed Kabanda, he becomes unsure of what he is saying and contradicts what he said.  "Madam President, Your Honours," says the witness, "regarding the question of whether -- who killed Kabanda, it is difficult to say because everyone shot at Kabanda when he was flushed out because they did not want him to escape from them.  So everyone rushed at him, because the assailants didn't want him to escape, because if he escaped it would have been a fiasco for them."  AF, in making this statement, is saying that he neither saw nor heard who killed Kabanda with a bullet.  Witness AF has several prior versions on the death of Kabanda in which he never made mention of Mika but of 
Charles Sikubwabo.  That is why the Defence confronted him with his written statement of the 22nd of August 2002 in which we find this passage:  "This is how I saw Charles Sikubwabo shoot at Kabanda, Assiel of Gishyita in June 1994.  He asked the assailants to cut Kabanda's head so that he would show it to the conseiller because he was sought after.  I also saw him kill Mukanga.  The 
bourgmestre Sikubwabo also shot at him.  He lost part of his arm."  When the Defence asked him to explain all those divergencies, Witness AF claimed that his statement was in line with the questions that were put to him.  The Chamber did not fail to point out the confusion in the Witness AF's evidence.  "Mr. Witness," says Honourable Muthoga, "you are doing your best, and I believe it is in your interest to answer the questions put to you briefly.  Because in giving long answers you cause confusion.  Please answer the question.  If you do not understand it, ask that the question be put to you again, and please answer the questions put to you briefly.  Please do not go into details in answering the question, because this does not help you in your evidence."  Similarly, the Defence confronted Witness AF with the transcript of the 3rd of March 1998 in the Kayishema, Ruzidana trial, wherein we have a dialogue between the witness and the Chamber.  Question: "Where is Kabanda today; do you know?"  Answer:  "He was killed."  Question:  "Do you know how he was killed?"  Answer:  "Yes, I know."  Question:  "Could you please tell us?"  Answer:  "Kabanda was killed in June.  The assailants were going home.  It was in the evening.  He had come out of his hideout thinking that the assailants had gone home.  So the assailants were with Sikubwabo, the bourgmestre of Gishyita.  When these assailants saw Kabanda, they shouted, 'Kabanda.  This is Kabanda,' and then it was bourgmestre Sikubwabo who was a marksman who shot at him and he fell."  Now, while Witness AF had claimed that the answers he was giving were being given in line with the questions that were put to him, the Defence confronted him with his own written statement, wherein he had been specifically asked to talk about Mika, and in his answer he does not implicate or mention Mika as regards Kabanda's death.  This is the passage and his response regarding conseiller Mika, and he said so just after talking about Sikubwabo:  "Regarding conseiller Mika, well before the massacres of 1994 started, he trained militiamen from September 1993.  He also participated himself in the training of Interahamwe in Nungwe forest.  He enlisted young Hutus, generally unemployed people, to train them.  He said it himself with pride.  He distributed weapons to the civilians.  He participated in the killings in Mubuga.  He was a close friend of the bourgmestre.  I often saw him with his gun, amongst the assailants in Bisesero and Mubuga.  He does not make mention of Mika as regards Kabanda's murder.  

The international court often excuses the contradictions of witnesses on the basis of the length of time that has elapsed since the events on which the witnesses are testifying.  But, Madam President, there is one thing that should be borne in mind.  However lengthy the period that has elapsed, under the pretext that time has elapsed, we cannot mistake day and night, light and darkness, abundance and penury, or the lack of water and fire and so on and so forth.  Of course, time makes people forget, but it doesn't add to people's memory.  As time goes by, people remember less.  But for Witness AF, time revives his memory and makes it possible for him to remember more things that happened.  This is not considerable.  The witness's prior statements were closer to the reality and memory is more faithful as regards recalling the perpetrators of culpable acts.  It is easier to remember them earlier.  As for the contradictions, they are only additional evidence of the lies of Witness AF and his ability to do everything to hurt my client.  All the Defence can do is to ask the Chamber to bear in mind the precise and credible evidence led by the Defence which proved that Mika was never involved in the massacres in Bisesero, and to understand why the Prosecution witnesses who tried to implicate him, like Witness AF, delve into inconsistencies, contradictions and falsehood because they are trying to testify on what they did not see because they are trying to give evidence on what never existed.  That is why the Defence has no choice than to ask the Chamber to consider that Witness AF is not credible and that his evidence should be discarded because it is not reliable.  

BH and AT's testimony is before the Chamber.  Their account of which Kabanda was a prosperous businessman and that he was running a business of coffee trading in Gishyita and also had a shop are all groundless, because as the Prosecution Witness BF and the Defence witness NT1 said, he had gone bankrupt for a long time and had gone to Bisesero.  Witness BB claims to have seen Mika at Nyangingo.  Witness BD allegedly was in the company of Rutagana, R-U-T-A-G-A-N-A, Kabanda and Mzamwita, M-Z-A-M-W-I-T-A, Nzakamwita, N-Z-A-K-A-M-W-I-T-A, and Nduwamungu, 
N-D-U-W-A-M-U-N-G-U.  These contradictions and the inconsistencies strip his testimony of all credibility.  Indeed, when he was questioned about the distance between him and the assailants, Witness BB had two versions.  The first version:  "Listen, I probably may make an estimate between the place where he was standing when he was shooting at us and the place where we were when we were throwing stones at them.  We had about 80 metres."  Second version:  "When the assailants were shooting at us, we were in front of them, and we constituted a wall in order to throw stones at them.  They were facing us.  And between us you had about 15 metres."  I have represented to you, Madam President, that there are things that time can make us forget, but to forget or to confuse between 15 and 80 metres is quite a bit of forgetfulness.  Witness DB -- BB, in relation to the confusions that have already been pointed out in the Prosecution Witness AT, BH and many others, has stated that he saw Muhimana shoot at Assiel Kabanda, BB alleges that when Kabanda and Nzakamwita were hit by the bullets, he and his companions were throwing stones at the assailants and that they were facing the assailants.  The Defence's question was to find out why, under the circumstances, Witness BB had stated that it was that when they returned that they learnt that it was Nzakamwita and Kambanda that were in question.  Now, question:  "Why did you return, why did you go back, whereas you were throwing stones at your assailants who were facing you?"  Answer:  "Yes."  The Chamber will assess whether this answer addresses the question that was put to the witness.  

I will crave your indulgence, Madam.  Grant me leave for me to take a glass of water.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sure. 
MR. SONGA:
I am indebted to you, Madam.  

Madam President, the contradictions and the shortcomings of Witness BB do not end there.  In the same answer he was able to say at the same time that the person who beheaded Kabanda was the same person who was carrying a machete and it was the same person who was carrying the gun.  And much further, I was unable to know if it was Mika himself who had cut off the genitals of Kabanda or if it was Mika who had beheaded him.  I don't know anything about that.  But all these explanations, all his explanations, his contradictions and lies and falsehoods can now be understood.  Witness BB is one of those who form Nkusi's network and whose mission we know today, which mission is definitely at odds with justice.  What can we deduce from all these contradictions regarding the Kabanda issue?  Because I heard the Prosecutor say that we have never said that Mika killed Kabanda; we merely said that he took part in the killing thereof.  However, the question that arises is as follows, Madam President.  Now, on the basis of all these lies, of all these inconsistencies and contradictions, is it possible to identify an act that constitutes participation?  Because to participate, well, that is well and good, but there are acts of participation, and this should be proven that by this act or that, Mika assisted, an act without which Kabanda wouldn't have been killed.  I think the proof should be provided that this action or act constitutes the means provided by Mika and that led to the death of Kabanda.  I think that some consensus should be drawn from all these contradictions to say that from this act or the other, Mika provided aid or assistance that led to the death of Kabanda.  But when was -- when could that act which constitutes participation -- where can it be identified?  I think this is the legal issue that arises when we have to confront all the falsehoods and statements by the Prosecution witnesses.  

Madam President, Your Honours, the part number four is devoted to the legal findings that you will certainly consolidate with regard to all the discussions that have taken place since Tuesday.  You will not fail to adapt those -- to adopt those legal findings based on what the Prosecutor has provided, especially when he decides that all the acts, all the allegations that are not found in the indictment must be expunged from the charge brought against Mika Muhimana.  

Madam President, the rules of procedure requires that when we make our closing statements, we should say something on the sentencing.  The flimsy nature of the Prosecution evidence as a whole compels me to ask you to assess it yourself and to tell us whether indeed the Prosecutor has succeeded in establishing beyond any reasonable doubt or in proving beyond any reasonable doubt all the allegations that he has and maintains in his indictment.  

For my part, I have proposed to your Chamber that you should declare my client acquitted.  Alternatively, however, if in spite of all the efforts that have been deployed to show how baseless the Prosecutor's approach is, if some guilt were found in the Accused and if he were to be convicted, we are counting on your knowledge of the case file.  We are counting -- we are relying on your high sense of justice so that if there is any penalty, it really should be proportionate, not to the counts as brought forward by the Prosecution but to the reality of the facts as retained and to the precise role that Mika might have played.  

You are well aware, Madam President, Your Honours, that regarding sentencing the Defence has little to say other than to place his trust in you.  You have two tasks which here, elsewhere and today and from the beginning of time you share only with God.  That is punishment and pardon.  This is the reason, wherefore, in order to conclude I would like to reiterate my confidence and trust in you and here ends my statement.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before you sit down, I have a small question for you.  

You have produced 21 witnesses, out of which 11 witnesses are detained witnesses, witnesses which are currently detained in Rwanda for the crimes they have committed during the genocide.  My question is, what is the probative value of these detained witnesses who admitted their guilt reluctantly during the course of counselling in the detention and have not volunteered themselves on their own?  And my follow-up question is, what would be the credibility of these detained witnesses who have given hearsay evidence, like they say they have never heard during the Gacaca session that Mika had ever committed a rape as against the evidence of those Prosecution witnesses who are the victims of the crimes and have given direct and firsthand evidence of the crimes? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, you will understand that your question is embarrassing to me.  However, I think that the detained persons who came to testify cannot be imprisoned definitely for crimes that they allegedly committed.  I think you should be in a position to recognise not only their humaneness but their capacity for contrition, for regret and to want to change and readopt social values.  Even as the criminals that they were, they are still human beings on whom we can and should be able to count.  It would be sad to think that because they are detained and because they confessed to their crimes or because they have been sentenced for serious crimes, they should not -- their humaneness should not be recognised, they should not be seen to be able to tell the truth.  

I think that is a difficult question, Madam President, but, once again, it will be incumbent upon you to weigh and to assess their evidence.  

Concerning the Prosecution witnesses, even there, Madam President, it is very difficult.  I know that it is easy, in fact, it is necessary to say that the victims deserve relief to be brought to them.  And insofar as relief is concerned, it should also be understood that this would require punishment.  But I think it will be dangerous for your Chamber, Madam President, to think that each time that a person stands before your Court as a victim, he has rights even if his status hasn't been assessed.  We cannot consider, we cannot definitely -- we can't think that all persons who state that they were victims were actually victims.  It is possible that they were really victims, but this must be established following the due process of the law.  It does not suffice to appear before the ICTR as a victim for people to conclude that you were actually a victim and that you deserve compensation independently of the due process of law that should establish the guilt of the perpetrators of the crime.  

Madam President, I would like to thank you for availing me of the opportunity of saying something about what devolves upon you.  It is up to you to say, to assign responsibilities, and once again I would like to end by reiterating the confidence that we place in you.  

Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Unfortunately, we will not be able to put an end to this trial today.  It is 5 p.m.  We will adjourn the case until Monday and resume at 10 a.m. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I just wanted to say that if you are mandated to sit for another 20 minutes, I could be done.  I don't have much to address, so that you don't necessarily have to carry on to Monday unless there are issues that you wanted to raise.  Not more than 20 minutes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then, please.
JUDGE SHORT:
I hope it is not a lawyer's 20 minutes. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Briefly, Your Honour.  

Your Honours, I'm just going to address very briefly some issues that have been raised by my learned friend.  The first issue is that of the person referred to as Mukasine, and I would like to make the following submissions.  The first submission is that there are three witnesses who have referred to Mukasines during the course of the Prosecution's case.  The first witness is Witness AT, alpha tango, and he refers to Mukasine who is the daughter of Kajongi.  The second witness is Witness BJ, bravo Juliette, who testified to having been raped in a room at the Mugonero hospital with a lady who had introduced herself as Mukasine.  The third reference to Mukasini was mentioned by BI in relation to the rape of a Mukasine who he described as the daughter of Charles Ubokizaba, U-B-O-K-I-Z-A-B-A.  If I deal with the last Mukasine, which is the one BI referred to, Your Honours, it is a non-issue.  The Prosecutor has stated that we are not relying on that allegation because it falls into the ambit of the allegations that are made outside the realm of the indictment, so that is a non-issue, and we have conceded to that for different reasons.  That leaves me with the Mukasine -- the two Mukasines at the Mugonero complex.  Now, if we deal with the Kajongi, Mukasine, it is our position that these two Mukasines -- that the reference to the Mukasines refer to two separate people and the attacks upon them are two separate attacks.  That's the first submission.  The Kajongi, Mukasine, as referred to by AT, you will find reference has been made at paragraphs 170 to 174 of chapter 5 of the Prosecutor's brief, and that is in support of paragraph 6(i) of the indictment.  That's our position.  The second Mukasine is that referred to by Witness BJ.  You will find the summary at paragraph 195 to 199 of 
part 5 of the Prosecutor's closing brief, and that is in support of paragraph 6(ii) of the indictment.  So that clears, as far as we are concerned, the issue as far as Mukasine up.  

Your Honours, going to the issue of Goretti and the Languidas and Kamukinas, as referred to by Witness AP, my learned friend did point out during his submissions that we had not dealt with the issue concerning the identity of this witness as testified to by AP.  Well, that is not true.  Because at paragraph 36 of chapter 5 at page 93 of our brief, we do proffer an explanation.  And I recall that my learned colleague Mrs. Madenga dealt with that at length during her submissions. 
(Pages 49 to 57 by Leslie Todd)





























	1700H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: (Continuing)
	So there are two references to this.  There's a submission at paragraph 36 of chapter 5 of the brief at page 93, and there's another submission, a general submission, at page 2 of chapter 1, at page 4 of our brief.  And that submission is in relation to the nature and assessment of evidence.  Where we have made submissions as to why the testimony of a witness may or may not be an exact reproduction of what transpired.  We represent to Your Honours that witnesses are human and sometimes do make mistakes.  In essence, Witness DQ from the Defence does confirm, in any event, that the person known as Languida Kamukina does in fact have a sister called Gorreti, for what it's worth. 

Moving on to a slightly different topic, Your Honour, the issue raised by my learned friend for the Defence about BI and the little chart that they showed you, all I will do is show to Your Honours the references that they provided are slightly different in the French and the English.  I have read the English and I do not see what inconsistencies there are in relation to Witness BI's testimony regarding Thomas Muhirwa or whatever event.  In that regard, Your Honour, I would simply refer you to pages 55 -- no, sorry, I will start with the smaller numbers -- pages 17, 18 and 19, transcripts of 30th April 2004 in English.  And also page 55 of the transcripts of 30th April 2004, and you would see thereon that there are no such contradictions. 

Going very quickly to the issue of Witness BH and her location at the Mugonero complex.  My learned friend, during his submissions, represented to Your Honours that there was a contradiction as to whether or not this witness was located in the pharmacy area or in the basement or surgical area of the hospital.  I need to make one submission.  The evidence of Witness BH in regards to her location having to do with anything to do with a pharmacy was simply that "I was located in the reception area where medicines are often given out to patients."  She never suggested for once that she was located at the pharmacy which is located on document -- in Prosecution Exhibit 2, document H3.  That was not where she was located.  And if you look at Prosecution Exhibit 2 at your convenience, Your Honours, K-reference is K0286164, H3 was not where she was located.  Rather, she was located in the main hospital building which you will find at diagram -- diagram K0286165.  Now, she was located in one of the -- on one of the floors opposite the counter where medicines were distributed, not in some far-fetched building somewhere else.  

Going to more legal matters now, the issue concerning paragraph 5(D) and the vagueness of the allegation therein and the prayer of the Defence in their brief to dismiss the allegation in its entirety, can I simply just say that notice of this allegation, and further and better particulars of the said allegation, was given in the pre-trial brief.  
First of all, the indictment is not vague.  I do not agree, because it clearly states that the events alleged under paragraph 5 concern Bisesero.  We have taken -- we have each gone to great lengths to draw your attention to -- for various reasons, in our pre-trial brief and in the closing brief, why the area of Bisesero is, in fact, unique.  Very few references.  I refer Your Honours to paragraph 21 of the pre-trial brief at page 5.  I would refer Your Honours again to paragraph 54 to 56 of the same pre-trial brief, at page 10.  More importantly, Your Honours, I refer you to paragraph 60 of the pre-trial brief at page 11.  In the closing brief, we repeat the same allegation at paragraph 321 of chapter 4, at page 71.  

Now, the issue of notice has come up, and even if you don't agree that the pre-trial brief forms notice, then what about the witness statements?  The issue is that the allegations and further and better particulars of all these allegations were provided for the following witnesses: Witness BI, statement of 25 October 1999 at page 211 of your bundle, in English, clearly puts them on notice; BH, statement of 11th November 1999 at page 256 of your bundle, puts them on notice; Witness AP, statement of 3rd February 2000 at page 28 of your bundle, puts them on notice.  Finally, Witness AW, witness statement of 12 December 1999.  The page doesn't have a bundle number but the K-reference is K0129399. 

Finally, my last submission concerning the law is the question raised by the Defence as to whether or not we can actually adduce the factual allegations which we seek to adduce in relation to rape in support of the charge of genocide.  I think we have made extensive reference to this at page 63 -- sorry, paragraph 63, page 11 of the pre-trial brief.  

If you look again at paragraph 79 and 80 of the same pre-trial brief, we have addressed the issue that you can do this so long as those crimes -- or so long as you can show that the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, existed in the commission of those crimes, they will qualify to be considered by Your Honours in relation to the charge of genocide, be they rape or murder. 

At paragraph 24 of chapter 4 of the closing brief, we repeat the same submission. 

At paragraph 32 of chapter 4 of the closing brief, we repeat the same submission. 

Your Honours, those are my submissions in relation to the matters raised by either yourselves or the Defence, and I am grateful for the extra time.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before you sit down, Prosecutor, what do you say to the assertion that there couldn't be genocide without -- against a person, without a plan to exterminate of which the person is aware and in furtherance of which he acts? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's not correct, Your Honour.  That view was reached in the Akayesu and the Kayishema cases, where the Trial Chamber made a finding that just based on the very nature of a genocide, it had to involve some element of planning.  It doesn't suggest for any one minute that the planning or the element of planning has to be vested in the individual accused person, but that in terms of the general context of the sheer scale of the atrocity itself, there had to be some element of planning involved.  We have actually tried to get the Trial Chambers to take judicial notice of that fact and often they have refused because of this same reason, that you cannot impute that to the individual accused person.  So I don't agree with that proposition, Your Honours.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So even if an accused person is to be convicted of genocide, can he be convicted of genocide without his being aware of a plan, if one existed?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, he can.  There's no requirement that he has to be aware of a plan.  The mens rea for genocide is personal to him and it doesn't go beyond that, and it doesn't necessarily mean that he has to be aware of an overall plan for genocide.  Plan, as it were.  He has to be aware of the large-scale killing and the targeting of Tutsis, but not necessarily of the plan of genocide.  It depends on what you mean by the plan.  What I understand that to mean is a group of people sitting down in a room somewhere, deciding to kill all the Tutsis of Rwanda.  My submission would be that that individual accused person sitting in Kibuye somewhere doesn't necessarily have to be aware of that plan.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Would that person in Kibuye in 1994, a Hutu, hater of Tutsis -- just a hater of Tutsis as a thing -- and killed one Tutsi, would he be executing a genocide? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If he does it with a specific intent, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
To? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
To commit genocide.  Sorry, the specific intent to destroy Tutsis in whole or in part.  If he possesses that specific intent which is required under the Statute.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And how would he exhibit that? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In a variety of ways, Your Honour: circumstantial evidence, the utterances.  Just being aware of the fact that Tutsis are targeted, he possesses the mens rea. He doesn't have to be part of a plan.  If he's aware that -- if he hears a radio broadcast, for example, that all Tutsis in Rwanda are to be killed, and he targets -- he steps out of this courtroom and he targets one Tutsi pursuant to what he's heard, that doesn't mean he's part of a plan, but he is in possession of the specific mens rea for genocide. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What you are saying --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
-- is that the existence of the plan could be inferred from the totality of the evidence that has been rendered --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the surrounding circumstances.
JUDGE SHORT:
And the circumstances.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, the widespread nature of the targeting.
JUDGE SHORT:
But the law does not require that he should have assembled with people in a particular location and hatched the plan.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It certainly doesn't, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
And the existence of the plan can be inferred from the circumstances and the totality of the evidence.  Is that what I understand you to be saying? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's pretty much what I'm saying, Your Honour, yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This brings to us the end of the trial in the Mika Muhimana case. 

Professor, in terms of Rule 86, do you wish to present any rejoinder to the rebuttal argument submitted by the Prosecutor? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I would just like to say a word on the last question pertaining to -- I just want to say that the Prosecutor has not given me sufficient reason for me to change anything whatsoever in my closing -- in my pleadings.  However, I should like to say something in respect of the idea of a plan for the genocide. 

It was said that the plan was not an element of genocide, but at the same time, and this is why I referred to the Kayishema judgement, this Tribunal decided that, in practice, it is impossible to carry out genocide without the existence of a plan or policy to that end.  This is recent international case law.  And if this is the case, it is also unimaginable that a person would be condemned for participating in genocide if he was not aware of the plan.  And if he was ignorant of this plan, the moral element which is specific to genocide cannot be realised.  

If we were to take what the Prosecutor says as explanation; that is in terms of individual murder, even if one were inspired by racial or ethnic hatred, these murders would change very quickly into genocide, whereas this is not what the case law says.  Genocide is one of the forms, or even one of the most advanced forms, of crimes against humanity, and crimes against humanity in -- the elements of crimes against humanity require a general or systematic attack, a widespread or systematic attack.  And eminent jurists such as President Cassesi, who presided over the ICTY, have stated that if these elements are required, they can only be implemented through a plan or an organisation.  

So I would conclude by saying that I do not agree with the Prosecutor's analysis when he claims that genocide can be considered as having happened, even when the person -- even when the Accused was not aware of such a plan.  Because if he is ignorant of such a plan, he cannot be said to have been part of its preparation.  He cannot be said to have implemented the plan.  He cannot be said to have put it into action.  And since these elements are not possible, the moral element can itself not be established.  

Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours, for giving me this opportunity to issue my rejoinder as provided for by the Rules. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Before I declare the close of hearing in the Mika Muhimana case, let me express our gratitude to the learned counsel for the parties for making these proceedings run smoothly and in a convenient atmosphere.  We also thank and appreciate the efforts of the support staff of the Court; that is, the translators, the court reporters, the registry, the technicians, the cameraman, the security, witness support section and, of course, our legal officers for their able assistance and contribution towards the efficient functioning of these proceedings.
