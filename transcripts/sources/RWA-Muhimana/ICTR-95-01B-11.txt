RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to welcome you to this afternoon's session.  I have a few questions which emanated from yesterday's court examination.  This afternoon I just want to focus your mind on the physical room you declared that was in the basement.  I want to kindly ask you to describe the layout of this surgical room in the basement. 
A.	All right.
Q.	(Microphone on in interpreters' booth)...  where you were coming from?  Can you describe the entrance you used to enter the surgical room?
A.	Yes, I can.  I went through the door on the left.
Q.	When you entered, using the door on the left, and you are now in the surgical room, can you see other rooms in the basement?
A.	Yes, there are rooms.
Q.	And if you are in the surgical room, and there are other rooms which you can see, are you able to see occupants from these rooms?
A.	No, I couldn't, because this room did not have a window; however, it was open.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  

Now we are in this room, can we focus to the stage where Mika has not yet raped you?  You are fleeing, you have come to the surgical room.  Can you just tell the Court, when you arrived, when you are in the room, before Mika has raped you, whether you were alone or in the company of other persons?
A.	There were many people around, but I was the only person in this room.  And Mika promised me that he would get me out of it.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.
MS. MADENGA:
I have no further re-examination, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor. 

Madam Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for assisting the Court and we hope and pray that, from now on, you live in peace and have a prosperous life in your country.  We wish you a very safe journey home.

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness.

	(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
BH.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness and we are sitting in open court, so avoid speaking your name or the name of your parents or any other information that may lead to your identification.  In these proceedings you will be referred to as BH, Witness BH, you shall testify, and for that you have to make solemn declaration.  

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness. 
(Declaration made by Witness BH in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor to examine-in-chief.
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon Madam President.  Good afternoon Your Honours. 

Good afternoon Witness.
 THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.
WITNESS BH
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Before you is a document that contains your personal particulars and I went through those particulars with an interpreter with you where you were staying and you verified the contents of those particulars by signing on this document; is that not true, Mr. Witness?
A.	That is correct; however, I do not know how to read.  I can tell you what I know.
Q.	Yeah, I said that I went through those particulars with the aid of an interpreter where you were staying.  Do you recall that?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	And that you signed that document?
A.	That is correct.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I tender the document containing the personal particulars of this witness as Prosecution Exhibit P. 11.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is so entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 11.
	(Exhibit No. P. 11 admitted)
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the witness made two statements before ICTR investigators.  One is dated 11th November 1999 and the other September 18, 2002.  These are found on pages 207 to 263 of the witness bundle, and I would rely on only one statement, that is the one dated November 11, 1999.  

Your Honours may wish to know that the witness testified as Prosecution Witness DD in the Ntakirumana (phonetic) case from the 20th to the 22nd October 2001.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness BH, did violence erupt in the area of your residence following the date of the president's death, 6 April 1994?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the Prosecutor has referred to two statements but in the documents that we have before us we can see only one statement.  May we have also the second statement to which he's referring?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you are referring to which statements?   One is 11 November '99?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone sir.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
18 September 2002.

MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do we have --
MR. KAPAYA:
Unfortunately it would appear that that second statement is not annexed to the witness bundle.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But the Professor is entitled to have it.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, we have prepared copies of that statement.  We will distribute them now.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Have they been disclosed to him previously?
MR. KAPAYA:
It has been disclosed to him previously, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have a copy?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, we have it.

May I proceed, Your Honour?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I had just asked you whether you recall - sorry.
MR. SONGA:
Pardon me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have Kinyarwanda of 11th statement.
MR. KAPAYA:
We don't have any French or Kinyarwanda copies right now, Your Honour, but they can be procured in due course, of that particular statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you are leading your evidence on this witness today.  You are not going to rely on this statement?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, we are not, Your Honour, just we are relying on the one of 11th November.  This is the one which has been interpreted in Kinyarwanda.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
This has been interpreted in Kinyarwanda--
MR. KAPAYA:
No, the one we are relying on, the one dated 11th November.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have a copy of these?  Okay, thank you.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, Defence would have preferred to have this document in French and be able to read it and use it for the defence of the Accused, if necessary.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, Mr. Kapaya has said he is not relying on this statement.
MR. KAPAYA:
In addition, Your Honour, we disclosed this statement a long time ago to the Defence, it is only it is not in the bundle, but they have a copy in English and French because we discussed it in three languages, actually.  The only problem is -- the only snag is it is not included in the witness bundle we are using today.  It was disclosed long ago.
MR. SONGA:
And you have no capacity to get a French copy?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, we can.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In the course of your examination, see if you can't get it.
MR. KAPAYA:
We can, Your Honour.  We can get a copy.  

Professor, this French -- this statement was disclosed to you in French, also.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that correct?
MR. SONGA:
It is not correct in the sense that the document must be sent to us unredacted.  That's the only document that we can use before your Court and it has never been sent to us in unredacted form.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, are you able to get the French portion during your examination-in-chief?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  We are able to get that, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this will be supplied to you during the course of examination.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Kapaya, please proceed.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, I had just asked you whether you witnessed any violence in your area of residence following the death of the president on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, I witnessed violence.
Q.	Can you tell Their Honours what form that violence took or what that violence consisted of?
A.	This is what I witnessed.  On the eve of the death of President Habyarimana, that is on the 7th of April, I witnessed violence which led to the burning of houses.  We saw burnt houses.  We wondered what was happening.  And members of the population began to leave the area to go and seek refuge in Mugonero hospital.  They stayed in that place until they were killed.
Q.	When did you leave Mugonero hospital?
A.	I went to the Mugonero hospital on the 10th, a Sunday.  The others had already arrived at the premises.  My parents, my wife and my children had come before me to the hospital.  And I arrived only on the 10th.
Q.	When do you recall members of your family leaving for Mugonero hospital?
A.	They left on a Friday.  Some of them also left on Thursday, and when they arrived, there were already other members of the population who were there.  In any case, they went there before the 10th.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you talk of members of your family, who do you have in mind?
A.	I am referring to my four children, my wife, my sisters, my father and my mother.  There are also members of another family that was related to us.
Q.	Mr. BH, would you be able to tell the ethnic composition of the people you found seeking refuge there at the hospital?
A.	It was Tutsi who had taken refuge.
Q.	And is it correct to say there were men, women, and children?
A.	That is correct.  There were children, women, young men, young girls; all ages were represented.
Q.	Do you recall witnessing an attack at that complex at any time you were staying there, Mr. Witness?
A.	On the 16th Saturday attack was launched against this place.
Q.	Can you tell Your Honours who the attackers are and how they arrived there?
A.	The assailants were Mika, Sikubwabo, who was bourgmestre of the Gishyita commune.  There was also Ruzindana, Obed.  These are the people who launched attacks against this place.
Q.	Now, can you tell us how the said attackers arrived at the said complex?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, were they just those three people?
THE WITNESS:
They were not alone.  They were accompanied by numerous Interahamwe and soldiers whom I did not know.  I could not know the names of all these persons, but what I noticed was that there were very many and had surrounded the premises.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, can you tell us how they arrived at that complex, if you saw them?
A.	For the assailants that I saw, it was one morning on Saturday at around 9 a.m..  It is true that I was not wearing a watch, but it was around 9 a.m.  I saw Mika arrive in the commune vehicle accompanied by Sikubwabo, who was bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.  They were on board the commune vehicle, which is a Daihatsu.
Q.	Apart from the people in the Daihatsu, did you see other attackers there at the complex?
A.	There were many people who had surrounded all parts of the premises.  We were in the middle of the assailants.  They were not the only people who came from the Daihatsu and who came to this place.  There were other assailants.
Q.	How close were you to the Daihatsu when you saw it arriving at the complex?
A.	I was quite close near the school, the ESI school.  The assailants arrived, they parked, they began to shoot at us.  Mika, Sikubwabo and other soldiers were armed with guns, they began to fire at us.  The other assailants who had other arms and other weapons attacked us as well.  We could not move.  We remained at this place.
Q.	When the attack started, where were you?
A.	We were in the ESI school.  Right now classrooms have been built, but at that time, it was just land.
Q.	Do you recall seeing the members of your family immediately before the attack started?
A.	When many shots were fired and grenades exploded and when people began to cut with machetes, we went up and we went to ESE (sic).  My family was there, and my family was killed there.  So my family was killed in the hospital.  I went to the basement of the hospital, and there were many other people who had already arrived, and we stayed there.
Q.	Well, let's focus on your presence in the basement of the hospital.  Can you tell us approximately what time you got in the basement?
A.	I was not wearing a watch, so I wouldn't be able to tell you when I arrived. At that time, people were not wearing watches. But in any case, I arrived there around the evening period.  It was still daytime but it was around evening.
Q.	All right.  Now, can you describe to their honours what you observed while you were in the basement?
A.	Three girls went into another room and the door to that room overlooked the surgery ward.  In that room were Janet, Mukabutera.  And while I was there, I saw Mika, accompanied by Alphonse Muhayimana and Kanyabungo.  They went into the room, they met me there -- Mika, Alphonse Muhayimana arrived and they met those young girls there.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I can't quite get the names of the girls you are referring to.  Could you please repeat the names for the record?
A.	I said that there was Johaneta, Euginia (phonetic) and Mukabutera.
Q.	All right.  Now, can you tell us what you observed after these girls were in that room?
A.	When they got into the room they spoke to those girls saying, "Choose between rape and death."  Those girls had nothing to say.  They had realised that the situation was desperate.  And at that moment, Mika raped Janet (sic); Alphonse raped Virginie (phonetic), and Muhayimana raped Mukabutera.  After raping them they asked them, "Can you take us out of this place or you will leave us to die?"  And Mika said in answer, "If we take these girls away, they could accuse us, and this will jeopardise our lives seriously."  So they went out, leaving the girls in this basement.  The Interahamwe arrived thereafter and killed those girls.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, let's backtrack a little bit.  We didn't quite get the names of the people with whom Mika entered in that particular room.
A.	They were Alphonse and Muhayimana.  They are the sons of Kanyabungo.  Muhayimana was a soldier and Alphonse was an agronomist.
Q.	After these three people had entered in that room, can you now tell us if there was any discussion?  Now what took place?
A.	There was no discussion that could have taken place between them and the people in the hall.  Otherwise, I would say that the victims were almost dead, so those who came in had nothing to say to those who were already in the room.  They came knowing what they wanted to do, that is to kill.
Q.	Before the killing took place, can you describe what preceded that, Mr. Witness?
A.	They started by raping those girls.
Q.	Do you recall who of the three people raped which of the three women?  Do you recall that, 
Mr. Witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
	Madam President, there's a problem with the earsets and we cannot hear the Kinyarwanda interpreters very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you repeat your answer, please, so the Kinyarwanda booth can hear you?

Is there a problem with the Kinyarwanda?

Mr. Witness, do you have something to say?  You raised your hand.

Hold on, Mr. Witness.  We are -- have an interpretation problem.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness BH, you said that after Mika and these two people entered this room an act of rape occurred.   Now, what is it that you saw that makes you say that there was rape?  Could you describe the act which you saw Mika and the two people who accompanied him with these three women?
A.	I said so because at that moment there was distress and the people were being said that the Tutsis had to be killed, and when they came in they told these young girls, "You were arrogant; now we are going to do what we want to do with you because you are in our hands."  And that is why I am saying that they raped them.
Q.	What did you see that makes you say it was rape?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you see yourself the ladies being raped by the assailants, including the Accused?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I saw them.  I saw him with my own eyes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please proceed.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us what you saw with your own eyes, Mr. Witness?
A.	I saw them with my own eyes.
Q.	What did you see?  Can you describe what you saw?
A.	What I saw is the men rape them when they entered the hospital.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I wish to explore this further.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, can you tell us, Mr. Witness, when you say that Mika and the two guys raped these women, what are the acts?  What actions did you see?
A.	What I saw.  I saw them bring down their zips and rape the girls.
Q.	Who did you see bringing down whose zips?
A.	Mika.
Q.	All right, how long did the act of rape take place, of you recall?
A.	It did not take long, even though I couldn't gauge how much time one could take to rape somebody.
Q.	Now, after the rape, did you see anything?  Did you hear anything that took place there?
A.	What ensued is they said, "Are we going to take them along or leave them here?"  And Mika said they couldn't take them along since they could denounce, that could be a source of problems for them.  So they killed them -- left them in the cave (sic) and the Interahamwes went down to the basement and killed them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, who said that he wanted to take the girls with him?
A.	All I was trying to say is it is one of the companions.  I can't remember exactly who said it.  I wasn't at peace with myself and I couldn't make a distinction between one and the other, but that is what they said.  They were talking amongst themselves, the three of them, and I was trying to make sure they don't see me for fear that those see me, for fear that they kill me.
Q.	All right, now, have you known Kanyabungo before that incident, before the 16th of April?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Can you tell us who he is or who he was?
A.	He was a soldier during Kayibanda's regime, but he was retired during Habyarimana's reign.
Q.	Do you know where he lived?
A.	Yes, I knew where he used to live.  But he lived in the Ngoma secteur in the Kigarama locality.
Q.	And do you know who Muhayimana and Alphonse were or are?
A.	Are you talking about them now or during that period?
Q.	I'm talking about them during the period the act took place.  Who was Alphonse and who was Muhayimana?  Where did they live, if you know?
A.	Muhayimana was a soldier, and Alphonse was an agronomist who used to deal with coffee.  He lived in the Ngoma secteur in the Kigarama locality.  As for Muhimana -- as for Mika, he was a conseiller of the secteur at the time.
Q.	Now, let's turn to the three girls.  Had you known Johaneta and Euginia (phonetic) and Theresa before you saw them being raped on the 16th of April?
A.	I knew them.
Q.	Let's start with Johaneta.  What was she doing for a living?  How old was she?
A.	I didn't know her age.  All I knew was that she was a teacher, and I knew Janine (sic) was a student.  Mukabutera, as for herself, was a farmer.
Q.	Okay, who was Theresa, Witness?
A.	She was a farmer.
Q.	Do you know where she lives?
A.	She used to live in the Ngoma secteur, in the Njema cellule.
Q.	How about Janine?  Do you know what she did for a living and where did she live?
A.	She was a student in the ESIPAN.  Her father was called Carla Amos (phonetic).  He used to work in the hospital.
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you in any way related to any of these three girls?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter would like to know if that passage should be interpreted because that may reveal the identity of the witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
Actually, Your Honour, I withdraw that question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you know the ethnicity of these three ladies?
THE WITNESS:
They were Tutsi.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, for how long did you stay in the basement of the hospital?
A.	During the night, I left the basement and I went away.  I went up through the Muhambi hills, Muhambi and Butyama, went through to Bisesero, and that is where I went.
Q.	Now, while in Bisesero, did there come a time when you saw Mr. Muhimana, Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Can you tell us where and when?
A.	I saw him when he came heading the attacks at around the 13th or the 14th.
Q.	Thirteen and 14th of which month, Mr. Witness?
A.	Thirteenth and 14th of May.
Q.	Can you tell us what part of your cellule you were on this date?
A.	I was on the Muhira hill or colline when I saw him.
Q.	Can you tell us what type of vehicle he came in and whether he was accompanied by anybody or whether he was alone?
A.	He was accompanied by other persons, because on that day there were very many attacks, and when he came, he was on board a vehicle that belonged to the commune and he was in the company of Sikubwabo and others.  Nzandake (phonetic) on that vehicle.  And so at that moment when I saw him, he launched attacks on Muhira.  Mika was shooting at people.  He had a gun.
Q.	Now, how close were you when you saw Mika come?  How close were you to him?
A.	There was only a small stream that was separating us.  It wasn't far.  All over we were surrounded.  I could see him just as I'm seeing you before me, because we didn't have anywhere else to go, so we could very easily see the people around us.
Q.	Apart from Mika and Sikubwabo, were there other people, other attackers, that you recognised on that date?
A.	I was able to recognise, amongst others, Ruzindana, Kayishema also came and he was the préfet of the Kibuye préfecture.  There were many Interahamwes and the soldiers.  One could say that everybody in Rwanda had come to Bisesero.  I cannot give you the names of all those who were there, because I was being chased, and I can't tell you all the names or the names of all the people who were there.
Q.	Now, had you known Ruzindana before that date?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Can you tell us who he is and where he lived, if you knew?
A.	He used to live below us at Mugonero.  He was a trader.
Q.	Now, these attackers, you have told us that they came in like numbers.  Can you tell us whether they came in a particular pattern or they came together?  It is not quite clear, Mr. Witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are not helping the witness tell us.  Why don't you put questions to him like -- questions like whether they came together, whether they drove, whether they walked.  Tell us that which will make him make his evidence in a way that illuminates.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	By what means, Mr. Witness, did the attackers come to the site, to the Muhira hill?
A.	There wasn't only one attack; there were many of them.  Buses, all the buses of Rwanda and all the vehicles of Rwanda, I could say that they all came there.  It wasn't easy to count them, even a computer couldn't be of any use if you wanted to give a count of the people, people from Gisenyi, of Kigali, of Morengeri (phonetic), who came.  People came from all over Rwanda.  On that day, the situation was very critical.  There were attacks from all sides.  You couldn't go anywhere to escape.
Q.	Now, among those attackers, could you tell whether any of them appeared to be leading the others?
A.	Mika was leading the group of the assassins from Gishyita.  He was the one leading the attacks.
Q.	Apart from Gishyita, did you see another group coming from any other direction?
A.	Many of them, I couldn't identify them from which direction they had come, but you could easily distinguish the Gishyita attack which was led by Mika.  Then the conseiller from the Mubuga secteur was also leading another attack, but as far as the other attacks I was unable to identify the origin nor their leaders.
Q.	Now, can you tell us when the attack took place at that particular place on the 15th of May?
A.	The attack began at 8:00 because at that time the attackers had  surrounded the locality.  I'm trying to estimate because it was very early in the morning.  I wasn't wearing a watch.  I can't say when exactly they came.
Q.	And can you tell us how the attacks were launched?
A.	The attacks were launched from all over, and they shot at us, they threw grenades on us.  We tried to run.  Mika shot at people.  He and his companions were unable to have a way out, and the night fell.
Q.	Now, did you see people wounded or dead, as a consequence of that attack, Mr. Witness?  If so, how can you estimate the number?
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you the number of people who died, because on that day very many people died.  I cannot estimate the number.  As for people who were wounded on that day, the attackers came the next day and finished them off.
Q.	Now, you say you were at the same place the next day.  Why didn't you move, Mr. Witness, following the attack the previous day?
A.	We had nowhere to go.  I couldn't go anywhere because we no longer had any place for refugees.
Q.	Now, on the 14th, the next day, tell us what you saw.
A.	On that very date of the 14th, that is the next day, I saw him again in the morning.  They came at about 8:00 and they launched an attack on the Muhira hill.  They shot at people, and the Interahamwes cut down people with machetes.  So I saw him that next day.  He was there.
Q.	Now let's go, let's make tracks a little bit.  How did he come the following day?  Can you tell us the means by which he got there, with whom he was accompanied by, if anybody?
A.	He came on board a car with Sikubwabo.  They were in a car that belonged to the commune, and that was on the 14th of May.  He was with many assailants, in particular Interahamwes who were in that car, in that vehicle.  So on that day the assailants came, many numbers, they came from Gishyita.  So in the morning they came in order to finish the work that they had begun.
Q.	Apart from Mika and Sikubwabo, who else could you recognise amongst the attackers?
A.	I was able to recognise Obed Ruzindana, the conseiller of Mubuga, and Kayishema was also present on that day.  Those are the people that I was able to recognise.  I didn't want to know the names of those who were there, but there were very many others because there was a very larger number of attackers.
Q.	Well, how were you able to recognise Muhimana in the midst of all those attackers?
A.	I couldn't have failed to recognise him.  Even if you see somebody for the first time, the next day you can recognise him, let alone given the fact that I knew Muhimana because he was from my region and I knew him and he himself knew me.
Q.	Can you tell us approximately what time an attack was launched?
A.	It was at about 8:00 in the morning, because they came very early in the morning.  I think it was at about 8:00.  We, the refugees, we usually woke up early in the morning while waiting for the attackers, so it was 8:00.
Q.	Do you have any idea how long the attack took, before it finally subsided?
A.	At about 2 p.m. their cars started going away, but the vehicles were still on the spot, and that is how other members of the population, who were equipped with spears; otherwise, the cars started going away at about 2 p.m. after they had done their job.
Q.	Did there come a time when you left this place, Muhira hill?  And where did you go, if you did?
A.	Since those hills are adjacent to each other, I left Muhira to go to another hill called Runyangingo.
Q.	How far is -- can you estimate the distance between Muhira and Runyangingo hill?
A.	The two hills are found in the same region, so the distance is not very long.  It is still -- they are both in the same Bisesero region.
Q.	Can you tell us what you observed when you went to Runyangingo hill?
A.	From where I was hiding, I saw that a certain Kabanda had been brought out.  He was taken out and killed and his head was taken to Mika where he was sitting on the road.  He was with Sikubwabo and Ruzindana, and they were just by the road, and the head of Kabanda was brought to them.
Q.	Now, how did Mika come to that place?
A.	He came to kill, as was his custom, and he wanted Kabanda's head.
Q.	By what means did he get to that place?
A.	He came on board the communal vehicle.
Q.	What time was it?
A.	Wherever he went, he was on board that vehicle.  I am not in a position to tell you what time it was.  In any case, I know it was during the day.
Q.	All right.  Can you help us with who are the other people he came with in that vehicle?
A.	There were Interahamwes on board that vehicle, but I don't know the exact number of people there were.
Q.	How far did that vehicle stop from where you were hiding?
A.	It was a short distance.  I believe I showed that area to the investigators.  It was a short distance.  I did not measure the distance in order to know exactly how many metres it was, but from where I was, I could see them because it was a short distance.  From where I was, I could very well identify the people who were on the road.
Q.	Can you now describe to us how Kabanda was discovered?
A.	Kabanda was flushed out of his millet fields.  He was hiding very close to me.  He tried to run, and when they caught up with him, they started cutting him up with machetes, and they cut off his head and took it to Mika, who was with Ruzindana.  Thereafter the head was given to Mika because he asked for.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who was this Kabanda in the community?
THE WITNESS:
Kabanda was a trader who bought and sold coffee.  He was Mika's neighbour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know what Mika did?
THE WITNESS:
Mika took the victim's head and went away with it on board that vehicle.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you if you knew what Mika did for a living before the war or when there was no war.
THE WITNESS:
Mika was a trader, as well as conseiller of the secteur.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know in what commodity?
THE WITNESS:
Mika used to buy coffee.  He also had a business place, a shop, but he was also conseiller of the secteur.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm still on Kabanda.  Do you know where Kabanda lived?
A.	Yes, he used to live in Bisesero region on Gitwa hill, but he practised his trade in Gishyita.
Q.	And what trade did he do?  Did he stay in Gishyita?
A.	He bought coffee and he also had a shop.
Q.	What was his ethnic group?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	Now, after Mika and company had taken the head of Kabanda, what happened to the body of this man, do you know?
A.	The rest of the body was left on the spot.
Q.	Now, after the Kabanda affair, did you see Muhimana again in the Bisesero area?
A.	I saw him again in the month of June.  He was at a crossroads of roads leading to Gishyita.  It was on the road leading to Gishyita, and he was asking the people who had been wounded to come out onto the road so that he should give them medicines and food, as well as plastic tents.  He was asking people to come down to the road so that he could give them that assistance.
Q.	Can you tell us the name of that place where you saw him, if you know it?
A.	It was on Gitwa hill, very close to Kanyinya (sic), close to the road from Mubuga and another road from Gishyita.  So it was a junction, and the road was leading to Gisovu, the road on which he was.
Q.	Now, how far were you from him when you observed him coming to that place?
A.	The distance between me and that road was a very short one.  He was talking to us, reassuring us that he would meet us at the junction and that he would bring drugs to us.  On that day, he did nothing wrong because he was hoping to rally a large number of people on the day he had an appointment with us, not on the day he had to meet us.
Q.	Can you disclose, as close as possible, the words which he used to address you as you were hiding there at Gitwa hill?
A.	These were his words.  "On Monday I should meet you here.  Are there any casualties, any wounded persons?"  We said, "Yes, we have."  "On Monday let us meet here.  I will bring you food and drugs, and I will also look for plastic tents for you."  These were his words.  He spoke with us.  I cannot tell a lie.  He is present in this courtroom, and he can confirm what I am saying.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you believe him when you heard him say these words?
A.	We did not believe him.  By the way, on the Monday, they returned in large numbers to launch an attack, and when they got there, all the refugees had gone into hiding because we knew he was telling a lie and he was trying to deceive us.
Q.	Why did you think that he was deceiving you?
A.	We had seen what he had been doing.  He had been killing people, and we told ourselves that he could not help us, whereas there was just a small number of refugees left, and we thought he wanted to seize that opportunity to finish off the others, and that is why we resolved to go into hiding.
Q.	Who are the other people that came at that hill?
A.	He was with Obed Ruzindana, Sikubwabo, and a large number of other people.  I would rather say that there weren't very many of them because they wanted to lure us into their trap so that we should assemble under the pretext that he wanted to bring us drugs, but as a matter of fact, it was  a trap to catch us.
Q.	Right.  Now, was there a time that an investigator from this Tribunal asked you to show the places you have described in this Tribunal today?
A.	I went there with an official of this Tribunal, a white person.  We left Mugonero hospital to go to Bisesero, and I showed him all the locations where those acts were carried out.  He told me his name, but I can't remember it.
Q.	Let's start with Mugonero.  What did you show him at Mugonero?
A.	I showed him the room in which those girls had been and where I and the other persons had been.  That investigator was accompanied by an interpreter, and I showed him where we had been.
Q.	Now, can you describe the layout of the room which you showed the investigator the act of rape took place?
A.	We went down the staircase to get into the hospital, and those girls had been in a room very close to the corridor.  There was a room that was used as a pharmacy, and a surgery room, and it was between those two rooms.
Q.	Now, did you show him where you were standing and where the girls were during the act of rape?
A.	Yes, I showed him where I had been standing.
Q.	Was it in the same room or a different room?
A.	I was opposite that room, and I could see what was happening in that room because the door was open.  It had been smashed, as well as the windows all had been destroyed.
Q.	And how close were you from the act?  How close were you from Muhayimana, Muhimana, and Alphonse when the act of rape was taking place?
A.	The distance from where I was standing to where they were was about a metre, not even a metre.  It was a very short distance.
Q.	And what time of the day was it, Mr. Witness?  Could you tell whether it was in the morning, the afternoon or the evening?
A.	It was towards the evening.  I don't remember exactly what time it was, but I believe it was towards the evening.  But it was before nightfall.  I had no notion of time.  I was haunted by death, so I didn't have the presence of mind to know what time it was.
Q.	Apart from that place where the rapes took place, what else did you show the investigators, if you recall?
A.	I showed him Runyangingo hill, as well as Gitwa hill.
Q.	Did you show him the distances where you were standing at Runyangingo when you saw Mika come, where he talked and where Kabanda was discovered?
A.	Yes, I showed him those different locations.
Q.	Now, just for clarity in the record, can you describe, how big was the place where you say the rapes took place?  How big was the room?
A.	I did not measure this room, but I might say that it was a small one.
Q.	As small as the place you are sitting there or, if bigger, how big?
A.	It was not bigger than this place.  I would say that it was from here where I am sitting to the other side of the hall.  I am referring to the wall just next to me before the end of the room.
Q.	That is, you mean behind where the Honourable Judges are sitting, the wall behind where the Honourable Judges are sitting?
A.	No, that's a long distance.  It was a small room.  I would say that it was just about the same size as the witness box in which I am.  I would say that two beds could get into this room, so it was a small one.
Q.	Now, did it have --
A.	That is from the box to the court registry room.  All the windows had been broken, had been destroyed, the glass had been broken, so the entire building had been destroyed.
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you know what that room was being used for before the incident?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Prosecutor, would you please repeat the question?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	I asked him whether he knew what that room was for -- was used for, at the Mugonero hospital?
A.	I did not often go to the basement of this hospital.  I did not know what this room was used for.  All I know is that at this point in time this room is being used as a maternity.  Besides, the hospital had not been constructed fully at that time.  But for the time being, this is one of the rooms of the maternity.
Q.	Were the three girls raped in the same room?
A.	Yes, they were raped in the same room.
Q.	Did you observe whether the rape took place on the floor or a bed?
A.	I witnessed the rape, but I did not pay attention to determine whether the rape occurred on a bed or on the floor.  However, in this room there were two beds but which were not made for people to lie on because the bedding had been removed.
Q.	Did you witness the three men undress the three women?
JUDGE SHORT:
That is a leading question.
MR. KAPAYA:
I withdraw it, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Immediately before the rapes, what did you observe, Mr. Witness?
A.	I saw the assailants move toward this room.
Q.	Immediately before the act of rape, did you observe the men do anything to those women, to those three women?
A.	I witnessed the Interahamwe enter this room and killed the young girls, but the people who had raped them had left them alive inside the room.
Q.	When the rapes were taking place, were the women dressed?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, I want you to assume that we don't know what rape is.  You have spoken about rape.  For the benefit of the Court and everybody here, we want to describe exactly what took place, the act which you consider to be rape.  I know it might be difficult for you to talk explicitly about rape, but I would like you to tell us exactly what was done and by whom to whom, please.
THE WITNESS:
They pulled down their trousers but they did not undress completely.  They did not undress completely.  They pulled down their trousers, but you know that when you undo your belt or you pull down your zip, the person is almost naked, even if their trousers does not fall to the ground.
JUDGE SHORT:
Continue and tell us what happened after they pulled down their trousers.
THE WITNESS:
After they undressed, after they divested themselves of their trousers, they abused these young girls, and after they had consummated the act, they said, "Shall we take them with us or do we leave them here?"  And Mika said this: "If we take them with us, they may report us, and that might be bad for us."  Immediately they went out.  The Interahamwe went into the room and killed these girls.
JUDGE SHORT:
How did they abuse the girls?  We want the details.
THE WITNESS:
What can I tell you?  They had sexual intercourse with these girls, like everybody does.  I don't know how to describe this thing to you, in fact, because he had sexual relations with her and they finished.  But I can tell you that he took his genitals and put them into the genitals of one of the young girls.  I don't know how I can describe this scene to you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I think you have described it enough, Witness.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right, now, Mr. Witness, you have stated that you know Mika.  Can you tell us when you knew him for the first time, Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew him because I was going to the area where he lived, where my aunt was married.  She lived not far from his residence.  My aunt was married at this place.  She was the neighbour of 
Mika Muhimana and he himself knows it.  There was also a ********************************************** *********.  Mika himself knows this.  Maybe he may pretend he doesn't recognise me but he's known me for a long time.  Even when he was young I knew him and I also know the house of his parents.
Q.	Now you are telling us, Mr. Witness, that you and Mika are related in a way?
A.	He is Hutu.  I am Tutsi, there is no relationship between us.
Q.	All right, now, can you describe how he looked like when you knew him?  Can you describe how Mika looks like?
A.	He is fair skinned.  I can see him.  He is sitting there.  He is wearing a little cap.  I knew him -- I've known him for a long time.  Even if I were to close my eyes, even if -- and I moved to where he is sitting I can touch him with my finger.
Q.	So, can you point out where he is right now, if you can see him, in this room?
A.	There he is.  He is sitting behind this elderly person who is wearing a glass -- glasses, and he is holding a pen next to one of his cheeks.
Q.	Can you describe what he is wearing?
A.	He is behind this person.  He is wearing a small white cap, a black jacket and a white shirt.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, let the record reflect that the witness has identified the Accused person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has identified the Accused.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

That's all I have for this witness, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you Mr. Kapaya. 

Mr. Witness, you will now be asked questions by the Defence counsel, counsel for the Accused.  Answer the questions asked by the counsel for the Accused, very briefly. 

Professor Songa, you have the floor.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to ask you whether I may be granted leave to use some minutes to read the statement that has just been given to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has raised his finger.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
I would like to take some time off, so I can go and relieve myself.  Please, I would like to take some time off so that I may go and put myself at ease. 
	(Court recessed at 1340H)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed.  Professor, you have the floor for the cross-examination. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Once again, good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know Mika Muhimana well before the events of April 1994?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Did you also know certain members of his family?
A.	I didn't carry out an investigation to know members of his family.  He is the one that I knew and I think that's enough.
Q.	That's correct.  Did you remember having made a statement before the Prosecution investigator on 11th November 1999?  
A.	Which date did you say? 
Q.	11 November 1999. 
A.	I do not quite remember because I didn't take down the dates.
Q.	We can refresh your memory.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, can I be granted leave to show the statement to the witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  

Mr. Witness, did you ever make a statement before the investigator?
THE WITNESS:
People used to come and meet me and ask me questions, but I can't tell you exactly who those persons were because I didn't know them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is this a signed copy?
THE WITNESS:
I cannot consult that document because I can neither read nor write.  I don't think it will serve me any purpose to show me the document when I can neither read nor write. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read and write Kinyarwanda?
THE WITNESS:
No.
MR. SONGA: 
Can an interpreter try to summarise or give a few statements, a few ideas in that statement?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you recognise your signature?  Mr. Witness, do you recognise your signature?
THE WITNESS:
Even if I recognised the signature, whereas I am not the one who drafted that document, I cannot be too sure of the content.  I am not the one who drafted that statement.  Probably my signature is appended to the document, but if I had been the person who drafted the document I would have been in a position to help you, but I am not the person who drafted it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you can read the relevant portion of the statement to the witness and ask your question.
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President, I will proceed in that manner.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement of 11 November 1999 you stated that you had been interviewed before about Pastor Elizaphan Ntakirutimana but that you didn't know the person who interviewed you or from which organisation he came.  Would you recall having made such a statement?
A.	Continue, I am listening to you.  I do recall having made such a statement.
Q.	Thank you.  The person who interviewed you, didn't he introduce himself?
A.	I did not take note of that name to become able to identify him.  Besides I don't know where he was coming from.
Q.	You also stated that in the morning of 7 April you saw in your cellule four gendarmes who were asking people to stay at home; is that correct?
A.	I began with that.  I don't know if you want me to go over my statement.  I made a statement -- testimony, and I don't think I should go over it. 
Q.	You should be ready to answer all questions asked by the Defence, Mr. Witness.
A.	If you ask me questions, I will answer you if I understand what you want to know.  But if I don't understand what you want to know I won't be able to reply to you.  I have told you that I will stick to my statement and I am not going to say anything outside it.
Q.	I will ask the question in another manner.  You stated that on the 7th of April, you saw in your cellule four gendarmes who were asking people to stay at home and not to gather in groups.  Do you confirm that statement?
A.	Today I do not make any allusion to that statement, and I have told you that I am going to stick to my statement.  With respect to questions that you are going to ask outside my testimony, I am not going to answer you because it is as if I am making a new testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you make a statement?
THE WITNESS:
I have reiterated the statements that I have made here today.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have to answer all the questions asked by the Defence counsel, as you did for the Prosecution.
THE WITNESS:
I am going to answer questions fielded to me by the Defence counsel if he asks me questions that have to do with those that I was asked, but if he has to ask me questions that are not in my testimony, I don't think I'll answer him because he would be trying to confuse me.  I wouldn't want to say anything outside my testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you know the answer, answer it.  If you don't know the answer, say you don't know, but you have to answer the question.  

Professor, please proceed.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, if the professor asks you a question he shouldn't ask, the Court will tell you not to answer, but the questions that are put by him are put by the Court.  So you answer to the Court, unless the Court tells you not to answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I will answer the question if it's acceptable to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please continue. 
MR. SONGA: 
Madam President, do I have leave to repeat the question for which I haven't had an answer yet?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please repeat your question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that on the morning of 7th April you saw in your cellule four gendarmes who were asking people to stay at home and not to gather in groups.  Do you confirm that statement?
A.	As concerns that statement, I think there is a problem somewhere because on the 7th, that is, on the eve of the death of Habyarimana, those events occurred, or rather the day following the death of the president those events that you just mentioned occurred. 
Q.	Now, to your knowledge, did people comply with that instruction?
A.	People did not comply with the instructions of the gendarmes because they had noted that there were things that were happening, and those people decided to go and seek refuge in the Mugonero hospital.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that on the 8th of April 1994, you heard grenades and fire -- gunfire or shots, and that you saw the smoke rising from houses that had been burnt, and you recalled similar scenes that had taken place in 1973.  Is that correct?
A.	I didn't make those statements.
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I am not the one who wrote down that statement in my statement.  So I cannot say that I am the one who inserted that in the statement in question.
Q.	Probably the Tribunal will have occasion to tell you that even an illiterate can assume responsibility for his statements.  Can we proceed?  

You state that, your family and yourself, that you went to the Mugonero complex where many white men were living; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What was your family made of?
A.	My family was made up of persons who belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.	I would like to clarify my question.  Besides yourself, did you have a wife, children, grandchildren, parents?  That was the meaning of my question.
A.	Although family members existed in my family, but I can't repeat their names because I do not want to resuscitate them, and I am not ready to give the names of people who have died.  It is not by talking about those people that they will come back to life.  But I would like to tell you that I had a wife and children.
Q.	Far be it for me to ask you to give me names.  Your answer is satisfactory to  me.  

You declared or stated before the Court a while ago that you went to Mugonero with your four children, your wife, your father, your sisters and your mother.  Can you confirm that?
A.	That was my statement and, please, I would like you to excuse me but I thought you had followed my statement, at least that's what I said in my testimony.
Q.	Mr. Witness, it's because I listened to you that I am asking these questions.  How many sisters did you have?
A.	There were three of them.
Q.	Do you recall having testified in another trial before a Court of this Tribunal?
A.	I do recall that.
Q.	Do you recall that a question was posed to you to find out how your family sought refuge in the Mugonero hospital?
A.	I didn't put that in writing but I know that my family sought refuge in that location.  I do not know on what date I made that statement, but my family sought refuge at Mugonero.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are going to refer to the transcripts of that testimony.  You state that when you arrived at Mugonero, you found many other people and amongst those people were members of your family.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can we have a copy of transcript? 
MR. SONGA:
Obviously, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In the French version of the transcript, it is page 91 and 92, and in the English draft you'll find the statement on page 97 and 98 -- 77 and 78, I beg your pardon.  You said therefore that when you reached the hospital centre, there were many other people and amongst those people were members of your family.
A.	Yes, I said that.
Q.	Thank you.  Does this not mean that you did not all go to Mugonero at the same time?
A.	We did not go at the same time.
Q.	Still in the same transcript, you stated that you -- there were two of your sisters and your father. You did not mention either your mother or your children, just as you didn't mention your mother.
A.	Probably the person who took those transcripts made a mistake, but the members of my family were there.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In the same statement, in the same transcript, in answer to the question as to whether you were married, you said, "Yes."  In another question you were asked if you had children in April 1994 and you answered in the affirmative. 
A.	I stated that I had four children, that is correct.
Q.	And for the next question, like,  where were your children and your wife when you went to take refuge at the complex, this is the answer that you gave:  "They were higher up in the hills in a location called Gitwe."  "Why" -- another question followed:  "Why didn't they try to seek refuge with you at Mugonero?"  Answer:  "We did not go at the same time".  That was your answer, you didn't leave at the same time.  So, Mr. Witness, please can you clarify -- can you enlighten the Court as to whether you and your family went to the Mugonero complex together on that 8th April 1994 or not?
A.	On that day, people hadn't gone to the hills yet.  They went to Mugonero.  I arrived on the 10th of April at Mugonero and I sent them.  Nobody had gone to the hills.  It is, rather, people who had survived the Mugonero massacre that went to the hills of Bisesero.  We, therefore, went to the hospital thinking that we were going to be saved there. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, am I to understand, therefore, that you are saying the truth today?
A.	I am speaking the truth from what I know.  I am saying what I know, in other words.
Q.	Should I also understand that on the 23rd of October 2001, you led the Tribunal into error or you misled the Tribunal?
A.	What date did you say?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What error are you alluding to?  That his family went there before him or they didn't go there at all?
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  This is the portion of transcript.  But in the English draft you can find the same questions and answers beginning from page 77, that is, on page 77 and 78.  These are the questions that we find therein:  "In April 1994, Mr. Witness, had you been married?  

Answer: "Yes."  

Question: "Had you had children by April 1994?"

"Yes, I had children."

Question: "Where were your wife and children when you went to take refuge at the complex?"  

Answer: "They were further up in the mountains at a place called Gitwe."  

Question: "Why hadn't they sought to take refuge along with you at Mugonero? " 

Answer: We didn't leave at the same time. "

That is a portion of the transcript, Your Honours, which I am trying to refer the witness to so that he can tell us the truth.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But the portion that he gave evidence today didn't say all his family were at the complex when he went there.
MR. SONGA:
We listened and followed the answer that he gave to the Prosecution a while ago, and he said that he went to the complex on the 10th with his parents, his wife and his children, and that they went to the complex together. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, he didn't.  He said -- what I put down is this, "I went to the Mugonero hospital on the 10th April 1994 after the members of my family had been there -- had gone there.  They found the other people there, my family included, my mother, my father, my sisters, my children."  I don't suppose mine is accurate, but what was distinctly correct is that he went after the other members of the family. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we are trying to compare several statements made by the witness, and from the declaration of 11th November we extracted the following statement, "My family and myself went to the Mugonero complex where many white men were living.  We understood that they left together or went there together."  And when we asked him the question as to whether they went together to Mugonero, he said, "No, they did not go to Mugonero."  He said, "They went to the mountains."  These are all things that appear in these various documents. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
May I say something on this issue, Your Honours?  Your Honours, the witness has said quite clearly that his wife, his members of his family, left their residence before the 10th, and that he went there on the 10th.  This was about a day after they had left their home, but in the course of days is when they met at the Mugonero hospital.  That is his testimony, and when he was asked in these proceedings where did they go, he had the impression that they went to the hills, but later on they went to the hospital; that is where they met, their final point of meeting.  He didn't say they went there together.  They went there separately, and he was asked a specific question on this part of his testimony.  He said, "My family preceded me." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can clarify the position by asking questions.
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President.

In the transcript of the 23rd of October 2001, a very precise question is put to the witness: " Where were your wife and children when you sought refuge in the complex?"  So what the Prosecutor has said is incompatible with that question and the response to that question.  The family did not go before.  The question was, "When did you go to seek refuge in the complex? Where was your wife?" So it was the witness himself who got to the complex before, whereas members of his family, including his wife, were uphill in a place called Gitwe.  This is very logical and coherent and we cannot challenge that.  

I would like to ask another question to the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, who went before to the complex, was it your wife and children or you?  Who went before?  Who arrived there first?
A.	It was my wife and children who got there first, as well as the other members of my family.  I met them there when I got there.
Q.	So let me repeat the question already put to you.  On the 23rd of October 2001, you misled the Tribunal; isn't that correct?
JUDGE SHORT:
When you say he misled the Tribunal, follow it with what he said which -- what he said at the Tribunal, otherwise the question becomes very vague.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Maybe I should be more precise by asking the witness this question:  on the 23rd October 2001, you lied didn't you?
A.	You should explain how I lied.
Q.	I will be able to do so.  When did you arrive at Mugonero complex, Witness?
A.	I wasn't wearing a watch.  I did not even know that this trial was going to take place.
Q.	Was it during the day or at night?
A.	I arrived there during the day.  It wasn't at night.
Q.	What means of transportation did you use to get to the complex?
A.	I went there on foot.  It wasn't far.
Q.	Who accompanied you?
A.	I was with other people who were going to that hospital.
Q.	Were you neighbours?
A.	Yes, they were my neighbours.
Q.	No family member was with you?
A.	There were many members of my family.  There were my uncles, my aunts, my cousins.  When you have problems, when you are in distress, you travel together.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You stated that while you were in Mugonero complex, the entire building as well as the premises were occupied by refugees; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Where exactly did you hide in the Mugonero complex?
A.	I was in the courtyard.  There was no bush in which I could hide; there were houses.
Q.	You did not have a precise hideout?
A.	I was in the hospital on that day of the killings, that is, on that date of 16th.
Q.	We haven't gotten there yet, Witness. 
Q.	You stated that pastors wrote to their colleague, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, requesting him to ask the bourgmestre's of Gishyita, Charles Sikubwabo, to spare the lives of the refugees and authorise them to cross Lake Kivu to Zaire because, at the time, Lake Kivu was watched over by the Interahamwe.  Is that correct?
A.	Why are you referring to Ntakirutimana?  I believe, as far as I am concerned, I am here to give testimony in Mika's case.
Q.	Witness, were the Interahamwe watching over Lake Kivu?
A.	Yes, the Interahamwe had control over Lake Kivu.
Q.	Who were the Interahamwe who were keeping an eye on the lake, Lake Kivu?
A.	They were Hutu Interahamwe.  At the time, no Tutsi could get to Lake Kivu.
Q.	Witness, you say that it was Interahamwe who were watching the lake, Lake Kivu.  Did you see that with your own eyes?
A.	Everywhere I was, the Interahamwe could get there.  They went everywhere.
Q.	At that time, were you on the banks of the lake?
A.	I was at the hospital.  I did not go to Lake Kivu.
Q.	If we understand what you are saying correctly, should we take it that you did not see with your own eyes the Interahamwe watching Lake Kivu?
A.	I do not know whether that is the case that has brought us here now.  I am referring to what happened at the hospital.  I am not supposed to answer questions regarding Lake Kivu.  I am not concerned by Lake Kivu.  Put questions to me regarding Mika.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, if you know the answer, please answer.
THE WITNESS:
I stated that the lake was guarded because people tried to get to Congo, and one of those people came back and told us that people were mounting guard over the lake and that the people who had been with him had been killed, otherwise I, myself, did not go to the lake. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So who -- under whose authority was the lake being watched, from what you gathered?
A.	I did not ask that question.  I was a man in distress.  I did not ask the question as to whether -- as to who was in charge of those guarding the lake.
Q.	Thank you.  You stated that you saw assailants surrounding Mugonero complex; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I was witness to that.
Q.	From what position did you see them?
A.	I was in the courtyard in front of the hospital.  Very close to ESI, there was a field, but at the moment that location is occupied by classrooms.
Q.	Were the assailants wearing any particular clothes?
A.	They were wearing clothes, but I could not make out exactly what type of clothes they were wearing.  They were all dressed up. 
Q.	You stated witness that you recognised Kagaba and Mathias, who were employees of Mugonero hospital, going ahead of the assailants and carrying firearms; is that correct?
A.	This case in point does not concern them.  I don't think I should answer questions regarding two different trials.  If they are arrested, you can ask me questions and I will explain.
Q.	I have not received an answer to my question, so I will repeat it:  you stated at that you recognised Kagaba and Matthias, who were employees of Mugonero hospital, and they were leading the assailants, going ahead of the assailants and carrying firearms.  Do you confirm having stated that?
A.	But those persons are not present here.  We should not dwell on those two people, unless you have arrested them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT.
Mr. Witness, we want you to answer the question.

Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You had stated that seeing about 5,000 assailants coming towards you, you ran towards the church, and finding the doors shut, you went to the surgical ward.  Do you confirm that?
A.	If I made mention of 5,000 assailants, it is only an estimate.  As a matter of fact, when I got to the church, it was closed, so I went towards the surgical ward.  That is what I stated.
Q.	What was the distance from the point where you decided to run towards the church to the church itself?
A.	It is a short distance.  We were being fired at; others were using machetes.  We were together. 
Q.	Can you give an approximate distance?
A.	It isn't a long distance.  For instance, if you pick a comparison, it would be from where I am sitting in the box to the wall opposite me.  People were being killed.  The assailants were already there when I was fleeing from the church.
Q.	Mr. Witness, give us the location of the surgery room in relation to the rest of the complex?t
A.	Would you please repeat the question, Counsel?
Q.	Yes, of course.  Give us the location of the surgery room in relation to the rest of complex, that is, in relation to the entire Mugonero hospital complex?
A.	All the houses are next to each other.  The surgery room is next to what was the hospital.  Before the storey building was constructed, all the buildings were next to each other. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what situation did you find in the surgery room?
A.	I did not enter the surgery room, instead, I went to a room next to this one.  There were persons whose names I have cited.  They were in a room next to the surgery room.
Q.	I shall read to you your own statement of the 11th of November 1999:  "I decided to run towards the church, and when I found it closed, I went to the surgery room".  That is why I am asking you the question on the situation that you found at that place.
A.	Perhaps things have been confused.  Where I was, was quite close to the surgery room.  I did not enter this room.
Q.	A bit further, further on, you state, Mr. Witness, that when you were in the operating block, you heard Pastor Ntakirutimana and Dr. Ntakirutimana say to the killers, "to save the medicine."  Is the operating block the same place as the surgery room or is this a different place?
A.	That is how this room was called.  I was in front of this room.  I was next to the door opposite the surgery.  There is no major difference; the two rooms are next to each other.
Q.	Would you please repeat your answer so that I may understand whether the operating block indicates the same place as the surgery room?
A.	I do not know the difference.  I could not distinguish the two rooms.  All I know is that the room in which the persons who were killed were found was opposite me, and opposite me is the surgery.  So it seems to me that there is no difference.  If I had worked there, I would have been able to make the distinction between the two rooms.
Q.	Thank you Mr. Witness.  When you heard the pastor and the doctor talking about the protection of medicine, in what precise location were you?
A.	I was in the hospital building, in the basement.
Q.	In what part of the basement?
A.	It was in the basement.  I could describe where I was if you knew the place or, perhaps, Mika can describe the place to you.  I cannot tell you what place it was but, in any case, it was in a corridor and it was close to the room I was referring to.
Q.	And when you were in the corridor, where were the pastor and the doctor?
A.	They were opposite a door which is near the stairs which lead down into the basement.  When you get off the stairs, you immediately arrive at the door of the surgery room so there is no major difference.  It is in this room that the young girls were.
Q.	May we take it that the pastor and the doctor were also in the corridor?
A.	I do not understand you very well, Counsel.  Would you like to ask me questions about these people?  Their court case has already been wrapped up.  I don't know whether you want me to talk to you about these people.
Q.	No, I am asking questions about this location.  I use your answers to determine location.  When you state that they were in front of the door when you heard them, I don't - I would like to know whether they are inside or outside.  If they are outside the door, I imagine that that would be the corridor.  That is the aim of my question.
A.	You heard my statement.  Did I tell you that Ntakirutimana and his son were inside the room? 
Q.	The answer would be shorter if you said that they were in the corridor.  

In exactly what place were found the medicine that they were talking about?
A.	The medicine was in the hospital building.  I am not a doctor, so I could not know where the medicine was found.  I just heard what they said, but I do not know where the medicine was kept.
Q.	Thank you Mr. Witness.  You state the following:  "Then the Interahamwe began to put the medicine in the car".  Is this correct?
A.	Did I say so today? 
Q.	You stated this on another day, on the 11th of November 1999?
A.	My statement is not based on this written statement.  If you want, you could ask me to give testimony based on that statement but, today, I am giving a statement based on a particular matter, and I am going to give you very precise answers. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we again direct you to answer the questions asked, and don't make comments on the questions. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, may I continue?  May I repeat this question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that the Interahamwe began to put the medicine in the car; is that correct?
A.	I did not state that they were Interahamwe.  They asked them to take the medicine out so that they would not be stained with blood, and since the vehicle was parked at that place, the medicine was loaded into the vehicle, and I would not say that they carried this medicine on their heads. 
Q.	So, you saw the medicine being loaded into the car?
A.	I did not pay attention to determine whether this order was obeyed, but I heard them giving this order because my ears were working, so I could hear what they said. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, just give short and precise answers and don't narrate long stories. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state you were in one of the changing rooms of the operating block, and that that is where they discovered you and shot at you, that most people died, and you fell to the ground amongst the bodies; is that correct?
A.	That is not correct.  I told you where I was.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which statement.
MR SONGA:
Madam President, I am referring to the statement of 11th November 1999.  In the French version, it is on page 4, the first paragraph, fourth line -- the fourth and the fifth line.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, professor. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I do not know whether I understood your answer correctly, Mr. Witness.  Would you please answer the question?  If you have already answered the question, be so kind as to repeat your answer.
A.	I can tell you where I was.  When I was shot, I was in the surgery room.  If you say that then that is false, I was in front of a door that was near the surgery room.
Q.	In the statement in question, do you not remember talking about a hiding place in one of the changing rooms of the operating block?
A.	I do not remember this statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor ---
THE WITNESS:
I am not the one who wrote down my statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- please read out the portion of the statement to the witness, and then ask the question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The English version has "wardrobes."  "You were hiding in one of the wardrobes of the surgical wardrobes" - "wardrooms."  Sorry, "wardrooms."  Is that the one you are referring to? 
MR. SONGA:
Exactly, Your Honour.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	On the instructions of the Court, I am going to read:  "We were hiding in one of the changing rooms of the operating block.  They discovered us and shot at us.  Most people died.  I fell to the ground amongst the bodies.  When they came to verify, they thought that I was dead." 

Mr. Witness, do you remember this statement?
A.	I do not remember this statement.  I do not remember it.  But I know that there are no changing rooms in the surgery room.  I know that when one goes there, one goes there dressed.
Q.	Do you, at least, confirm that they thought that you were dead?
A.	Listen, if they had found me alive or if they had thought that I was alive, they might have killed me.  They would have killed me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, why don't you give straight answers?  

Yes, professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When you fell, was it because you were hit?
A.	I was not hit by a bullet, but since I noted that the assailants were not near me, I decided to lie down so that they would think that I was dead.
Q.	When you say that they were not close to you, what do you mean?  Were they not where you, yourself, were?
A.	They were there but, for example, here in this room, if somebody begins to shoot at people, you can do anything to fall to the ground and pretend to be dead, and that was the situation.
Q.	Who were those who came to verify?
A.	It was Mika, Kanyabungo, Alphonse and Muhimana.  There was also Gérard Ntakirutimana.  These are the people who came to verify that there were no survivors.
Q.	And we are still in the basement here?
A.	The questions that you are asking me are referring to what happened to the basement. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We are on the same wavelength.  

Mr. Witness, you state that if -- when you were in the room, you saw Mika Muhimana, Dr. Gérard Ntakirutimana, Kanyabungo and his two sons, Interahamwes whose identity you do not know, and it is the Kanyabungo and two Interahamwes who were carrying guns; is that correct?
A.	It is Mika and Gérard who were carrying firearms.  However, I did not check the weapons that the others who were with them were carrying. 
Q.	I am going to read your statement to you:  "When I was in the room" -- 
MR. SONGA:
I am referring here to the statement of 11th November 1999, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	"When I was in the room, I saw Mika Muhimana, conseiller of Gishyita, Dr. Gérard Ntakirutimana, Kanyabungo and his two sons; one of them was a soldier and the other had been trained by the Interahamwe, both were carrying firearms.  I also saw two Interahamwe whose identity I do not know who were bearing firearms."  At no point in time do you state here that Mika was carrying a firearm.  

Now, we would like to know the truth.  Who was bearing firearms?
A.	Do not focus too much on this statement.  Listen, it is not I who wrote down this statement.  The interpreter might have written just anything.  I did not know this interpreter.  I do not know whether he wrote down the statement as I made it, but if I tell you that those who were bearing firearms were Gérard and Mika, then that is true.  The others were carrying other firearms; I could not identify them.  If it is I who had written down the statement, and if I knew how to read and write --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, just answer the question.
THE WITNESS:
-- I would have been able to answer your question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Answer the question you know.
THE WITNESS:
I know that it is the two persons whom I have named who were bearing firearms.  As for the others, I do not know.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When you saw Mika Muhimana, how was he dressed?
A.	He was wearing clothes of a whitish colour.  I did not really pay attention to verify the colour of his clothes because I was in a difficult situation.  I could not pay attention to the colour of the clothes that people were wearing.
Q.	You are right, Mr. Witness, and that is why I was not referring to colours, rather, I was referring to the clothes that Mika Muhimana was wearing.  What clothes was he wearing?
A.	There I think that you are trying to complicate my situation.  Listen, I was in a difficult situation, Counsel.  I could not pay attention to determine how these people's clothes were.  What is more, when one is in a situation where one is in hiding, one does not have the time to verify the clothes of any person.  So I think that this is not a question that I can answer.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I present to you your statement of the 18th of September 2000. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am referring to the statement which was given to us a while ago, between the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	On the first page, the paragraphs are not clearly determined, but we might say, on the third paragraph, if one were to count from below upwards, Mr. Witness, you state this:  "I remember that Mika was armed with a gun and was wearing a long jacket.  I saw him shoot at us." 

You were at least able to notice the long jacket.
A.	Yes, he was wearing a long jacket, but I do not remember any other clothes that he was wearing.
Q.	May we ask you whether you remember if he was wearing trousers?
A.	It is possible that he was wearing trousers.  I do not know whether he was wearing shorts.  I did not verify, so I cannot be sure.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state that in the room opposite there were three women.  Is this room opposite the operating block?
A.	Those were two doors, one of which was next to the other; it was not opposite.
Q.	And there three women were hiding. 
A.	One cannot hide if one is in a room.  One can hide only in a bush, and there were no bushes in this room.
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement you say, "In the opposite room, there were three women who were hiding."  Do you confirm this statement?
A.	I do not confirm it because I do not see how anybody can hide in a house.  I know that people hide in the bush; people do not hide in houses.
Q.	And you in the hospital, were you hiding in a bush?
A.	I was not hiding in a bush, I was in a house, because if I were in a bush, I would have got out and I would not have seen them.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What was Johaneta doing at that place?
A.	She had taken refuge, just like other persons who had found refuge at this place and who were targeted by the massacres.
Q.	Is that the same response you would give in regard to Theresa Mukabutera and Eugenia?
A.	It is the same answer.
Q.	Was it only the three women who were at this place?
A.	In this building, there were many more people, but in this room there were only these three young women.
Q.	With these three young women, would we consider that the room was full?
A.	Full of people?  I did not understand the question. 
Q.	Full of people, I meant.
A.	No, it was not full.  Other rooms were full, but in that one, I wouldn't say of it that it was full.
Q.	Were there other rooms that were not full?
A.	I did not check in the other rooms, but I would say that all the rooms were occupied; there were people.  I might have checked, if I felt safe.
Q.	What was Johaneta's family name?
A.	I only knew her first name.
Q.	What was your relationship?
A.	There was no relationship between us; she was my neighbour.
Q.	Did you live together with (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I shall not insist on names in regard to the need for witness protection.  And who was Eugenia?
A.	She was my neighbour.  Eugenie and Jeanot were my neighbours.
Q.	Did you know her family name?
A.	No, I did not know their family names.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that Mika asked Dr. Gérard Ntakirutimana, Kanyabungo, his two sons, and the two Interahamwe to choose two of the three girls who would be killed or raped; is that correct?
A.	The three girls were raped and afterwards killed.  However, they were not killed by those who raped them; they were killed by Interahamwe.
Q.	If you would be so kind as to answer my question.  Did Mika ask that two of the three be chosen to be killed or raped?  That is my question. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
Your Honour, may I intervene, Your Honour?  My learned colleague is misstating the question.  The question is not whether two of them should choose to be killed, Your Honour, the question is whether --

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Whether to be killed or to be raped. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that is the correct position, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It may be a translation problem, professor.  The choice was not which two were to be raped, it is whether they want to be raped or they want to be killed.  The choice was between death and rape.
MR. SONGA:
I will make my statement again in French.  The statement of 11 November states as follows:  "Mika asked them to choose the two of them who would be killed or raped."  That is the version that we have.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is very close to what is here, but it isn't to choose which ones of the two, it is to choose -- two of them to choose which of the acts was to be done to them.  It goes like this:  "Mika asked the three ladies to choose among the two to be killed or to be raped."  The interpretation there is open that it is to choose between death and rape.  The two of them, the two girls were to choose between --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, the two.  "The two" must mean the two girls were to choose; the other one wasn't asked to. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mika asked these ladies to choose between whether they should be killed or whether they should be raped.  The choice was theirs. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
To choose among two things.  "The two" which is there, must mean to choose between some two things, rape and death.
MR. SONGA:
I do understand you, Your Honours.  I think we can proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did those persons make a choice, Mr. Witness?
A.	If they had had to choose, they definitely would have chosen not to die.  So there was no choice.  I would rather say that their executioners used force and subsequently the girls died.
Q.	What dress was Johaneta wearing?
A.	I did not pay attention to know what clothing they were wearing, I just know that they were wearing clothes.
Q.	Mr. Witness, before this Court I think I retained (sic) that Alphonse raped Eugenie, Muhimana raped Mukabutera, and Mika raped Johaneta; is that correct?
A.	That was not what I stated.  I did not say that Mika violated Mukabutera, it is rather Muhimana who did that, and Mika took hold of Johaneta.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will go over this.  Did you say that Alphonse raped Eugenie, and that Muhimana raped Mukabutera, and that Mika raped Johaneta?  That is my question.  Do you confirm that?
A.	That is the statement I made.
Q.	So, you see that I did quite get that.  Now, my question, when I look at your statement of 18 September 2000, and this is what I will read:  "Mika was a part of those who entered the cave.  I saw him with another person that I couldn't identify.  I saw them enter the room that was adjoining the cave where there were other people, including (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal)." 
MR. SONGA:
I would like to stop here, Madam President, to find out if you have identified the passage in question.  I am talking about the declaration that he -- the statement that he made today, that is, the statement of 18 September 2000 that was filed today.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, can you give the English version to the Defence counsel to identify the portion which --
(Pages 22 to 39 by Judith Baverstock)




















1745H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
While reading the portion of the statement of this witness, from witness statement dated 
18 September 2002, the learned counsel mentioned the names of the sister of the witness.  That is protected information to be kept under seal.
MR. SONGA:
I would like to apologise, Madam President, and will try to be more careful.  

This is from the portion of the statement that I was reading.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
"I saw him with another person that I couldn't identify.  I saw them enter the room that is adjoining the cave to meet other persons, and I heard Mika ask her to undress, and she was pleading with him not to kill her.  After, Mika's companions also raped another girl, whose name was Eugenia, and I would say that it's Mika who killed them after their having raped them."  

I think we can stop here for now.  You will see, therefore, that insofar the person that has to do with the protected witnesses was concerned, they refer to Mika, whereas as in his statement of 
11 November 1999, as well as in the statement made today before this Court, the person who had been raped by Mika was Johaneta.  That is the discrepancy in the versions and which I would like to get an explanation of the witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
May I intervene?  That is not what the statement says.  All the statement says is that Mika asked this very lady to undress, and in the statement of November '99, it also says that Mika had asked all the three girls to undress.  It doesn't say it was Mika who raped this Theresa.  It doesn't say that at all, contrary to what learned counsel is alluding to now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think the learned Defence counsel is referring to the contradiction that it was Mika who killed them.
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour, he's saying that it was Mika who raped Theresa.  That's what he was asking.  That's the contradiction.  He's saying that in this statement Mika is said to have raped Theresa, while in the other statement it is shown that Mika raped Johaneta, and that is what the witness testified to in court also, so that is what the contradiction is that he's trying to point out, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you repeat your question?

MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  And yet things are clearly stated.  The young girl to whom Mika asked to undress -- it is also stated in the declaration, in the statement of 18th September that the person who -- the name of the person who was raped is clearly stated that she was raped by some other person other than Mika.  Now, we compare this version with the one that we have heard in the court, and we compare this version with the statement of 11 November 1999.  At least the first thing that we should establish is that it is not said that Johaneta was raped by Mika in that statement of 
18 September 2000.  I'm referring to the statement of 2002.  And that is why we are asking the question to the witness.  Did Mika undress that person simply to kill her, or he undressed her to rape her?  That is the question that we are asking the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I think that I do not have anything to add to what I have stated.  I have given you the name of Johaneta as being the person that was raped by Mika and I gave you the names of the girls who were raped by other persons.  You are giving the name Mukabutera because you are referring to the statement.  I don't know how I can explain this to you.  Otherwise I'm basing myself on my statement and I don't want to go back to that.  I do not quite see the reason wherefore we should go back to it.  I would like to maintain my statement because it is based on the facts that I can recall, and I have related those facts as I remember them.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Who killed those girls?
A.	When the Interahamwes went out, they entered and killed those young girls.  I don't know the names of those Interahamwes because I didn't have the names of all the assailants who were killing people.
Q.	Mr. Witness, please, let's stay within the same statement and at the same level. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, let us stick to the statement that I read out a while ago.  This is what is written: "I can say --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you, yourself, see the killers killing the three ladies? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw them, but I don't know their names.  I don't know the names of those assailants.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm talking about the killers who killed the three ladies.
THE WITNESS:
I do not know the names of the assailants.  I saw them kill those young ladies, but I don't know the names of the assailants.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I wanted to give you a reference in the declaration of 18 September 2002, and it is at the same level where we were a while ago, that's towards the end.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	There we read the following, Mr. Witness: "Mika's companion also raped another girl whose name was Eugenia, and I can say that it is Mika who killed them after their having been raped." 
MR. SONGA:
That is the passage that, to me, is in conflict with the statement of 11 November 1999, and also with the statement that has been made here before this Court, because in the statement of 11 November 1999, we read the following: "After having raped them, I heard them debate whether they should take the women along -- whether they should accompany the women to their homes, and Mika said that it would be very useful because that would betray them.  So they locked them in the room and a few moments later the Interahamwes came in and killed them.  I was able to see what was happening because the very large door was broken."  And today before this Court, it was clearly stated and repeated that it is Interahamwes who killed them.  

Now, we have just been served with another version, according to which the witness doesn't know the assailants.  The main thing, Mr. (sic) President, is that this should feature in the transcripts. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know the names of the assailants.  I know that they were Interahamwes.  If I tell you that I don't know them, it is because I don't know their names, but they were Interahamwes.  They are the ones who killed them.  If I knew their names, I definitely would have given them to you, but I do not know their names, and that is why I said that I did not know them, but I know that it is Interahamwes who killed them.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	That is why I would like to thank you, Mr. Witness.  At what time were they killed?
A.	I cannot give you the time.  I don't know the hour.  It was not during daytime.  It was after nightfall.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state, Mr. Witness, that at midnight you escaped, or you fled towards the Bisesero hills; is that correct?
A.	It's at that time that I left that place.  If I gave that hour, that was only an estimated time that I gave.  It was about around that hour that I left that place, that is at about midnight.
Q.	Which route did you take to go to the Bisesero hills, Mr. Witness?
A.	I went up through Murambi, Gitwe, where there was a road and I reached Bisesero.
Q.	Thank you.  On which hill of Bisesero did you find your hiding place?
A.	I was on the Muhira hill.  In fact, it's on that hill that we gathered.  It wasn't refuge as such.  We didn't have a choice as if it was a seaside.
Q.	The Muhira hill.  And when did you reach Murambi?
A.	I went through Murambi when I was going up again.  I also passed Gitwe.  In fact, those two locations come before Bisesero.
Q.	When did you reach your first Bisesero hideout?
A.	I was there in the month of May and I was accompanied by other persons.
Q.	Do you want to say that before the 16th and the month of May you were still on the way to Bisesero?
A.	Yes, it is in May that I found myself in Bisesero, but for the rest of the time I was still on my way to Bisesero.
Q.	Murambi; is that in Bisesero or not?
A.	We first of all passed through Murambi before reaching Bisesero.  It is through Murambi that I passed through when going up to Bisesero.
Q.	On what date did you reach Murambi?
A.	I am not in a position to recall the dates, but I do remember the month.
Q.	On the 1st May, were you already in Bisesero?
A.	I arrived at Bisesero in the month of May and I don't know the date.  I do not recall the date.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You talk about the 13th and 14th of May.  I would like to know, is it the 13th and 14th, or the 13th or the 14th of May?
A.	I have mentioned the 13th and the 14th.  The 13th was a Friday and the 14th a Saturday.  Those are the two dates that I recall.
Q.	And on the 13th, on which hill of Bisesero were you?
A.	I was at Muhira.
Q.	You say that on that 13th there was an attack.  At what time did that happen?
A.	Well, there wasn't only one attack.  There were several attacks, and the assailants came at about 
8 a.m., and I'm only making an estimate here.  I wasn't wearing a watch, so I can only estimate the time.
Q.	When did the attacks end?
A.	I saw the vehicles start going back, going down, the buses and other vehicles, and it was about 2 p.m.  Otherwise the Interahamwes remained on the spot until later, until about 6 p.m.
Q.	The Interahamwes, did they bear any distinctive signs?
A.	I heard people call them Interahamwes.  They were all the same people.  I cannot distinguish them from other people.  Rather, they are human beings.  There were other persons that were the targets of their attacks.
Q.	You state, Mr. Witness, that soldiers who had firearms arrived in big buses, whereas the Interahamwes came on foot.  Where was Muhimana during that time?
A.	He was also on the spot.
Q.	In the bus or was he on foot?
A.	He came on board a vehicle of the commune in the company of Sikubwabo and they had in that vehicle their Interahamwes.
Q.	Can we compare the attacks of the 14th to those of the 13th?  Did they take place under the same conditions?
A.	Yes, they took place under the same conditions.  They were very significant attacks and the assailants were in great numbers.  I could even say that all the vehicles of the country were there.  There were buses and other vehicles.  It's as if the entire Rwandan population had given themselves a rendezvous at Bisesero up until Saturday at 2 p.m.  Besides, the assailants who came from Cyangugu didn't go back to those homes.  They went back with Mika, who housed them, and they came back during the attacks and those attacks took place on the 13th and on the 14th.
Q.	Who were housed by Mika, I beg your pardon?
A.	I'm talking about those Interahamwes.  They spent the night at Mika's and very early in the morning they had already come back, and when we were on the hills we could see that there were very many people in his house.  The distances between that place and Mika's home wasn't very long.
Q.	Do you want to say that from Muhira you could see what was happening at Mika's house?
A.	Do you think that we went to his house to see what was happening there or what he was doing there?  We were in the hills.  We didn't go to his house to see what was happening there.
JUDGE SHORT:
The question was whether you could see Mika's house from the hill.  Answer that question.
THE WITNESS:
When we were on those hills, we could see Gishyita.  We could see where the shops were near Mika's house.  We could see that location.  The distance wasn't too far from where we were.  They came up towards us, and when we were on the hills we could see down below Mika's residence because it was below us.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What was the distance between the Muhira hill where you were and Mika's house?
A.	When he was going back, we would leave the hill.  Our secteur, where we had left our belongings, these communes were inhabited mostly by Tutsis and most of the Tutsis had been killed, so we used to go down the Muhira hill to go to the destroyed houses and we spent the night there.  So we left the ruins of our houses to go back to Muhira.
Q.	Please try to address my question, Mr. Witness, by telling us if, from the hills of Muhira, you could see what was happening in Mika's house in Gishyita?
A.	But if you are on a hill, you can't see what is happening in somebody's house.  You can see people leaving from that house, but you cannot know exactly what is happening there, except you are in that house.
Q.	When you talk about Interahamwes who were housed in Mika's home, shouldn't we understand that this was at night?
A.	We saw many vehicles that were parked in his house, whereas before we never used to see vehicles there, but during that period there were very many vehicles that were parked in his compound.
Q.	Now, do you want to answer my question, Mr. Witness, and tell me if it was at night?
A.	Are you asking me if the Interahamwes spent the night in his house, or what do you mean? 
Q.	When they were housed at Mika's home, what time was it?
A.	But you understand they can spend the night at his home and the next day they came back.
Q.	So from the Muhira hill during the night, you can see Mika's house and identify the people who were housed by Mika?
A.	I have told you that it is during the day that the vehicles were parked in his compound, and during the day we could see his house, and when the assailants were leaving at about 2 p.m., we could, you know, come out and see what was happening below.
Q.	Are we to retain that the vehicles were parked in Mika's house and that you were seeing them?
A.	Even when the vehicles were coming towards us, we saw them come.  They were coming up towards us.
Q.	From where were they coming?
A.	They were coming from his house.
Q.	Is it from there that you concluded that he was housing Interahamwes?
A.	Well, he's the one who used to come with those Interahamwes, and the vehicles used to come.  I mean, you will understand that they spent the night at his home because he used to come with them.
Q.	Thank you.  Were you alone in your hiding place on the 13th and on the 14th May?
A.	There were many people.  I wasn't alone.
Q.	Amongst the persons with whom you shared the hiding place, were there people who died or who were wounded?
A.	We were not hiding.  We found ourselves on a hill.  There was no bush even in which you could hide, so most of those people died.  Even a person who was wounded was finished off the next day by the assailants.
Q.	Amongst those with whom you shared your hiding place, are there any whose names you know?
A.	We didn't have any reason to know their names.  Since they had died, I know that they were people who were with me there.  Whether I gave you their names or not, I don't know how the names would help you since they are dead.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, please make an effort.  Don't ramble, ramble, ramble with answers.  Just say, "Yes, they were; they were not."  It enables us to move faster than giving us explanations that tie and tie and tie you up.
THE WITNESS:
I don't think I have any other explanation to give.  The people are dead.  I have nothing else to add.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When you were coming here, you knew, Witness.  Please answer the following question.  You state that after the attack of the 14th May, you hid on Runyangingo Hill in the forest belonging to 
Charles Sikubwabo, bourgmestre of Gishyita; is that correct?
A.	I had left Muhira, and those two hills are adjacent to one another.  I was actually on Runyangingo Hill, and that is very close to the other.  It is just like the two rows near me.
Q.	And the forest belonged to the bourgmestre of Gishyita?
A.	My statement was not properly taken down.  That forest did not belong to Sikubwabo.  It belonged instead to another bourgmestre who had been replaced by Sikubwabo.
Q.	What is his name? 
A.	(No answer)
Q.	Please can you tell us his name?
A.	I am not feeling very well.  Just give me a minute to think.  I made a mistake.  That forest belonged to that bourgmestre whose name you have just mentioned, but beyond that forest there was a forest owned by Mika.
Q.	Thank you for informing us about that.  Let us proceed as regards Mika's forest.  What was it like?
A.	It was a pine forest.
Q.	Please forgive me for my ignorance.  Can you describe this species of trees?
A.	I only know that tree by name.  I'm not in a position to describe it.  It is a tree just like any other tree that is planted.
Q.	Is it a tall tree?
A.	Yes.  These are very tall trees.
Q.	For instance, like the Eucalyptus tree?
A.	Those trees hadn't grown tall yet.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are too talkative.  You must have realised by now that your long and unnecessary answers have given birth to many questions.  Give short and brief answers.

Professor, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, how did you know that that forest belonged to Charles Sikubwabo?
A.	It is because they were the ones who owned forests there.
Q.	When you say "they", who are you referring to?
A.	I said "they" because they were the authorities, and they are the ones who own forests there.  Sikubwabo had his own forest.
Q.	And why wasn't it a forest belonging to Kayishema?
A.	If Kayishema had a forest there, I'm not aware of that.  The person I knew who had forest there was Sikubwabo.
Q.	Witness, from what I gathered during your examination-in-chief, you stated that Kabanda was flushed out of a millet farm.  Is the millet farm and the forest the same thing, or you're referring to two different fields?
A.	I am not referring to two different fields.  He was flushed out of a millet field and the millet field was just below the forest.
Q.	So you are referring to two separate plots?
A.	The trees were not intermingled with the millet, but the millet farm was very close to the forest.
Q.	Now, my question to you is whether Kabanda was flushed out of the forest or of the millet farm?
A.	It was very close to where I was hiding, very close to that millet farm.
Q.	Please, Witness, answer the question.  Was he flushed out of the forest or the millet farm?
A.	I stated a while ago that he was flushed out of where I was hiding, and I stated that the forest was below the millet farm.
Q.	You state that Kabanda was captured at a distance of five metres from where you were; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.  I was just giving an estimate because I didn't measure that distance.
Q.	Can you indicate the distance of five metres in this room, what it corresponds to?
A.	It is from here to the wall opposite me.  It could have been more than five metres, perhaps.
Q.	How did you know that he was captured by the Interahamwe?
A.	I knew because I saw them flush him out.  If I say it was Interahamwes, because I saw them killing people.  I heard people saying that they were the Interahamwe.  I did not know their names.
Q.	Were they wearing any particular clothes at that time?
A.	They were wearing clothes, but I cannot say whether they were any specific clothes.  Everyone wore clothes that resembled those of others.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you saw the Interahamwe, could they also have seen you?
A.	If they had seen me, they would have killed me, so they did not see me.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, you know that you are now entering the third hour of your cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you for allowing me to continue up to this point.  I will take your remark into account as I move towards the end of my cross-examination.  Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How come the Interahamwe could not see you from a distance of five metres?
A.	I was lucky.
Q.	Was there an obstacle between you and those Interahamwe?
A.	There was no obstruction or obstacle.  I was simply lucky.  The person who was discovered was killed, so I was lucky that I, myself, was not discovered.
Q.	My question to you is whether there was a landscape or shrubs or something that prevented Interahamwe from seeing you while at the same time enabling you to hide properly.  That is what I want to know.
A.	There was no bush.  There was only a millet farm.
Q.	So it was in the millet farm?
A.	I was in the millet farm.  If they had searched that farm, they would have seen me.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were you standing or lying down?
THE WITNESS:
I was sitting down. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you.  You state that the Interahamwe immediately cut off Kabanda's head and placed it on the main road where Mika and Muhimana (sic) were waiting; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	When you saw the Interahamwe cutting off that man's head, did you also see those people waiting on the road?
A.	I could see them.  That place was very close.  The sorghum field was very close to the road.
Q.	Witness, who cut Kabanda's head?
A.	I did not know them.  All I know is that they took the head to the road where Kayishema and Mika were.  These were men, but I could not identify those who did it.
Q.	In your statement --
MR. SONGA:
May I continue, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In your statement of 11th November 1999, Witness, this is what you state: "In June I saw Ruzindana, Sikubwabo and Mika on the Bisesero hills.  They asked the survivors to bring those who were wounded so that they could assist them.  We did not heed their orders because we knew they were going to play a trick on us.  A few days later I saw them return and kill people as usual." 

Before the Chamber, during examination-in-chief, you made remarks on that event stating that you discussed with Mika Muhimana; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is what happened on that day.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In the statement of 18 September 2002, this is what I see: "One day when we were not attacked, while we were resting in the forest in Rubugurizo in Bisesero, we saw a vehicle come and stop on the road.  Mika, Ruzindana, Mathias and Kagaba alighted from the vehicle and someone amongst us called Ezekia decided to go and see what brought them there."
MR. SONGA:
The reference, Madam President, is the last page of the statement of 18 September 2002.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	"We agreed that we should flee, and they killed him."  Are these statements referring to the same event?
A.	We are not referring to the same event.  The events did not occur exactly as you have described them.
Q.	Do you mean, Witness, that Mika came to meet you twice to propose his assistance to you?
A.	He came only once in the month of June.
Q.	Don't you think that those two statements refer to the same event?
A.	If we are dealing with the same events, you should bear in mind that when there is interpretation, the statements of the witness can be misrepresented, so I cannot tell a lie in my statements.
Q.	Do you prefer one of those statements?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Songa, he says that they are not the same and they are different occasions, so why are you asking him to choose one of the statements? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honour.  It is the opposite of that that I believe I heard.  He stated that it was the same event, although the statements are different.  He even stated precisely that Mika visited them and offered them assistance only once.
JUDGE SHORT:
You asked him whether Mika offered them assistance and he said, "No, it's only once."  You asked him whether it's on the same occasion, and he said no.  You may put the question again to him.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I will try to seek clarification.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Could you perhaps ask him which, if any, of the two statements is the correct one -- represents what happened?  Then he might tell you which one.
MR. SONGA:
That was the purpose of my question, Your Honour.  When I asked him which of the versions he preferred, that was the purpose of that question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, ask the question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, in your statement of 11th November of 1999, this is what you state:  "In June I saw Ruzindana, Sikubwabo and Mika on the Bisesero hills, and they asked the survivors to bring those who had been wounded so that they could assist them.  We did not heed their advice because they wanted to play a trick on us.  A few days later, I saw them return and kill people as usual," whereas in the statement of the 18th September 2002, we read what follows: "One day when we were not attacked, we were resting in Rubugurizo forest in Bisesero when we saw a vehicle come and stop on the road.  Mika, Ruzindana, Mathias and Kagaba alighted from the vehicle, and one of us called Ezekia decided to go and see what had brought them there."  

These are the two passages, and my question to you is whether those passages refer to the same event, and in answer to my question you stated that, "Mika only offered us assistance during a visit once."  That is why, Witness, I asked you, since the two versions are different, which is the version that is close to the truth?
A.	As far as I'm concerned, the correct version is the one in which Mika and Sikubwabo are mentioned.  As for the other statement, I would say that I don't even know the names you have just cited.  I know the statement in which the names of Mika and Sikubwabo are mentioned.
Q.	Thank you, Witness?
A.	Thank you, also, Counsel.
Q.	Do you know Ezekia?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Do you know Mathias?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The witness has stated that he does not know Ezekia.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Yes, I have understood that point.  Mathias?
A.	I know Mathias as an employee of Mugonero hospital, but I never saw him in Bisesero.
Q.	And Kagaba?
A.	He also worked at Mugonero, and he was a teacher at AC.  I don't know how come the statement -- in the statement they are mentioned, but I never saw them on the hills.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Witness.

Madam President, I have no further questions for this witness in cross-examination.  I thank you for your patience.  I thank the witness for his availability.  Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
MR. SONGA:
I will crave your indulgence here, Madam President.  We have some exhibits that we would like to tender.

Madam President, the transcript was entered, but there hasn't been any reference number assigned to it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have not entered transcript as an exhibit.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I think we have entered it.  You may wish to ascertain if that is the case, probably with the assistance of the registry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The transcript in Ntakirutimana has not been entered so far, so we will enter it.  It will be Exhibit D. 13, E for English and F for French, under seal.  No, it should not be taken as under seal. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. 13E and D. 13F admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And statement of 18th September 2002 is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 14, F for French and E for English, under seal.
(Exhibit Nos. D. 14F and D. 14E admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, that's all?
MR. SONGA:
We are done, Madam President, and once again, I would like to express my gratitude.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Any re-examination, Mr. Kapaya? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, three questions, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
 RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me take you back to Mugonero.  Following cross-examination, can you tell us who killed Johaneta, Theresa and Eugenia?
A.	I did not know the names of those who killed them, but I know that there were many Interahamwes, and they are the ones who killed them.  Mika and Kanyabungo and Kanyabungo's son, after they had left, the others came in and killed the girls.
Q.	In your statement of 18 September 2002, this is what you say, and I will read it over to you, that statement, and ask you to clarify what you mean by that.  Do you understand what I mean,
Mr. Witness?  

In that statement, you say, "I can say that it was Mika who killed them after they had been raped because I heard gunshots.  Mika had the gun when they got into the room."  Now, what is your explanation for that?
A.	I heard the gunshot.  The explanation that I can give is that on that day, Mika was carrying a gun and those people were killed on that day.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, there was a specific question by the Bench whether he had seen the killers, and he said yes, he had seen the killers.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, here, Your Honours, he appears to imply that it was perhaps the accused person who had done that, because that is the impression the Defence created in cross-examination, so I had to clarify that.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, let me take to you Muhira hill now.  Imagine you are on Muhira hill, right?  While standing at that hill, could you see Mika's house in Gishyita?  Answer yes or no.
A.	From that Muhira hill, you cannot see Mika's house.
Q.	So what did you mean in your statement when you said that you could see vehicles and Interahamwe at Gishyita town?  What do you mean by that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Not in the statement; in cross-examination.
MR. KAPAYA:
In cross-examination, yes.  I'm sorry. 
THE WITNESS:
We were on other hills below, because that region had many hills, so we were on another hill.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was the name of that hill?  Mr. Witness, what was the name of that hill?  You mentioned another hill.
THE WITNESS: 
Are you talking about the hill on which we were?  The hill on which we were, from where we could see Mika's house at Gishyita, is that the hill you are referring to? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
We were on the Nyarutovu hill, and from that hill you could see the Gishyita centre where the Accused used to live.  There are several hills in the Bisesero region, and from the hill that I have mentioned, you could see that centre.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Is there any hill between Nyarutovu hill and Gishyita centre where the Accused used to live?
A.	No, there wasn't any other hill that was higher than that one.
Q.	And what would you estimate the distance from Nyarutovu hill to Gishyita centre?
A.	On that hill, you could see the Gishyita centre.  If I make an estimate, I think we can cover the distance in 30 minutes, at least 30 minutes.
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you --
A.	Thirty minutes or less.
Q.	Do you know Rubugurizo forest?
A.	Yes, I know that hill, or that forest.  I know that forest.
MR. KAPAYA:
I see counsel has risen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the Prosecution has declared that he wasn't asking questions on the basis of the statement of 18 September 2002, but I'm seeing that all the further examination seems to dwell on that, and that is why I'm raising an objection, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you dwelt on the statement of 2002, and the re-examination is arising out of 
cross-examination.  

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, proceed.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell me now whether you know Rubugurizo forest?
A.	Yes, I know that wood.
Q.	What is the distance between Rubugurizo forest and Gitwa hill?
A.	Those two sites are close to one another.
Q.	When you saw Mika telling Tutsi to come down the hill, were you at Rubugurizo forest or were you at Gitwa hill?
A.	They stopped at Gitwa, and we were in the Rubugurizo forest or wood, and that wood is very close to Gitwa hill, and the distance can be covered in three minutes, so those two places are close to one another.
Q.	In your statement of September 2002, you describe an event which is slightly different from what you told us happened at Gitwa hill.  Now, were the events you describe in the statement of September 2000 the same as the event you have just narrated before this Tribunal today?  Are these two or separate events?
A.	I cannot recall what I said on that occasion, but I stated that I saw those people at Gitwa, and Gitwa is near the Rubugurizo wood.  I can't recall exactly what I stated, but I was in that Rubugurizo wood which was near Gitwa, and they came and stopped there at Gitwa, and the distance between the two places is very short.  The distance between the two places is short.
Q.	When you say in your statement of 2002 that you saw Kagaba, Mathias, Mika and others, is it the same day when you saw Mika, Ruzindana and Sikubwabo talking to refugees?  Are those two separate events? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, could you please repeat your question?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, I'll do that.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	In your testimony today, you testified that sometime in June, you saw Muhimana, Ruzindana and Sikubwabo at Gitwa hill talking to refugees.  In your September 2002 statement you say that you saw Muhimana, Kagaba and Ezekia, and actually it was Ezekia who came to talk to the refugees and relayed some information to people.  Now, my question is are these two separate events you are narrating, or they are one and the same thing instead of different?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, we are afraid this is a kind of leading question.  He did say that they are --

Mr. Kapaya, please, rephrase your question.  Can you repeat the question, once again, the question portion, not the events portion.
MR. KAPAYA:
All right, then.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you see Mika, Kagaba and Ezekia at Rubugurizo forest any time when you were hiding in Bisesero?
A.	Those are two distinct events.
Q.	Did you see Mika, Sikubwabo and Ruzindana at Gitwa hill?
A.	Yes, I saw them in the month of June.
Q.	Is the Rubugurizo and Gitwa events, are they one or are they two separate events?
A.	Those are two separate events, but which took place in -- on two locations that are close to one another.  The  Rubugurizo wood and the Muhira hill are close to one another -- that is the Gitwa hill, I beg your pardon.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours, that's all.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Court management, will you please give P.  2 to the witness and open page 175.  Draw his attention to page 175 and 176.  Have you got it?  Show me, show me.  Show me the page you are showing him.

Witness, have you seen those pictures, photo No. 7 and photo No. 8 and photo No. 9 and photo 
No. 10?  Have you seen them?
THE WITNESS:
I see images, but I can't understand them because I can neither read nor write, so I can't know what they stand for.  I see pictures there and I wouldn't be in a position to tell you exactly what they are all about.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It's not to do with reading or writing, there is nothing to read or nothing to write.  I ask you, can you see the photographs?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I see pictures.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do they represent the areas you showed the investigator, the ICTR investigator who came to see you? 
THE WITNESS:
That is possible, but the truth be told, I don't quite understand anything there.  I showed him wood, but I don't know.  I see pictures here, I just see photographs.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do they represent the Bisesero area you have given us evidence about? 
THE WITNESS:
If I knew how to read, probably I would have been in a position to tell you if it's the Bisesero region or not, but unfortunately, I cannot read.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you very much for having come to Arusha to testify before this Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness.
THE WITNESS:
I would also like to thank you.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This also brings us to the end of this week's session.  We resume hearing on Tuesday, 2 p.m.  
Before we adjourn, we wish everybody present here a happy Easter.  Thank you.
(Court adjourned at 1855H)
