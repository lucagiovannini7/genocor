MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

And before we proceed with the documents, could we have the appearances of the parties, please, beginning -- starting with the Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Good morning my colleagues at the opposite side 
of the Bar.  The Prosecution today is led by Mr. Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; and also comprises of Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant.  We also have three interns:  Jamet Marion, Godwin Manyiga and Catherine Gibson; and lastly, but not the least, myself, Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney.  
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence, please.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  On the Defence side this morning we have Nathalie Leblanc, legal assistant; Anja Kortenaar, Judith Khelifa and Charles Brozille as interns.  Mr. Nzabonimana is here also and myself, Philippe Larochelle.  And I note that Mr. Justin Habineza, a Defence investigator, is also with us this morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  The Trial Chamber would like to welcome you back to the proceedings.  

Before we adjourned last week, we did set aside this time for the production of documents by parties, if there are any.

Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
May I request registry please to come and assist.  

Madam President, Your Honours, we have prepared to hand in our documents that we used last week, and I have already given a copy of the same to my learned friend and I am requesting if he can give it back to me so that I can produce it.  As the Court pleases.  

From our discussions with the Defence, I did not get the hint from them that they were objecting to the use of these exhibits.  

The first document, My Lords -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, maybe the Defence can respond to each document as and when it is tendered, unless we are advised that there is no objection to the entire package.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I must say that with the third one we may have submissions.  The first two documents, we have no issues with their production, but the third one, we will object to its production.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Okay.  May I proceed to produce the first document?  This was referred to as tab 1.  This was the Gacaca record of Umurenge, Nyamagana .  We have made a justification dated 12th July 2010, and we have also included an unofficial translation of the same document and we have highlighted and marked on the documents the relevant portions for which we are producing them.  So may I request registry to mark the first document, tab 1, with relation to Witness T97 as the next Prosecution exhibit.  

Registry, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, kindly assist counsel.  

Defence Counsel, this is one of the documents you don't object to.  Is that the case?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Absolutely, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The Gacaca record as described by learned counsel for the Prosecution, its justification and unofficial translation as highlighted are tendered as one exhibit for the Prosecution and it is marked Prosecution exhibit --
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 62 -- P. 62.  Sorry.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 62.  
(Exhibit No. P. 62A admitted) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Gacaca record is in Kinyarwanda.  The unofficial translation is in English.  

MR. NG'ARUA:
Correct. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We might require a French translation so the exhibits as described is tendered as 62A and the 
French translation when made would be 62B.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  

Likewise, we request to produce tab number 2.  We have made justification for the production of the same dated today, 12th July 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, sorry to interrupt you, but when you say tab number 2, it does not describe sufficiently the exhibit you are tendering for the record.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  I will go into it, My Lords.  

Tab number 2 is the French statement of Witness T97 signed on the 18th November 2009 and that was used as tab 2 in the cross-examination of Defence Witness T97.  We have marked the relevant portions of that document, the statement of T97, and we have also included the official English translation and it is also marked.  This is one of the documents that the Defence has indicated they have no difficulty with and, therefore, request that it be marked as Prosecution Exhibit P. 63.  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, kindly assist.  

Defence Counsel, is that the case?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, we have no objection on that document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The French statement of Witness T97 signed on the 18th of November 2009 as marked together with the official translation in English are tendered as one exhibit for the Defence and are marked as Prosecution Exhibit 63.  
(Exhibit No. P. 63 admitted)
MR. NG'ARUA:
Now, the contentious document, I would ask the Trial Chamber to refer to tab 3.  This really was the trial transcript of T97 of 7th July 2010, page 18, 25 and 26.  
Now, we referred to this transcript exhaustively in the cross-examination of the Witness T97 and this is really a record of what he had said earlier and we put it to him to show contradictions and inconsistences that occurred subsequently on the 8th of July 2010.  We, therefore, do not see any foundation whatsoever to say that this document could be contentious in any way and that is the reason why we have requested that the marked portions of that document be marked as an exhibit.  

Now, I will wait and listen to what my learned friend objects to before I make my response, but 
my submission is that these documents are really the words of the witness and they would be useful 
to the court, especially for ease of reference because the transcript is already part of the trial record, 
but what this will do is to enable the trial -- the Trial Chamber in assessing the facts to very quickly and easily access the portions that have been put to him to show contradictions and inconsistences.  I, therefore, apply that this document be marked as P. 64.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel -- Defence Counsel, before you come in, we wanted to know which trial this was, 
Learned Counsel.  You just said T97 trial transcript, where?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Before this trial Court, in examination-in-chief.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, the transcript which you want to tender -- 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  The trial transcripts -- the exhibits that I wish to tender are three pages of the trial transcript of T97 before this Court during examination-in-chief that was put to him during cross-examination to point out certain contradictions.  And I hope that I have clarified that point, My Lords.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, Madam President, just as the Prosecution has pointed out, we see no useful purpose in putting into exhibit something which is already in the record.  These are the transcripts, the only transcripts of the witnesses.  So they are part of the record of this trial.  We see again -- we see no useful purpose in doubling the amount of paper of this case, which is, I think, voluminous enough as it stands now.  And if we start doubling the transcripts as exhibits as well as transcripts, I think we will just create superfluous materials which do not need to be.  I think exhibits should be material documents that come from other cases or other sources, not the transcripts of this case.  I don't think any -- the Prosecutor has cited any precedent in support of the proposition that transcripts -- portions of the transcript can be extracted and then filed into the record as exhibits as well.  So that is why we object to the production of those transcripts.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution Counsel, briefly, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Very, very, briefly, My Lords.  As we have said earlier, indeed, this is the transcript of the trial.  But, again, we are saying that for ease of reference only, and these are not voluminous and superfluous documents, as my learned friend would have us believe.  They are well-marked, highlighted and quite a few lines of the previous transcript, and as we may recall -- and I hope that my learned friend has also gone through the testimony of the witness in cross-examination and in examination-in-chief, it was very, very significant, the -- to point out the contradictions that arise from the small passages that we have highlighted and that is why and the only reason why we wish it to be part of -- to be put in as an exhibit for ease of reference.  Otherwise, we know that the Trial Chamber may refer to it from the main transcript, but we feel that for ease of reference, this is a better way of doing it and I, therefore, request that the Trial Chamber allows this to be put as an exhibit, particularly because there is a justification that points out to the exact nature of the document and why it is being put in.  So I think it will assist the Court.  It will assist all the parties, the Defence and the Prosecutor alike, rather than to cross reference to a huge material of transcripts that they are now pointed to a specific place in the transcripts.  I think it will assist us all, and it is for that reason that we request it to be admitted as an exhibit.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

These are the observations and the ruling of the Trial Chamber in respect of the request to admit transcripts of Witness T97 as an exhibit for the Prosecution.  

The Trial Chamber considers that this move is premature.  The proper stage for this is the submissions stage, and given that counsel wants to tender transcripts in this very case, we will sustain the objection because of the reasons we have given.  When the submission stage is arrived at and counsel has compiled all these documents, then he can draw the attention of the Chamber to the specific areas where their attention should be focussed with regard to alleged contradictions.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

Registry, can we have the witness brought in court, please. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If I may briefly -- I see that -- I think earlier by mistake I left the document which should have been distributed.  

Yes, I see that the registry has taken hold of these documents.  I am sorry.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, we saw the witness carrying a certain folder or file.  Could you remove it from the witness and keep it until he has finished his testimony.  And arrange to administer the oath after that.  
Thank you.  
(Declaration made by Witness T117 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we notice that you are carrying a file and we would like to explain that as a factual witness you are not allowed to consult any materials, so we -- that is why we have asked that the file be removed from you.  It will be returned to you.  So after you have completed your testimony -- so do not worry. 
Is that okay? 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Microphone.  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood, and I thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are happy that you are able to switch on and off your microphone and we would like to encourage you to continue doing so.  When you have -- you need to speak, switch it on, and when you are done, switch it off.  If you leave it open and another microphone is open as well, the proceedings would be interrupted as your testimony will not be heard fully, and the interpreters and 
the recorders will not be able to take it down or interpret it as it should be.  As well, the Accused and 
the Trial Chamber will not be able to follow exactly what you are saying.  So continue observing that very carefully.  

Are you going to testify in Kinyarwanda, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I intend to speak in Kinyarwanda.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, as you intend to speak in Kinyarwanda, we would like to advise you about a technical problem that exists here.  You need to pause and count one to three before you speak after hearing the question.  If you answer immediately without that pause, the result would be that the Accused and the Trial Chamber will not be able to hear your answer in full.  And it is very important that we hear and understand your evidence fully.  As well, the Accused, Nzabonimana, is following your testimony in Kinyarwanda, so he needs to hear it in full.  So turn on your microphone, count one to three quietly and then begin speaking into your microphone.  We will keep on reminding you about this as we go along.  

Now, with regard to the procedure, this is how we will proceed.  You have been called here to testify on behalf of the Defence.  They will, therefore, be the first team to put questions to you.  And the Defence team is seated on your left.  Are you able to identify the Defence team, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, when the Defence has finished putting questions to you, the Prosecution will, in turn, put questions to you.  And the Prosecution is seated on your right below the translation booths.  

The interpreters will be interpreting your testimony in two languages.  So be careful not to give long narrations as they are difficult to interpret and record.  So be directly -- be direct and brief as you answer questions put to you.  

The Judges will also ask you questions at any time during the proceedings, if they feel that there is a matter that needs clarification.  Answer all questions put to you by the parties and by the Judges.  This is what we will require of all witnesses and it equally applies to you.  So answer all questions briefly and directly.  This will facilitate interpretation, recording and understanding of your evidence.  

We also require you to observe courtesy to all the parties and officers present in this courtroom.  
As well, we require them to extend the same courtesy to you.  You must answer all questions unless the Trial Chamber rules that a question put to you is not proper.  And if it isn't, you will be informed, accordingly.  You are a protected witness and you will be giving your evidence in both open and 
closed sessions.  

In an open session, like this one where we are at the moment, the public is allowed to attend, listen and even acquire a copy of the record, if they so wish.  So when we are in such a session, be careful not to mention names of people or places that may identify you as you are a protected witness.  

The Trial Chamber may order that your evidence be taken in a closed session if it deems that giving it in open session may disclose identity.  This decision will be taken by the Trial Chamber and not by anybody else.  And you on your part, if you feel that the answer you are about to give may identify you, do not hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber to this fact.  

We consider that if you carefully follow these simple instructions or directives, your testimony will go on very smoothly and very quickly and you will quickly return home to continue with your business.  

Witness, we would like to know whether you have understood the instructions we have just given to you.  Are they clear?  And if you have not understood anything, do not hesitate to ask for clarification.  
THE WITNESS:
In the course of my testimony I believe I will be brought to mention places that are known and so I will raise topics which have been discussed on other occasions and other jurisdictions and, therefore, questions that have to do with my place of origin and that have to do with my testimony may eventually reveal my identity because I have already discussed these in other jurisdictions and there are other public documents which have to do with these testimonies which I have given in other places and before other tribunals or jurisdictions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Witness.  We just like to reassure you and to allay your fear.  We don't know the questions that counsels are going to put to you, but they know these questions, and we, on our part, would be listening very carefully.  The counsels are experienced; they know which questions to put to you in open session and which questions should not be put in open session.  So don't worry about this.  If they -- they will not deliberately disclose your identity.  Should they do it inadvertently, the Trial Chamber would be very alert to this issue and should it arise, it will deal with it accordingly.  

Is that understood, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
That is understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we would like to welcome you again.  Sit back and relax and wait for the questions and answer them directly and briefly.  Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President. 




WITNESS T117, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	(Microphone not activated)  
Q.	Before you, you have your personal identification sheet, and I would urge you to quietly peruse the information carried in that document and to eventually confirm that this information is accurate.  
A.	The information I have before me is accurate.  
Q.	Consequently, I would ask you to kindly append your signature at the foot of that document.  And also to add the date of today, which is, 12th July 2010.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Madam President, I would like to tender the document as an exhibit under seal obviously, because it contains the particulars of the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution Counsel?  
MR. MAWERE:
We have no objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet of this witness, T117, is tendered as an exhibit for the Defence, 
under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness and it is marked Exhibit D?
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 43.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 43.
(Exhibit No. D. 43 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Madam President, the first topics I will address with the witness are pertaining to his place of residence and his family.  Therefore, I would kindly request that we move into a closed session to give the witness full liberty to be able to answer the questions that I will be putting to him.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Members of the public, we regret that you have to leave at this moment, for the reasons given by 
learned counsel for the Defence to protect the witness, who is a protected witness.  We hope it will not take long.  
Registry, would you kindly arrange for a closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 11 to 19] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 10 by Sithembiso Moyo) 


































MR. MATEMANGA:
We are now in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are now in open session, so heed the warning we have given you at all times.  And if you have any difficulty, don't hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber.  

Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I now want to -- I am going to ask you some questions on the events which occurred close to your residence between 1991 and 1994.  Do you know a place called COFORWA? 
A.	Yes, I know that place.  
Q.	According to the evidence before this Court, there were Tutsi refugees at some point in time at this place.  Are you able to confirm that? 
A.	Yes, there were refugees at that place.  
Q.	Do you have a recollection of when these refugees arrived? 
A.	It is difficult for me to recollect the date because these refugees came to that place when they were fleeing from the Satinski commune and others were coming from Kibilira commune, but I have no clear recollection of the month during which they came to that place.  
Q.	Are you able to give the year? 
A.	This was in 1993.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, the communes are not properly recorded.  Could you assist with the spellings, please.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:  
Yes.  Just one second.  There was Kibilira, K-I-B-I-L-I-R-A.  Satinski, S-A-T-I-N-S-K-I. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And is Kibilira a commune or what is it, Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Kibilira is the name of a commune.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, according to the evidence brought before this Court, Mr. Nzabonimana is alleged to have incited the residents of your locality so they can attack the refugees of COFORWA.  Did that happen? 
A.	It's an outright lie.  Those refugees remained in that place and their security was assured.  They were never bothered until they were transferred to Kabgayi in 1994.  
Q.	Are you able to say with a little more clarity when they were transferred to Kabgayi? 
A.	In the middle of the month of April. 
Q.	Of which year? 
A.	1994.  
Q.	Do you personally -- did you personally know some of the refugees who were at that place? 
A.	I *********among the *************************************************************************
MR. LAROCHELLE:
These names are items 24, 39 and 45.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	What happened to these persons? 
A.	At the time that the other refugees went aboard the vehicle to be transferred to Kabgayi, Masumbuko did not go along with the others.  He was killed along the way before they got to Kabgayi.  Bizimana died of a sickness after 1994.  ************************************************************. 
(Pages 20 to 21 by Sithembiso Moyo)























1030H 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Still, according to the evidence before this Chamber, Mr. Nzabonimana allegedly organised military training for Interahamwes prior to 1994 in the residence of one Kambanda (sic) and one Straton Nzabonimana -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Straton Sibomana", sorry. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Number 74.  Édouard Kambanda, number 32.  

There is no M.  It's Kabanda, not Kambanda.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
Q.	Are you through with your answer, Witness?  

These persons that you are -- these persons, Sibomana and the second one which -- and Kabanda, did they have any known skills in military training or weapon handling?  

Your microphone, please, Witness.  
A.	These two persons were civilians, and they have no skills in military training and they've never had any military training.  
Q.	Still, according to the evidence that we heard in this Court, after the 6th of April 1994, a date that is described as being between April and May 1994, there were Kalashnikovs distributed in Mr. Sibomana's house to communal policemen; the distribution to the communal policemen took place at the communal office of your locality; and that these communal policemen allegedly trained people from Kibangu, taught them how to handle these weapons.  Did you hear about any such events?  
A.	All I know about the communal policemen is that during that period the ministry of the interior replaced the weapons that was being used by the policemen and gave them new weapons.  But regarding the alleged distribution of weapons which took place in the residence of Straton Sibomana, I must say that I was not a witness and I did not hear about it.  
Q.	The question was that there is evidence before this Court to the effect that it is Mr. Nzabonimana himself who distributed Kalashnikovs to the policemen of your locality, at the communal office of your locality.  Did that happen; yes or no?  That is, after the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	Callixte Nzabonimana was the minister of youth.  He was not the minister of -- he was not a minister of the interior.  He was therefore not involved in any possible distribution of weapons.  This allegation is false.  
Q.	What were the new weapons that were given to the communal policemen by the ministry of the interior?  
A.	Based on my professional experience -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness has mentioned his occupation.  
THE WITNESS:
-- I realised that these weapons were made in Russia, and these weapons had magazines that could contain only ten bullets, whereas the Kalashnikov had a magazine that could have -- that would -- could take about -- that could take 32 bullets.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you know the name of these weapons?  
A.	Unfortunately, I've forgotten the name of those weapons. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, sorry to interrupt you.  

Could we go into a short closed session?  The Trial Chamber would like to raise a small matter which may concern the identity of the witness.  

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave briefly to allow us to deal with an issue that may disclose the identity of the witness.  It will be for a short time.  

Registry.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 22 to 23 by Kirstin McLean)















MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are now in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Most obliged, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, do you recall the time -- the moment when the ministry of the interior gave these new weapons to the communal policemen in your locality?  
A.	I was not part of the central administration, so I was not interested in the dates of the distribution.  We only observed that the communal policemen were equipped with new weapons.  And if at the time I knew that at some point in time I was going to be answering such questions, I would have gotten the information relating to the date of the distribution.  

But I must say that this distribution took place following the signing of the Arusha agreement, because it was said that the police would be unified and that the administration will be the same for all policemen.  
Q.	Are you able to situate this event in relation to 6 April 1994?  Was it before or after that date?  
A.	It was before the 6th April 1994.  
Q.	Still, according to the evidence before this Chamber, prior to the 6th April 1994, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana allegedly distributed grenades at the communal office of your locality.  These grenades were distributed to Édouard Kabanda, who was instructed by Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana to distribute the grenades to the responsable de secteur of your commune.  Did you hear about any such event?  
A.	I never heard anyone talk about any such event.  And if Édouard Kabanda received those grenades, he must have carried them and we must have seen him carrying these grenades.  But during -- during the genocide, Édouard Kabanda was carrying a sword, and not grenades.  
Q.	Generally, were there distributions of weapons at the communal office of your locality prior to the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	No, there was no distribution of weapons at the communal office.  The only distribution that took place in my presence was the one organised by the prime minister, Kambanda.  And that distribution took place in June 1994.  
Q.	We will deal with that event later on.  

(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
Q.	Your microphone if you've completed your answer, my -- Witness.  

First of all, from your answer, you said between May and June.  The month you are looking for is between April and May.  That is the period I am referring to.  

And then, in relation to the question I put to you, the 3,000 persons I'm referring to, is -- according to the evidence before this Court, were not necessarily all MRND members but Hutus.  

So, my question is if -- close to your residence, in April or May, if there was a meeting where 3,000 Hutus were present, and Nzabonimana told them to kill all the Tutsis.  Did any such meeting take place?  
A.	(Microphone not activated) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Microphone, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm not aware of such a meeting.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Did you see or hear that Mr. Nzabonimana allegedly held a meeting at any time, during which meeting he incited -- he incited those who were present to kill the Tutsi?  Did you hear of any such event?  
A.	I still confirm that Nzabonimana did not hold any meeting during which he allegedly incited the participants to kill the Tutsi or to racial hatred.  
Q.	Now, I'm going to ask you questions on the Ndiza battalion.  Do you know that battalion?  Yes or no?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I believe we should discuss this issue in a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we need to know why you think so.  Without revealing your identity, you can explain to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
That, if I may, Madam President, it is difficult for him to explain why we need to move into a closed session without revealing elements of information that may reveal his identity.  And this is why I want to ask him simply to say whether he knew the battalion Ndiza, yes or no.  And I think we will -- I will request that we move into a closed session immediately after the break, because the answer to the questions that will follow up are certain to -- to lead to the identification of that witness.  

So -- but, for -- for now, if he can simply state whether or not he knew the battalion Ndiza, will not lead to any information that may reveal his identity.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
THE WITNESS:
My answer is yes.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you know the date on which it was formed, established?  
A.	It was towards the end of May 1994.  
Q.	My last question before the break, and before we go into closed session:  According to the evidence before this Court, in the days preceding the establishment of the Ndiza battalion, there was a contingent of French soldiers, more specifically 60 French troops, who came to your locality, spent a number of days in your house -- sorry, not in your house -- in your locality before battalion -- the Ndiza battalion was established.  Did you see French troops in May 1994 in your locality?  
A.	That is a lie.  French troops never came to our locality.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
With your leave, Madam President, I think this would be an appropriate time to break.  And may I request the Trial Chamber that we move into a closed session when we resume, because as we -- as we ask further questions on the battalion Ndiza, the -- the identification of the witness needs to be protected.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Witness, we are taking the morning break shortly.  You are still testifying, so don't discuss your evidence with anyone.  Don't move until the curtains have been drawn and you are told it is safe to move from your witness box.  

The proceedings are adjourned to 11:30 this morning.  
(Court recessed from 1059H to 1131H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, once again.  

Registry, can we move into a closed session for the reasons given by learned counsel before the break.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 28 to 64] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
