(Court resumed at 1454H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  We are sorry again we are late.  We were tying up loose ends in this case.  

Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Before the next witness arrives, I wanted to mention the tendering of the exhibits which I submitted to the witness during the previous cross-examination.  Does the Trial Chamber desire that -- well, I know you asked us to -- particularly regarding previous statements of witnesses, to produce them with a summary, but are we to do the same thing when we are dealing with exhibits which were put to the witness in court?  And if that is not the case, then I would be requesting that these documents be tendered in as exhibits right now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The only difference, Counsel, would be the transcripts.  You would need to -- formerly we used to highlight, but these days we underline because the highlight might fade with time.  You would need to underline all the -- or, mark clearly those portions.  You just can't tender in the entire transcripts without guiding the Trial Chamber as to where to focus.  So you need to be ready with that before we can admit those exhibits, Counsel.  

With regard to the others, the procedure we outlined previously applies.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well.  In that case I would like that we examine -- or, rather, not examine, that we run through the documents which I presented to the witness, that we count them.  

Madam Registry, I believe the documents are in front of her.  Yes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, if you could separate transcripts from the other documents, that would be helpful.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
There are no transcripts for now, just these documents.  I did not include the transcripts.  I understood what you meant about the transcripts, but what I did not quite understand is what you meant regarding the documents.  

The first document is the report of the 20th of August 2001, Witness CNAA, to the authorities in Rwanda.  And that is the first document which I mentioned.  Then there's the letter of the 
6th of August -- 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry to interrupt you, but we need to deal with the documents one by one and see whether -- 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
D'accord. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, how many documents are there?  And, Counsel, is this document -- are all these documents clearly underlined to show what the -- you are -- first of all, you want to tender them to show discrepancies, but not for their content; is that so, Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I did not hear the interpreter.  Could the interpreter please repeat?  I did not hear the end of your sentence, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we want to understand whether you want to tender these documents for purposes of demonstrating alleged discrepancies.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
They are different issues.  There are some documents which I put to the witness, particularly documents which he himself wrote, and there are also documents from the Gacaca court sessions which he read and recognised.  There are the interviews, radio announcements.  So we have documents of different types.  But the documents are always intended to underscore contradictions.  
(Pages 44 to 45 by Kirstin McLean)


















1500H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, that's what we needed to be cleared.  So we are not admitting the documents -- their content as evidence, but to demonstrate contradictions.  So -- 

Learned Counsel, it is our recollection that we -- we -- there are some prior documents, which you have not tendered, and we required your team to underline and accompany those documents with a note guiding the Trial Chamber as to where exactly to focus.  That has not been done and we would require the same procedure with regard to these documents.  

The Trial Chamber has to deal with a lot of documents, and if the counsel don't properly guide the Chamber it -- it might be difficult for us to dig up these documents and relate them to particular events in the future.  

Counsel, if you could do that that would be very helpful.  And you can just tell us when you are ready and we can always admit these documents. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I really want to assist the Trial Chamber.  That is why I am here.  There are some documents which were signed already by the witness.  So they have to be entered into evidence.  He recognised those documents as coming from him.  This is evidence that he recognised.  He signed these documents.  So I want to underline important passages, but he already recognised these documents.  

I have understood the concern of the Trial Chamber.  I understand that you have a lot of work, many court sessions and we have to facilitate your work as well.  The difficulty regarding these documents is that for the time being the Defence has not yet entered any documents yet into evidence, even though we have seen a multitude of documents during these court sessions.  

When we are dealing with previous statements of witnesses there's no major difficulty because these are documents that come from the Office of the Prosecutor.  But when we are dealing with documents which were signed by the witness or Rwandan judicial documents, some of which do not have translations, or are translated as we go on because the witness has read them, I believe they should be entered into evidence.  

Of course, we will try to explain to the Trial Chamber what is important in this document for us as far as we are concerned.  But I do not really understand, honestly, the fact that -- I do not understand that we are required to postpone entering into evidence of documents or letters which the witness has already signed.  

My assistant is not here with me.  I have to review everything myself.  And as a result we are getting to the end of the Prosecution case and the Defence has not -- has been able to tender only 
one document.  Now as for the documents we have here, as well as the radio announcements and the rest, I do not quite understand why I am being required to underline and summarise before I can tender them into evidence.  That is something I really do not understand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, the Trial Chamber understands that you have a lot of documents which you have not tendered, precisely because you have not been ready to tender them in evidence.  

The Trial Chamber has said, and underscores, that it is not forbidding you from entering these documents in evidence.  However, the Trial Chamber doesn't want to do the work which should be done by your team.  Your team has to prepare these documents and present them to the Chamber in a form which makes the Chamber -- the Chamber's work easy.  So -- and, in any case, the Trial Chamber notes that the Prosecution case will not be over until the 29th of March, and then shortly thereafter.  

And before we proceed with the Defence case, we can set aside time to receive these exhibits before we proceed to the Defence case.  

So really the ball is in your Court, Counsel.  So for you to say that because the witness has recognised these documents and he's signed them, therefore, the Chamber should admit them, is to miss the point which we are making.  You are tendering these documents.  Not because of their entire content, but because of what you perceive to be discrepancies.

So you need to guide the Trial Chamber to these discrepancies by properly underlining these documents and accompanying them with an explanatory note.  That is the standard procedure in all these Chambers.  

So counsel you just need to be organised and then let us know when you are ready.  That is all. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I will do as the Court has decided.  But I have some experience in this Court.  I have already worked on a case where the Accused was acquitted.  And I have worked on all court transcripts in this Tribunal.  I do not know cases where you had to prepare notes.  We read all notes in the Karemera case a while ago.  The documents were put to the witness and he was the one who had written the documents and then the documents were tendered into evidence.  

But if that is the decision of the Court, then I will follow the decision of the Trial Chamber.  But the 
Trial Chamber should not criticise me by saying that this is the rule before this Tribunal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, Counsel, that is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  Each Trial Chamber has its own methods and that is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.

Now the registry has a report to make to the Trial Chamber.  Registry?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Thank you, Madam President.

Yesterday the Trial Chamber asked the registry to update the list of Defence exhibits and we would like to do that now, Madam President.  

During the testimony of witness of Straton Sibomana in Kigali, the Defence presented or produced a number of documents as exhibits.  And the Trial Chamber admitted those documents.  

So now I shall give a number to those two Defence exhibits.  The first exhibit is the personal identification sheet of Witness Straton Sibomana.  That exhibit would be D. 3, Defence Exhibit D. 3.
(Exhibit No. D. 3 admitted) 
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
And the second document is the technical support contract at CORFORWA presented by 
Witness Straton Sibomana.  And this is going to be Defence Exhibit D.  4, Madam President.  
(Exhibit No. D. 4 admitted)
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
Those were the comments that the registry wanted to make.

I said the technical support contract in CORFORWA presented by Witness Straton Sibomana would be Defence Exhibit D. 4.  And those are the only remarks that the registry made regarding the exhibit, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  

Were there any exhibits for the Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, My Lords.  There is the transcript of 18th July 2007.  We have selected the exact portions of the transcript that we want --  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Counsel.  Sorry to interrupt you. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are still addressing the exhibits in Kigali.
MR. NG'ARUA:
No.  From the Prosecutor no, sorry.  I -- 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Madam President, the Prosecutor adduced three documents in Kigali and those documents were already exhibited in Kigali.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Has the Prosecutor given summary of the documents that it offered in Kigali for us to see whether those documents were relevant?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, this was a video recording.  And we took a lot of time.  Unfortunately, my learned friend was not there.  But we took a lot of time to lay the background of it and produced it.  The Defence objected and eventually we agreed and the documents were handed in without problem. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Judge Rajohnson.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON:
Counsel, I'd like to point out that the Prosecution hasn't tendered exhibits that are seeking to demonstrate inconsistencies.  

Secondly, in his submissions and cross-examination the Prosecution immediately tendered the important exhibits depending on the context.  In other words, there was no delay in its tendering exhibits.  So therefore it wasn't necessary for Prosecution to explain the relevance of these exhibits since they were done in real time.  

By contrast, if I have to express my opinion, in so far as you are concerned here, there have been serious delays between the explanations that you have given; for instance, you sought to tender exhibits that show inconsistencies between the statement made before the Tribunal and subsequent statements.  So in so far as I'm concerned, this is a concern that we think warrant explanations as to the documents that are being tendered for admission into evidence as exhibits. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Judge Rajohnson, for that observation.

Prosecution, you had a matter to raise. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  During the re-examination of the witness we mentioned, and went through the transcript of ********************************.  We have underlined the relevant portions and we have selected the relevant pages, which are page 14, page 15, line 6 to 12, and page 17, line 8 to 19.

The purpose of handing in this transcript is to show the context in which the witness mentioned the Musambira incident to the Trial Chamber.  We shall also be filing before close of business today an explanatory note to the Chamber describing exactly why we are handing in this document.  And it is to show the context in which the Musambira incident was -- came out from the -- from the witness.  

My Lords, I would therefore be moving to the Court to enter this as an exhibit and also followed by an explanatory note, which will be filed within the next few minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  Why don't you file them together?  So that we admit both as -- 
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It is more convenient that way so that we give the exhibit one number. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But we have noted your submissions, Counsel.

Now, before the next witness comes in we have -- 

Sorry, before the witness comes in, we are left with two hours -- less than two hours this evening and tomorrow up to 12 noon.  So before we embark on the testimony of this witness, we want an undertaking from the parties that they will be done with this witness by that time tomorrow.

We'll start with the Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, if all goes well, we will lead this witness for one hour, not more than one hour.  But we pray that -- that is the kind of estimate that we have.  So if he exceeds, we hope that the Chamber will understand.  But our approximate time is about one hour.  It could be a bit less. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I can't make such a commitment, Madam President.  I will try, of course, since all of us will want to finish tomorrow by midday.  I will try my best. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is sufficient for us as the Chamber, that the parties are committed as they can to finish the witness.

Can we have the next witness in court, after the curtains have been drawn.  Registry?  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good evening, Witness.  Good afternoon. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry.  Could you kindly administer the oath to the witness?  
(Declaration made by Witness CNAC in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  We welcome you to this Tribunal and we would like to give you some pieces of information regarding the procedures obtaining here and also to make your stay here and your testimony comfortable and quick.  

The first thing to recall -- to remember, Witness, is to switch off your microphone when you have finished speaking.  And switch it on when you are going to speak.  If you leave your microphone on and there is another microphone open, it interrupts with the translation, the smooth translation and transcribing of your testimony.  So kindly switch off your microphone now.

The Prosecution, which is seated on your right hand, will lead your evidence in chief, asking you questions to get your evidence on the events.  When the Prosecution has finished asking you questions, the Defence will in turn ask you questions on the evidence you have given and on other relevant matters.  The Trial Chamber will in turn ask questions as we go along, or at the end, depending on the circumstances.  We require you to answer all questions put to you by either party and by the Chamber.  We also require you to observe courtesy in the courtroom.  And also answer questions briefly and to the point.  If you have not understood a question, ask for it to be repeated or clarified.  And if you have any problem, do not hesitate to bring it to the attention of the Chamber.
If a question put to you is not proper, the Trial Chamber will say so.  And in that case you will not be required to answer that question.  But if the Trial Chamber does not say so, then you have to answer the question the best way you can.

Witness, we have two sessions in this Tribunal.  We have the open session and a closed session.  A closed (sic) session is attended by the public.  So when we are in open session, like we are now, we require you to be cautious and not to disclose any information that might lead to your being identified.

The public is excluded from what we call closed sessions.  And when we are in such session, feel free to give any information, even if it may identify you.  

Witness, we hope that if you follow these simple instructions or directives, we'll quickly finish your testimony and you can go home.  

That is all the Trial Chamber wanted to bring to your attention. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  

We have presented Witness CNAC with his personal identification sheet.  And we'd like to know whether he is satisfied with the veracity of the information contained therein. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is he able by himself to go through it?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, I know that he has a good level of education. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that so, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Indeed, Madam President, I have read the information in the personal information sheet and all the information therein is correct. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you.

May this PIS be admitted as the next Prosecution exhibit, under seal?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, number?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 21. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  The personal information sheet is entered as P. 21.
(Exhibit No. P. 21 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And, Prosecution, we are in open session, where would you like us to begin?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I would like us to begin in the open session and then maybe try something in the closed session later.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are in open session.  Be careful not to mention -- give information that may lead to your identification. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you.  I think we have a list -- a spelling list of proper nouns, which has been distributed to all the parties.  I believe all the parties have one, and if not I have a few extra copies.  Yes, maybe to the Bench, yes.
WITNESS CNAC,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, we are in open session, and I'd request you to adhere to what the Judge, President, has said.  

Now, Witness, I want you to tell the Court whether before 1994 you knew Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Before 1994 I knew Minister Callixte Nzabonimana very well. 
Q.	Now can you briefly, without disclosing your identity, demonstrate to the Court how you knew him very well? 
A.	I knew him well because we hail from the same province.  Furthermore, ***************************** **********.  I'd also like to add that once I went to see him to ask ***************************************** *********************************************************************************************.  Moreover, when he came to visit his family, I would see him.  I would meet him.  In summary, these were the circumstances under which I knew Minister Callixte before 1994. 
Q.	And how many years had you known him before 1994, approximately? 
A.	Not less than five years. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, tell the Court how was Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana regarded by the community, especially from around 1993 to July 1994.  
A.	From July 1993 the population considered Callixte an important personality who was well appreciated.  From the time he became minister he helped the region in development matters and he also assisted all the people who hailed from that locality without any distinction whatsoever.  He was someone who was well respected. 
Q.	And tell the Court, did he have, or hold, any other office, other than that of minister, from around 1993, July, to July 1994? 
A.	Despite his duties as minister, he had another position at préfecture level; namely, he was the chairperson of the MRND party, the party of President Habyarimana. 
Q.	Tell the Court, what power, if any, did this position entail?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, which position are you addressing?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
The latter position as president of MRND in the préfecture.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
The fact that he was the chairperson of the party at préfecture level required lots of responsibility as far as he was concerned.  From the advent of multiparty politics, préfectoral authorities had to work in accordance with the -- or they had to work with the other parties that formed the government.  So every time a project came up, he could agree with the project or refuse to cooperate with the project.  Because of his position he could block a project or approve it. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Thank you.  As president of MRND in Gitarama, what kind of people did he lead? 
A.	Members of the party who hailed from Gitarama préfecture.  There were organs of that party at préfecture level and right down to the cellule level.  Therefore, he was the hierarchial superior of all these party leaders.  And he was the one who supervised any campaigns being carried out by that party.  Within that party, there was a youth wing -- a youth wing which he created, over which he had effective authority.  So anything that the youth wing did arose from instructions that were given from the officials of the party at préfectoral level. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, I think there is a small problem with translation.  The witness mentioned Interahamwe, but in the CaseView that noun does not appear.  Maybe we could ask whether he mentioned the name of the youth wing.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Do you understand, Witness? 
A.	The youth wing of the MRND was called the Interahamwe.  And I, indeed, mentioned the name of that youth wing in question. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, between 1993 -- July 1993 to July 1994, what was the power of the Interahamwe?  How were they regarded by the members of the population? 
A.	Since July 1993 right up to July 1994, the Interahamwes were considered as youths affiliated to that party.  But very often acts committed by that youth wing were acts of violence targeting members of other parties who were also influential in that region.  There were acts like the burning of flags of other political parties, violence against members of other political parties and we even saw meetings to which Interahamwes were invited from other parts of the country and they came and hung on to buses.  And all of this always ended with acts of violence.  That is how the youth wing, the Interahamwes, were considered by the people in the locality where I lived. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, after the death of the president on 6th April 1994, did you see Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I saw him, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Can you give the circumstances under which you saw him, Witness? 
A.	I met him on two occasions.  The first time was during a meeting in Murambi in the Gitarama préfecture.  The second time was during a meeting and we met in Musambira.  Musambira is also in the 
	Gitarama préfecture.  At that time, after the death of the president, I saw another Callixte, a changed Callixte.  At the time killings and massacres were being perpetrated in our region and these massacres were being perpetrated by the youth wing, the Interahamwes, which he led.  And when he was asked to stop the acts being committed by those Interahamwes, he would threaten us and he would tell us that anyone who did not support him would suffer the consequences.  

In the Gitarama meeting, and the Musambira meeting, we tried to make him understand that those people were engaging themselves in criminal acts.  But he was not concerned by the problem.  As far as I was concerned, he was a changed person.  It was not the same Callixte that I had known before those events. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  You need to break your narration and have pauses in between, because your evidence is being interpreted in three languages as well as being transcribed.  And we also need to take notes.  So don't make long narrations.  Pause and wait for questions from counsel for the Prosecution.  
Thank you.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President.

He has mentioned two nouns.  The first one is Murambi.  It's number 4 on our list.  And the second one is Musambira, which is not on the list, and it is M-U-S-A-M-B-I-R-A, Musambira.  

Madam President, I think at this point I would like to go into closed session, because I do not think it is possible for this witness to discuss the matters that I want him to discuss without revealing -- or his position becoming obvious.  

So may I request that we go into closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, can we go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 57 to 72] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
