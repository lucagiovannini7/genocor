MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is a status conference in the case, Prosecutor versus Mr. Ndindabahizi.  May I first ask the registrar to please, call the case 
MR. TOURE:
Thank you, Mr. President, status conference Judge -- status conference Judge Wolfgang Schomburg, solving a status conference, in the case, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi versus the Prosecutor, this day, Wednesday, 8th February 2006.  Case No. ICTR-O1-71-A.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Appearances, please. 
MR. KONITZ: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor.  I am not receiving the translation into my headset unfortunately. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could somebody please take care that Defence Counsel has a headset that works? 
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can follow now.  
MR. KONITZ: 
Yes, I can, Mr. President, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
May we have the appearances of the Office of the Prosecutor, please? 
MR. SEYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  For the Prosecution, we are George Mugwanya, Abdul Seye and our legal intern M -- 

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
     (Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
     Your Honour's microphone.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, so much.  May I ask Mr. Ndindabahizi, can you follow the proceedings in the language you understand? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:  
Yes, Mr. President, I am following the hearing in French, and my headset is working.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I hope those parties have received the agenda of today in the language those parties understand.  So, therefore, we can proceed immediately if there's no other obstacle.  Let us start, with a view to the time, immediately with point one.  Prosecution, are you prepared to answer the question included in point one?  
MR. SEYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Regarding this point, we are in a position to say that the Defence was aware of the full identity, including the name of the victim, at least one year before trial.  We are not in a position to say exactly when that identity was given to them -- the name, I mean.  But the fact is, they were able to conduct investigations and produce a statement from the daughter of that victim, which statement was taken on 4th October 2002.  And if I may add for the statement of Witness CVC, the last, this order was done on 4th April 2003 together with the other statements of the witness we intended to call at the time.  And that statement indicated, not the name but the description of the victim.  As -- if I may call it, as a Rwandan half-cast.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, when you are saying that the name of the daughter of that victim was disclosed to the Defence then I take it that also the real name was mentioned in this disclosure. 
MR. MAGWANYA: 
No, let me rephrase that, Your Honours, if you please.  What I meant is that the Defence was aware of the identity of the victim because as I indicated earlier, they interviewed the daughter of the victim about that very killing.  And that statement was taken on 4th October 2002, and this is, if I may add, the witness they called at trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  May I ask the Defence, is it correct that while the daughter of this victim we are discussing right now, you are well aware of the identity of this as it reads in the indictment, "Occupants of the vehicle." 
MR. KONITZ: 
No, Mr. President.  Thank you for letting me address this issue.  I see that in point No. 1, they said that the Prosecutor had to indicate in which document we can have the identity.  I did not have an answer on that point; which means to my knowledge, I was not there at the trial stage.  Perhaps I don't have an exhaustive knowledge of the case.  There's no document from the Prosecution before the opening of trial containing the identity.  

Second; the Defence did talk about the daughter, but when we contacted that witness, we were not at all sure that was the daughter of (by order of the court the name has been extracted and put under seal).  So if he wanted certainty, it came out during the Trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, may I ask please that the name be redacted from the transcript.  Please, all parties don't mention any names. 
MR. KONITZ:
Pardon me for that Mr. President.  May I proceed? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you.  So contrary, to what is indicated, the Defence never had any document from the Prosecution containing the identity of that person who was killed.  So the daughter did testify but that's something entirely different.  In the indictment, in paragraph 11, there's no identity of the victims.  I would like to know exactly in which document we can find the identity of the victim. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. Do you want to reply?  
MR. SEYE: 
Yes, Your Honour, just briefly.  I may have to repeat myself.  Our position is that what we meant by identity was -- in this particular case what was disclosed - sorry, was a description of that victim.  Indeed the indictment talked about a person in a vehicle but the statement of CVC disclosed in 
April 2003 described the victim as a Rwandan half-cast and indicates the name of the driver, not the name as such of the victims.  So, the description of the victim and the name of the driver.  And once again when the Defence interviewed the daughter of the victim, the very first question put was about the death of that man. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are far better familiar to this entirety of the trial record.  Could you please draw our attention, maybe not today if you don't have it before you, to this way -- first question because this would be of assistance for the Chamber, no doubt? 
MR. SEYE: 
Yes, they would be, Your Honour.  They could be found in the statement of that witness.  Well, since I call her the daughter of the victim, I wouldn't give a pseudonym now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, right, right. 
MR. SEYE: 
And that statement was taken on 4th October 2002. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
4th October.

MR. SEYE: 
2002, which is one year prior to trial.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, I think having described the person in this way, it will also be possible for the Defence to identify the name and it's for the Chamber finally to decide whether this is sufficient enough.  But I think we can't achieve more clarity today.  Thank you for contributions. 
MR. SEYE: 
May it please Your Honour, I can give you a copy of that statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that would be extremely helpful, yes. Thank you. 
MR. SEYE: 
They will be both in French and English, disclosed by the Defence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you also have a copy for the Defence, please, in all fairness?  
MR. SEYE: 
They will certainly have it. 
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

May I speak, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you.  Yes, one issue.  You are completely right.  It is up to the Chamber to decide if this is sufficient or enough.  In other words, the description.  But according to the appellants or the respondent's brief, the identity of the victim was revealed to the Defence well before trial.  It was not reviewed by the Prosecution.  If I understood your argument, we found the -- the only time we found the daughter of the victim, we don't identify them, but it was not the Prosecution that revealed the identity of the victims to us. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think this has to be decided later.  I think this suffices for today.  But let us now turn to point two of the agenda.  This brings us to the question of the discussion of the crime of extermination to be found in the trial judgement not only in paragraph 479 but also 480. 

Normally, the time is never running against the court.  However, today there are serious time constraints and so forth.  I don't think that it would be appropriate to discuss lengthy today the question of the definition of extermination in relation to the actus reus and mens rea.  And, therefore, my suggestion would be, if both parties could agree that I would grant leave to file submissions no later than the 1st of March on this issue.  I have to clarify already now that it might be that during or in the time between 1st of March and the hearing in this case, some other judgements may be handed down where extermination might be discussed.  I don't know for sure.  So, therefore, of course, it is always open to the parties later, to elaborate again on this question.  However, I am still under the impression that the definition of the crime of extermination should be discussed more in detail.  So may I ask the parties, are they in agreement that departing from the Rules of Procedure and Evidence to that end, that both parties present their submissions in writing on the definition of the crime of extermination, however, no later than the 1st of March 2006?  

May I have your consent, Prosecution? 
MR. SEYE:  
Your Honour, definitely, Your Honour.  We are all right with that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
MR. KONITZ: 
Yes, of course, Mr. President, it would now be reasonable to have that discussion now and it would be better that we exchange our views in writing.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Leaving for a second agenda; I want to clarify something about the date of the hearing.  There's a substantial likelihood that this case will be heard either in the first week of July or the second week of July, no later because then there's a Court recess and no earlier because there's a meeting of Security Council in New York and some Judges have to be present there.  So, is there any obstacle?  I think the Prosecutor is always ready to hear an appeal.  Is there an obstacle on the part of the Defence for these two weeks?  Please, MaÎtre Konitz.  
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  There are no obstacles.  I do have a preference but I will adapt.  I prefer the second week of July.  It will be easier for me, but of course, I will make myself available whatever the decision might be. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Then let's turn to point 3 of the agenda.  The question is directed to -- primarily to the Defence, although also to Prosecution.  Are there any motions on the admission of additional evidence pursuant to Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure and evidence to be extracted?  Defence please and may I, in this context, recall that the Defence already filed one -- Rule 115 motion and they apparently rely on four documents admitted under this rule purportedly signed in Kigali to argue that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi was not in Gitwe on 13th of April and 23rd of April 1994.  During trial another alibi was presented, presence in Gitarama.  My question would be, do we have to expect additional evidence in support of this second alibi, sometimes also called in a sloppy, way, blib B-L-I-B. 
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, you did, indeed, order the protection of four important documents that the Prosecution had in their possession which they used in a different trial to, in fact, demonstrate.  And on Saturdays and Sundays members of the government did work.  The problem, 
Mr. President, is that in paragraph 177 the Chamber took Judicial notice where it considered that on the 21st and 24th of April were week-ends.  Amongst the documents you ordered be produced, we had produced them on the 23rd of April.  The Accused was working, as there is a letter from him signed on that day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I interrupt you?  Thank you.  This is not a point in time to argue the case.  My only question is, you will want to present this whole evidence in support of this new alibi.  
MR. KONITZ: 
No, no, Mr. President, I could have simply answered no.  I just wanted to indicate that for me the documents that you ordered we produce are sufficient.  And 12 years later at any rate it could not be reasonable to look for more testimony.  So pardon me.  We will, under Rule 115, not request that other documents be produced.  Not on that point or any others.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it on purpose that you speak only about documents?  This brings me to point B of the same question because in paragraph 318 of the appellant brief it reads that:  "The Defence might request the 
Appeals Chamber that a Trial record of the testimony of a certain witness from Bizimungu et al, be produced and that this witness also testifies in the instant case.  Is it your intention to move for hearing this witness? 
MR. KONITZ: 
No, Mr. President.  In paragraph 92, to the response of the Prosecution, we indicate that according to the Defence, we, the appellant can refer to a different trial in the sense that it is not a protected witness.  We do not intend to ask that that witness be heard.  Yet in our authorities we do intend to use that from Bizimungu. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask both parties, this complete testimony is it already part of the Trial record?  Maitre Konitz?  
MR. KONITZ: 
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it so? 
MR. MAGWANYA: 
Not at all.
 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not at all. 

MR. MAGWANYA: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So how do you want to introduce something that is not yet on the trial record during appeal? 
MR. KONITZ: 
Mr. President, I thought that since it was not a protected witness we could look into the transcripts in another trial as it is public information, as it has already been heard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I hear the Prosecution in this please? 
MR. MAGWANYA: 
Well, with all due respect that is not actually possible.  It's not actually allowed under the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the jurisprudence.  Although the material was disclosed to the Defence, as long as it's not part of the record, it cannot really be allowed into evidence on appeal.  So the witness's material in Bizimungu et al, is not part of the Trial record.  It cannot be part of the appeals record, unless -- unless the Defence seeks to include it under Rule 115, without it it's not on the record, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Therefore, Maitre Konitz, I hereby give a deadline elapsing the 1st of March, if you so want, to introduce the testimony of this witness in this case, then please do so under Rule 115, however, no later than the 1st of March, 115, that we can prepare the hearing in a proper way because I think it's undisputed that you need to move under Rule 115.  Only if you so want, of course.  It's not an invitation to request but please read carefully not only Rule 115 but also the established jurisprudence of this Tribunal including the Kuch and Wood Test because the threshold is extremely high and it becomes higher the closer we come to the Appeals here.  You can agree with this?  And you accept that one, yeah? 
MR. KONITZ: 
Absolutely, Mr. President, the motion will filed, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course, it's finally for the Chamber in it's entirety to decide whether or not to grant this motion or not after having heard the Prosecution on this.  But the purpose of this pre-appeal conference is to find out what is before us, therefore, this deadline.  And I would kindly ask the Prosecution to answer within two weeks after the receipt of this motion if this motion is brought at all.  

One other question is directed to the Defence.  Do you have access to the entire trial record, and if so by which means, by means of the three CD-ROMs or in another way?  
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have had no difficulties because the previous Counsel for the Accused gave me everything in his possession and I was able to obtain further elements from the registry.  To this day I have not had any problems, if ever I do; of course, I shall inform the Appeals Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, but please do so as soon as possible because the easiest way would be to provide you with the three CD-ROMs and then you know what is -- what was admitted during trial and what not.  

May I now ask Mr. Ndindabahizi himself, what is the status of your health?  Do you have any complaints about your health or do you have any complaints about the conditions in the 
United Nations Detention Facilities?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Mr. President, up until now, I don't have any specific problems with the detention facilities.  Of course, 
I am ill.  I have diabetes but I am receiving treatment, and that is enough for now.  I have received the same medication since 2002.  It is the same medication but I am not an expert about these matters and so I don't know what more I can do.  I take the medication that is prescribed.  I am ill.  Sometimes I have high blood pressure but there again there are no problems.  There are doctors who are assigned to the detention facilities to treat us.  This is an illness that cannot be cured and I think that in some way they are related to the fact that I am detained.  That's all, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you, Mr. Ndindabahizi for this clarification.  May I ask the parties are there any other issues to be discussed today because this is the pre-appeal conference and we will not meet before the appellant's hearings?  

Prosecution, please. 
MR. MUGWANYA:  
Thank you, Your Honour.  Nothing specific really, apart from, of course, us meeting the deadlines you have prescribed for the filings, otherwise there's nothing else, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, if you have problems with the deadlines please tell us. 
MR. MAGWANYA: 
We don't have problems yet.  Well, in case we get -- we shall keep you informed, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

Defence please.
 
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  There are no problems.  We will a bide by the deadlines, 
the 1st of March 2006 and we will file all of our submissions before the 1st of March. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, so much.  This concludes the pre-appeal proceedings for today.  This session is adjourned.
