MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good morning to everyone.  Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will now be cross-examined by the Prosecution.

Please. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good morning, Your Honours. 
WITNESS DM
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified yesterday, and indeed it's contained in your statement, that you have pleaded guilty before the authorities in Rwanda.  Is that correct, sir? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And the essence of your testimony before this Court yesterday was that the subject of your guilty plea was the killing of Karegeya, amongst other things.  Is that not correct, sir? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying that you testified that you witnessed and participated in the attack on Karegeya in 1994?  I can't recall the month now, but just accept whether it's 1994 or not. 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	You testified yesterday that your guilty plea involved you stating that a man by the name Ndagijimana struck Karegeya in your presence with a club.  Is that not so, sir? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Sir, have you been tried by the courts in Rwanda? 
A.	I have not yet been tried.  I'm going to be tried before the Gacaca courts.
Q.	And your plea of guilty was made under which provisions?  Was that under the Gacaca as well? 
A.	No, it was in the prosecutor's office. 
Q.	Do you recall when you made that guilty plea, sir? 
A.	I wrote a letter to the prosecutor's office on the 13th December 1998.
Q.	And thereafter were you, at some stage, interviewed by the prosecutor's office in relation to your confession, sir? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is it your testimony, sir, that in that report to the prosecutor, you outlined that you had participated in the attack on Karegeya?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you also outlined, to the best of your recollection, sir, that you had witnessed Karegeya being attacked by Ndagijimana with a club in the presence of you and other people, sir? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours would find on your desks a document in Kinyarwanda with a translation in French and a translation in English.  So there are three -- or two documents, because the French might be stapled to the Kinyarwanda, but the English is obviously separate.  Some of you might have three, some might have two, but you all have the same documents.  So do my learned friends.

Can I ask the registry to place the Kinyarwanda version in -- before the witness, please.  Just the Kinyarwanda one, because he doesn't read English or French, obviously.  The top one, the handwritten one, thank you. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you see the document that I've had placed in front of you, sir? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	You can see from the title of that document that it is a copy of your confession and guilty plea and request for forgiveness, a report from the office of the prosecutor.  Do you see that there, sir? 
A.	Let me just check.
Q.	Sure. 
A.	Yes, I've seen it. 
Q.	It states that your confession date was the 16th of November, 2002, and that you were arrested on the 9th of July, 1998.  Is that correct, sir? 
A.	That is a second document.  I pleaded guilty the first time and the document was misplaced, and I had to make a second document because they couldn't find the first one.  They couldn't find the first document, so it became necessary for me to repeat my confession, and a second document was put together.  So what you are saying is true, this document concerns me.
Q.	Yes.  And this is the second and most recent confession, is it not, sir? 
A.	Yes, that document relates to me. 
Q.	If you turn to the first page -- you open the page and turn to the first page, under column 2, it tells us there, sir, does it not, that you confessed to the crime of murder in 1994 in Kibuye pr復ecture?  Does it not, sir? 
A.	 (No interpretation).
Q.	If you then turn with me to the third page there in the Kinyarwanda version --

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And for those reading in English, it's the second page; I don't know what it is in French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we just have on the record the witness's answer in English, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He said "yes".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we all heard that he said "m-hmm," but we want a translation on record of the "m-hmm".
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Right, very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, booth, can you help us with that?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said "yes". 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	If we then turn to the third page, you list four people who are described there as the victims of your crimes.  Is that not the case, sir?  Do you see that, sir?  Do you --
A.	Yes, I see it.
Q.	Do you see Mr. Cyprien Karegeya's name there, sir? 
A.	I haven't found it yet. 
Q.	Have you -- is it the case that you haven't found it or is it the case that it's not there, sir?  Which is it, sir? 
A.	I haven't found it yet. 
Q.	I'll give you all the time you need, sir.  Please look. 
A.	Did you refer to the third page?  I do not read very well, but I cannot see his name on the third page. 
Q.	Indeed, the name in number one is Uwimana, the second name is Sekaraga, the third name is Alfred.
A.	Yes, I can now see the page you are referring to.
Q.	Do you see those names there, sir, all four of them?  Do you see those names?  Do you see Karegeya's name there, sir? 
A.	I haven't found it yet.
Q.	Okay.  Now, let's turn to the page that talks about your co-perpetrators, then.  Now, you mention many of the names that you mentioned in your testimony.  Misago, do you see his name in that document at number --
A.	I cannot find his name.
Q.	Number one on -- I'm terrible for the photocopying, here.

Mr. Witness, the pages on those documents are not numbered so I can understand the difficulty you have, so I would ask the registry to show you Mr. Misago's name in the document.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you show him this page?  Can you show him this page and bring the document back to me?
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Have you seen that, sir? 
A.	You told me the name was on the third page, and I was looking for that name on the third page, where the name of Karegeya is; and the other problem is, I don't read well. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Registry, can you just show him the page I've opened for you in this document.  Okay? 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see that name there, sir? 
A.	I cannot see that name.  I cannot say I've seen it when I haven't seen it. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Show him this page, sir.  Just like that, thank you.  Stay there with him, please.  I need the document back.  Can you just stay there with him, please.  I need that document back.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see that name there, Mr. Witness?  Let's do this very quickly, please.  Okay? 
A.	Not yet. 
Q.	Has the officer of the registry shown you a page that is open with a name on it, sir? 
A.	I cannot see Karegeya's name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is whether you can see --
THE WITNESS:
I cannot see the name of Karegeya.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Prosecutor is trying to ask you whether you can see Misago's name on the top of the page which the registry has placed in front of you.  Can you see that, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Misago.  Yes, now I can see Misago on this page, Misago, Amon.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the document back, please?  Just wait, please. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	I'm asking the registry to show you the name on the top page that I've opened, and that's the name called Ahingereje, A-H-I-N-G-E-R-E-J-E.  Do you see that, sir?  Yes, do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see Ahingereje's name.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Can I have the document back, please, for one last time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As I mentioned for the record, the first names was number 22 in the English version; this one is number 13.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it's spelled slightly different.  Your Honour, if I can just show him the same page.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	On the same page, Mr. Witness, the name right under the name you've just identified is Ruganamanzi, R-U-G-A-N-A-M-A-N-Z-I, Ruganamanzi.  Do you see that, sir? 
A.	Yes, I can see Ruganamanzi's name.
Q.	Thank you.  Can I have the document back.

Do you mention Ndagijimana's name as part of the co-perpetrators of this attack in this document, sir, to the best of your recollection? 
A.	It is Ndagijimana who gave the -- who struck him first.
Q.	Did you mention that in your confession statement as part of the co-perpetrators, sir? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	I wouldn't, I wouldn't like to waste the Court's time unduly, but I put it to you, Mr. Witness, that that name is not mentioned there as part of the co-perpetrators.
A.	Are you referring to Ndagijimana?  I gave that name.  Maybe they forgot to put his name there, but I recall that I gave his name. 
Q.	Indeed.  Who were the witnesses to this crime, Mr. Witness?  Who was present when this crime occurred, sir?  Can you help us with that, very quickly? 
A.	In Gitaka, there were people living there, of course.  There were people that were there.  Karara, for example, we were in front of his house.  There was another man called Mwirinde who was trading in that centre, but at that time their shops were not open, but those people were in front of their shops.  There was another Nsengimana.  There were many people.  There was also Jotham Sebarame.  I do not remember the other names because it has been a long time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May we have the last name spelled, please.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Will you spell the last name for us, Nyirahamwe (sic) you said?  Something to that effect. 
A.	Are you referring to people that were present? 
Q.	Yes, yes. 
A.	Sebarame, spelled S-E-V-A-R-A-M-E (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two such names, Mr. Mwirinde and Mr. Sebarame.   Did you mention any other observers of this crime?
THE WITNESS:
I mentioned Karara and Mwirinde, Mwirinde, Gitan (phonetic).  Mwirinde is spelt M-W-I-R-I-N-D-E.  I also mentioned Nsengimana.  Nsengimana is spelled N-S-E-N-G-I-M-A-N-A.  I also mentioned Sebarame.  These are the people I remember being present at the time, sir.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	In your confession statement to the prosecutor, in the last section, which is a statement from you entitled "Commission of the Offence," you state at length the activities that you were involved in, the date, and the location of your activities at the time, do you not?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If the registry can assist in showing him what I'm talking about. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I did talk about the commission of the offence, but I did not give any dates because I couldn't remember those dates. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	You say as follows:  "I the undersigned," I skip your name, "confess that we were in Nyarusange," the secteur indicated there, with the district, "province, Kibuye, in April 1994, in the company of Bagaruka and other co-perpetrators named above, and we killed a certain Sekaraga," in brackets "illegible," because the translators can't read it.

You then describe how you had killed him.  You forced him to go to his house, committed suicide by hanging on a rope which someone had given you, and you state there that he preferred to die in that manner for fear of being killed brutally.

Now, you then talk about the killing of Uwimana.  You describe who you did it with and who asked you to do it.  You describe the killing of Habiyambere.  You describe how you did it.  The child of Alfred, you also tell us how you did it.  You talk about a cow that you ate, and the roof of a house that you removed.  Absolutely no mention of the things you've talked about in this courtroom between yesterday and today, is there, Mr. Witness?  Yes or no. 
A.	But you didn't ask me questions on these things.  It is true that I ate the cow and that I took off the roof and that I killed those people, but you never asked me questions on these, questions on these issues.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I've noted your answer, thank you.

Now, are you -- at the location that you're currently detained at, would I be correct in saying that a man called Seyeze, Ezikias, is also detained with you?  S-E-Y-E-Z-E.
A.	That is correct, Seyeze is at the same prison as myself.
Q.	And does this man Seyeze have any relationship with the Accused in this case? 
A.	That is his younger brother. 
Q.	Isn't it true, Mr. Witness, that the man Seyeze is the one responsible for having you come all the way to Arusha to testify in this matter, together with the others that are to come?  Is that not correct, sir? 
A.	People came to investigate.  They came to question me at the prison, and I gave them answers.  But those persons also talked to Seyeze, but I do not know what they said to each other because they came in turns to talk to those people. 
Q.	Right.  Why are you willing to accept responsibility for something you did not do, sir? 
A.	I said that I played a part in the commission of that offence because I accompanied them when they went to kill those people.  But I was also one of the attackers because I had a club.  I accompanied the group of killers.  We got to Gitaka, and I stayed at the place where those persons were killed.  This was why I decided to recognise the crime because I feared that I might be told later that I was also responsible because I was in the company of the killers.  This is why I accepted to make that testimony and to confess that I had some responsibility in the commission of that crime. 
Q.	Was -- were you particularly forthright and forthcoming with the prosecutor in Kibuye?  Did he believe your confession and accept it, sir? 
A.	I told them the truth, and they accepted that I told them the truth, and such a person -- a person whose confession is accepted by the prosecutor's office is given a document that authenticates the fact that his confessions have been accepted by the prosecution's office.  I do have such a document with me. 
Q.	Indeed, isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that the prosecutor made a notation on your confession where he stated that in his opinion, you did not explain the role of each co-perpetrator in the crimes that you seem to have confessed to?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The registry can hand me the Kinyarwanda; I will show him where it is.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Is that not the notation that's made in that document?  Have you seen it? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, Your Honours, on page 12, it's just below the certification on page 12.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Have you seen that, sir, in Kinyarwanda document on the bottom of that page, his comments?  Yes or no? 
A.	Yes, I can see that notation.  Usually when someone makes confessions to the prosecutor's office, sometimes additional questions are put to him.  I knew that I had other questions to respond to our Gacaca.  Well, I was being told to summarise because they didn't have enough paper, but when I go to Gacaca's jurisdiction, I shall explain everything.

And I should like to add something else, if I may.  I want to explain that what I said is the truth.  If you allow me, I will explain to you why I am insisting about having said the truth. 
Q.	Witness, I honestly -- I honestly am not interested in your explanation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you want to say about that, Mr. Witness?  You can elaborate briefly on it. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, in a word or two, I believe that the prosecutor's office accepted that I have spoken the truth, and they gave me a document to that effect. 

Now, we, the accused, have pleaded guilty, we are very few in the prison.  We decided to look for more evidence to submit to the prosecutor's office.  We held a meeting, a meeting of people that had pleaded guilty.  People had come from all areas of the commune.  We went outside the prison, we held a meeting, and we elected a leader, a leader that represented all the accused of all the communes, and we called him the pr復et.  So the pr復et appointed one person per commune, and we called him bourgmestre, the bourgmestre.  And in the commune we appointed councillors for each secteur, and each councillor appointed people per cellule, a leader for each cellule, and those people appointed police officers.  Now, this is the structure of those that have pleaded guilty, and we held a meeting.

Now, the secteurs came together and appointed people for each cell or cellule.  Now, that was to ensure that all the accused who pleaded guilty were present in the meetings.  We established a list of all the people killed in every cellule.  That we did, and after that we spelt out the names of the killers of those people so that we were sure that nobody would say that he did not participate in such or such a killing, because we were there.  So that if anybody wanted to lie, we will put the truth into his fruit (sic) and tell him that he was lying, since we committed the crime together.  So that is the situation, because you cannot lie in such a situation. 

If the prosecutor has more questions, I am ready to answer questions because I have pleaded guilty.  There are details that I did not mention.  Perhaps they could be asked.  I'm sure that even Gacaca will have other questions to respond to. 

This is what I wanted to say.  We were telling the truth.  We did not want to lie any more.  So, this is all I wanted to say. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	I have no doubt that your explanation has been terribly helpful to the Court.

Now, let's go back to the issues at hand.  Is it not the case, Mr. Witness, that you and your co-detainees in Gisovu prison, and other prisons in and around Rwanda, have formed a solidarity, a Hutu solidarity; and the object, is it not the case, of that solidarity, Mr. Witness, is to absolve your Hutu brothers who are now in custody before this Tribunal of their crimes?  That's what the essence of what you've just told us, isn't it? 

You now have a pr復et amongst yourselves, you have your own bourgmestres, a government in prison, so to speak, and you have all come together, formulated your evidence with a view to assisting those leaders in 1994 of their crimes.  That's exactly what you're doing here, is it not, sir?  Yes or no.
A.	No, sir.  I have something to say about what you've just said.  I pleaded guilty.  I spoke the truth.  I believe that I cannot speak about the co-perpetrators.  If I confessed, I cannot begin to absolve anybody that participated in the criminal activities that we are talking about. 

As far as the government that you're referring to is concerned, this is not a government.  We, rather, tried to establish the truth, and we succeeded in convincing many people to plead guilty.  And indeed, before that, it was very difficult for the prosecution to know what really happened. 
Q.	You did not operate in Gasharu cellule in 1994, Mr. Witness; is that not the case?  You were nowhere near that area, yes or no?
A.	I arrived at Gasharu on the day Karegeya died. 
Q.	You haven't answered my question.  You, you did not operate your criminal acts, by your own admission, in Gasharu cellule, did you?  Yes or no. 
A.	This is what I pled.  I was not able to protect the victim; moreover, I was still with the killers that killed that person, but I did not assist them.  If not, I did not play any other role in Gasharu, sir.
Q.	That's precisely what I thought you might do, turn around and diminish your role.  But yesterday, it was different:  You were present enough to know who did what.  Today, your role is somewhat diminished, isn't it? 
A.	No, sir, I'm not diminishing my role.  If you ask me questions, I will respond, but -- and I will not leave anything aside.  I explained the roles of one and all; I'm prepared to repeat it.  I said Ndagijimana, Ndagijimana struck him with a club.  It was Ahingereje, Ruganamanzi and Rwasibo who flushed him out.  Those were the foremost people responsible.

Now, the one that struck him, that was also Misago and Rusagara that also participated in killing him, and I told you I was there.  So what did I hide from you? 
Q.	You learned all those things from your criminal colleagues in prison, did you not, sir, during your discussions with bourgmestres and pr復ets in Gisovu prison?  That's where you learned all this information. 
A.	No, sir.  The bourgmestres in the prison, do not -- they do not counsel the accused; rather, they tell you to say the truth on what you have done.  Now, those people were appointed to convince the detainees to speak the truth about the acts they have carried out.  Now, the bourgmestre or the pr復et cannot advise you not to speak the truth; rather, he would put questions to you to convince you to speak the truth about what you've done, sir. 
Q.	What position does Augustin Karara, the former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, hold in that prison cabinet?  Help me with that. 
A.	No post, sir, did he have. 
Q.	What about Rukundakuvuga? 
A.	Rukundakuvuga was an ordinary citizen.  He had a post -- he has a post in the Gacaca structure. 
Q.	So if Rukundakuvuga, an ordinary citizen, has a post in the Gacaca structure, how then does a former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune hold no post?  You're not being truthful here, Mr. Witness, are you? 
A.	I don't know the type of post he occupies, but I know that he is responsible for something at the Gacaca structure.  I've just spent eight months in Gisovu so that I do not know everything that happened.  I said I came at the time the Gacaca structure was set up, and when I arrived I realised that he had a role in that structure, and my secteur is different from his.  He didn't even ask me questions about what I did because he did not know what I did.  I live in a secteur --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness gave the name of a secteur.
THE WITNESS:
-- and he lives in the Kayenzi secteur, sir.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	That's precisely why you have no -- you can -- you could have no knowledge of the things you testified about yesterday, different secteurs, different locations, different attackers.  Is that not the case?  Why didn't you mention Rukundakuvuga in your -- as part of your co-perpetrators in your confession, sir?
A.	I did not work with Rukundakuvuga.  I did not.  In his confessions, he didn't talk about me, and I did not talk about him in my confession.
Q.	Precisely.  Precisely, Mr. Witness.  You didn't work with Rukundakuvuga because if you did, then you would have mentioned Karegeya in your confession.  Is that not the case, sir? 
A.	Yes, sir.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to tender anything of this, Mr. Phillips? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful for that intervention, Your Honour.  I thought I did.  No, I tendered another one yesterday. 

Your Honour, if I just tender it as the next Prosecution exhibit.  I think it's 36 we're on?
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 36.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In English, A -- sorry, in Kinyarwanda, A; B and C for French and English, in that order.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 36A, P. 36B, and P. 36C admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Re-examination, please. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, at this juncture I should like to make an observation.  This document was only disclosed to us after the beginning of this hearing.  I believe that it is regrettable.  We are not here in a theatre where we have coup d'俸at and surprises.  We are here to be serious. 

The parties should disclose the material they have, and the Prosecutor should be told that when he has important material, he should disclose the material to his learned friends on the Defence.  This is the observation I wanted to make, Mr. President. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The observation is noted, Your Honour, but this is an adversarial proceeding, and the whole point of the exercise is to impeach the credibility of the witness.  His witness should be forthcoming in telling him the truth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Besnier, we have noted your remark, and we have also taken into account that this is the second time this happened; you made a similar remark yesterday.  The Chamber has discussed the matter.

Now, the Prosecutor is, as indicated by Mr. Phillips, under no legal obligation to disclose in advance documents of this character.  It is also important, of course, also stressed by the Prosecutor, that in adversarial proceedings, the party be given the possibility, cross-examining the witness, to impeach the credibility -- I don't take a position whether this was actually done in the present case, but now I'm at the general level -- to impeach the credibility by submitting documents which have not previously been made known to the witness.  So the Prosecutor is right in that respect.

On the other hand, we all think that the Defence remark is legitimate in the sense that once the witness is in the witness box, there is no longer any contact between the witness and any of the lawyers, any of the teams, either on the Prosecution or the Defence side; and for that reason, the element of surprise and the possibility to impeach the witness would not be reduced if the Prosecution were to provide the Defence with documents the Prosecution intends to rely upon when the cross-examining is starting or even once the witness has entered the witness box and therefore is incommunicado for the Defence.  So, that would reduce the element of surprise for the Defence without reducing the possibility of the Prosecution to impeach the credibility, and we think that is a practice that should be followed in this case as it has been followed in previous cases.  So if that could kindly be observed from now on. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have an observation to make.  It's an observation that centres on the inequality or equality of arms.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The Defence, during the Prosecution's case, adopted the same practice.  The same courtesy was not afforded to the Prosecution.  It is, for want of a better word, unfair and prejudicial to the Prosecution to be asked to submit documents of their own witnesses. 

They are calling the witnesses, not my witness.  They should be making the disclosure to me because they know, they ought to know the evidence and the documents.  We were not afforded the same privilege.  They sprang up with documents; I never objected because that is the essence of an adversarial system. 

The issue you make about the witness being in the box would not be helpful.  Learned counsel, with all due respect, would only tailor his examination to suit the evidence there.  The whole purpose of it -- and in any jurisdiction in the whole world, it is a noted fact that it is not a disclosure obligation of the party impeaching the witness to disclose the evidence beforehand.  It is absolutely unfair.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Now, we are well aware, coming from many jurisdictions in the world, of what is the practice in the world, so we do not need to be reminded about that.

I also take your point, Mr. Phillips, that when it comes to a document which may affect the way in which the examination-in-chief may be conducted, then certainly you will not be doing that until your cross-examination starts.  So that's absolutely -- I totally agree with you there. 

So in other words, when I made the remark about the moment he -- you may, of course, be able to wait with showing documents to the Defence if that could influence the examination-in-chief of the Defence.  That point is taken.  But the remainder of the remark remains; that is, namely, that we have now in Trial Chamber I, for at least two years, observed the practice I just outlined, and it's a matter of courtesy.  It's not a binding rule.  It's not a clear-cut rule, but it facilitates the proceedings in the courtroom.

Now, coming, then, to the point of the equality between the parties, I can't -- are there any documents or episodes in particular you want to recall?  You will remember -- I don't recall you having made any objections previously in that connection, but that is, as you say, because you accept the adversarial principle.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Of course, of course.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It happened several times, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
With the same sort of documents from the prosecutor's office.  There was one that was the subject of a motion that I filed, which I haven't received a decision on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that or which decision?  I thought we were absolutely up to --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The decision on the misconduct of Defence counsel.  It was based on a similar practice.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But what I'm saying now is not particularly dramatic or difficult, it's only a matter of courtesy between the parties.

Now, there were no questions -- do you have anything to add, Mr. Besnier? 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have no difficulty with the ruling.  I understand the grounds and I accept it, but I have one question still in my mind.  If we have in our possession after this session documents which enable us to challenge the documents produced by the Prosecutor, will we be authorised to produce such documents in the interests of justice? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will make an application to have it admitted, and then we will deal with it in concreto, case-by-case basis based on the situation.

MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MAR큐IS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that yesterday you testified to the effect that you were guilty for three murders which you yourself committed? 
A.	That is true, but there were some of my co-perpetrators whom I did not mention because there were many.  But it is true that I committed these crimes, and I confessed to them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that with regard to other crimes, you testified yesterday that you had played the role of an eyewitness, and that your guilty role was attributed to you mainly because of your passiveness?
A.	No one has even accused me of these crimes.  I voluntarily provided this information concerning the crimes so that the legal authorities are aware. 
Q.	Am I correct in saying that for the murder of Cyprien Karegeya you are described as an eyewitness, as a passive witness of the murder, and that you are not yourself accused of having struck any blow?
A.	I do accept my responsibility in that crime because people saw me pass by.  I was in the group of attackers.  I was armed with a club, and for those who saw me, I was a criminal amongst others.  And that is why I am counting myself amongst the attackers who killed Karegeya.  And people who were seeing me on the scene -- at the scene of the crime could not say that I was not part of the criminals involved, and that is why I voluntarily gave information regarding that crime so that one is aware of exactly what happened. 
Q.	With regard to the murder of Cyprien Karegeya, are there any documents in the possession of the Rwandan courts containing confessions given by you, giving an account of the events?
A.	Yes, such a document exists.
Q.	You will see that this document is attached to your confession, a document which was given to you today. 
A.	But I think I saw Karegeya's name in the documents which were given to me. 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- I do not want to ask a leading question, Mr. President -- but the name of Karegeya does not exist in the documents which you were given today.  Does that mean that there were other confessions or other documents bearing the name of Karegeya and which you voluntarily did not wish to submit, so that we have a complete document? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, why is Mr. Karegeya's name not mentioned in the present document, the one in front of us?  Why is that? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know how they omitted mentioning Karegeya's name.  I mentioned it.  Furthermore, I have in my possession a document which testifies to the fact that I mentioned that name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that, the one you have in your possession? 
THE WITNESS:
I have a document.  In fact, it's a copy of my confession that I sent to the prosecutor.  The first document which I sent to the prosecutor was lost, and I made a second document.  So I do not understand why the name of Karegeya does not appear in that document, whereas I had spoken about him and I gave the names of persons who had killed him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when you sent that second document to the prosecutor, was that a document containing the names we have in front of us here, but in addition, also Mr. Karegeya's name?  Is that your testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
I remember that I mentioned Karegeya's name.  I was asking the person who was writing for me, because I don't know how to write, to add Karegeya's name.  So I don't understand how come he didn't mention Karegeya's name, but I'm positive that in the document I have, that name exists. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But when you provided this second round of information, did you then give these names, plus Mr. Karegeya's name?
THE WITNESS:
I asked the person who was writing for me to also note down Karegeya's name, but I didn't take care to find out whether he'd actually written Karegeya's name.  Maybe he forgot to mention Karegeya's name, but I had asked him to do so.  I'm positive that I asked him to add Karegeya's name. 

There were two documents.  First of all, there was a document in which my confession appeared, and then there was a document in which I was testifying on persons who killed Karegeya in my presence.  Therefore, I did not omit to add Karegeya's name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you also mentioned these other names in that connection on that occasion; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. MAR큐IS:
The problem of documents which are disclosed at the last minute is that we are unable to verify their completeness. 
BY MR. MAR큐IS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in Rwanda, did you have counsel to assist you in your case? 
A.	No, I don't have counsel.  Actually, my trial has not yet begun. 
Q.	So your case has not been brought to completion?
A.	No, because I'm going to appear before the Gacaca courts, and these courts have not yet begun their sittings. 
Q.	At the appropriate moment, nothing will stop you from mentioning the Karegeya affair and the role which you played therein?
A.	No.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My learned friend should know better, really.  You should know better. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was this a question?  What is the next question?
BY MR. MAR큐IS:
Q.	Have you been --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, the witness is also speaking. 
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, I don't think I understood your question. 
BY MR. MAR큐IS:
Q.	I think I've already put this question.  I'll put it again.  Have you -- has your case been ruled on definitively in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I have not gone before the courts as yet.

0950H
JUDGE BOSSA: 
Mr. Witness, was your confession read to you, the one which is before us?
THE WITNESS:
No, it wasn't read to me.
JUDGE BOSSA: 
And how much time did you spend at Gitaka roadblock.
THE WITNESS:
I was not at the Gitaka roadblock.  That roadblock was erected in the Gitesi secteur, whereas, I was in Buyea secteur.
JUDGE BOSSA: 
And where was Karegeya killed?
THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was killed in Gitaka behind the buildings.
JUDGE BOSSA: 
Which buildings?
THE WITNESS:
It was behind the row of buildings which was somewhat below.
JUDGE BOSSA: 
Was one of those buildings Gitanen Karara, the trader's house?
THE WITNESS:
No.  The first building belonged to Myera and the second to Sebarame.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I have not understood you very well.  Where was the Gitaka roadblock, according to you?
THE WITNESS:
When I arrived in Gitaka in 1994 I saw the roadblock.  It was erected between Karara's house and that belonging to Ndabukiye.
JUDGE BOSSA:
But that is not where Karegeya was killed?
THE WITNESS:
We had already passed the roadblock and it was behind the buildings, a little bit further away from the roadblock that Karegeya was killed.
JUDGE BOSSA:
So you never spent any time at this roadblock, then?
THE WITNESS:
No.

JUDGE BOSSA:
You mentioned in your evidence yesterday that after the arrival of the accused in Gitaka, a few days later people began to flee, and you say this was at the end of May or beginning of June.  Is that what you said?
THE WITNESS:
I said that I saw Ndindabahizi at the end of June and people began to flee at the beginning of July, the first week of July.  I think that's what I explained yesterday, and that's how the events occurred.
JUDGE BOSSA: 
The war was over, wasn't it?  So why were people --
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  People were leaving the country.  Ordinary citizens were no longer being killed.  There was rather a war between the soldiers.  The disturbances amongst the population had come to an end and there was only the soldiers that were in confrontation during this time.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Then you also stated -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that the Accused could not have killed Karegeya because there was no prior meeting.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE BOSSA: 
My question then is, were there prior meetings in respect of the victims whom you killed or others who were killed?
THE WITNESS:
No, there were no meetings.
JUDGE BOSSA: 
Thank you, that's all. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, were you provided with a copy of the confession statement made before the Rwandan Court?
THE WITNESS:
I made a confession.  I kept a copy and I gave the original to the Prosecutor.
JUDGE KHAN:
Do you have the original with you?
THE WITNESS:
I have a copy but the other was sent to the Prosecutor's Office.  I'm keeping a copy with me in the prison.
JUDGE KHAN:
Did you see the name of Karegeya was mentioned in that confession statement?  Did you see the name of Karegeya in the copy provided to you by the Rwandan court?
THE WITNESS:
I had told them to write down his name and I believe his name is there.
JUDGE KHAN:
Did you read that name?  Did you know that name was there?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know how to read.  I'm sure his name is there, because I asked that the name be mentioned, so I don't know how it couldn't be written down.  I cannot read what was written by hand.  When I'm given a document I keep it.
JUDGE KHAN:
You are unable to read even your own language?
THE WITNESS:
When it's a typed document I can read it and that's the case if it's in capital letters, but if it's written by hand I am unable to read.
JUDGE KHAN:
Your confession was recorded in handwriting?
THE WITNESS:
Someone was taking down notes for me.  I was asking someone to take notes for me, and the confession was taken down by hand.
JUDGE KHAN:
The copy provided to you, is it a handwritten or a typed copy?
THE WITNESS:
I kept a copy but the other one was sent to the Prosecutor.  Nobody gave me a copy.  In other words, no one sent us a typewritten copy of what we had said.  I kept the handwritten version.
JUDGE KHAN:
That handwritten version was provided by the Court, by the Rwandan Court?
THE WITNESS:
No, no, it's prisoners, it's my fellow-prisoners who wrote for me, and then a copy of that document was sent to the Prosecutor's Office.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, who was the leader of the group that killed Mr. Karegeya?
THE WITNESS:
I saw Rwasibo, who was conducting himself like a leader.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You formed part of that group, did you, but he was the leader or you were not sure of him?
THE WITNESS:
I can consider myself as an observer.  I was not with them in the beginning.  We met along the way, and I joined the group.  We did not discuss the plan together.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you -- but you were present when the person was killed.  What was the distance between you and the spot where he was killed, physically?
THE WITNESS:
It's a distance that I can cover, if I walk at a fast pace, in five minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you five minutes away from the spot where this person was killed?  Were you five minutes walking distance away?
THE WITNESS:
No, I was very close to these persons, about ten metres from these people.  I was a bit uphill in relation to where they were.  I was not further than ten metres away.  And I could see a person and whatever he was doing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if Rwasibo was the leader, why is Rwasibo not mentioned in this document with persons present during killing?  In other words, the document containing perpetrators and observers, why is his name not mentioned in that document which was shown to you just a few moments ago?
THE WITNESS:
Rwasibo was often mentioned.  How did you know him, Mr. President?  I'm sure it's because his name is in a document that you have.  How then do you explain his presence in the document?  I mentioned him in all the documents.  I could not have covered up his name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, did you mention his name when you made your explanation to the Prosecutors and when you confessed to your crimes?  Did you mention Rwasibo's name?
THE WITNESS:
At that time I did not mention Rwasibo simply because I was talking about myself.  When I gave my testimony perhaps I should have mentioned him in my testimony, but with regard to my confession, the confession is about what I did personally.  But the testimony about -- that arose in the second part and his name is mentioned therein.  I think there's a portion of my testimony which you did not receive.  There were two parts, my confession and then my testimony.  It is possible to see it in one portion of the document and not in the other.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in the testimony before this Court you mentioned Rwasibo.  I'm putting to you that there is no mention of Rwasibo in the document we were just provided with.  What is your comment to that, please?
THE WITNESS:
I'm saying that in my statement, when I had my statement written, I asked that his name be mentioned.  I don't know why they did not write it down.  I believe those who recorded my statement did not write it.  Sometimes you ask somebody -- you tell somebody something and you ask him to put it in writing and it's possible for that person to forget certain things and to include certain things, that is normal, that is human.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Mwirinde?
THE WITNESS:
You asked me a question regarding residents of Gitaka, people who were present and who could have seen what happened, and you asked me the names of other persons who were present, people who were observing and who were not killers, and I mentioned his name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
THE WITNESS:
He was a Hutu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he present during the event?
THE WITNESS:
Mwirinde was there the day Karegeya was killed and we found him there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Mwirinde observing this event, the killing of this person?
THE WITNESS:
He was present.  When Karegeya was taken away he was in front of his door, but he did not go to the site where he was killed.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Who was Sebarame, was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
THE WITNESS:
He was a Hutu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he also observe the killing of Karegeya?
THE WITNESS:
Sebarame saw him, he came and stood about five metres away from me and observed what was going on, and if you asked him the question as to who struck Karegeya, he will tell you because he was present and he saw everything.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Nsengimana, was he Hutu or a Tutsi?
THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was Nsengimana's first name?
THE WITNESS:
Nasone (phonetic).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he have any nickname?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know his nickname.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He was present during the killing, was he?
THE WITNESS:
We left him a bit uphill.  He was standing there, but I do not believe that he was present among those that I saw at the killing site.  I think he was on the road close to the houses.  I don't think he left that place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then Sebarame, was he Hutu or Tutsi?
THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Was he also present?
THE WITNESS:
He was standing about five metres from me and he saw everything.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in your statement we just received here there is no mention of Mwirinde, Nsengimana, and Nsabimana.
THE WITNESS:
I added this name when you asked me the name of the persons who were present.  We did not have enough sheets of paper such that we couldn't put all the names.  We had to reduce the names and to write as little as possible.  So we mentioned only some names.  They asked us questions on events which we experienced which we witnessed, which we saw.  We gave the essential parts.  We could not have given all the names.  I have given this name before you just because you asked me a question regarding those who were present and who witnessed the killing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know anyone called Joel Ntabwakule (phonetic)?

THE WITNESS:
It's, rather, Joel Ndabukiye, I know him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
THE WITNESS:
He's Hutu.  He's detained in the Gisovu prison.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he present during the killing of Karegeya?
THE WITNESS:
He was not present. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why is he detained?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I don't know the reasons for which he is detained.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know anyone named Emmanuel Ndabukiye?
THE WITNESS:
Did you say Emmanuel Ndabukiye?  I don't know him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the distance, Mr. Witness, between Tabeya and the place where the killing took place?
THE WITNESS:
Where the killing took place is called Tabeya but before then it was in the Gitesi commune, and for now, when they are asking their questions about where the killing took place, we used to say in the Gitesi communal, but now that place is called Tabeya.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the place where Karegeya was killed is in Tabeya?
THE WITNESS:
Now it has become Tabeya, it used to be Gitesi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Mr. Witness, we have concluded your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be escorted. Yes, you have anything to add, Mr. Witness?

THE WITNESS:
I have a question, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead.
THE WITNESS:
I have a question.  I have seen Ndindabahizi in this courtroom.  Can't you allow me to say hello to him?  We haven't seen for a long time.  That is my only request.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a request which is now noted and if there is a wish on the part of the Defence to follow-up that request, then it can simply be done by communication through the witness protection unit.  Your testimony has come to an end, provided that there is no objection by the Prosecution, and there is none.  So that is something that will be followed up administratively and we will see how that develops.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
	(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. The next witness is DO.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, it is DO, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness DO in these proceedings.  Do you have a document in front of you there?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your signature at the bottom of that document?
THE WITNESS:
It is my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information contained in that document is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That leads us to Defence Exhibit 38, under seal.
(Exhibit D. 38 admitted under seal).
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you have to tell the truth, Mr. Witness, and the registry will administer the taking of your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness DO in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
      You will now be asked questions by the Defence.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS DO,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell the Court where you lived in 1994?
A.	I lived in the Nyagahenga cellule in the Kahenge secteur and Kibuye pr復ecture, in the Gitesi commune.
Q.	Thank you.  And before you came to Arusha, Witness, where were you living?  Just before you came to Arusha where were you living?
A.	The same place I've just mentioned.  But before coming here I was a detainee in a Gisovu prison.
Q.	Very well.  You are a detainee in the Gisovu prison.
A.	Yes, in the Gisovu prison.
Q.	And do you recall the dates on which you were arrested to be taken to the Gisovu prison?
A.	30th November 1994.
Q.	What are the charges against you?
A.	I'm accused of genocide.
Q.	Did you plead guilty to those crimes?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And have you been sentenced for this crime?
A.	No.  My case is still before the Prosecutor.  It's not yet been brought to the judges.
Q.	You admitted having been arrested for genocide.  Did you participate in attacks against civilian Tutsis?
A.	Yes, I have a big share of responsibilities.
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court, taking as a reference point the death of President Habyarimana, if you remember that, tell the Court when the attacks against the Tutsis started.
A.	In our region it was after four days that we started the killings.
Q.	How did the killings start?  Who gave the signal?
A.	We were very nervous.  I did not see any authority, but there were attacks and there were attackers from Mabanza, from Rutsiro, and they told us that, "You have not done anything to date."  And I think that is how we started.
Q.	You admit having committed crimes against Tutsis.  In which secteur did you perpetrate these crimes?
A.	In three separate secteurs, Gitesi secteur, in Kayenzi, as well as the Ruragwe secteur.
Q.	Do you recall having gone to a cellule called Gasharu during the genocide?
A.	Yes, very often.  We virtually lived in this cellule.
Q.	Were you going to Gasharu every day?
A.	We didn't go to Gasharu every day, but we used to go there -- we go through the cellule when we were going for attacks, and then we came back to this cellule to have a drink.
Q.	And yet the Gasharu cellule is not the cellule in which you have your house.  So why do you go there so often?
A.	It's a cellule which is neighbouring to our own.  There's a river dividing the two and every day we used to meet in the Gasharu cellule.
Q.	Was there a trading centre in Gasharu?
A.	Yes, there was a small trading centre.
Q.	And what is the name of that trading centre?
A.	It's the Gitaka trading centre.
Q.	During the events that we are discussing, are you able to tell me if there was a roadblock at Gitaka?
A.	There was.
Q.	Who was manning this roadblock?
A.	There was a young man called Sumayire Minani and another one called Nbonyubwe.
MR. BESNIER:
Can witness or the Kinyarwanda interpreters, are you able to spell this name for the Court?
THE INTERPRETER:
Minani, M-I-N-A-N-I.  Sumayire is S-U-M-A-Y-I-R-E.  Nbonyubwe N-B-O-N-Y-U-B-W-E.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, let's come back to this roadblock.  Do you know if Tutsis were killed on this roadblock?
A.	No Tutsi was killed at this roadblock.  People were brought from neighbouring hills.  Some were killed behind the house and others in other places, but nobody was stopped and killed at the roadblock; to my knowledge.
Q.	To your knowledge, did it ever happen that Tutsis were killed within the vicinity of that roadblock?
A.	It is in the commercial centre that the roadblock was located, and I know people who were killed close to that centre, and I myself played a role in their killing.
Q.	You are saying that people were killed.  Who was killed during the genocide in that cellule?
A.	There were many.  There was, for example, Nyiranye; a child called Gatemeri; there's Kayoni.  There's a child of Rwabyuma, and the little children, two of them of Nzajyinduga; and a woman named Tatiana and her two children; another one called Nyankiko, and others.  There's a woman and her child, the woman was called Mukankubito, there was another man called Karegeya who was killed very close to that centre.
Q.	I think we have sufficient names for now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you need to have these names spelled for the record?
(Pages 17 to 27 by R. Lear)
























1030H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. President I was going to ask -- to request the Kinyarwanda interpreters to give us -- to spell those names for us.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Nkiranuye, N-K-I-R-A-N-U-Y-E; Gatemeri, G-A-T-E-M-E-R-I; Kanyoni, K-A-N-Y-O-N-I; Rwabyuma, R-W-A-B-Y-U-M-A; Nzajyinduga, N-Z-A-J-Y-I-N-D-U-G-A; Thacianne,
T-H-A-C-I-A-N-N-E; Nyankiko, N-Y-A-N-K-I-K-O; Mukankubito, M-U-K-A-N-K -U-B-I-T-O; and Karegeya, K A-R-E-G-Y-E-Y-A (sic).
MR. BESNIER:
We thank the interpreters.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, we are now going to ask you questions on one of the persons -- or, on a few of those names that you have mentioned.  Let's start with the person that you call Thacianne.
A.	Yes, it is Thacianne Mukantabana, M-U-K-A-N-T-A-B-A-N-A.
Q.	Witness, all those names you have mentioned, did you know them beforehand?
A.	Yes, I knew them very well.
Q.	Were you on good terms with them before the events?
A.	I had no problems with them.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We heard only, April 1994, we didn't hear the beginning of counsel's question.
THE WITNESS:
We were surprised -- we were taken by surprise by the events.  Immediately after the death of the president, we were very nervous, very exited, and we were afraid at the beginning.  We were afraid.  We lived harmoniously on the hill, we used to work together, and we were ensuring our own -- our security together, but later when houses -- when they started burning houses in Mabanza, the events went all the way to Ruragwe and people came by saying, "Well, you have not done anything," that is when we started killing, and one person -- you attack a person you knew and you kill him.  It is a matter of shame and we are very sad about that.  I am very saddened by the crimes that I have committed and I know it will create problems for the courts, and that is why I decided to confess my guilt.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You killed Tutsis, but were you not afraid that the authorities or the police will arrest you and put you in prison during the events?
A.	It took time for us to begin killing, but then later on, when we started killing, what could the authorities do against thousands of people?  It was impossible to quieten those people.  That was a major problem to the authorities.  Those were killings never seen before; unspeakable, but I couldn't see how the authorities could arrest those killings, and had they attempted to stop us, probably the situation would have worsened.  Thus, we started killing, it was because we were very nervous.  We had become more like beasts.  This is the only adjective I could use to describe us.
Q.	Now, let us be more precise about Thacianne Mukantabana that you mentioned.  Do you remember the date on which she was killed, Thacianne Mukantabana?
A.	I do not remember the date, sir, but I believe that it was in May, at the very beginning of the month of May.
Q.	Who was there when she was killed?
A.	Let me give you the names of the persons that were with me.
Q.	Are you going to give us names, sir?  If so, give us names of the people who were in your group, who could not be witnesses at this time.  We shall come back to that.
A.	We were at Gitaka, and when we killed her it was on a Monday.  There was a first person, Nsengiyumva -- a gendarme Cyprian Nsengiyumva; there was another Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu; and then there was Ismael Mbarushimana; and I believe that there was also Frouduel  Bakinahe; there was also one Mpitabakana.
Q.	Still for the Court and the transcripts,  could you be so kind as to spell out those names?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There was Cyprian Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y U-M-V-A; Ismael Mbarushimana,
M-B-A-R-U-S-H-I-M-A-N-A; Mpitabakana, M-P-I-T-A-B-A-K-A-N-A; Frouduel Bakinahe, B-A-K-I-N-A-H-E; there was also Mbarushimana, rather, Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A; Alias Rutomvu, R-U-T-O-M-V-U.
MR. PRESIDENT:
A general remark.  When there is a list of names given by the witness, and the same list is given in a piece of paper, then, I think, the practical way to proceed is to ensure that the court reporter has the same list.  For the time being, it would appear that that list has not been distributed to the court reporters.  But could that be arranged from now on, that when there are lists of names in the document, then that is being submitted to the court reporters, then we do not have to do the spelling. So that is one issue.

The second; once names are being spelt, it is, of course, important to reflect the names and their order as testified to by the witness and not to follow the names in the list if there are differences between the two.  I am just making those two general observations. 

Yes, please.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I have taken note of that observation, Mr. President.

BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, Witness, let us now hear from you, briefly, but accurately, the manner in which Thacianne Mukantabana was killed?
A.	I believe it was around 2 p.m., we were at the Gitaka centre.  Cyprian Nsengiyumva, who was a gendarme, and Nsengiyumva, alias Rutomvu, took her to Gitaka -- they found her at Joel Ndabukage's, where she was hiding.  I asked them, "We were looking for that person for a long time, where did you find that person?" And the gendarme told me, "You cannot search for these people, I am a soldier I know how to go about it.  I cannot tell you where I found her."  And the people said, "Well, now we have found her."  And when we were going out to kill her, the gendarme said, "Well, wait a minute, she promised to give me something," so that we went away and got to Nyarubuye at one Pascal's house -- Pascal Rwuhara's house, there were the furniture belonging to that lady.  We took the furniture and got back to Gitaka.  The furniture went to Nyabahiga -- at the gendarme's house.  When we wanted to take it to Nyabahinga's house the soldier said -- when we got to Nyabahinga -- we wanted to go to Nyabahinga, but the soldier refused, the gendarme refused.  So we stayed at Gitaka, and we took her behind the shops.  We didn't go any further, and it was there that we killed her in the company of two of her children and another man who was at Ndabahinga's, he was called Nyugahingu; so that we killed four people on that occasion.
Q.	You are saying, firstly -- firstly you found and flushed out Ndabakeke who was at Bukiye's house in hiding?
A.	I was not one of those that flushed the person out.  She was brought in by Nsengiyumva, Cyprian, who was a gendarme.  With Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu, they were the two that brought her.
Q.	Were you a member of the group that went to take the furniture -- to steal the furniture?
A.	Yes, I also went to Nyarubuye.
Q.	Yes, you went to Nyarubuye to get the furniture.  Were you with Thacianne?
A.	Yes, she was with us, with her two children.   We went together.
Q.	And then you took her back to the Gitaka centre; is that correct?
A.	Absolutely correct.  It was there that we found that Nyankiko, Zachari, that man -- when you get to Gitaka, you go down along rows of shops and just in front of Gatwa's residence, and when you get to a junction, you turn into a street of Rwuberamye's house, that is where the shops were.
Q.	Now, as compared to the roadblock that was at the central of Gitaka, what was the distance at which Thacianne was killed?
A.	It was the distance of 80 to 90 metres.
Q.	Who were the persons that struck Thacianne Mukantabana?
A.	I, personally did.  I struck her several times.
Q.	With what type of weapon?
A.	I used a club.  There were four people to be killed, but I also had a sword.  I did not use the sword, since Nyakiko was bringing about problems, I left after having struck her twice.  She was not yet dead, and it was Nsengiyumva, alias, Rutomvu that finished her off whilst I went off to kill the other man who was called  Nyankiko.
Q.	Who ordered you to kill those people in particular -- especially Thacianne and her family, who gave you instructions to kill those people?
A.	You mean at that very instant or just before?  In the preceding days, nobody ordered us to do so.  I have told you how it all started, but when we were on the spot the most important person was the gendarme, and it was the gendarme who told us, "Don't take her all they way to Nyabahanga, kill her here."
Q.	Didn't you say that Thacianne was being sought after, who was looking for her?
A.	Everybody was looking for her -- everybody.  All the population in that area was looking for her.  In 1985, there was an incident.  There was a teacher called Jaqueline Nyirabakwiza, who was a teacher in primary 5, she had poisoned -- she had poisoned her, and people were saying that it was her that -- it was she that poisoned her, and that is why she was called "Nyiramasitete".  And when the war started, they were saying that she has to be found and killed, and that is when -- why Thacianne was killed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This episode with Jaqueline, in which year was that, Witness?
THE WITNESS:
I was in primary 5, I believe it was in 1985.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Could you tell me whether you knew one Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before the events that we have just discussed, that is before April l994?
A.	I used to know him.  I had seen him on two occasions.  The first occasion at which I saw him was just before -- just after his wedding.  He had come to visit his family while in our area.  We were there, we watched his vehicle so that the children do not spoil the tyres.  The second time was, I believe, in 1992.  He had come to our area in Gitaka; he held a meeting there, and I believe on that occasion, he gave us berets of his party, PSD.   We were very happy to join the party.  This is how I got to know Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi once again during the war, that is, between the beginning of April l994 and the end of June 1994?
A.	I did not see him during that period, but I heard it said that he had come to our area -- he had come to our area in Gitaka, and that he had arrested one Augustin Karara, who had a shop in the centre.  He had arrested him and he had taken him away to imprison him.  On that day, I did not move.  I believe it was on a Sunday, I was at home, and the other attackers came to see me and they said, "The minister is here, he is very serious."  And I asked, "What has happened?"  They told me, "Well, he has just arrested Karara."  And then I told them, "Well, if you continue to move around like this, you may be arrested yourselves."   And we went to a hill, and several moments after that I saw, from one kilometre away, a vehicle pass by Ndabukiye's house.  We therefore went to the centre after that, and people told us that Karara had just been arrested, and they did not know what was going to happen to him.  This is what happened, but I did not personally see him when he came on that day.
Q.	Didn't you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before Thacianne's death at the Gitaka roadblock that you mentioned?
A.	No, sir, I didn't see him.  I did not see any other authority as a matter of fact.  I didn't see any pr復et or bourgmestre.  I did not see any such authorities.  And, I pleaded guilty, let me state the truth and nothing but the truth, and if I had seen the president I would have said so.  So that if we speak the truth it must be the whole truth and supply the names of all the accomplices.  So that had I seen him, I would have made a testimony against him, and that would have been done a long time ago, and that is the reason why I am saying he did not do anything in our area.  He did not call for massacres to begin.
Q.	Did you know one Cyprian Karegeya?
A.	I know him very well.  He was a neighbour in the Gasharu cellule.
Q.	Did he survive the genocide?
A.	No, he died.  He was killed, and that is a very well-known fact.  He was killed.
Q.	When was he killed?
A.	After the murder of Thacianne Mukantabana, that was less than seven days after that murder, it was at that time, I believe, that he was also killed.
Q.	Do you know how he was killed and who killed him?
A.	I do not know the circumstances under which he died.  Karegeya was one of the people sought after.  He was very much sought after.  I came to Gitaka, at that time Karara just came out of the Jita pub where he was having a drink.  He was very sad, and he said, "My friend has been killed."  I asked him, "Who is killed?  Is it Karegeya?"  He said, "Yes, it is Karegeya."  I said that since he is dead we no longer had to look for him.  He said that he was one of the most important people that actually had been killed.  And I said, 'Who killed him?"  And he said, "It was attackers that came from Buye."

I said, "Didn't you bury him since he was your friend?" He said, "Yes, I did bury him."  I said, "Well, well, that is the end of all of that."  It was thus that I learnt that he was killed by people from Buye.
Q.	But you were not an eyewitness to that murder?  Yes or no will do.
A.	You mean Karegeya?  No.  I was not an eyewitness to his murder.
Q.	Very well.  Regarding your testimony here in Arusha, do you believe that you are going to gain anything from it -- from having -- or testifying for Emanuel Ndindabahizi, are you going to gain anything from it?
A.	You mean interest?  You see, we in Rwanda only want people to plead guilty if they are guilty, and ask for pardon, because there are people who are wrongly accused.  People are said to have played a role whilst one did not see them anywhere.  Those people are falsely accused.  So, you the Judges must seek the correct information to get to the truth.  We are speaking the truth.  We are not protecting anyone.  We never do so.  We speak the truth, the whole truth, because what happened is deplorable, and it's for that reason that if we are to struggle and show the reconciliation of Rwandans, we must speak the truth so that we know where to lay the blame.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, try to be brief in your responses.  I have two more questions for you.  In the prison that you are, did you meet people very near Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, who were close to him, and who asked you to testify in his favour?
A.	You mean people from abroad, or people in the same prison as myself?
(Pages 28 to 33 by Regina Limula)





























	1100H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, people in the same prison ask yourself, all the detainees; didn't they ask you to lie in favour of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Nobody, sir.  We are here speaking the truth about crimes that we personally committed.  Nobody close to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi approached me in that respect, and even if they did, I wouldn't accept.  There are many people that were compelled to plead guilty, but I personally can never be coerced into doing anything.
Q.	In the prisons in which you are, are there Hutu groups that help one another to lie before national or international jurisdictions, and are you not one of the members of those groups?
A.	I don't know of the existence of such groups.  All I know is that each and every one speaks out his or her own truth as he or her -- she knows it.  If there are any people who are lying, other people will challenge them. 
Q.	Isn't it correct that among the detainees that confessed some are trying to help or are trying to encourage their friends also to confess; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct, it does happen.  We had meetings like the ones we had in gacaca per secteur, per cellule, and people talked about what happened in the cellules, the crimes that were committed, who committed them.  They gave the names of the accomplices and everything is said.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. BESNIER:
No further questions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then have the morning break and then the cross-examination thereafter.
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1121H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Cross-examination, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, we have a practical problem.  We don't have the French court reporter.  I don't know how much -- what the implication that has for --
MR. PRESIDENT:
She is indispensable. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Indispensable; indispensable; okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will now be cross-examined by the Prosecution. 


CROSS-EXAMINATION
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Hello again, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning.
Q.	I am going to ask you some questions in relation to your testimony this morning.  Mr. Witness, you have testified to your involvement in the killing of some Tutsis in the Kibuye pr復ecture in 1994, have you not, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Amongst the victims of your crimes, do you recall being involved in the killing of a man by the name Higiro, Simeon; H-I-G-I-R-O, Simon?
A.	I do not know Higiro.
Q.	Do you recall being involved in the killing of the child of Rwabyuma.  R-A- - R-W-A-B-Y-A --
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, let's talk about the -- Higiro, Simon.  You have testified that you don't recall being involved in that crime.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm going to ask that the registry show you a document.  And I want him to be shown the confession statement of a man called Seyeze, Ezechias.  
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you know that person, sir?  Just the first document.  Excuse me, sir. 
A.	Yes, I know him. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I am having the documents which you have before you shown to the witness.  The front document, which has 61 written at the right-hand corner of it, is the original Kinyarwanda confession, and then there's a French translation.  Again, we were unable to get an English translation to this document in time for this hearing.  That's the document I refer to, and we all have it.  
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Sir, do you know the man by the name Seyeze, Ezechias, please? 
A.	I know him.
Q.	How do you know this man, sir?
A.	He lives in Gasharu commune in Gitesi secteur.
Q.	Did you participate in any crimes with this man, sir?
A.	Yes, sir.  Yes, in front of his house, in front of one man known as -- in front of Kanyoni's house.  That man was known as Kanyoni; it was in front of his house.
Q.	And when you say "in front of his house", who do you refer to, sir?
A.	Actually, I'm talking about Seyeze's house, in front of Seyeze's house.  That killing took place in front of his house.
Q.	Did Seyeze take part in that killing, sir, to the best of your knowledge, sir?
A.	Yes, a major role.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Killing of whom, Mr.Witness?
THE WITNESS:
We are talking about Kanyoni.  He's the one who brought Kanyoni.  He had found him in a beans field.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can we have Kanyoni spelled for the record, please?
THE KINYAWRANDA INTERPRETER:
Kanyoni is spelt K-A-N-Y-O-N-I; Kanyoni.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, in the confession that I have asked to be placed before you, Mr. Witness, Seyeze, Ezechias, confessed to you being a collaborator or an accomplice in the killing of a man called Higiro, Simon.  Do you see that on the first page, sir?  The second page in Kinyarwanda, the second, if you look at -- can you see that, sir, on page 64?  Turn three pages in Kinyarwanda to the fourth page and you see your name at the top of the page, sir.  

If the registry can assist the witness, I'll be grateful.  Turn him to the page -- the page that has 64 on it in the bundle with him.
A.	I don't think I have that document here before me.  I was given Ndabukiye's document.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you please stay with him, sir?  He needs your help. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	You see that on page 64 your name is mentioned there? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Okay.  Now, let's turn now to page 63, the page before that, sir, in Kinyarwanda.  You see the name of the victim there, sir; do you?
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Now, do you understand --
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you understand that to mean that Seyeze is accusing you of being an accomplice in the killing of that person, sir?
A.	Yes, I can see that, but the problem is to determine whether Kanyoni is a nickname.  The circumstances that he is referring to are the same, but I recall that that person was called Kanyoni and that's why I'm saying that I did not participate in Simeon Higiro's death.  I do not know whom he is referring to, who he is talking about.  I must know whether that person was called Simon Higiro.  The person whom he is referring to and who was killed or who died at Gasharu, I don't know.  I don't know who he was; I killed many people, I wouldn't know his name.  Sometimes the person may have written the nickname without knowing other names, so it's possible that Simon, Simeon -- Simon Higiro and Kanyoni would be one in the same person; it is possible. 
Q.	I am grateful for that, sir.  

Now, can you help me?  Does the man Seyeze, Ezechias, have any relationship with the Accused person in this case, to your knowledge, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what is that relationship, to your knowledge?
A.	I don't know what the exact relationship is; maybe they are brothers.
Q.	Are you speculating?  Are you saying you are not sure, or you don't know, sir?
A.	They have their sister who lives on their land, on their property.  I was going to school and I didn't know everybody, nor the relationships that existed between them, but I know that their family relationship is very close.
Q.	Sir, if you -- do you recall the people who were present during the incident of Simon Higiro's death, who you say may be or may not be the same person with the nickname?  Do you recall those who witnessed this crime, sir?
A.	Yes, there were other people with me.  For instance, there was a soldier known as Boniface Mgabo.  There was another person, and it was very early in the morning.  There was a man known as Uwimana; I don't know his first name.  There was Uwimana, yes. 
Q.	Sir, can you turn with me to the page -- after the page that has your name on it in that document that you referred to?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And if the registry can just ensure he is doing the right thing; he should only have one document with him at the one date.  I am talking about page 65, on the right-hand corner. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see the first name there, sir, and before that name is --
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	-- were they witnesses to the crime?  Do you see that name, sir?  Don't read it out, please, just tell me if you see it. 
A.	Yes, I can see the name.
Q.	Do you confirm that person was a witness to that crime, sir?
A.	I can see names, but these names don't mean much to me.  Unless these people come to -- come here, then I would be able to say that person or the other was there.  Maybe they were there before I got there.  I see that these are women's names.  Maybe they saw me, and they fled when I got there.  I cannot deny that they may have seen me.  It is possible that these people saw me, and I don't see any problem with them mentioning my name because I did commit the crime.
Q.	Witness, I know you are very proud of your activities in 1994, but can you just limit your answers, please, to the questions that I ask you.  Can we do that?  Can we just do that, please?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Now, look at the third name on that page, please.  It is numbered 1, 2, and 3, the third name there.  Please don't mention the name; same page, same page, the third name.  Do you know that person or do you recall that person being a witness during the killing of Higiro, Simon, name number three; and look at the father's name as well.  This person is related to Sim -- Cyprien Karegeya, and it tells you the relationship there on that page.  

Don't mention the person's name, but just tell me, do you recall whether or not that person was a witness to the killing of Simon Higiro, since you participated?  Help me with that, sir?
A.	It's possible that this child was in the location, and this is why I am saying that if the child was not very far away, maybe she was able to have seen me.  Maybe she could have seen me without me seeing her.
Q.	It is actually the person who confesses to that crime that has pointed out this person's name as a witness to his crime, isn't it?  Ezechias Seyeze, and he says that you are an accomplice; is that not so, sir?  Can you say yes or no?
A.	I have made a confession, but I was not able to know who the witnesses to my crime were.  I was able to give the names of the co-perpetrators, yes, and that was by chance, because the truth will come out as nothing will be able to be hidden.  And since Seyeze was their neighbour, it's obvious that they knew him, and he's the one who is going to help you and I and the Tribunal, to remember the names of those who were present.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you see that lady there when the crime was committed?  That question can be answered with a yes or a no.  Did you see her yourself?
THE WITNESS:
No, I didn't see her.
THE PRESIDENT:
Do you know whether she was there, even if you didn't see her?  That can also be answered with a yes or no.
THE WITNESS:
I do not believe that person was there, no; I don't think so.  And I knew her; I knew her.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for answering that question.  

Now, in relation to the killing of the child of Rwabyuma, which you say you recall, do you remember the people who witnessed that crime?  And can --
A.	Yes, I remember those people.
(Pages 34 to 39 by Judith Baverstock)



































	1140H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Q.	Can you tell me who those people were, who were present when you -- when you were involved in the killing of Rwayumba's child?
A.	There was Jo泄 Ndabukiye, one lady known as Madeleine Hitiyaremye.  There was another known as Sendiragora and I think there was also Boniface Mgabo.  Those are the people I remember having seen at the location during the crime.
Q.	Before I ask you my next question, can we have those names spelt into the record please.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Ndabukiye is spelt N-D-A-B-U-K-I-Y-E; Hitiyaremye is spelt H-I-T-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E; Hitiyaremye; Sendiragora is spelt S-E-N-D-I-R-A-G-O-R-A; Mgabo is spelt M-G-A-B-O.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:  
Q.	Witness, were these accomplices or were they witnesses to the crime?  Can you make that distinction for us, please, these names which you have just given us?
A.	No, no, these were co-perpetrators.
Q.	So what about the witnesses, the people who witnessed the killing; do you recall who any of them may have been, sir, the witnesses?
A.	I only remember one person, a girl.
Q.	Who is she, sir?
A.	Do you want her name?
Q.	Yes, please, sir.
A.	Her name was Julienne Mukamana.
Q.	And is that name contained in the document the confession of Jo泄 Ndabukiye that I have just asked to be placed before you, sir, on page 74?  Make sure he has -- it is the fourth page in the Kinyarwanda, the fifth page, the fifth page in the Kinyarwanda.  Is that name there, sir?  Is it the top name?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, I want you to look at the third name, the third name on that list, the name Sibomana.  Do you know -- do you recall who that person was?  Could you tell us if it was a man or woman, one of the witnesses that Jo泄 said witnessed described?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Do you recall, sir?  If not, just say so.
A.	All these people don't live very from the place where we killed that child.  It's a place from where one can observe the place very easily, the site of -- the scene of the crime.
Q.	But you still haven't answered my question in relation to Sibomana.  Do you recall who he was or don't you, sir?  Can we just cross that bridge first sir?
A.	He was a simple citizen who had -- who had come to live in Gasharu cellule, but he was not a native of that place.
Q.	Can you describe his age to me?  Was he young, was he middle-aged, was he an old man?  Can you help me with that, sir?
A.	He was a man more than 40 years old and he had children in primary school.
Q.	And you knew this man before the events of 1994, did you, sir?
A.	Yes, I knew him very well.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Registry.  You can sit down now, and if you can take the document away from the witness.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I now want to ask you questions in relation to the killing of Mukantabana, Thacianne.  Do you understand that, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Is it your testimony, sir, that you were involved in the attack on this lady and her child or children, sir?
A.	I am amongst the people who killed them.
Q.	Had this woman and her child offended you, sir?
A.	No.  It's like the other people who had been killed; these people had done nothing to me.
Q.	Were you arrested in relation to her death, sir?
A.	No.
Q.	Witness, who else was involved, apart from yourself, in the killings that you were involved in, in 1994?  Was Jo泄 Ndabukiye involved with you, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, prior to the genocide of 1994, Mr. Witness, what was your profession, sir?
A.	I was a farmer, but before that in 1988 when I was in secondary school, I left secondary school in 1990 and I came to remain at home.  And when the war began I was a farmer.  I had just spent four years in that profession of farmer or cultivator.
Q.	And Jo泄 Ndabukiye, sir, before the genocide of 1994, can you tell me what he did for a living, sir?
A.	He was headmaster of a primary school.
Q.	Was Seyeze Ezechias involved in the killings with you at this time, sir?
A.	I accused him of having participated in the crimes concerning Simon Higiro, the one you referred to as Sakanyoni.  I am the one who accused him, and he confessed.
Q.	Do you know what profession or job he did, sir, before the genocide, this man Seyeze Ezechias, sir?
A.	He was a cultivator also, a farmer.
Q.	Sir, have you confessed your crimes before the courts in Rwanda, sir?
A.	From the 30th of December 1994, the day on which I was arrested, until today, I have confessed to that crime.  I have requested the forgiveness of Rwandans, the international community, as well as the victims and their families. 
Q.	And would I be correct in saying, sir that you would have confessed to killing at least -- maybe I should ask you, Mr. Witness. How many people have you confessed to killing, sir?
A.	They are very many, more than 20 people that I killed or in whose deaths I was involved.  But if there was a particular location, I was responsible for having killed six people.  So I myself must confess to having participated in a crime during which these six people died, and I needed to denounce those who participated in the killings, because we formed a single group of evildoers, people who participated in that crime, even if I had only killed two people out of the six.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that Mukantabana and her children or child, as you say, had been hiding in the home of Jo泄 Ndabukiye before her death, sir?
A.	Yes, that's where she was hiding.
Q.	How was it that Joel then decided to betray her and subsequently became involved in her death, sir?  Can you help me with that?
A.	No, Jo泄 didn't participate in the killing of that woman, but as I have already told you, I asked the gendarme to tell me how he had found the woman, and he told me, "You were unable to find her, so I can't reveal to you my secret how I work."  And until today I do not know who told the gendarme that this woman was hiding in Ndabukiye -- Jo泄 Ndabukiye's house.
Q.	Pardon me, Witness, for that error.  So is it your testimony that Jo泄 Ndabukiye was involved in some killings with you but not in the killing of Thacianne?  Is that your testimony, sir?
A.	No, he didn't play any role in Thacianne's killing, no role whatsoever.
Q.	The man --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That again, who did not play any role, Mr. Witness, in her death?  Who did not play any role, did you say just now, in her death?
THE WITNESS:
I am speaking about Jo泄 Ndabukiye, in other words, the person in whose house the woman was hiding.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you also testified about the events that led to the death of Cyprien Karegeya.  Do you recall telling us about that?  Do you recall that, sir?
A.	I haven't yet told you how he was killed.  I don't know who his killers were, but I know where they came from, and this was told to me by Karara Augustin.
Q.	I see.  Now talking about Karara Augustin, do you recall whether or not he was a witness to any of the crimes that you committed, sir, and if so, which one?
A.	I was living with that person together with other people who were living at Gitaka.  And when we brought her, he was a witness, he was looking on.  All the people who were living in Gasharu, anyone who you would ask questions about me would tell you the truth, and he cannot have been unaware of what happened in his cellule and the crimes that were committed in his cellule, and he must have been a witness because he was there.
	(Pages 40 to 43 by Petrus Chijarira)




































1200H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Did Karara Augustin, to your mind, hold any official position in the local administration in Gasharu during the genocide, sir?
A.	I think he was a responsable.  If not, he must have been a member of the cellule committee in 1994, during the period of the events.
Q.	And what, to your knowledge, very, very briefly, would be the duties of the responsable de cellule or a member of the committee at the time, if you know?
A.	Those were people who were responsible for solving problems arising between the inhabitants, and when they failed to do so, they referred the problem to the secteur.  Furthermore, they are responsible for the development of the cellule by involving the population in the implementation of development projects. 
Q.	So if crimes were committed in Gasharu cellule, would it have been the functions of the responsable to report them to the conseiller or would it not?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you then help us with this:  how was it, then, that this person, this responsable, was then aware of your crimes and did not prevent them, sir, or report them?
A.	It's true that if there are attackers who attack a cellule, the responsable should refer the matter to the higher authorities, but I described to you what we were like.  Some authorities could do nothing against us.  We could even attack them.  Now, without even talking about the responsable, even the conseiller couldn't approach these people who were killing.  They could do nothing, they could say nothing.  For instance, Karara; there were young people who came to destroy houses in Gitaka, and when he tried to stop them they wanted to kill -- to beat him, and I told you that he was my neighbour, so they made him pay a fine of 30 litres of beer.  So people became afraid, and the authorities remained silent in the face of all these crimes because they were afraid. 
Q.	How then was it, Mr. Witness, that Ndindabahizi was able to order Karara's arrest, as you say, in the month of June?  Can you explain that for me, please, in the light of your --
A.	What I know is that these young men who were with me during the attacks told me he came, he arrested Karara and put him in jail, and that he put him in jail because he suspected that he killed. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, if, according to you, none of the authorities could stop the killings at the time, how then did the killings stop, or did they go on forever, sir?
A.	I think that the killings stopped when the soldiers on the front line realised that they had lost the war.  They fled and we members of the population fled.  In fact, we perpetrated these killings in a record time.  We had virtually finished in the month of May.  There were a few survivors, and, to tell you the truth, when we left the country, when we fled the country there was no one else to be killed.  And they told us something which I'll tell you.  When the French came, someone came and told us, "Be careful.  These French have sophisticated equipment which can track down criminals".  So we got afraid and -- we got afraid and we stopped committing the crimes.  There were some survivors who passed in front of us and we left them alone because we thought the French were going to track us down.  And that is how the killings stopped. 
Q.	And it is your testimony that you never saw with your eyes Emmanuel Ndindabahizi throughout the genocide in Kibuye, sir?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In your statement dated the 7th of October 2002 to my learned friends for the Defence, you mention six names who you describe as people who had accompanied you -- in other words, accomplices -- during the killings.  Do you recall doing that, sir?
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Do you recall if you mentioned all six people in your confession statement to the Rwandese authorities, or did you just mention some of them?  Did you mention all of them, as you have done here, in your confession?
A.	My case file is very voluminous.  Possibly all the names have been mentioned.  If I were with someone in a certain place it is possible that I went with him to commit another crime, but when they were asking us the questions they asked us to list the names that we remember, and they told us that later on if we remembered some other names, we should come and add them.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the registry show the witness a copy of his confessional statement in Kinyarwanda, please.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm having them hand over to you -- can I see it; yes, correct -- the voluminous document that you have described in Kinyarwandan.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And it is the last document I am going to refer to, Your Honour.  It has got his name in front of it and it has got a French translation as well.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you see the document that I have had placed in front of you?
A.	Yes, I have the document.
Q.	Do you recognise it as a copy of your file before the prosecutor in Kibuye?
A.	Yes, that indeed is my case file. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I want you to -- with the help of the registry, I want you to turn to -- it is all numbered -- if you turn to page 22 of that document, the Kinyarwanda document, and the name under 5 which in the French translation can be found on page 19, No. 5 as well on page 19 of the French.  You see that name there, Kampira Deboura; do you see that?
A.	Yes, I can see that name. 
Q.	Do you know that person, sir?
A.	Yes, I know this person. 
Q.	You have described her as having witnessed some of the crimes that you committed, have you not, sir?
A.	Yes.  Regarding Kampira Deboura, she knows the crime I committed against her because I killed her son, I can no longer remember his name. 
Q.	That is indeed correct, sir.  Now, can you turn with me to page 27 of that document, and can the registry assist him; 27 of the handwritten document, and I will try and find it in French.  I think in French it is on page 22 and 23.  The name against No. 20 in that document is the name Nkurunziza Jo泄, N-K-U-R-U-N-Z-I-Z-A, Jo泄.  Do you recall that?  Do you see that, sir?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Again you have described this person as being a witness to some of your crimes.  Do you recall saying that, sir?
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Now, on 21 you also describe the spouse of Jo泄 Nkurunziza as being a witness to some of your crimes.  Do you see that, sir?  Just look under Jo泄's name, and you see the other entry there?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, which crimes or crime did Jo泄 and his spouse witness, sir?  Can you help me with that?
A.	They witnessed the killing of two children of Nyirahembe and the killing of an old woman whose name I cannot recall.  So, it is the killing of two children of Nyirahembe and an old woman. 
Q.	Nyirahembe is spelt how for the record, please?
A.	Nyirahembe is N-Y-I-R-A-H-E-M-B-E.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you in addition refer to an old man or an old woman? 
THE WITNESS:
No, an old woman who sought refuge in Nyirahembe's house.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know -- in your confessional statement you describe one of your accomplices by the name Sendiragora Uwimana?
A.	Yes, I collaborated a lot with this person, and I know him.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is on page 16 of the handwritten Kinyarwanda document and on page 13 of the French.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell me if this man Sendiragora has any relationship with the accused person in this case, and, if so, can you tell me what that relationship is, sir?
A.	I do not know the relationship between the two.  I don't even know where this person comes from.  I know he is a young boy who was keeping cattle in the area.  I don't know any relationship between him and the Accused in this case. 
Q.	Finally, Mr. Witness --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Registry, that is enough for that document.  Can I have the document back.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Finally, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether or not the prosecutor in Kibuye accepted your confession?
A.	I do not have the confirmation.  After I sent my confession, the Prosecutor received them, but then he was transferred.  Following that, I sought to find out what had happened to my case, and lately after people were invited to participate in a meeting to be told about what should be done in the country, I raised the question as to what had happened to my case file.  I was told to refer the query to the prosecutor's office and that my case file was still with them.
Q.	Indeed there is a notation on your confessional file which indicates that the prosecutor has accepted your confession and has categorised the crimes in this confession under the first category.  Does that surprise you, sir?  That is on --
A.	There is no problem with that.  In my confession -- in my confessions I wanted to bring out the things that we had done.  I have committed a lot of crimes.  That is why I cannot but plead guilty.  I wanted to ask for forgiveness, and I find it necessary -- I find it normal that I'm classified in the -- in category 1.  I have committed a lot of crimes. 
Q.	Your killings were operated in units, following your testimony; that's what you say.  Is it possible for someone who was not in your unit of attackers to be involved in a particular area, or how were those units arranged?  How did you operate?
A.	We could start with our cellule, form a group of ten persons, leave the cellule, and when we get to another cellule we are told, "There's a person hiding in such-and-such a person's house".  In our group we would take a decision to go, and after killing that person we could go to another cellule and that we might meet another group which would tell us that there's another -- "There's somebody hiding in X or Y's house", then we go after this person.  That is how we used to operate. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for answering my questions. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions, Your Honour. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have to enter the documents as Prosecution exhibits.  The first one is the first one I used, Seyeze Ezechias, which would be the next exhibit.  Can the registry help me with the numbers, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 37, says the registry.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
37A, and B for the French, and when we get the English I would have that as C.  The next one will be Jo泄 Ndabukiye's, which will be P. 38A, B and C.  Then the final one will be the one for this witness, which will be P. 39A, B, and C when we get the English translation.  I am grateful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I lost you there.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The first one was No. 61?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The one that has 61, yes, on it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That is P. 37A and B, and C later on.
MR  ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
(Exhibit P. 37A, P. 37B and P. 37C admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the next one?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The next one is the one that has 70 on it, starts 70 on the end.  Ndabukiye.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Did you use that one? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I did.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So that will be P. 38.
(Exhibit P. 38A, P. 38B and P. 38C admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And then the one -- the bulky one, which is the one for this witness, will be P. 39.  In that order.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we will place all three of them under seal. 

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.
(Exhibit P. 39A, P. 39B and P. 39C admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Re-examination? 
MR. BESNIER:
Just one or two questions, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, do you recall that the Prosecutor asked you a question on the killing of the child of Rwabyuma?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you admitted having committed that crime?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The Prosecutor referred to witnesses who witnessed that killing, and as witness you mentioned Mukamana Julien.  Do you remember that?
A.	Yes, I said so.
Q.	And then the Prosecutor referred to one Sibomana.  You did say that he lived in the neighbourhood, in the region; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	During the killing of the children was Sibomana present?  Did you see him?
A.	Since I was with Ndabukiye, Ndabukiye was mentioning the names of these persons.  I am sure that I saw Mukamana Julien, he came from Kirambo to hide in that locality.  But regarding Sibomana and the other name that I saw, it was -- the crime site is close to the house, it is possible that they were there.  And I brought out this child from a banana plantation, everyone could see us, and I see that what these witnesses are saying is -- is true. 
Q.	Witness, the question is simple; you can give a yes or no answer.  Did you, yourself, see Sibomana at that time?
A.	During that crime, I did not see him. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. BESNIER:
Does the witness still have the Prosecution exhibit that is the confession, that is the bulky document? 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, do you now have that document?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Page 1, that indeed is your name on that page?
A.	Yes.  I can see that. 
Q.	Do you recall the date on which you made that confession?
A.	No, I have no clear recollection of that, but I believe it must have been last year.  This document was put together last year.  At the very beginning when I wrote down my confessions, this was in 1994; that I remember.
Q.	This document that you have in front of you, was it written based on your confessions of 1994?
A.	In 1994 I was arrested by soldiers.  The genocide survivors pointed me out and said he's -- that I am a criminal.  That is how I was arrested.  I was detained in the Gitarama prison, where I stayed for four years.  When I got to Gisovu I felt it necessary to plead guilty and to make my confessions.  That is when I started drafting my confessions.  I think what is contained in this document reflects what I did, but it was later on, when I did some soul-searching based on the questions that I asked myself, I decided to confess. 
Q.	Very well.  Can you please move on to page 8 of that document in Kinyarwanda, that is the figure which is at the top right-hand side of the document.  Are you with me, Witness?
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	Can you read out the name against the entry No. 24 on that page?
A.	Mukantabana, Thacianne. 
Q.	Would that mean that before you came to this courtroom, Witness, that you had confessed to the killing of Mukantabana Thacianne?
A.	Yes, that is the person that I killed.  He is among one of my -- he is among my first victims. 
Q.	Very well.  Do you know Nzaminduga -- Nzajyinduga?
A.	I know Nzajyinduga.
Q.	Is there a relationship between the children that we referred to a while ago and Nzajyinduga?
A.	These are the grandchildren of Nzajyinduga.
Q.	Do you know if there is any blood relationship between the children of Nzajyinduga and Ndindabahizi?
A.	No, she is an old woman, and I wouldn't know of any relationship between her and the Accused. 
Q.	Very well.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Witness.  No further questions. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, what did Karara tell you about the killing of Karegeya? 
THE WITNESS:
As I explained earlier on, soon upon my arrival at Gitaka they was drinking beer in Gitan's beer bar.  When I got there he was sad and told me that "They've killed my friend.  It's over".  The question I asked him was to know who the killers were.  He answered that it was not necessary to answer that question, that he was killed by people who came from Buye.  That is what I know about the death of Karegeya.  He was killed by people who came from Buye. 

JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it your testimony that no Tutsi were killed at the roadblock at Gitaka?
THE WITNESS:
No Tutsi was killed there.  The people that were killed there came from other hills, and they were going by and they went by and were killed elsewhere.  For example, the woman I talked about did go through there.  She was going to Ruhara's, Pascal Ruhara's, and upon her return she also went through there, that location.  We did not arrest anybody at that roadblock. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
How long were you at this roadblock?
THE WITNESS:
I was not there for a long time at that roadblock.  I wouldn't say that I was all the time at that roadblock.  People were brought and went through in our presence.  So far as I was concerned, I went through when I was on the way for an attack, and I came back only for a drink. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
And you said attackers came from Rubanga, Rutsiro and Ruragwe, and you were told that you had done nothing and that is how the killing started.  Who told -- who were telling you that nothing had been done in order for you to start the killings? 
THE WITNESS:
Among the people who came there were people who were usually called Abakiga.  We were scared of those people; they had intimidated us.  Some people had taken refuge at Kirambo, and those people, the Abakiga, came to kill them and threaten -- and to retaliate against us if we did not take part in the massacres.  I can't tell you the names of these Abakiga.  They went through and went to Bisesero and elsewhere.  So far as we were concerned, we stayed in our given location. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you went to kill Mukantabana, a schoolteacher; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE KHAN:
You said after giving the two blows you went away.  You left her and you went away to kill other persons.  Why didn't you finish her finally?   
THE WITNESS:
I did so because that man who was also called or known as Nyankiko wanted to confront the person that had taken Mukantabana, and when I saw that I came to help, and the woman was finished off by other people who were around.
(Pages 44 to 51 by Trish Greig)

	1230H
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This person, Nyankiko, who was killed after your blows concerning Tatiana, what was his first name?  

We are waiting for the translation of Zacharia.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's Nyankiko, Zacharia.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Rwasibo, do you know that name? 
THE WITNESS:
	I know him.  That was Rwasibo, Augustine.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in any particular killing, to your knowledge? 
THE WITNESS:
	Indeed we worked together in several places.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in the killing of Tatiana? 
THE WITNESS:
	Perhaps he stayed in Gitaka, but among the people that I remember, I can only remember six persons, so that was a sizeable attack.  Now, what I did was that I tried to observe people, I tried to remember people who took part in the attack.  If I knew that he participated in the attack I would have said so.  Perhaps he was in Gitaka but that he didn't come to the location at which we were and at which we killed the people that I talked about.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Rwasibo involved in the killing of Karegeya, to your knowledge? 
THE WITNESS:
	I believe that Rwasibo is from Kayenzi.  People could move from one secteur to the other for attacks.  If somebody mentioned him as having been in Buye, perhaps he was there.  As I said, and as Karara told me, those who killed him came from Buye.  I don't know how he got to Buye, perhaps he was one of the killers.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not know; isn't that the situation, Mr. Witness?  You do not know whether he was involved in the Karegeya event?  That's your explanation, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
	I don't know.  I could have confirmed it if I were there at the killing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know someone called Emmanuel Ndabakuye -- Emmanuel Ndabakiye? 
THE WITNESS:
	I do not know that name, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you name -- you know the name Joel Ndabukiye but not the name Emmanuel Ndabukuye.  Am I right now? 
THE WITNESS:
	I rather know the name of his son, that is Emmanuel.  I know the one called Ndabukiye, Joel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know Joel Ndabukiye.  Have you ever heard of anyone called Emmanuel Ndabukuye -- Ndabukiye.
THE WITNESS:
	No sir.  In our area we only had one Ndabukiye and that was Joel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which area was that -- no, you don't have to answer that question.  

Now, do you know anyone called Appollinaire Bugisiga? 
THE WITNESS:
	I do know him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is that? 
THE WITNESS:
	He was a farmer.  He was a farmer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he involved in the killing of Tatiana? 
THE WITNESS:
	No, sir, I didn't see him at the place Tatiana was killed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, we have -- we have now --
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- come to the end of your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to testify before the Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home, and please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
	I thank you, Mr. President, and Your Honours.
	(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the Registry could assist us and then bring in the next witness.  At least we can start with that witness, I think.   That's DR, is it? 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
	Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You would be referred to as Witness DR in these proceedings.  Do you have a piece of paper in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I see a document in front of me, and I see on this document the letters DR.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you also see your signature there? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I see my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that mean that the information in that document is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That brings us to Defence Exhibit 39, under seal.
	 (Exhibit No. D. 39 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will now be asked questions by the Defence, Mr. Witness.  

The Registry will first make sure that you undertake to tell the truth and will administer the solemn declaration. 
	(Declaration made by Witness DR in Kinyarwanda)




WITNESS DR,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MAR큐IS:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.  We are just entering the afternoon.  Good afternoon as we enter the afternoon.  

Could you tell us your commune, your secteur and your native cellule?
A.	I'm from the Kibuye pr復ecture, Gitesi commune, and Gitarama secteur, Kigesi cellule.
Q.	At this time where do you live?
A.	I live at the same place that I have just indicated.
Q.	More precisely, do you presently live in Rwanda?
A.	At present I am in detention at the Gisovu prison, sir.
Q.	Which is your ethnic group?
A.	I am Hutu, sir.
Q.	At what date would you place the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	President Habyarimana died on the 6th, but I only learnt about it in the morning of the 7th.
Q.	Which month, which year?
A.	It was the month of April 1994, sir.
Q.	What happened in the days following the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	In a very few number of days after the death of President Habyarimana nothing much happened in my area, but at about the 12th, I saw many Tutsi taking refuge in Kibuye from Mabanza.
Q.	What did you yourself do in April 1994?
A.	In April 1994, after the days I have just said, I lost my brother-in-law who used to live in Ruhengeri and I was not able to go to Ruhengeri, but later on I was able to go to Ruhengeri.  And when I came back  I realised that the people that had taken refuge at the stadium had died and those that had taken refuge in the church were also killed.  There were dead bodies almost everywhere.
Q.	You went back home after the burial of your brother-in-law.  At what date was that, approximately?
A.	I do not clearly remember the date, but it was between the 20th and the 25th of April 1994, sir.
Q.	Could you say as from the end of April 1994 and May -- April and May 1994 what you were doing in terms of activities?
A.	At the end of April and during the month of May, I stayed at home; I did not go anywhere.  But at the end of May, a roadblock was set up in our area and myself, just as anybody else, was asked to take part in the manning of that roadblock until such a time as the French arrived and after they had said that they were going to ensure security.
Q.	When were you arrested, Witness?
A.	I was arrested on the 9th February 1995; the 9th of February 1995.
Q.	Why, to your knowledge, are you still in detention?
A.	I am presumed to have taken part in the genocide, just as the others that are detained along with me.
Q.	Did you plead guilty?
A.	I recognised having been at the roadblock I am being accused of having been at the roadblock.  I am also accused of have a grenade in my possession, which I confessed, but I used the opportunity also to testify on the events that took place at that roadblock.
Q.	Very well, let us come back to the roadblock.  

To your knowledge, when was that roadblock erected; when was it built?
A.	I do not clearly remember the date, but I would say that it was at the end of the month of May or at the beginning of the month of June.
Q.	Could you be more precise as to the precise location of that roadblock?  Where was it erected precisely?
A.	The roadblock was set up in front of the Nyabahanga River bridge.
Q.	Who erected that roadblock?
A.	That roadblock was set up by the conseiller of the Gitarama secteur -- which is my secteur -- Gitarama secteur by the name of Ngerabayeyi, Etienne.  Ngerabayeyi is spelt N-G-I-G-A-B-Y-E-Y-E -- N-G-E-R-A-B-A-Y-E-Y-I.
Q.	You were one of the people manning the roadblock, were you?
A.	That is correct.  I was one of those members of -- one of the groups manning the roadblock.  We were being relayed by another group.
Q.	Now, at the date that roadblock was set up, what was the purpose of the roadblock, to your mind?
A.	The instructions given us by the conseiller who set up that roadblock were given out when I was there.  He asked the -- those in charge of the Kigesi cellule, that is the person called Pierre Damien Nsegureze (phonetic), to look for people of integrity to man that roadblock for the purpose of intercepting Hutu refugees on their way to Cyangugu and Kibuye in their flight from the RPF soldiers.  So that a camp was created in Nyamuyeve (phonetic) to be able to list the names of the people concerned in order to prevent them from getting into Kibuye.  The other reason of the roadblock was of course to monitor the number of people going through the roadblock in vehicles to see whether they have ID cards, and if by any chance the people at the roadblock had any doubts about their identity of such-and-such a person that was believed to a member of the RPF or to be an Inkotanyi, that person was to be arrested and taken to the competent authority.
Q.	What does Inkotanyi mean?
A.	The Inkotanyi were the RPF soldiers that were fighting against the Rwandan Armed Forces during that period.
Q.	As far as you are concerned, you are a member of one of the groups that worked in turn at that roadblock, manning it?
A.	Absolutely true, sir.
Q.	Were you armed?
A.	At the beginning when we used to man that roadblock, it was Bonaventure, Niyikula who was armed with a gun.  The others were armed with machetes, sticks, clubs, but then later on I was given by Bonaventure Niyikula, I received a grenade.  I asked him for the grenade because I needed it, sir.
Q.	We shall come back to the grenade.  So that the arms, the weapons you had were machetes.  Where did the machetes come from?
A.	Well, each one brought a machete from home, because in Rwandan culture each person has a machete at home, and women are not authorised to touch their husband's machete, and the child neither.  The children are not authorised to touch the women's machetes.  A young adolescent would first of all buy a hoe and a machete, so that in our culture the machete is a symbol.  It's a cultural symbol.  Each and everyone does have a machete.
Q.	The other people in the machete -- in the roadblock, were they armed, and if so, with what types of weapons?
A.	They had machetes.  They had clubs, big sticks, sir.

	1300H
BY MR. MAR큐IS:
Q.	Was there any distribution of arms at the roadblock? 
A.	No, sir, no weapons were distributed at the roadblock.  Up to the time the roadblock was dismantled, no weapons were distributed there. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would this be a convenient time to break for the day?
MR. MAR큐IS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because then we could continue on Monday at two o'clock in the afternoon.  Since the military trial is scheduled for the morning on Monday, we will then move on to the afternoon shift in the Ndindabahizi, in the afternoon. 
MR. BESNIER:
Certainly, Mr. President.  Probably this is the right time for me to come up with some information concerning the rest of the proceedings.

I believe we have heard 12 witnesses this week, and next week we could bring in five new witnesses.  But for the week beginning on Monday, the 10th November to the 17th November, we believe that we will not be able to bring in witnesses, Mr. President, the reason being that certain witnesses, for professional reasons, cannot make the trip before the 17th, 17th of November.  These are DD and the expert herself (sic).

You wanted to know yesterday afternoon whether Mr. Ndindabahizi could not appear during the week of the 10th of November before the expert.  We looked into this matter with Mr. Ndindabahizi, and 
	Mr. Ndindabahizi believes that he should not testify before the expert.  I believe that we share his opinion, sir.  There are two reasons for that.  The first reason is that it is a matter of pragmaticism (sic).  We focussed a lot on the witnesses to date.  I was not able to meet my client; I spent most of my time with the witnesses.  Next week I will not be able to meet my client, either, because we will be in the courtroom, and we are not authorised to see them during the weekends.

There is also a reason concerning the structure of the proceedings, and as a matter of logic, he will have to look at the whole structure of the trial and he will have to answer some questions from the experts.  And we also believe that the order of appearance of the witnesses be maintained, and we beg that we continue after the 17th of November, after having heard witnesses next week, so that we'll have a week without witnesses, that is, the week running from the 10th of November.  

	We should like to apologise for this.  It was difficult for us to know that we would work with such speed.  At the time we contacted the witnesses and the experts we didn't have all the information, and we didn't know the tempo at which this court would be working.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the -- thank you for that explanation.  Now, Witness DD would appear here on the 13th, isn't that so?  David-David, arrival on the 13th? 
MR. BESNIER:
On the 13th, sir, so that he will be ready to appear from the 17th, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So he's not arriving early on the 13th, is he, because --
MR. BESNIER:
As a matter of fact, I believe he should be here on the 14th of November.  I should review this with the witness protection section, but I think he will be here on the 14th of November. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Let us simply take note of what you said now and look into this.  There is a matter of planning, not only this trial but also the other trial.  Let's see whether we can sort it out in a way which is practical, and we will come back as soon as possible so that you know what will be the final schedule. 
MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  Have a very nice weekend.

Mr. Witness, you must not now discuss your testimony with anyone.  We will continue with you Monday in the afternoon at two o'clock.

The Court is adjourned.
	(Court adjourned at 1310H)
