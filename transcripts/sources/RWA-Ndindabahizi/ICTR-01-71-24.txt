MR. MARÇAIS:
We will make a small request for a closed session just at the beginning regarding the identity of the witness.  I understand the constraints of the Tribunal.  I will try to move quickly out of the closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But just to make the point that we are now starting a new session.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
	Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness, and will be referred to as Witness DF in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take the solemn declaration.
	(Declaration made by Witness DF in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
So do you want to start with the closed session immediately, Mr. Marçais?
MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, please, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.

So in order to protect your identity, Mr. Witness, we will in a short while be moving to a closed session.  Do you have a document in front of you there? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I see a document before me.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there a signature on the bottom of that document? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your signature? 
THE WITNESS: 
It is my own, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information in the document is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is then Defence Exhibit 44 under seal.  Thank you very much.
	( Exhibit No. D. 44 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the closed session in order to protect your identity, Mr. Witness.  So we will not have any public in the public gallery for the first few minutes.  Here follow now the questions by the Defence to you.
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 21 to 22] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 19 to 20 by Petrus Chijarira)




























MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so from now on we are in an open session.  Be careful with your answers, Mr. Witness, so as not to disclose your identity.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Witness, how did you learn of the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana?
A.	I learned of his death by reading the morning newspaper on the 7th of April 1994.
Q.	In your opinion, what happened in your region after the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I learned of Habyarimana's death when I was in a meeting at Kiranda, a meeting of ministers, of pastors. communiques were being broadcast over the radio, asking people to stay home.  We were compelled to suspend our meeting, and we went home to our respective homes.  Each one had to stay at home.
Q.	Did you stay at home?  Did you stay in Rubengera during the events?
A.	During the entire time of the war, and even after, I stayed in Rubengera.
Q.	Were you still in the same ministry, practising as a pastor?
A.	Indeed, I was still practising up until 1995, when I was transferred to the secondary school of Rubengera.
Q.	Did you leave Rwanda after the RPF took power?
A.	I did not.  After the RPF took power in Rwanda, I remained in Rwanda*****************************
Q.	(No interpretation) ... Witness --
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, can we please strike that last phrase from the record, as it went to the witness's identity?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is so decided, under seal.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Witness, were you ever arrested?
A.	I was, but it was a misunderstanding. Rather unfortunately, *********************************.  Thereafter, I was transferred to Kibuye prison.
Q.	Witness, do you know the people who accused you of the crimes?
A.	I don't know who was accusing me, but the bourgmestre of Mabanza commune sent me a summons through his police brigadier, who was accompanied by a soldier.  They told me that I was being charged, the fact that people had died at my home.
Q.	A few months went by and you spent them in jail, and then you were sent to Kibuye; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  I was in jail for three months.  After that, I was transferred to the prison in Kibuye.
Q.	What allegations were levied against you?
A.	When the investigations began, I was being charged with murder, the murder of five people who had died at my home.
Q.	Did you acknowledge it?
A.	No, I did not acknowledge that.  I always pled not guilty, saying that I played no role whatsoever in any of that.
Q.	What, exactly happened?  What were the facts that led to your incarceration?
A.	I just told you.  It was explained to me that I was being arrested because five young people died at my home.  In fact, they were children who were seeking refuge at my house.  In fact, there were more than five of them.  We hid them in a different house.  One morning, around 15th of April 1994, I saw -- I witnessed an attack.  My house was attacked in the morning.  Someone came to say, "We know that you are hiding Tutsis, and the Tutsis killed Habyarimana.  Now we are going to search your house to look for those people.  If you attempt to resist, or if you're hiding anyone in any rooms in your house we are going to kill you and your family."  The assailants came into the house immediately, then they started to attack.  The children hid in the bathroom in the store.  The assailants broke the doors down.  Some of the kids had left the house.  They were brought outside.  They were brought into the courtyard.  They were brought into the bush just below my house, and they were killed by machete.  I was locked up in one of the rooms in my house, and the assailants told me to give them money.  They took my money.  They took my wallet.  They looted my house, and then they left, and they went to the hilltop in front of my house.  When I went to see what had happened to the children, I observed that they had been killed.
Q.	Did you denounce those facts after the war?
A.	After observing that those people had been killed, I informed the authorities during that time.  But since those authorities had no more power, after the war I went to talk to the new appointed bourgmestre.  He told me, "We learned of this but we conducted investigations, myself and the forces of order.  We have determined that you have played no role whatsoever in the death of these people.  That is why we are not going to summon you."  I think the authorities understood everything.  After that I went home.
Q.	But nevertheless, *************, you were incarcerated?
A.	I informed the authorities in 1994, in around September-October.  It went on to 1995, 1996, I was still director of the school.  One morning, it was the ***********, as I explained before, I was summoned to the communal office.  The bourgmestre told me, "Somebody is accusing you of participating in the death of those young people."   Immediately I was put in the jail, the communal jail.
Q.	Why do you think you were arrested on ********************, thereafter?
A.	Genocide is a very sad thing.  People kill their own, but some people use the genocide as a pretext because they are hateful or jealous and they use it to arrest people.  I think that is one of the reasons for which I was imprisoned.
Q.	You were arrested on ***********.  Were you released thereafter?
A.	I was released, temporarily, ***************, after four years in jail.
Q.	Under which circumstances were you released?
A.	Investigations were conducted.  The Kibuye prosecutor's office conducted an investigation, another one by the gendarmerie, and there was another investigation by the police in Kibuye.  All of those investigations were brought together.  The prosecutor of the republic in Kibuye examined the issues and he determined that there was no tangible proof that would justify the dossier being transferred to a court.
Q.	Did you pay any bail?
A.	No, I did not.  I did not pay any bail.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the bourgmestre who you referred on ************ issued a summons and you were arrested, was that the same bourgmestre who had told you previously, around '94, that he knew your case and that you would not be incarcerated or was it a different bourgmestre?
THE WITNESS:
	It was the same bourgmestre.  That is the bourgmestre I contacted to tell him what happened to me.  He thereafter was the same one to summon me and to imprison me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And who was it on the 13th of December 2000 decided that there was no proof for transfer to the courts?  Who made that decision?
THE WITNESS:
That decision was taken by the Prosecutor of the republic in Kibuye during that time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	When you were provisionally released, could you move about freely?
A.	I could not.  I was free to go anywhere in the country under the condition that each month I had to present myself before the prosecutor's office in Kibuye, and I did that.  But after six months I no longer kept going to the prosecutor's office.
Q.	Now, were you authorised to do that?  Is that why you stopped going?
A.	The prosecutor's office told me the following: "It is no longer necessary to pay money to report to Kibuye.  We know your address very well.  If we need you, we will simply issue a summons; therefore, it is no longer necessary to report to our office."
Q.	Did you appear before a Rwandan criminal court?
A.	I went to the prosecutor's office, but during that year I went twice before the gacaca jurisdictions.
Q.	But you never went before a Rwandan criminal court, but you did go before the gacaca courts; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  I appeared on two occasions before the gacaca courts.
Q.	What happened when you appeared before the gacaca courts?
A.	I was summoned.  I appeared.  There was an assembly.  I was asked questions about the death and burial of the children who died at my home.  I explained my case, and the gacaca court decided that I played no role in those children's deaths, and they told me I was free to go home.
Q.	Do you believe that your innocence is now a matter of fact?
A.	I do not have any document testifying to my innocence, but if I refer to all the investigation carried out and my release, on the basis of my appearance twice the gacacas found me innocent.  Considering that my conscience is clear, I take myself to be innocent.
Q.	Now, do you now know the main author of the crime committed at your house in 1994?
A.	Some of those that were responsible for the crime, I was able to identify them later on, but there's Zachary Ntimareyesen that admitted and pleaded guilty, and he's in prison at Gitarama.  Ntimareyesen is N-T-I-M-A-R-E-Y-E-S-E-N, Ntimareyesen.
Q.	When did you hear about the name you've just said, Ntimareyesen?
A.	I heard this name at around 1999, when the person concerned pleaded guilty, and it was the prosecutor's office who had summoned me to ask whether I had any relationship with that person.
Q.	But you learnt about this name after the person concerned pleaded guilty and pleaded to the crime?
A.	Yes, he had already admitted guilt and had pled guilty and sent a letter in to that effect to the prosecutor of the republic in Kibuye.
Q.	Was he in the same prison as yourself?
A.	Yes.  I (sic) was in the same prison as myself, that is the Kibuye prison, but that person was in a section of the same prison, and I was in a different section of the prison.  Do you know that we are not compelled to be together in the same prison.
Q.	So there were several sections of the prison, and you were in a different section?
A.	Yes, sir, that is correct.  There were several sections in the Kibuye prison where I was.
Q.	So you knew his name only after he pleaded guilty?
A.	Yes, I knew about his name when he pleaded guilty, or after he pleaded guilty.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was it, Mr. Witness, that the gacaca courts decided that you had played no role during that event?
THE WITNESS:
The first time I was summoned by the jurisdiction of gacaca was in April this year.  The other time was in July this year, that is 2003, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was the last announcement made that you were cleared.  Was that in July or some other date?
THE WITNESS:
I was summoned by the gacaca jurisdiction but in different cellules.  Now, the first jurisdiction was in the Kabatara  cellule.  That court found that I was not involved in the death of those children. 

The second cellule to which I was summoned was the Kabanda cellule.  I was questioned as to the circumstances of the burial of the children, and this court found that I was not involved in those events neither.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two courts made their decisions in April and July this year, respectively, is this so?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.  That is correct, Mr. President.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you were declared innocent because the real culprits pleaded guilty?
THE WITNESS:
I believe that on the grounds of all the investigation carried out, additional information may have been made available but they may have used.  What you are saying is one of the grounds to the effect that somebody else was responsible.  He was not alone when he committed that crime.  Moreover he didn't mention names of the persons he was with when the crime was committed, and that he did in writing.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Were the two gacaca courts competent?  Why two?
A.	Indeed, each Tribunal had its own jurisdiction.  I explained that the tribunal that had me come in the month of April was in the Kabatara cellule, so that tribunal covered that territory, that cellule.  As far as the other tribunal was concerned, it was in the Kabanda cellule, which it covered in terms of jurisdiction.  So these were two different jurisdictions.
Q.	Witness, do you know Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I do know Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  We went to the same school, secondary school, and in '64, '65.  Later on, I didn't see much of him even though we were from the same province, that is the Kibuye province, but I heard of him.  I hear he used to work at TRAFIPRO in Kigali, then Electrogaz in Kigali, and then later on in the Ministry of Planning in Kigali as well.  I heard it also said he was the director of the office of the minister, Kagame, of the minister, and then I heard later on that he had become the Minister of Finance in the Ndyambati government in 1994.
Q.	Did you once again see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi during the 1994 events?
A.	During the tragic events in Rwanda, I did not see Mr. Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Now, apart from his activities and functions as Ministry of Finance, did you hear about him playing any special role in these events, that is Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	No, sir, I didn't hear anything concerning him.
Q.	Did you see Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi since the 1994 events?
A.	No, sir, I did not see him any more.  As I explained, I remained in my area, that is the area in which I lived.  As far as he was concerned, he had fled; so that I did not see him any more following the events.
Q.	What remembrance do you have of Ndindabahizi, since you went to school together?  How do you remember him?
A.	Ndindabahizi was a person of good repute, quite convivial with his fellow man and had never shown himself to be discometrie (phonetic) among the people.
Q.	Now, when you were at the Kibuye prison, did you hear any talk about Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I saw co-prisoners from Gitesi that knew him very well as somebody who was a minister.  He was known by many people, so that we often did talk about him, especially from the time we heard talk about the fact that there were negative reports about Ndindabahizi.  We were surprised when we heard about those reports.  It was the fact that any member of that particular government was going to be accused of genocide.  That was what we talked about in the prison.
Q.	Who told you about the investigation carried out concerning Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	Some people were summoned to meet investigators of its national criminal tribunal.  There were, of course, the supervisors that used to tell us about these things; but in particular there was one of the supervisors who had very good relations with the prisoners.  That particular supervisor very often kept us abreast about that question.
Q.	Now, let us come back to the supervisor without naming him.  Could you write down or perhaps I should send you a piece of paper and have you write down the name.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Probably it would be more spontaneous if the witness himself were to write out the name.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	The name and first name, the name and surname. 

Could you tell us the occasion on which you met that supervisor and what he told you?
A.	As I was suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure, the person in charge of the prison had authorised me to go out of the prison building to do some physical exercise, and one day, when I was outside with other prisoners, he talked to us and said that questions had been put to him concerning Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  He told us that lies were said about him and said that somebody had encouraged him, this is to make false testimony.  He mentioned names.  He said that he had mentioned names of people to be killed and distributed weapons.  It was on that occasion that I heard his name.  We were in a group of prisoners in the prison compound.
Q.	Could you tell us approximately the time of your meeting with the prison supervisor?
A.	Several weeks after that meeting, I was released, so that it must of been around November 2002 -- I'm sorry, 2000. 
THE INTERPRETER:
It's the Kinyarwanda interpreters correcting, 2000, October.
MR. PRESIDENT:
November or October?  Can you just repeat the month and the year once more, please, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
It was around the month of November 2000.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Now, first you are concerned -- you said that you had not heard about any abnormal behaviour on the part of Ndindabahizi during events; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I didn't hear any such thing, something that he may have done.  We were rather surprised.  We were rather surprised about the investigation carried out concerning him.
Q.	And, thus, this supervisor suggested that a case might be constituted against Ndindabahizi, in spite of the fact that Ndindabahizi did not do anything?
A.	No, sir.  No, sir.  He simply acknowledged that he testified on his behalf, that is, he did not witness any events, and he said that at the beginning of the tragic events that shrouded the country, he had sought refuge at the home of one Karara and that he had left that house when it was time for him to cross the Kivu river in a canoe with the assistance of Mr. Karara.  It was at that time that he went to Congo.  That was what the supervisor of prisons said.
Q.	In other words the prison supervisor boasted about false testimony?
A.	That is correct.  That is correct.  That is what he said.
THE INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Counsel.  Wait for the person speaking to finish.
THE WITNESS:
He even appeared to say the reasons why he was always saying we were required to do so.  That means that there must have been people -- I trust it's not a secret -- there must have been people, or some survivors, especially those that are in the IBUKA association; there were some of them who tried to concoct allegations against those in charge of the vanquished regime.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	As far as you're concerned, did you have contacts with those investigators?
A.	No, sir.  I did not meet the investigators personally.
Q.	To your knowledge, nobody had any contacts with the investigator; is that correct?
A.	Well, I heard it said that many people were summoned for questioning.
	(Pages 23 to 29 by R. Lear)







	1645H
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	When in November 2001 the prison supervisor talked about the false testimony, did you react or were you able to react?
A.	Well, as a prisoner, one can only keep quiet.  We were surprised, indeed, but we couldn't react otherwise.
Q.	Were you in danger of being punished had you reacted?
A.	Yes, indeed, because the prison supervisor was an authority, in a way, and somehow he could hurt someone if that someone were to challenge -- try to challenge what he said.  Indeed, when one is in prison, one has nothing to say. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
May I move to another subject, Mr. President, after one or two questions.  But before that, probably the piece of paper on which the name is could be tendered as an exhibit, Defence exhibit, 
Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
D. 45, under seal. 
(Exhibit D. 45 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this false testimony by this prison supervisor, was that something -- did he mention any particular -- did this happen at his own initiative or did he indicate any particular persons that influenced him to come up with false testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
He said, "We have been ordered to make accusations against people, but I'm going to speak about things that I did not witness".  So that I deduced that there must have been an invisible force that pressurised people to come and testify in that manner.  They must have been contacted under such circumstances.  This is what I think. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, did the prison supervisor mention any names of persons who were behind this movement of false accusations? 
THE WITNESS:
No, he did not mention any name. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Now, during the events, Witness, you stayed in Rubengera?
A.	Yes, I did stay at Rubengera.
Q.	Now, what was the distance between Kibirizi and Rubengera?
A.	I believe that the distance was one or more kilometres between those two locations.
Q.	Could you be a little bit more precise; one kilometre, one and a half kilometres?
A.	I was saying that it would be more than a kilometre.  Perhaps one and a half kilometres between the two locations.
Q.	What does Kibirizi mean, sir? 
A.	Kibirizi is a commercial centre.  There were market days organised at Kibirizi.  It is a commercial centre.
Q.	Now, during the events, did the centre continue to operate?
A.	Well, during that period nothing was working.  There were roadblocks preventing people from moving around.  Moreover, a communiqué was read out over Radio Rwanda urging people to remain at home, so that the centre was not operational during that period, because for a centre to be operational there must be people.  People should be able to take their commodities to it and other people should be able to go and buy these commodities.  But at that period, the population couldn't move freely to go to the markets and to purchase any goods.  A commercial centre functions because there is security that enables one to trade.   

At that period, had one opened any shop, that shop would have been looted, at any rate.  So that during the period we are talking about, that centre was not operational.  Even the churches were not functioning properly.  People did not go out as usual, and they did not function as usual.
Q.	Now, when that market and that commercial centre -- when did the market and the small commercial centre resume operations?
A.	At around June, Operation Turquoise, that is, Operation Turquoise of the French, came into the area and slowly operations started growing, gradually, and the centre was able to resume their activities, and people were able to come into the market to buy supplies.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, I have ten or so more questions and I will try to finish. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Now, we talked about a meeting, or gatherings, of people, of 10 to 15 people.  Were you ever told of such gatherings in Kibirizi at that time?
A.	No.  At the time of events, it was not possible to have such meetings.  I did not hear of any meetings that may have taken place.
Q.	Did you hear about a visit -- minister's visit to Kibirizi?
A.	No, I did not hear about that.  I think that a government minister is someone who is important in Rwanda.  People respect authorities.  As such, a minister would not have gone to Kibirizi.  If one had gone there, I would have known about it, and, moreover, I heard nothing to that effect.
Q.	If there was a meeting at Kibirizi, would you have known about it?
A.	Yes, no doubt I would have known about any gatherings.  Same goes for a minister's visit.  If a minister comes to a place, the population gathers around to listen to the message given by that person.  Even if I wouldn't have been at any such meeting, I would have known about the presence of such people.
Q.	So as regards Mr. Ndindabahizi, you would have known about such a visit from him?
A.	I would have certainly known.
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, if you heard about the distribution of machetes at Kibirizi centre?
A.	Distribution by whom?  I did not hear of any distribution of anything.  I am surprised by "distribution of machetes" or an alleged one.  Normally in Rwanda, every peasant has a machete in his or her possession.  It is a tool, a farm implement used to cut down banana trees, to cut branches off trees, or to clear brush or to gather firewood.  It's a farm implement that we have lying around at home.  Therefore, I don't see why anyone would go to distribute machetes to people who already have them at home.
Q.	At which date do you place the end of the major massacres in Mabanza?
A.	I would say that the massacres ended towards the end of the month of April 1994.  I say that because there were no more Tutsis around.  In fact, the Tutsis, during the massacres, had taken refuge at the Mabanza communal office.  The bourgmestre during that time knew that the people were coming to kill the refugees, and he asked for gendarme help to ensure the safety of those people taking refuge.  He was told that the gendarmes were in insufficient number to protect the refugees.  The refugees had to leave the commune to go to Kibuye.  They were kept there for several days.  After that they were killed.  The others went to Bisesero.  

But in Mabanza, there were a few Tutsis who were hidden by their friends, and upon the arrival of the French, those Tutsis were put under the protection of the French.  Therefore, the massacres in Mabanza ended towards the end of April.
Q.	Two more questions, Witness.  Would I be correct in saying that if a minister had come to distribute machetes to a gathering of 50 persons, not only would you have known about it, but such an assertion seemed a fantasy to you?
A.	It seems to me that it would be impossible.  Could the minister come alone in a vehicle?  One more thing.  A minister is a man who's educated.  He works on behalf of the people.  He, therefore, cannot distribute machetes.  Because he is such an important person, he wouldn't be someone who would distribute these things.  

Also, I said that every Rwandan has this tool at home.  Therefore, I don't see under which circumstances a minister would distribute machetes.  Thirdly, when a minister moves about, the conseiller de secteur, even when he comes out, many people come to see him.  So when a minister comes, many more will come to see him.  If that had happened during my absence, I certainly later on would have learned about it.  People would have talked about it.
Q.	Last question, Witness.  Can you tell us why you accepted or decided to come to testify on behalf of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	When you hear someone accuse someone of such serious crimes, I couldn't remain silent.  It would be against my principles, against the patriotism that I should respect with regard to my country.  We are asked to tell the truth, to bring about justice, so that the truth may come out about what happened in our country.  I can't remain silent on this issue.  If I have an opportunity to speak, I must; I have a duty to speak about what I heard with my own ears. 
Q.	Are you, therefore, convinced of the innocence of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	I said that Mr. Ndindabahizi played no role in what happened in Rwanda.  I never heard anything about a role he may have played.  I didn't see him do anything. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Thank you, Mr. President, I've finished with my examination-in-chief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We have cross-examination tomorrow, then.  There are two more Defence witnesses in town waiting to testify; is that so? 
MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President, that is correct.  Those are Witnesses DP and DQ.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are they long witnesses or short witnesses? 
MR. BESNIER:
As I mentioned yesterday, we need about one hour and 15 minutes for DP.  It's mostly the Prosecution that conducts long cross-examinations.  That is why we take more time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you made the same estimate for DQ, did you? 
MR. BESNIER:
I had indicated about one hour and a half for DQ, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  All right.  We will see how this develops, then, tomorrow.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness, we will continue your cross-examination tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  

Court is adjourned.
