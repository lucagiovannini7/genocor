MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session now.  May we have the appearances for the parties, starting with the Prosecution.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours, Mr. Kapaya, Ms. Madenga, Ms. Lauriston and Mrs. Kabisinga and myself appear for the Prosecution.  I'm Charles Adeogun-Phillips.  I'm grateful.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the Defence, please.
MR. SONGA:
I am Professor Nyabirungu Mwene Songa, lead counsel for Mika Muhimana.  To my left you have legal assistant Leopold Munderere and to my right you have legal assistance Mathias Sahinkuye.  Good afternoon Madam President.  Afternoon, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before we proceed with the cross-examination business, we may remind you that we are pressed for time.  We have 20 working days for 20 witnesses and the way the things are moving we cannot meet the target.  So, therefore, we would appreciate if the honourable counsel for the parties coordinate their time with their witnesses, so as to enable us to finish the evidence within the requisite period.  We have also decided that from today onward we will sit until 7 p.m.  Thank you.  And furthermore we may request learned counsel for the parties to provide us, the reporters, and the interpreters with a list of proper nouns which they may use in the course of the evidence, proper nouns for each.  Thank you.  

Yes, Professor Songa, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, before I continue with the cross-examination, I would like to submit to you a problem which has just happened now.  It was when I was getting into the Court at 2 p.m. that I was told that the other presentation of the witnesses had been changed.  From the previous documents, we know that after APC, AX, we are to have AX, but we have a document which shows that it is AV.  Madam President we are not ready to counter -- cross-examine AV at this time today.  If we had the information yesterday we would have been able to do so.  This is the problem that faces us, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In fact, we went from yesterday the next witness would be AV and we don't understand why this was not communicated to the Defence counsel.  Mr. Constant. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Madam President, the Court management section failed to provide copies of the information to Defence counsel yesterday.  Immediately after court we could not trace him, so we were able to do so just this afternoon and we are sorry for that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, can you produce Witness AX as your next witness?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
May I just consult about that, Your Honour?

Your Honours, the -- we had some practical difficulties with Witness AX and myself.  AX had complained of some back problems, and that's why we had shifted her to tomorrow.  

Also, I cannot be here on Friday, and because of the pace of proceedings, I wanted to ensure that I wrapped up all my witnesses before I departed on Thursday.  And Witness AV is my only other witness, apart from this witness, for this week.  

Noting Your Honours comments at the beginning of the proceedings, in terms of the timing, my learned colleague says that she is ready to proceed with AX and I'm sure I would be able to take AV by close of business on Thursday.  It's essential that I finish with AV by close of business on Thursday because I'm not here on Friday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So who's your next witness?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So we will take -- in view of my learned friend's complaint -- we'll take AX as originally.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, the next witness would be AX.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.

Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor.
WITNESS AP
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, good afternoon.  When we left yesterday --
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	When we left yesterday, we were referring to what happened on the 7th of April in Muhimana's house.  And I think that I had asked most of the questions that I meant to ask in this regard.  Perhaps I would just have to ask one little question regarding that meeting.  You stated that these meetings were held from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.; is that correct?
A.	This is what I said.  I said that Muhimana, the bourgmestre, was holding meetings above my house in a building which is currently used as a prison.  The meetings were not held in Muhimana's house.  They were held, instead, above my house, and this was before the war.
Q.	Thank you. 

However, in your statement of 30th of August, if I remember correctly, you do state that there were meetings usually held between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did the witness get the question? 
THE WITNESS:
I understood the question.  I told you that these meetings were held above my house in a building which was there, and it was in this building that all government workers met.  The meetings did not take place in Muhimana's house.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I have already heard this answer and I remember it.  However, my question is whether these meetings did indeed take place between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.
A.	Yes, the meetings were held from 2 p.m. up till 6 p.m.  People were in the hall from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Q.	Thank you.  Were you able to see, to observe when these meetings started and when they ended?  Were you, for example, able to note when people were late or to note whether the meeting had extended beyond 6 p.m.?
A.	We used to observe to see what was happening regarding these meetings, because there was a Tutsi person who was Nkundiye who participated in these meetings and who told us what happened at these meetings, and he told us to be careful.  I would like to tell you that Tutsis did not have access to these meetings.
Q.	Let us come back to the meeting of 7th April, Madam Witness.  This meeting -- did this meeting, as the preceding ones, end at 6 p.m.?
A.	This meeting was held in Mika's house.  I cannot know at what time it ended because we were afraid, and we knew that we were going to die.
Q.	Did you know when the meeting started?
A.	Regarding this meeting, I have told you that, from the time when they came to ask me where our cows had been sent and after my arrest, I saw many people entering Mika's residence.  I understood they were going to participate at a meeting.
Q.	At what time was that, Madam Witness?
A.	When they came to ask me questions.  When I was arrested, in fact.  Look, it was because I was afraid I didn't note the time.  But if I were to make a guess, I would say it was between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.
Q.	So we are noting that between nine and ten on the 7th of April you saw people going into Mika's house for a meeting?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Madam Witness, you do not know the time when the meeting ended, however.  Was it already around nightfall or was it still daylight?
A.	For that meeting or regarding night or day I cannot tell you much because I was immediately detained.
Q.	All right.  All right, you were detained in the morning, but at 2 p.m. you were already free, so you were or you should have been able to realise what was happening in the neighbours house.
A.	Between the time when I was released I went back home immediately after I was released.  I was unable to move.
Q.	Very well.  However, Madam Witness, still in your statement, you say that immediately after the meeting of the 7th of April Mika came to your husband's uncle's house, that is who was your neighbour.  When you say "immediately after the meeting."  Is it possible for you not to be able to tell us whether it was day or night?
A.	That is not what I said.  I said that Mika came to the house of my in-laws at around 7 p.m. and it was at that time that he came to my in-laws.  He did not come there at 2 p.m.
Q.	I'll take an extract from your own witness statement, which I believe is dated 30th August.  I shall check.  Yes, indeed, in the statement of 30th August, on the fourth paragraph we read the following.  "The day after the death of the president they met once in Muhimana's house on the 7th of April, Muhimana, Sikubwabo, Ruzindana were present at this meeting which was held in the afternoon."  And you continue, "immediately afterwards he came to the uncle of my husband, who was our neighbour.  He was called Taday Ruhengera (phonetic).  This is what I can read from your statement.  That is why I am asking the question.  Since you state that "immediately after the meeting," then you should be able to tell us whether the meeting ended in the day or in the night?
A.	I didn't take note of what was happening regarding this meeting, but I know that I saw Mika at about 7 p.m. in my father-in-law's house, that is Taday Ruhengera, unless perhaps my statement was not well written down.  But I saw him come to my in-law's house at 7 p.m.
Q.	Thank you, madam. 

First Mika comes to your husband's uncle's house at 7 p.m., but you cannot tell whether it was after the meeting held at Mika's house.  Is that correct?
A.	It was after the meeting because he came to my in-law's house at night around 7 p.m.
Q.	Mika called the daughters of your husband's uncle.  In the statement we have before us, these girls were called Goratee (phonetic) Mukashyaka, who was 21 years old and Languide Kamukina who was 18 years old.  But based on what you said yesterday these are other names.  Can we have any clarification about this, about the identity of these girls and on the discrepancy between the names in the declaration in the statement and the names that were given yesterday?  We would also like to know about the difference in the surnames, as well as the names?
A.	One can make a mistake about names of sisters or brothers if they do not bear the same name.  The daughters that Mika took out of our house were Immaculée Mukashyaka and Languide Kamukina.  I confused their names and the names of their sisters.
Q.	My impression is that the confusion continues.  Since yesterday Immaculée was called Mukakayilro and today you are saying that Immaculée is Mukashyaka.  Don't you think that the confusion continues?
A.	There is Immaculée Mukashyaka and Mukakayilro and Languide Kamukina.  I may have made a mistake about their names because it's a long time ago.  When people are dead you can forget their names, but you always have an image of these people in your head.  This happens often amongst Rwandans; we forget very easily and indeed I am making an effort when I am asked questions about a dead person.  Often I make mistakes.
Q.	Madam Witness, are you now able to give us the final names of these two girls, first names and surnames?
A.	For Languide, she is called Kamukina K-U -- K-A-M-U-K-I-N-A. There is Immaculée, Mukashyaka, M-U-K-A-S-H-Y-A-K-A.
Q.	Can we finally delete Mukakayilro's name?
A.	You can delete Mukakayilro's name because you have Languide Kamukina and Immaculée Mukashyaka.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. What is the composition of the family of your husband's uncle?
A.	Today I am telling you that my declaration was not well taken down.  It was not my husband's uncle, it is my husband's father.  It is my father-in-law.
Q.	We note the correction.  However, you can still answer the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, these two young girls were your sister-in-law, your husband's sister?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were my sisters in-law.  They were the daughters of my husband's uncle.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please repeat?  Are they related to your uncle?
THE WITNESS:
They were the daughters of his paternal uncle.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The uncle of your husband, is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
The house belonged to the paternal uncle of my husband.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, who was the father of Languide, what was his name?

THE WITNESS:
He is called Ruhigira, R-U-H-I-G-I-R-A.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Son of who?
THE WITNESS:
He was the son of Rwabigwi, R-W-A-B-I-G-W-I.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, who was the father of Immaculée?
THE WITNESS:
Ruhigira.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, who was your husband. Sorry.  Who was the father of your husband?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness, you can write down the name of your father-in-law.  Mr. Issa, please, provide the witness with a paper and a pen.

Can you write?
THE WITNESS:
I can no longer write.  I am almost paralysed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we have Kinyarwanda interpreter to come to the witness stand to help us with the name of the father-in-law?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The interpreter is coming, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Interpreter, please ask her about her father-in-law, the name of her father-in-law and write it down on a piece of paper.  And the name of her husband, too.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's done, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, interpreters.

Mr. Songa, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	My question has to do with the age of those two persons.  I need to know the age because it varies from one statement to the other.  We take the statement of the 30th of August of 1999, Mukashyaka was age 21 and Languide was age 18, and yesterday I gather that Mukashyaka was aged 25.  What is the age that we should retain?
A.	You should retain the ages of 21 and 18 because I said that I may have erred yesterday because I was mixing up those persons with her other sister, because the events occurred a long time ago.
Q.	Thank you.  You stated, Witness, that Mika called the two young ladies.  First of all, tell us, how did the visits come about when he came into your compound?  Did you greet anybody?  Did he say anything?  What did he say?
A.	Mika arrived, like any other person visiting us.  I told you he was a family friend.  He asked the mother of those girls where they were.  And she called them, and they answered her call.  And he left with them, as if he wanted to put a question to them.  And when I noticed that they were going far away I followed them.
Q.	You say that he asked the girl's mother where they were.  What was the mother's answer?
A.	She called those girls who came and said good morning to Mika.
Q.	Where were they?
A.	They were behind the house.
Q.	Did Mika say anything?  Did he say anything in terms of greetings or did he request any news or did he say goodbye?
A.	He said nothing further.  All he asked was where the girls were, and they told him they were behind the house.  The girls came out and he went with them.  The girls accompanied him.
Q.	So Mika did not speak to the parents?
A.	No, all he wanted was those two girls.
Q.	And the parents said nothing to Mika?
A.	No, the parents said nothing, but since our houses were opposite one another, the parents asked me to follow them to see where they were going.  As you know, during that period we were not speaking to one another.
Q.	Was your mother -- did Mika know the names of the children?
A.	Yes, he knew their names.
Q.	How do you know?
A.	Mika was our neighbour.
Q.	Did you hear him utter the names of those girls when he came into the compound?
A.	No, I did not hear him utter those names, but I know that he knew their names. Since he was looking for them, he indeed took them away.
Q.	More than once in your statement of the  30th of August 1999, as you did yesterday, you make mention of parents.  At the same time you are ready to correct what you say by saying it was only the mother.  Is it possible for you to tell us why there are all these changes in your statement?
A.	I did not change anything.  The two parents were not alive.  The father was already dead.  I explained that, but that detail was not noted.  My father-in-law was already dead, only my mother-in-law was alive.
Q.	When you followed the girls, who left with Mika, what did you notice in terms of Mika's attitude towards them?
A.	When Mika took the girls away he spoke to them calmly, and that is why I followed them.  If I had observed any anger on his part, I wouldn't have followed them.
Q.	You've stated that you stopped on the other side of the courtyard at a distance of about 30 metres; is that correct?
A.	What I said was, rather, three metres.
Q.	Do you have a clear idea of what a metre represents?
A.	I am not very sure, but I believe three metres is the distance from the point I indicated to the other end.
Q.	Thank you. When you stopped at that distance you have just described, my question to you is why you stopped; whereas, if I understood correctly, Mika, since he had visited the family, up to his attitude on the road, had always shown himself to be friendly.  Why did you stop at that distance instead of continuing up to Mika's house?
A.	I stopped at that distance because I had just seen how the girls were taken into the house and the door was shut behind them.  That is why I stopped.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did Mika know that you were following him?
THE WITNESS:
He did not see me.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When the door was shut, did you have the feeling that the children were in danger?
A.	Once inside those girls could be heard screaming.  I heard those girls screaming.
Q.	You remained on that spot without speaking to anybody, without meeting anybody.  What happened while you were waiting?
A.	From where I was standing, I could hear the girls screaming and saying they were not expecting Mika to do what he was doing to them.  And I remained on my feet in front of the house near a bush which I showed yesterday, and after some time I became afraid myself because I could hear many voices.  Shortly thereafter, those girls came out accompanied by Mika and Ruzindana and Mika called on many youngsters, who are inside the house, to come out and see what Tutsi girls look like.  Those girls were stark naked, they could hardly walk and their feet were apart.
Q.	Madam, please try to answer my question.  I was saying -- I was asking whether, during the time you were waiting, you spoke to anybody, whether you saw people with whom you came into contact, whether you did not have any contact with anybody while you were waiting?
A.	The only person who saw me, and with whom I came into contact, was Mr. Kabanda, a trader who was also killed.
Q.	Where was he coming from and where was he going.  What did he tell you?
A.	Kabanda lives or lived close to Mika's house.  He was outside the house and all those houses were lit.
Q.	Please make an effort to answer my question.  What did he tell you?
A.	Kabanda asked me where I was going and I told him I had come to that area to buy a box of matches.
Q.	On the 7th of April in Gishyita could people move about freely?
A.	We were afraid after the death of those girls.  Perhaps that we were not afraid because we were confident that our safety was being provided for.
Q.	You never heard of a curfew following the president's death?
A.	Yes, the order was given, but that did not prevent us from going out of our houses because up until then there hadn't been any acts of violence.
Q.	A while ago I put the question to you as to what you did while waiting.  Now, I'm asking you for how long you waited.  In view of the variations in your statements, yesterday you stated two things that were contradictory.  You said that you waited for an hour, and you also said that you waited for two hours.  What should we retain definitively between the two disparities in time?
A.	When you are afraid, if you could put yourself in the shoes of a Rwandan, when you are afraid you lose the sense of time.  I was afraid.  I went there because I saw people in danger, but I observed that scene and I left.  What I was waiting to see was whether those children would die or survive.  When I saw them safe I left.  I don't know exactly how much time I spent there.
Q.	I understand, Witness.  During those events anybody in your position would have had the same problems, but in this case you were not afraid.  I hope so, at least.  And this way you stated that you spent two hours and on another occasion, still in this courtroom, you stated that you waited for an hour.  I hope you are not afraid.
A.	No, I am not afraid.  Here I am not afraid.  I am explaining to you my state of mind during those events.  I was not in a position to know what time it was and for how long I was there.  I cannot say whether it was one, two or three hours.  All I know is that I left late at night.
Q.	What do you want us to retain as to the duration of your waiting there?
A.	I would say two hours.  I would say that, in view of the abduction and the sufferings they endured, all that lasted about two hours.
Q.	You stated, Witness, that there were many youngsters in the house, in Mika's house.
A.	Yes, there were a large number of people.
Q.	Can you give us a rough idea of the number of people there were?
A.	I cannot tell the number of people who were inside the house. 
Q.	I'm putting this question to you, Witness, because you stated somewhere that Mika said this, "Come out, I want to show you what Tutsi girls look like." When they came out, could you give an estimate of the number of people who came out?
A.	I did not count them.  I do not want to lie.  All I can tell you is that those youngsters came out in Indian file to look at those young girls, and I added that I didn't tarry after that scene.
Q.	Mika's house could contain how many people?
A.	If I rely on the number of rooms in that house, I would say that the room in which those girls went in could contain about 15 people.
Q.	One could also say that the number of youngsters could correspond to the number 15?
A.	I explained that when they came out I was afraid.  I could not start counting.  I saw that those youngsters surrounded the girls.  They surrounded them and that was all I saw.
Q.	Thank you.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, yesterday there was some disagreement as to whether the witness, after having been released, could return to the communal house and I promised to show how the transcripts clarified this matter. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Well, Witness, did you return to the communal house, the communal building, after your release?
JUDGE SHORT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE WITNESS:
Yesterday I denied that I returned to the communal building, the communal office.  I said I went home.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	If we refer to yesterday's transcripts and turn to page 23, on page 23, line 18, in answer to the question, "Were they killed in your presence, madam?"  The answer given yesterday was, "After my release I went home, and I returned because I live very close to the communal office.  When they were being beaten up with clubs I could see them, and they were beaten up -- up to their death."

That is what you stated yesterday and which we have just read.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. SONGA:
I hope the problem is not an unending translation problem we always face.  I'm reading transcript page 23, line 18.
THE WITNESS:
Can I answer the question?  I did not return, but I could see what was happening because I did not live far from there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, we've got the part. Could you please repeat your question?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am concerned about knowing the truth about what happened on the day of the 7th of April.  We didn't finish.  We cannot finish with that date, 7th of April, without knowing exactly what happened.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, did you return to the prison or not when Nkundiye and Murindiahabi, whom you say were killed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness -- Professor Songa, where did she say that she returned to the prison?
MR. SONGA:
We have found the English transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, could you please just read your -- just read the answer she has given yesterday.  French.
MR. SONGA:
To the question, "Were they killed in your presence, madam?" 

Answer.  "After my release I went home and I returned because I live very close to the communal office and when they were being beaten up with clubs I could see them and they were beaten up until they died.  And so the war and the massacres started with the deaths of those two persons."

That is the passage, Madam President to which I am making reference.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
So she didn't say she came back to the prison.  She said she came back to the place where she was standing.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She didn't say she came back to the prison.  She said she came back to the place where she was standing and watching the girls.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Songa, what is being said here is this, she came back or she returned, whichever one you take.  It doesn't say she returned to prison.  It says, it is really likely that she returned to the position she had been.
MR. SONGA:
No, Madam President, Your Honours.  If you take into account the entire context, the discussion had to do with the assassination of the two agronomists, Nkundiye and Murindiahabi.  It has no connection with the spot where they were standing when those two persons were locked up in Mika's house.  These are very two different contexts, if you take time to verify them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What we are asking you, Professor, is are you -- you are adding "came back to prison" or you are saying "the place she came back to was prison."
MR. SONGA:
Exactly, Your Honours.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Songa, that's your interpretation, isn't it?  The English and the French version are the same.  I understand a little bit of French.  It is the same version.  The French says, "I came back."  It doesn't indicate where she came back to. You are interpreting that to mean she came back to the prison but it doesn't necessarily follow.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In fact, following in your subsequent questioning yesterday she denied very vehemently having gone back to prison.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, Your Honours, if we read this text, "I came back," she cannot come back to two places.  She can only go back to the place she went from.  "After my liberation I went and I returned."  You can only return to a place that you have gone away from.  It is not an interpretation.  It is the sense.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, let me get to the sense.  First she comes to the communal office.  Then from the communal office it is directed that she be put in prison.  She is put in prison.  Then she is released from prison, and then she goes home.  Then she comes back.  That coming back doesn't arrive at imminently coming back to the communal office.  It doesn't exactly mean that the "back" has to be "back to prison" it could be "back to the communal office" where she had been before he was incarcerated.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President (sic).
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	We are still referring to the witness statements of the 30th of August, and here Madam Witness, you state that you saw Muhimana every day before (sic) she was wounded -- before you were wounded.  Is that correct?
A.	Are you asking the question of me?
Q.	Of course, Madam Witness.
A.	Mika, before I was wounded I saw him every day when he came to Bisesero with the assailants that he was controlling.
Q.	When were you wounded, Madam?
A.	I was wounded in May.  I don't remember the date.
Q.	Do you remember the month or the week?
A.	It was perhaps during the second week of May.
Q.	Under what circumstances, madam?
A.	I was wounded on the Muyira hill.
Q.	Can you say more about that, was it during an attack?  Could you identify anybody during this incident?
A.	Nobody recognised me except for the persons who were with me, refugees like me, who are dead, besides.
Q.	No assailant was identified?
A.	During the attack during which I was wounded, during which I was raped, it was Musema who was identified.
Q.	And the date of the 13th is of no help to you?
A.	Listen, at that time nobody could remember dates.  We saw nightfall and we saw sunrise.
Q.	During your statement in the Musema trial, the question of the date was asked -- was put to you, and you said it was the 13th of May and it was at Muyira.  Now that your memory has been refreshed, can you confirm?
A.	I told you that the last time I came here to testify during the Musema trial five years ago, it was five years ago.  So I cannot remember that, because it's a long time ago.  I do not have notes that can help me to remember.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, yesterday you told me that you would take one hour.  One hour is almost over.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, you said that it was an approximate figure.  I might make an effort so that in 15 to 20 minutes I can ask all of the rest of my questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, not beyond 15 minutes, 20.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Madam President, I would like to include this extract of the Musema trial transcript where the date when she was wounded is given. 

Madam President, we are going to have to give references to our exhibits.  Yesterday, some documents were produced but references were not given.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we have the English transcripts, please?

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But Professor, if at the end of May is the date you are after, it is in the second week of May, wouldn't you agree, 15th?
MR. SONGA:
That is correct.  That is the second week of the month of May.  That is when she was wounded.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So there would therefore be no contradiction between what she said now and then.
MR. SONGA:
No, my concern here is not to raise a controversy regarding the date when she was wounded.  The controversy might appear in the questions that follow.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you want us to enter these all five transcripts as an exhibit?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry Professor, there were not five here; they were copies, there's only one transcript.

Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour was asking me about whether the date of the 13th of May was contrary to previous statements.  I answered no, that the contradiction might arise in the questions that would follow and here is a question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state in this document that we have entered as an exhibit, that after you were wounded you did not make yourself seen and the Madam President asked you when -- how long you were able to see the attacks.  And you answered, "After that I was not able to be seen because I was hiding in a bush.  I had been wounded." 

The question, the more precise question that I want to ask, in the statement of 13th of August you refer to Kanyinya.  I shall verify the exact date of the statement.  It is in the declaration of February, instead, the 3rd of February 2000, in you refer to Kanyinya in the statement of that time.  So what is the difference between Kanyinya and Muyira?  And was Kanyinya before Muyira or was it the other way around?
A.	Kanyinya, comes before Muyira; so Muyira is the next stage.
Q.	The question.  You said that after you hid in Bisesero you went to Muyira.  How did you get to Kanyinya?
A.	I stated that Mika came on board the commune vehicle and he beat the drum to call the refugees to come and take medicine and provisions the next day, and that is how we got to Kanyinya.
Q.	When did this happen, on what date, 7th, 8th, 9th of April?
A.	Quite frankly, I don't remember the dates.  I have already told you that nobody could worry about dates.  We saw day and night come and go, and it was indeed difficult to note when one went from one week to another.
Q.	But how much time did you spend in Kanyinya, madam?
A.	We came to Kanyinya just to attend a meeting, and we came back to take medicine and, at that time, we saw buses on board -- and on board there were assailants, many assailants were coming to attack us.
Q.	You came back to Kanyinya for a meeting in Muyira, is that what you're saying?
A.	It was at the beginning of the month of May, I would say the first week which followed the month of April, so the first week of the month of May.
Q.	Between the first return to Kanyinya for the meeting and the second return for medicine, how much time elapsed?
A.	The Accused came today and then the next day we saw the buses, on board which were assailants which were coming to attack us, whereas we had been promised that we would be receiving medicine.  And it was at 2 p.m.
Q.	You said that in Kanyinya you saw Mika controlling a group; is that correct?
A.	Yes, he came with assailants that he was controlling, but I could not determine their ethnic origin; however, I will say that it was a large number of assailants who were armed with guns, firearms, machetes and clubs.
Q.	Do you mean that you never referred to yourself?
A.	Listen, there was so much mystery it was difficult to talk about Hutus and Twa.  Often the Twa assailants were bearing clubs and sharp sticks.
Q.	I am going to read out to you the last paragraph of your 30th of August declaration.  "I saw Mika Muhimana before I was wounded.  I saw him tracking Tutsi with a group of Twa."  That is your statement, madam?
A.	But at that time it was not in Kanyinya.
Q.	Where was it?
A.	It was during all these attacks, which were carried out in Bisesero against us.
Q.	And on what hill were the Twa?  Where did they attack you?
A.	I saw them at a place called a Rwirambo on a hill which is next to Muyira.
Q.	And that is where Mika was, wasn't he?
A.	Mika was in all the attacks.  He was managing the attacks.
Q.	In your previous statements is there any place where you said that Mika was in Muyira?
A.	No, I did not talk about Rwirambo.
Q.	Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor do you want this to be entered in the record, this transcript of 11th of March 1999 in Musema case to be entered as an exhibit?
MR. SONGA:
We have here the transcript of the 11th of March.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you want the document to be entered as an exhibit?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This transcript is an English version of this transcript in Musema case dated 19th  of March 1999 reported by court reporter Petrus Chijarira as exhibit.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we object to that because we don't see the foundational basis of entering this as an exhibit.  There is no foundational basis laid, whatsoever.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, Defence has led evidence on this document.  He referred this document in his cross-examination.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He has referred to it, yes, but he hasn't laid the foundation for it as an exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He has referred this document to the witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He hasn't  actually drawn our attention to any major inconsistency between the evidence and what's contained in the document.  So in my respectful submission there is no basis to enter it as an exhibit. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have deliberated and we ruled since Songa is unable to find any major inconsistency between the statement and this transcript we will not admit it as an exhibit.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But perhaps we ought to clarify our position.  You are saying you produced a document which is already part of our record.  If you want this particular page and document put in there must be a basis upon which it is put in; otherwise, it doesn't speak to us.  It has to speak to us, and the way it speaks to us is that you show what the witness has said now and what is contained here are different, so that we look at it that way.  But entering it in that way in the record, when it is already part of the record, without a basis, makes it of no purpose to the evidence.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I do not question the decision of the Court.  I would just like to know, are you referring to the last exhibit or all the extracts of the Musema trial?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The transcript of 11th March 1999, the last one which was given to us.
MR. SONGA:
I take note, Madam President. 

Madam President, I have two short questions and after that I will ask that the declarations, the statements that we have used should be entered as exhibits for the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which exhibits, to which documents?
MR. SONGA:
I am referring to the statements of Witness AP.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Statement of the  --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Three.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- government of which dates, all?  The statements of which dates you are referring to?
MR. SONGA:
All three, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, what do you have to say?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We have no objection in relation to the witness statement.  He's drawn attention to the inconsistency, so that's fine.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Document 3, government (microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The three statements of this witness is entered as exhibit D. 1, D. 2 and D. 3. Statement of 13th of January 1999 will be D. 1.  Statement of 30th of August 1999 will be D. 2.  
And 3rd February 2000 will be Exhibit 3.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
All under seal, Your Honour, as they have identification features.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All exhibits are under seal.
(Exhibits No. D. 1, D. 2, D. 3 admitted under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

I would like to ask a question.  May I continue with the two or three questions left?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, go ahead.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, after the 7th of April did you go to Mubuga church?
A.	Yes, I went to the Mubuga church.
Q.	Where did you leave from?
A.	We were coming from Gishyita.
Q.	Was it after the 8th of April?
A.	We left Gishyita on the 7th of April in the night.
Q.	From Mubuga?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And when did you leave Gishyita for Bisesero?
A.	We arrived at Mubuga on the run, and the priest chased us away, and we went on towards the Bisesero region.
Q.	Do you mean that Mubuga is en route for Bisesero for anyone coming from Gishyita?
A.	We passed through Mubuga.  There was a large number of us.  We wanted to take refuge in the Mubuga church, and the priest drove us away and we went on our way.
Q.	Around what time was that, madam?
A.	I stated that at that time it was difficult for us to determine the time, because we were frightened.  I told you that when we left Gishyita my three children had been killed.
Q.	Between Mubuga and Bisesero, what is the distance between these two?
A.	From Gishyita to Mubuga, there is a great distance, and from Mubuga to Bisesero there is a great distance, as well.
Q.	I believe I noted contradictions in your hours of arrival in Bisesero.  At some point you state that you arrived on the 9th of April at 3 p.m. and somewhere else you say that you arrived at three o'clock on the 8th of April.  I don't know whether this controversy can be cleared up, but it is in the transcripts.  

This is on page 24 of the transcripts, "And I continued with two of my children.  I spent the night on the road and I arrived in the -- arrived in Bisesero in the morning or in the night, but it was on the 9th.  I arrived at 3 p.m."  And in the same document, in the statement of the same day, on page 30, last line before the end, you say, "I arrived Bisesero only on the 8th." 
Please give us the latest version, madam.
A.	I know that I am telling the truth.  I left Gishyita on the 7th of April in the night.  They were chasing me, and they killed my children and we hid in the cathedral.  We were Catholic Christians.  The priest chased us off.  And we took the road to Bisesero.  In my country, when you talk about 3 a.m. that is cockcrow.
MR. SONGA:
I shall ask the last but one question, Madam President.  I have taken advantage of your indulgence.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, what are the circumstances of the death of Nyagihigi?
A.	Nyagihigi was killed when Mika asked us to meet at Kanyinya, as he was bringing us food and medicine.  It is at that time that he was killed.
Q.	Who was he?
A.	He was a married man.
Q.	How did you know him?
A.	When Mika shot at Nyagihigi, he screamed, and he called him to come forward so that he could finish him off.  He said, "Come and finish me off because you are the one who shot me."
Q.	Did you hear this yourself or was it reported to you?
A.	I heard it myself because we were there in confusion, we were being chased and the bullet hit Nyagihigi.
MR. SONGA:
Madam, this is the last question, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that in a group of assailants you identify Mika, and you certify that you identified him because he was wearing red and around his waist he was wearing banana leaves.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.
Q.	And all of the leaders were wearing red?
A.	All the leaders were wearing red and the Interahamwe were wearing white, especially white T-shirts and shorts, and in addition they had coffee leaves on their heads.
Q.	Was he the only leader that day that you were able to identify him by his red dress?
A.	I recognised him because he was wearing a gun with a wooden butt and he was also wearing this gun.
Q.	And when did he wear this?
A.	When I saw him, I used to see him wearing the gun that way.
Q.	My question was about that particular day.  Was he the only chief in red, the only leader in red?
A.	Sikubwabo was also wearing the same uniform but he did not have the same size.  The bourgmestre was small, whereas the other one was big.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, to stay within the time frame that you have defined I shall stop my counter - cross-examination and thank the witness and I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Yes re-examination?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, we don't, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, as you were running away towards Bisesero, were you alone or with others?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, will you answer?
THE WITNESS:
I was in the company of a large number of people.
JUDGE SHORT:
So you were all running away together.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was accompanied by my neighbours.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, you spoke about these two girls that Mika brought from your house.  And you indicated that you were asked whether they live in the same locality or whether they were from somewhere else.  And you indicated that these children were studying far from their home, but at that time they were in that house, it was during the school days.  How often did these children come to the house?
THE WITNESS:
Are you asking when they came to my house or to Mika's house?
JUDGE SHORT:
No, to your house.
THE WITNESS:
The two girls were students; they were on holiday.
JUDGE SHORT:
That's what I'm saying.  So how often would they come on holidays?
THE WITNESS:
Those girls came to my home often because it was the same building, the same house.  We shared an inner courtyard and we lived in the same building with those girls.  We were of the same family.

JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you very much for coming to Arusha to testify before this Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, who is your next witness; I suppose, AX?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that's correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please call the next witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, how many statements of this witness do we have one?
MS. MADENGA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  We have one statement for this witness, Witness AX.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
December 16, 1999.
MS. MADENGA:
Sixteenth of December 1999, that is correct, Your Honour.

With your leave, Madam President, and whilst we are waiting for the witness, I would just like to confirm from you whether you prefer that I lead the witness on the protected witness information or whether we should just proceed like yesterday, because we had already reconfirmed the protected information with Witness AX .
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed as we did yesterday.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not -- we continue with evidence-in-chief.

Mr. Prosecutor, you have a copy.
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Madam President, we will make several copies, enough for all relevant parties.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the team is not properly sitting, Mr. Phillips.  You may make copies.  

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness AX in these proceedings.  You are a protected witness.  Do not reveal your name, place of residence or disclose any other evidence that may lead to your identification.  Before we proceed with your evidence, you will take a solemn declaration to speak the truth.  

Mr. Issa, please.  
(Declaration made by Witness AX in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Here is a copy of this.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, madam
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have a copy of the protected witness sheet?
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, that is a copy the witness has signed.  It was our intention, that after confirmation we will proceed to make copies for all relevant parties.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But from now on it should be given to all of us, this measure.
MS. MADENGA:
Indebted to Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Afternoon Your Honours.  

Good afternoon members of the Defence team.  
Afternoon, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.

WITNESS AX,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, in front of you is a document containing protected information relating to yourself as a protected witness.  If you recall, we have already reconfirmed those details.  Can you recognise from that document your signature?
A.	I can see my signature on the document.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, the Prosecution would want to tender that document under seal, the document containing protected information for the witness as in Prosecution Exhibit No. 6.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It will be entered as Exhibit P. 6 under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 6 admitted, under seal)
MR. SONGA:
Please.  Madam President, we do not have that exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We also don't have it and Madam Prosecutor has promised to provide same after a while.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Show it to the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, make sure from tomorrow on we have a copy of this information sheet in advance.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, yes.
MR. SONGA:
Please, Your Honours.  Madam President, just one clarification.  The names on the document that has been presented differs slightly from what was given to us.  

Maybe that matter should be clarified now.  The document refers to (Name deleted by order of the Court) whereas the list that we have --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we don't see any difference in the name.
MR. SONGA:
There is a difference in the last but one letter.
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, Defence counsel is referring to names of the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, this is a protected witness and her name should be deleted from the record. 

Professor we don't see any difference in the names.
MS. MADENGA:
Maybe to assist the Court, Your Honour, in fact, there is a difference because if you refer to the statements they put the last letters with a different letter from what is contained there.  If it is out of the reconfirmation exercise THAT we made those corrections.  So, with your leave Your Honour, I will just indicate where the difference lies, without disclosing the particulars of the protected witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name is the same in this information sheet and the name given in the identification of the witness.
MS. MADENGA:
That's correct, Your Honour.  But then during reconfirmation she changed the last two letters of the alphabet, that is what we just want to underline, without revealing the name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do.
MS. MADENGA:
It's accordingly done, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, can you pronounce it?
MS. MADENGA:
No, the witness is protected.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  Please proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to start by apologising.  I had actually indicated to you that there was a  -- that you would testify tomorrow, so I'm sorry for any inconvenience.
A.	That's fine with me.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell the Court when you heard about the death of the president?
A.	I heard about the president's death on the 7th.  I heard that he was dead, and it was announced over the radio.  And I learned of that over my radio.
Q.	Madam, when you say the 7th, do you recall the month and the year?
A.	I recall that it was in 1994.
Q.	Where were you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When?
THE WITNESS:
In the month of April.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She said 1994.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	The year?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Where were you?
A.	I was at home.  I was in my house.
Q.	Who else was in the house?
A.	I was alone, since my husband was absent.
Q.	Where was your husband?
A.	My husband was a night watchman.
Q.	Thank you.  Your husband belonged to which ethnic group?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	Did anything happen when he heard about the death of the president?
A.	My husband immediately came home from his work place and he told me that the houses of Tutsis were being destroyed and their property looted.
Q.	Did he tell you who was destroying the property?
A.	He told me that Hutus were the ones destroying houses.
Q.	Did you personally see the houses being destroyed?
A.	I came out and I witnessed such destruction.
	(Pages 1 to 25 by R. Lear)










1600H
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	What did you witness?
A.	I could see people looting the property of neighbours, and apart from such looting, we could see that roofs were being removed or destroyed.
Q.	Madam Witness, when you said you saw people, do you know the people you saw?
A.	I knew them.
Q.	Can you identify the people you saw?
A.	After hearing that people were destroying houses, I saw Mika, the bourgmestre, and police officers.  Those were the people who started destroying houses and looting in that area.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  You referred to Mika; can you clarify?  Who is Mika?
A.	Mika was our neighbour.  He was also conseiller.
Q.	The person you referred to as Mika, do you know the surname of that person?
A.	His surname is Muhimana.
Q.	Did you know Mika before the incidents you have just related to the Court?
A.	I knew him even well before then because he was our neighbour.
Q.	For how long had you known Mika?
A.	Since my youth, I used to see him.
Q.	Since you have clarified who Mika was, do you think you can identify Mika?
A.	If I had the opportunity of seeing him, I would identify him, unless he has changed.
MS. MADENGA: 
Your Honour, with the leave of the Court, I am applying that the witness leave the witness stand.  Since the witness is a protected witness, I would also make a request that registry will draw the curtains, and if the Court can allow the witness to stand up, and then we will proceed from there. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Leave the witness stand, did you say?
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, Your Honour, that's my application.  I am saying the witness is not limited to the witness box, but since the witness is a protected witness, I want her to take all the practical measures to stand up and try to identify the person the witness is referring to as Mika Muhimana.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You want her to be free, at liberty, not to go away?
MS. MADENGA: 
No, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You want her only to stand up and identify the Accused? 

MS. MADENGA:
That's what I apply, and for that purpose I requested that the curtains be drawn so that the public will not see the witness standing up.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think that the public would see her if she stands up in the witness stand. 
MS. MADENGA:
The next request, Your Honour, is that the witness should not be limited to the witness box, but should actually stand up and see if she can identify the person she referred to as Mika Muhimana.  He has --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. The application is granted.  She can stand up and move around if she wishes. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, we have referred to a person by the name Mika Muhimana.  I want you stand up from the witness stand.
A.	I can see him he is wearing a white (no interpretation), but I notice that he has put on weight. 
Q.	Madam Witness, where is the person you are identifying?  Where is he sitting?
A.	In front of him there are three people who are sitting down, and he is sitting behind these three people.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  We want you to point in the direction you are referring to.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have agreed the witness has identified the Accused. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  May the record accordingly reflect that. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you also referred to a person you called Sikubwabo.  Who is Sikubwabo?
A.	Sikubwabo was bourgmestre of the commune.
Q.	Now, let's go back to Mika Muhimana.  At what stage after the death of the president, did you first see Mika Muhimana?
A.	I saw him in a neighbour's residence, who was above my house.
Q.	How close were you to the neighbour's house?
A.	I was at the entrance to the yard of my house, and these two persons -- and the residence of these people was very near our house.
Q.	When you saw Mika, what was Mika doing?
A.	He was accompanied by many people.  They were looting the property of this neighbour's house.  They took these goods away -- the property away.  They passed in front of my house, and they were entering every house that belonged to Tutsi.
Q.	What ethnic group was the neighbour?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	From the neighbour's house, what happened?
A.	They came to my house.
Q.	When you say, "They came to my house", who came to your house?
A.	I refer to Mika and the assailants who are accompanying him.
Q.	Do you know any of the assailants who accompanied Mika to your home?
A.	I know some of them.  The bourgmestre, communal policemen and a few Hutu civilians; they were part of the group.
Q.	When you refer to Hutu civilians, can you explain to the Court the identities of the other people?  Were they civilians also?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Please, Counsel, make certain we know which people you are referring to.
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If you may, please do them one by one.
MS. MADENGA:
I am indebted, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, let me ask that question again.  You referred to civilians, and my question now will focus on Sikubwabo who you say was the bourgmestre.  Was Sikubwabo armed?
A.	He was armed.  Mika was armed too.
Q.	When you say, " Mika was armed too," can you describe what Mika had?
A.	It was a gun.  I don't know the type of gun, but I could see similar guns in the communal office.
Q.	What did Mika do at your house?
A.	I went out because I thought that the situation had not deteriorated.  I wanted to ask him what I should do about my children, and he answered that we had to -- they had to kill all Tutsi, and that there was nothing else to be done.
Q.	When Mika Muhimana said, "There was nothing else to be done," what did you understand him to mean?
A.	I had just asked him what I could do because the last night, the night of the death of Habyarimana, a few Tutsi who were hiding were killed selectively.  We saw that only Tutsis had been killed and no Hutus, and we asked them what had happened.  They explained it was the Tutsi who had to die and that there was nothing else to be done. 
Q.	When Mika Muhimana said that to you, what did you do?
A.	I did not have any strength.  I had just given birth two days previously.  My husband told me, "I am running away towards Bisesero.  I beg you take the children to your parents because you are not targeted.  I hope nothing will happen to you."  So I took the children and I went to my parents.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Let's focus on what your husband said.  He referred to children.  How many children did you have?
A.	We had five children.
Q.	He also referred to you not being targeted.  Were you not targeted?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, ask what did he mean.
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	What did Mika mean?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not Mika, her husband.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	It was your husband who stated that you were not targeted; so what did he mean by, "You were not targeted"?
A.	He meant that I did not belong to this ethnic group and that I could take my children to my family or my tribe.  I was a Hutu; I was not personally targeted, but people close to me were targeted.
Q.	What ethnic group was your husband?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	What then happened?
A.	I went to my parents with my children, and my husband ran away to the Bisesero hills.
Q.	Your parents, what ethnic group did they belong to?
A.	My father was Hutu and my mother was Tutsi.
Q.	At what time did you arrive at your parents' place?
A.	I arrived in the evening.
Q.	Did you find your parents at home?
A.	They were there.  They had not started to hide, but as soon as I arrived we used to hide.  I used to hide with my mother from time to time, but we always went back home.
Q.	Where did you hide with your mother?
A.	We used to hide in the forests and bushes, everywhere that we could find a place to hide.
Q.	What did happen to the children?
A.	We were hiding with the children.
Q.	Can you tell the Court the ages of your children?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not getting the translation.
THE WITNESS:
The first was 11 years, the second was nine years old; the third, seven years old; the fourth was four years old, and the fifth was newborn. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Let's start with the first child.  What happened to the first child?
A.	They found us out once and they killed all the children except the first one, who did not die as the four others. 
Q.	Let's focus --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, what was the age of your eldest child?
THE WITNESS:
He (sic) was 11 years old.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was he a -- she was a girl?
THE WITNESS:
It was a girl.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you had just explained that your eldest daughter was killed separately, and you also indicated that the other four children were also killed.  We want to focus now on the four -- on four of your children, then we will go back to the first child.  What happened to the fourth child?
A.	Assailants found us out.  I did not mention that we were attacked at night very often.  So when we were found out, the children were killed first; after that my mother was killed also.
Q.	Were the children discovered at the same time, your four children?
A.	Yes, we were all together.
Q.	Madam Witness, I understand this is very difficult, but it is very important for you to tell the Court step by step how the four children were killed?
A.	These children were found out; they were discovered, and immediately they were killed by the assailants led by Mika.
Q.	Where were they killed?
A.	They were killed in my parents' house. 
Q.	You indicated the assailants were led by Mika; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	At what stage did you see Mika?
A.	Obviously, I saw him during the attacks during which my children were killed.
Q.	You said the children were killed at your parents' home.  How close was Mika to where the children were killed?
A.	He was nearby; he was present.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, the children were killed in your presence?
THE WITNESS:
I first tried to hide, but I was trying to run away from the scene, but they caught me and brought me back.  Often the parents of Tutsi were forced to kill them themselves, and I was brought back by force, and they were killed before my eyes.
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Who brought you by force?  You said you were brought back by force?
A.	It was the Interahamwes who were blocking my way, because when a person had married a Tutsi, this individual was arrested and was forced to kill the children herself.  In my case, I was forced to come back on site and I was forced to watch as they were being killed.
Q.	Do you recall who forced you to come back on site?
A.	I know some of them who are in prison in our country, others are in exile, and yet others I do not remember.
Q.	Were the assailants acting of their own volition?
A.	They were acting with a lot of enthusiasm.  They seemed determined.
Q.	You indicated that Mika led the assailants.  When the children were being killed, did you see Mika?
A.	He was everywhere.  He was in all of the attacks.  He was present that day, yes.
Q.	How close was Mika to where you were; that is at the stage your children were being killed?
A.	He was quite close.  He was quite close to me.  He was not far.
Q.	Could you see Mika?
A.	Yes, I could see him.
Q.	What was Mika doing when your children were being killed?
A.	He was encouraging his troops to kill.
Q.	Which child was killed first?  Which of your children was killed first?
A.	The children were all being hit at the same time.  I could not know which of the children was killed first because they were all killed.  They were hitting with their clubs at the same time, and they were hitting all of the children, so I don't know who received the first blow.
Q.	During the course of the killing --
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, Witness said that Mika was encouraging the attackers; what does that mean?
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	You indicated to the Honourable Court that Mika Muhimana was encouraging the attackers; what do you mean by that?
A.	He was present.  He was our leader, and he did nothing to prevent these attacks.  And after this expedition, he went around distributing death, so we could conclude that it was he - it was he who was encouraging that.
Q.	Did Mika personally participate in the killing of the children?
A.	No.  During the deaths of my children, he seemed to supervise these actions.  Where he personally participated, was during the killing of my husband.
Q.	How did Mika supervise the killers?
A.	How can I explain it to you?  He was a leader.  He was respected and his orders were followed.
Q.	Did you hear Mika say anything on this day; that is, when the children were killed?
A.	He said that Tutsi should be killed and that this was a plan that should be implemented: that Tutsi should be exterminated.
Q.	Did you -- did you know to who Mika was addressing those comments?
A.	He was speaking to the assailants.  I wasn't paying attention to that; my children were being killed.  I didn't have a heart to listen to what he was saying.
Q.	Thank you, madam, I understand.  We will go on to talk about the death of the eldest child.  

When did you hear of the death of the eldest child?
A.	The day of the death of my four children, I was able to hide my children (sic) with other members of the family.  The assailants found out in due course where I had hidden my children -- the child, and they killed the child on the same day as they killed my husband, her father. 
Q.	Were you present when your eldest child was killed?
A.	I was present.
Q.	Can you describe to the Court what happened?
A.	When they found the child where I had hidden her, they threatened to kill me with her.  They took her to my home; and when they arrived there, I tried to hide because they were going to -- they wanted to kill me as well.  They took her and they killed her.  I was hiding.
Q.	When you say, "They discovered", who are you referring to?
A.	It is the assailants, the very same who killed my children; they were roaming everywhere.  It was practically their main activity.  They walked around the countryside looking for their victims.  They looked for her; they ended up finding her, and they killed her. 
Q.	When the eldest child was discovered, did you see Mika Muhimana among the assailants?
A.	It was he who was leading all the attacks.  When my child was taken, they got her to pass in front of Mika's house.  They took her down to my house because they wanted to kill me.  They wanted to kill me because I had tried to hide her.  Obviously Mika was there.  He was participating in all the attacks, considering that it was he who was leading them. 
Q.	Did Mika say anything to you?
A.	Do you mean on that day?
Q.	Yes, when the assailants discovered your eldest child.
A.	No, I did not go near to the place because I would have died if I had been discovered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, is this a convenient time to take a short break? 
MS. MADENGA: 
Your Honour, thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We adjourn the Court for 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1630H to 1655H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor, please proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, before we adjourned you indicated that when your eldest child was killed, you could not go near because you would have been killed also.  I want to thank you for sharing that part with us.  Now we want to go to another area.

Earlier on in your evidence, you indicated that your husband was killed.  I also appreciate that it is very difficult, but it is also very important to tell the Honourable Court what happened to your husband.  Can you proceed and tell the Court what happened to your husband?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, you mean how it happened.
MS. MADENGA: 
Your Honour, thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
My husband had taken refuge on the Bisesero hills.  He was taken down; he was taken to Gishyita.  When he arrived at Gishyita, he was taken to Mika's house; he was tied up.  And this is how he was killed; that is, is from Bisesero to Mika's house, and he was killed in Gishyita.  He had just been taken from the Bisesero region.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know who took your husband from the Bisesero area to Mika's house?
A.	It was these Interahamwe who were accompanied by Mika who had gone to Bisesero, and who brought him back, because each person whom they brought from this region was taken to be killed at Gishyita itself. 
Q.	At what stage did you know your husband had been captured?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, before you answer the question put to you by my learned Madam Prosecutor, can you tell us what you mean by Gishyita? Are you referring to a certain place or Gishyita is the name of a specific place?
THE WITNESS:
This is the place where Mika was living.  It is in Gishyita commune.  It was near the Gishyita communal office.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the residence of Mika was known as Gishyita -- Gishyita commune?
THE WITNESS:
The residence of Mr. Mika was in Gishyita commune in Gishyita secteur, and it was quite close to the Gishyita communal office.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, how did you know that your husband had been captured?
A.	People were being caught in the Bisesero hills and they were being brought down.  People told me that my husband had been caught, and I ran to see whether it was indeed he because I hadn't seen him for a long time.  I immediately realised that it was indeed my husband who had been caught.
Q.	Where did you find your husband?
A.	He had been made to sit in front of Mika's house.
Q.	When he was made to sit in front of Mika's house, could you see him?
A.	I could not come near these people because they were heavily armed; nobody could go near them.  But when I arrived at the road, people warned me that I would be killed and prevented me from approaching him, but I did everything in my power to come near that place.  There was a banana plantation near Mika's residence, and I went near the place where he was and I was able to see him. 
Q.	Could your husband - 
MS. MADENGA:
I withdraw that question, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Could you talk to your husband from where you were?
A.	The assailants were armed with traditional weapons.  Since we had lost our minds because members of our families were being killed, I was able to approach the place where he was sitting. 
Q.	Did your husband say anything to you?
A.	He was in a difficult situation.  He was waiting for death  He had lost his mind, and he said that he had been informed of the death of his child, the remaining child.
Q.	Did he say anything else?
A.	No.  We said nothing more to each other.
Q.	After that comment from your husband, what happened to him?
A.	He was at Mika's residence.  He had been tied with the jacket that he had been wearing, and afterwards, when he realised that his head was going to be cut off, and castrate him, he loosened himself and he ran away, and he was killed before he could reach the road, which was down below; that is the road leading to Kibuye. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Do you know who killed him when he tried to escape?
A.	It was difficult in such a situation.  I was on the lower side of the road and I could see assailants running after him and were shooting at him.  He fell, and he was finished off with other traditional weapons.
Q.	When your husband was being killed, did you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, he was present at the time when he was being shot at; and he fell when a bullet hit him and he was finished off with traditional weapons.
Q.	Did Mika Muhimana say anything when your husband was being killed?
A.	At the time when my husband was being killed, I was not quite close, but I could hear shots and my husband fell after the shots.  What could he say?  What else could he say?  He was being shot.  He had nothing to add.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I understand.  

I will ask you the next question relating to the body of your husband.  Did you manage to bury your husband?
A.	I did what I could -- everything in my power to bury him because the dogs were eating him, and people were saying, "If you try to go and bury him, we are going to kill him -- kill you and bury you with him."  So he was buried hurriedly.  His body was taken and thrown down the road, and a few tufts of grass were thrown over him. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.
A.	And it was after the dogs had been able to cut his arms off.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

I appreciate it is difficult, but it is important also to tell the Court what happened to the bodies of your children.  Did you manage to bury any of your children? 
A.	The Interahamwe were removing the bodies from the roads to avoid the odour of these decomposing bodies.  So it was the Interahamwe who were burying the bodies of the victims.
Q.	Thank you, madam. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Madam President, with your leave, I just want to ascertain whether my witness is in a position to continue because I see she is a little bit upset and distressed; because now I wanted to move to another aspect to sort of distract her from the family members.  So I wanted now to deal with other members who are not family members, and then I will come back to conclude with this aspect.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please proceed.  

Madam Witness, how are you now?  Can you continue with your statement?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, you may continue, madam.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can we continue with your statement?  Are you able to continue?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, you can continue.  I will try to make an effort.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, proceed. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour; I am indebted. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to ask now to move to a different area.  Do you know a person called Charles, the policeman?
A.	I knew him because I was living right next to the communal office.
Q.	For how long had you known Charles?
A.	I had known him for one year. 
Q.	Do you know Charles' occupation?  What was his occupation in 1994?
A.	He was a communal policeman.
Q.	Do you know Charles' ethnic group?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	Madam Witness, I want you to explain to the Court what happened to Charles, who was a policeman and a Tutsi?
A.	Charles was a communal policeman, a Tutsi.  He hid in the Bisesero hills.  He was arrested and killed horribly.
Q.	Do you know where Charles was arrested?
A.	He was arrested in the Bisesero hills.
Q.	Madam, do you know who arrested Charles?
A.	He was arrested by the bourgmestre, Mika, Ryandikayo, and many other Interahamwe who were part of the attacks.
Q.	Were you present when Charles was arrested by, among other people, Mika Muhimana?
A.	At that time, I was not on the Bisesero hills.
Q.	So how did you come to know that Charles had been arrested?
A.	After the arrest of a Tutsi, the drums were beaten and people ran up to see what was happening.  So anybody who was able to see what was going on could do so.  So I ran up and we went to Gishyita.  I realised that he had been castrated and they had hung his genitals on a lance.
Q.	Madam Witness, I just want to take you step-by-step.  You said you heard that he had been captured; you heard the drums.  At what stage did you, personally, see Charles the policeman?
A.	After the announcement of the arrest of Charles, his gun was taken from him, and we ran up and we realised that he had been castrated, and his -- parts of his body that had been castrated were being exhibited.
Q.	Where was Charles when you first saw - 
MS. MADENGA:
In fact, I will withdraw that question, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Did you see Charles?
A.	I see -- I saw his genitals that had been cut off.
Q.	Let me take you back a little bit.  You indicated that you heard drums being beaten.  It is from that stage that I want to know whether you saw Charles?
A.	I went up after the others, and people were saying that he had been castrated.  And when I arrived at the scene, I realised that his genitals were being exhibited.
Q.	Did you identify -- did you identify Charles among the people?
A.	He was already dead.
Q.	Did you see his body?
A.	Yes, I saw his body.
Q.	You indicated that his private parts were suspended.  How close was his body to the place where you indicated -- where you mentioned that his private parts were suspended?
A.	It was in front of the residence of a certain Kabanda, in front of an electric pole -- on an electric pole. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Did you see Mika Muhimana when you went to see people suspending the private parts of Charles?
A.	Yes, he was present.  The bourgmestre was also present, as well as other local authorities.
Q.	Can you tell the Court what Mika Muhimana was doing?
A.	After having -- hanging the genitals of Charles on a spear, they said, "Any Tutsi that would be found out would suffer the same fate."
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Let's go back a little bit.  Who suspended the private parts of Charles on a spear?
A.	Mika ordered the Interahamwe to hang the genitals of Charles and he asked them to exhibit them, to show them to the people.
Q.	When Mika gave these instructions, did you personally hear that?
A.	I was present.  I heard him give that order.
Q.	Did Mika say anything else to the Interahamwe?
A.	He ordered them to hang the genital parts of this policeman up so that other people would realise what had happened.
Q.	Approximately how many people were present when this happened?
A.	There was a large crowd.  I cannot estimate the number of those who were present because it was not my problem.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  How close to you was Mika when he ordered the Interahamwe to suspend the private parts on a spear?
A.	We were at the end of the trading centre and everybody had run up, so Mika was quite close to us.
Q.	Do you know, madam, what eventually happened to the body of Charles the policeman?
A.	The bodies were being thrown just anywhere.  After having castrated him, his body was thrown away, and it was covered with grass.  It was just to avoid the smells from the decomposing body.
Q.	Do you know why Charles was castrated?
A.	When a person was arrested, they took him away.  He was castrated on the spot.
Q.	Thank you, madam.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Just to correct your record, you actually intend to say "when his genitals were removed," not castrated.
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, let's proceed and reflect on what you said earlier in your evidence.  You talked about the house of one Assiel Kabanda. 
A.	Assiel Kabanda was living quite close to the place where these acts were committed.
Q.	Did you know Assiel Kabanda before the incidents of 1994?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	For how long had you known Assiel Kabanda?
A.	I had known him from when we were young because he was a trader in this centre.
Q.	Madam, can you tell the Court what happened to Assiel Kabanda?  What did you personally witness in relation to Assiel Kabanda?
A.	Regarding Kabanda, I would say that he was also a Tutsi.  He had a trade that he ran in the centre.  At the beginning of the war, that is, at the beginning of the genocide, Kabanda had a house in Bisesero, and he went to seek refuge in the Bisesero hills.  I learnt of the death of Kabanda when I saw assailants carrying his head, the head of his body.
Q.	Madam, when you say you saw assailants carrying his head, where was this?  Where did you see the assailants carrying Kabanda's head?
A.	Kabanda was a trader who bought and sold coffee.  After capturing him, his head was cut off.  His head was taken away, and the assailants were shouting that members of the population should bring coffee for Kabanda to buy.  The population ran up thinking that it was Kabanda himself who had come up.  We thought that if he had been spared, it meant that the war was going to end but, to our surprise, we saw only Kabanda's head.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  How did you identify the head as Kabanda's head?
A.	People were shouting and saying Kabanda had come; those who want to sell coffee can bring it to him.  We ran up because to all of us, it was like a play, like theatre, people ran up each time they heard of the death of someone.  And when we went to see what happened we saw the head of Kabanda.
Q.	When you saw the head of Kabanda, did you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	What do you mean?  He was the person who was always at this sort of situation.  Everything that was done was done under his supervision. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where was the head of Kabanda when you saw it?
THE WITNESS:
Are you asking me the place where I was or the place where Kabanda's head was?  Regarding the place where I was, I was at the centre, the centre wherein Mika was staying.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And where did you see the head?  Was it in possession of somebody or was it on the ground or was it -- where was it?
THE WITNESS:
The head of Kabanda was brought on a vehicle, and it was hanging on a spear.  And when they arrived, they beat the drum; they showed the head of Kabanda, and saying that people should bring coffee to Kabanda.  It was the Interahamwe who were carrying this head.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam, you indicated that Mika Muhimana was present.  I want you to explain to us how close was Mika to the Interahamwe who had the head of Kabanda?
A.	Are you asking me where I was or where Mika was?
Q.	I am asking where you were -- excuse me, I am asking where Mika was.  You indicated that the Interahamwe had the head of Kabanda.  How close was Mika Muhimana to the Interahamwe who had the head of Kabanda?
A.	All of this happened at Mika's residence because Mika was a neighbour to Kabanda.
Q.	And how close was Mika to the Interahamwe who had the head of Kabanda?
A.	Mika was standing next to the Interahamwe because he was together with the Interahamwe from Bisesero.
Q.	Did Mika say anything?
A.	He said this, "Hang this head up on his house."  He said, "My neighbour has come back."
Q.	Do you know who Mika was referring to as, "My neighbour has come back"?
A.	He was referring to the head of Kabanda.  He was asking the assailants to hang the head up on a wall of his house.
Q.	Do you know what eventually happened to the head of Kabanda?
A.	There was an old man called Ndurabiga (phonetic), who lived in the centre.  He was very much affected by the death of Kabanda.  When the head of Kabanda began to decompose, he took it off and he threw it in a toilet.
Q.	Thank you, very much, Madam Witness:  

I want us to go back to the initial events of April 1994.  Did you ever go to Mika's place of work?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	Do you recall how many times you went to this place?
A.	I went there on about three occasions.
Q.	Let's start with the first occasion.  Why did you go to Mika's place?
A.	This is why I went there.  I considered Mika as one of our relatives.  I went to ask him where I could find food to feed my children with.  I asked him for permission to harvest food from our farms to feed our children with.  I went to seek permission of him to harvest food; and Mika told me, " Why do you want to feed the children, whereas we have to kill you as well".  So I left.  So he wrote a message on a piece of paper and gave to nyumbakumi -- nyumbakumi of our area, and he told him that I no longer had the authorisation to go to our farms because he said that the food or the crops on those farms would be used as recompense -- as compensation for the assailants.
Q.	When you say you wanted to feed the children, the children had not yet been killed at this stage?
A.	That was the first time I was going there, and that was before the death of my children.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, what is nyumbakumi?
THE WITNESS:
Nyumbakumi is one of those people who are under the authority of the conseiller, and they were assigned to work in certain areas under the authority of the conseiller.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What did they do?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, your question wasn't heard by the interpreters.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What did they do, the nyumbakumi?
THE WITNESS:
They showed me a document that conseiller Mika had drafted; and that document stated that I did not have access to those plantations because all the crops on those farms would be used to feed the assailants after they returned from the attacks.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What I asked you, Witness, is what was the work of nyumbakumi. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Their functions.
THE WITNESS:
This is how I would explain it to you.  They were supposed to provide for the security of the cellule.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, Counsel.  Go on. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Why would you seek special authorisation from Mika Muhimana?  Can you explain this to the Court?
A.	It was because I considered Mika as one of my relatives.  I wanted him to give me permission so that if I was asked why I was coming back from my farm, I could show the authorisation; this would enable me to feed the members of my family. 
Q.	When that special authorisation was denied, when next did you go to Mika's office?
A.	I returned to see Mika after the death of my children.
Q.	Why did you go back to see Mika after the death of your children?
A.	He was the one who had sent for me.
Q.	When you say Mika was the one who had sent for you, can you explain; how did he send for you?
A.	He sent Interahamwe and asked them to ask me to come and see him because he had something to tell me.  And when I got to the place where he was, he immediately seized me and raped me.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  I will take you back a little bit.  Do you know the name of the Interahamwe who came to tell you that Mika wanted you to come to the office?
A.	I no longer recall the names of some them, but there was a certain Alexi, who is dead now. 
Q.	Do you recall what Alexi specifically told you?
A.	This is what he told me:  "You have to go to the secteur office". 
Q.	Did you, personally, want to go to the communal office?
A.	No, it was under duress.
Q.	When you arrived at the communal office, who was there at the office?
A.	There were Interahamwe who had been returning from attacks in Bisesero, and they were drinking beer.
Q.	In relation to the office, where were the Interahamwe drinking beer?  Was it inside the office or outside the office?
A.	It was in Mika's office, which was not far from his place of business, which was run by Interahamwe.  Mika had a business very close to his office.
Q.	When you arrived, did you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	I saw him on the spot.
Q.	When you saw Mika, did he say anything to you?
A.	I entered the house.  As a matter of fact, he wanted to pull my leg, and he was saying that I wanted to marry Tutsis.  The Tutsis had been exterminated and I had nothing to say on that -- in that regard.
Q.	When he made those comments, what did you feel?  How did you feel?
A.	You would understand that in front of such a person who could kill you or do anything, I was not at ease.  While he was saying that to me, I could not be at ease.
Q.	Thank you madam, I understand.  So what happened next?
A.	He immediately pulled me to himself, seized me by the neck and pushed me to the ground, and then he undressed me brutally and he raped me.
Q.	Madam Witness, I understand this is difficult, but it's very important for the Court to understand what happened step by step.  So I will take you back to when you said he undressed you brutally.  What were you wearing on the day in question? 
A.	I was wearing kitenge. 
Q.	Can you also tell the Court if you recall what Mika was wearing?
A.	I no longer recall the clothes he was wearing.  I cannot specify the clothes that he was wearing, but I know that he usually wore a white shirt.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  When Mika -- when you say Mika undressed you brutally, what exactly do you mean?
A.	What I mean is this: that at the time, if somebody undressed you, all he did after that was to rape you.
Q.	Did Mika himself undress?
A.	He undressed himself.
Q.	When Mika undressed and he had undressed you brutally, I now want you to explain to the Court step by step what happened, which you refer to as rape?
A.	After undressing me and after undressing himself, he simply raped me in an appalling manner.
Q.	Did Mika say anything to you after undressing you brutally?

A.	As a matter of fact, he didn't say anything to me.  He immediately jumped on me.
(Pages 26 to 43 by Judith Baverstock)




































1745H
MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Who else was in the office when Mika undressed you brutally and undressed and jumped on you?
A.	He had locked the door.  The Interahamwe were drinking outside, and screaming.
Q.	For how long did you feel that Mika raped you?
A.	I wasn't wearing a watch, but I would say that it lasted an hour.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I understand that it's difficult, but it's of paramount importance for you also to describe what you mean by rape, so I will ask you a few questions.  When Mika undressed you brutally and when Mika undressed, what did Mika do to you which you referred to as rape?
A.	As regards sexual intercourse, I know it is done usually with the consent of the parties involved, but he did so without my consent.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Did Mika have sexual intercourse with you?
A.	That is what happened.
Q.	When that happened, how did you feel?
A.	I told myself it was slow death, that I had to wait for such death in turn.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Can you explain to the court why you thought that was what you called a slow death?
A.	It was because I had realised, and I had observed that my entire family had been exterminated.  I was a widow.  My mother had been killed, and all I could expect was such death because having sexual intercourse without consent was -- because I was of the -- bad in the group, I did not have the rights that every Rwandan was entitled to.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  We want to go back to this office where you said Mika raped you.  Can you just describe to the Court the office?  For instance, what was in the office?
A.	There was a table, chairs and a cupboard in which books were arranged.
Q.	Where exactly did Mika rape you?
A.	He raped me in his office.
Q.	You indicated there were tables, chairs and files.  I mean in relation to those objects. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Ask the witness whether there was a bed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I'm indebted. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I asked you to describe the contents of this office.  The Court also wants to know whether there was a bed?
A.	There was no bed in his office.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where did the action take place?
THE WITNESS:
On the floor.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, Counsel.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	When you say the floor, can you also describe a bit whether the floor was like carpeted or cemented?  What was the condition of this floor?
A.	The floor was cemented.
Q.	Further to that, can you also describe to the Court the cement?  Was it like the smooth cement or the rough one?
A.	It was not a smooth floor.  It was rough floor.  It was an old building.  The floor was rough.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  I just want to ask you, in your evidence you said you knew Mika Muhimana.  Was Mika Muhimana married?
A.	He was married.
Q.	Did you know the wife of Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew her.
Q.	Do you know whether the wife of Mika Muhimana is still alive?
A.	She is dead.
Q.	I just want to ask you this question.  If you don't know, just indicate you don't know.  Do you know what she died of?
A.	I don't know what she died of.  She took ill.  When she went to consult a doctor, she died in the hospital.  I don't know the cause of her death because I was not her attendant.
Q.	Thank you very much, madam.  When Mika raped you, you said you felt like he raped you for the time you approximated to be an hour.  What then happened?
A.	I immediately came out of the house and I went home.  I came out of the house and I went home.
Q.	I also want you to explain to the Court how you came out, because you indicated that he had undressed you brutally.  Did you manage to dress up before leaving Mika's house? 
MS. MADENGA:  
I'm sorry, Your Honours, I wanted to say Mika's office; not Mika's house.
THE WITNESS:
I put on my clothes, by all means, and I left the office.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	When you left the office, where were the Interahamwes, because you indicated when you arrived at the office there were Interahamwes?
A.	When I came out, the Interahamwe were still there drinking beer.  They were drunk; they were dancing.  I left hastily like a thief.  I returned -- I went back home very rapidly, very quickly.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  When you say, "I left like a thief," I want to you explain to the Court how you felt when you left Mika's office?
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, I think the witness did not get the interpretation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Repeat your question.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I will repeat the question.  Can you hear me now?
A.	I can hear you, Counsel.
Q.	Thank you.  Madam Witness, you indicated that after Mika raped you, after Mika Muhimana raped you, you left the office like a thief, and I just said can you describe to the court how you felt as you left Mika Muhimana's office.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, the witness --
THE WITNESS:
I can't hear you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any problem with the interpretation?

Madam Prosecutor, please repeat your question.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I will repeat that question again.  You indicated to the Honourable Court that after Mika Muhimana raped you, you left the office and you felt like a thief.  I just want you to elaborate how you felt when you say that when you left you felt like a thief.  What do you mean?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She didn't say she felt like a thief, Counsel.
MS. MADENGA:
Left like a thief; not felt.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She said she ran very fast, and you want to know how she was feeling.
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
You would understand why when I left that place I was not feeling safe.  Deep down I was very, very shocked.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I understand.  

I now want to proceed to the third incident.  You said you went to Mika's office on three occasions.  Can you now describe under what circumstances you went to Mika's office on the third occasion?
A.	On the first occasion I told you that I went to seek his permission.  On the third occasion, it was for the same reason as the second time, and I suffered the same fate.
Q.	Let's come to this third occasion.  You say it was the same occasion as the second one.  How did you go to Mika's office?
A.	He sent Interahamwe to bring me and I went to his office under the same circumstances.  The Interahamwe were escorting me and they were carrying guns.  When I got to his office, he told me, "You know why you're here.  I have to do the same thing as I did the first time -- as I did the last time." 
Q.	Who were the Interahamwes who came on the third occasion?  Do you know the Interahamwes?
A.	Yes.  I know some of them and they are in prison back in the country.
Q.	Do you know the names of those Interahamwes?
A.	As regards the names of those Interahamwe, I told you that the first group of Interahamwes are dead.  Others are in exile, but there was a certain Burabyo and another person called Gasigwa.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
G A-S-I-G-W-A.  Burabyo is spelled as follows: B-U-R-A-B-Y-O.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam, you told the Court that the Interahamwes were armed.  Can you explain what you mean?  Armed with what?
A.	They were carrying guns.  I don't know what brand they were but -- and they were also carrying traditional weapons.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us what happened when you arrived at Mika Muhimana's office?
A.	He once more raped me.  First he tore off my clothes again and he did what he had done the previous time.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I want to you take it step by step.  I know it's difficult, but it's important for us to know what happened exactly.  On the third occasion when you went to Mika's office, who else was at Mika's office?
A.	There was still a large number of persons because meetings were being held at that place.  Before the attacks, it was at this place that meetings were held.  There was always a crowd.  When I arrived I was under escort.  I was pushed inside, and I went in.  He immediately began to take off his clothes.  He threw me onto the floor, and he made -- he did to me what he had done the previous time.
Q.	You indicated that there was a crowd.  Do you know any of the people who were present in the office?
A.	There were very many.  When you are forced, you are taken under duress, you do not have the time to try to recognise individuals.  There were many Interahamwe, many people.  When they returned from attacks, it is at this place that they drank beer, so I cannot give you any name at this time.
Q.	When you were pushed into the office, can you also describe, like you did, on the third occasion you went to the office what happened?
A.	Yes.  He did what he had done the previous time.  He asked me to take off my clothes and he said, "If you resist, I'm going to shoot you."  I took off my clothes out of fright.  He also took off his clothes and he raped me as he had raped me the previous time.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  When you say he also took off his clothes, can you tell the Court what he took off?
A.	He took off his trousers and his underwear.
Q.	On this occasion, did Mika Muhimana -- did he have sexual intercourse with you?
A.	Yes, he had sexual relations with me.
Q.	For how long did you feel that Mika had had sexual intercourse with you on this third occasion you went to the office?
A.	I was not able to estimate the time.  I wasn't wearing a watch, but this time it was a lot shorter than the previous time.  I would say that it lasted about 20 minutes.
Q.	On this third occasion, where did the sexual intercourse take place?  I know it was in the office, but where in the office?
A.	Still on the floor.  There was no bed in his office.
Q.	How did you leave Mika Muhimana's office after he had sexual intercourse with you?
Q.	Still by the same way.  I was confused.  I went out and I left.  The Interahamwe who knew me could see me and certainly he knew what had happened to me, and I went to my home.
Q.	On this third occasion, as you left and you say there were Interahamwes who knew you, how did you feel leaving Mika Muhimana's office after the rape?
A.	I understand.  My feeling of what the impression they had -- of the impression they had was that what I had gone through was worse than death.  I would have preferred that he should kill me.  After losing so many members of my family and going through that, I felt that, within myself, that it would have been better if I had been killed.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for sharing that part of your life with the Court.

I want now to move in conclusion to the last part.  You indicated in your evidence that your children were killed.  What happened to your mother?
A.	My mother was killed at the same time as my children.
Q.	Madam Witness, were you approached by the investigator on the 18th of March 2004?
A.	Yes, they came to see me.
Q.	Did you make any indications to the investigator?
A.	They asked me questions regarding the place where my children were killed and the place where my husband was killed.
Q.	With the leave of the Court, Madam Witness, I want to show you certain photographs and I will invite a comment from you.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, Madam President, I want to refer to the Prosecution Exhibit No. 2.  Specifically I want to go to page 193 of Prosecution Exhibit No. 2, and for this exercise, Your Worship, I would also humbly make a request that the protected witness be also protected by drawn curtains, since I will ask the witness to move from the witness stand to come to the projector so that she can indicate to the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you are referring to which photograph?  Please could you repeat the number? 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I'm referring to Prosecution Exhibit No. 2.  I'm referring specifically to page 193.
JUDGE SHORT:
You said 192 or 193?
MS. MADENGA:
Pardon, Your Honours, I said page 193.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Photograph of the investigator; are you referring to that one? 
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Your Honour, that's correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  You want the witness to move to the projector.
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the witness can go there -- to the projector.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you have a look at that photograph?  Do you recognise this photo?
A.	I recognise on this picture the house of my parents.
Q.	Can you please mark which one you are recognising as the house of your parents?
A.	(Witness marks photograph)
Q.	Can you also indicate on the photograph where your children were killed?
A.	(Witness marks photograph)
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Can you also indicate where you were standing whilst your children were being killed?
A.	Do you want me to mark the place? 
Q.	Before I ask the --
A.	It is here.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
And the witness has indicated the place.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The photograph on the screen is not very clear.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, there are two photographs on page 193.  The first indications the witness has marked relates to the first photograph.  Now I'm asking her another question as to where the children were killed, so she is now marking on the second photograph on the same page, page 193 of Prosecution Exhibit No. 2.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Do you recognise the second photograph?
A.	Yes, I recognise the second picture, too.
Q.	Do you recognise the house on that photograph?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Whose house is that?
A.	That is my parent's house.
Q.	In relation to your parent's house, where were you standing when your children were killed?  Can you mark on the photograph?
A.	All right.  (Witness marks photograph)
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You also indicated in your evidence that Mika Muhimana was standing close to you.  Can you mark where Mika Muhimana was standing in relation to where the children were killed?
A.	(Witness marks photograph)
MS. MADENGA:
On this one, Your Honour, I want to refer the witness to the first photo on the same page, 193.  It's page 193 of the same Exhibit 2, Prosecution Exhibit 2.  With your leave, Your Honour, can I just take the witness back to the previous question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MS. MADENGA:
Yes. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	To clarify matters, let's go back to photo No. 2.  You have already identified that is the house of your parents.  What I now want you to indicate on that photograph, which is on page 193 of Prosecution 2, is where Mika Muhimana was standing when your children were being killed?
A.	It was here.  I have already showed it to you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness indicates on the picture.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now that I have already done that, we will end with the first picture again.  I want you again to confirm by indicating where your children were killed, the place where your children were killed?
A.	I didn't understand your question properly.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  I will repeat the question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Juma, can you give the witness a marker?
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	So the question is where were your children killed.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, the witness is waiting for a marker.
(Witness marks photograph)
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
Before I proceed, Your Honour, because I still have one more photograph to show to the witness, at this stage I would request the Court to accept the photographs, that is the photograph on page 193, photograph 192, the indications by the witness.  Can they be accepted as Prosecution Exhibit 2C, if I'm not mistaken.  So, to make it very clear, I would actually tender the first photograph as Prosecution Exhibit P. 2C and the subsequent photograph on the same page, 193, as Exhibit 2PD (sic).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So admitted as Exhibit P. 2C the first photograph, and the second photograph, Exhibit P. 2D. 
(Exhibit Nos. P. 2C and P. 2D admitted)
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  With your leave, Your Honour, I want now to move back to the same exhibit, Prosecution Exhibit 2.  I'm now specifically referring to page 189. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you have a look at the photograph on the projector on page 189.  Do you recognise the house appearing on the photograph?
A.	Yes, I recognise the house.
Q.	Whose house is this?
A.	It is Mika's house.
Q.	In relation to Mika's house, can you indicate where the secteur office, Mika's office, you referred to in your evidence, is?
A.	It was just next to Mika's house.
Q.	Can you indicate on the photograph what you mean by "next to Mika's house"?
A.	Yes, I can do it.
Q.	Proceed, madam.
A.	(Witness indicates)
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, My Lord, the Prosecution wants to tender the indications on Prosecution Exhibit 2, the indications made by the witness on page 189 as Prosecution Exhibit P. 2E.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, it has already been exhibited as Exhibit P. 2A.  You are referring to the first photograph on page 189? 
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Your Honour, but the specific reference I'm making is where the witness indicated the building she says was the secteur office which is adjacent to Mika's house.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You want this office to be exhibited as Exhibit P. 2E.
MS. MADENGA:
P. 2E, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The office in the photograph.
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Before we leave this photograph, Madam Witness, you indicated in your evidence that you were raped at Mika's office.  Can you indicate where the office is?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Again?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, go on.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, Counsel, you can clarify.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam, you can proceed.
A.	Do you want me to show you the office?  I didn't understand your question.
Q.	I will repeat the question, Madam Witness.  You have already indicated what you called the office, but I now want you to indicate the place where you said you were raped by Mika Muhimana.
A.	It is right here in the secteur office.
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  I will just suggest that it remains Prosecution Exhibit P. 2E, since it's within the parameters of that exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So entered as Exhibit P. 2E. 
(Exhibit No. P. 2E admitted)
MS. MADENGA:
The last photograph I want to refer the witness to is on page 191 of the Prosecution Exhibit 2.  With your assistance, Registry, I want to show the witness the second photograph on Prosecution Exhibit P. 2 on page 191.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you recognise the photograph in front of you?
A.	Yes, I recognise the picture.
Q.	Do you recognise the buildings on the picture?
A.	I recognise them.
Q.	Can you tell the Court what's this building on your right, on the far right?
A.	These are stores.  These stores are close to that of Kabanda, whom I have referred to and about whom I said that he was -- his throat was cut.
Q.	Do you also see the electricity pole on the photograph?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you are referring to the second paragraph on page 191?
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Your Honour, I'm referring to page 191 of Prosecution Exhibit No. 2 and I'm specifically referring to the second photograph, and I'd ask Madam Witness -- I had drawn her attention to the electricity pole because I want to ask her to clarify one thing on this one.
THE WITNESS:
I recognise this pole.  These poles are next to the store of the man whose head was cut off.  I know everything that is shown on the photo.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, I'm not tendering this last photograph as an exhibit.  

Thank you, madam.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
Madam Witness, you can go back. 
MS. MADENGA:
If I can proceed, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness for sharing with the Court. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, this will be the end of my examination-in-chief.  Thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

Madam Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Defence counsel on your left.  Please try to answer the questions as briefly as you can.  

Professor Songa, please, can you go ahead. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, you stated that you learnt of President Habyarimana's death over Radio Rwanda on the morning of 7th April, and that at the time of those events you were living with your husband and five children in Gishyita; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was your reaction to the news?
A.	What else could my reaction have been, having seen that our neighbours were beginning to go into hiding, and that Tutsis were being sought after to be killed by decapitation?  And we began to understand that there was a war going on.
Q.	In your personal particulars, your civil status is indicated as remarried.
A.	Yes, I got married again.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, would you mind if I continued putting questions to this witness on her civil status.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can ask questions, but they should not disclose her identity.

MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And they must be questions arising from the examination-in-chief and not off the point.
MR. SONGA:
I will try to make an effort, Madam President, to stick to the statement of the witness.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	For how long had you been married, Witness, at the time of the events?
A.	I do not know exactly for how long I had been married.  All I know is that I had five children, so at the beginning of the war, I already had five children, but I do not know for how long I had been married.
Q.	At the time of the events, Witness, what were the names of your children, and what were their respective ages?
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, Madam President, I would suggest that all identities of the children be in writing since she's a protected witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I suggest that the professor applies for a closed session.  Otherwise this kind of evidence will obviously become close to identifying the witness, and it may be easier to do it in a closed session than in open session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor Songa, what do you have to say? 
MR. SONGA:
If such is the wish of the Court, I have no objection to the court going into closed session for this line of questioning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have any objection to the closed session? 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  What I just want to ascertain from my learned colleague is the relevance of this kind of questioning before we even indicate whether we have an objection to a closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, what is the purpose of this question?  She has already given the ages of her children, and for what purpose you need the names of her children?  Could you please clarify? 
MR. SONGA:
It is likely that I did not take notice of them initially, but the purpose of my question is with regard to the fact that at one time, in view of all the movements of the changes in the witness's status, marital status, it may be necessary to put questions to her regarding her position with regard to the events she is testifying to.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, what I personally don't understand is what it is you are -- what is the point you are going to be bringing home by the names of the children, which, of course, comes close to identifying the witness?  Why do you want the children named? 
MR. SONGA:
A while ago I said, Madam President, that the change in the marital status of the witness was such that we may have to put some questions to her to clarify the matter as to whether she was present on the ground where these events she is testifying to were committed.  I want to know the names of the children in order to be able to relate them to either the first marriage or the second marriage.  That is why I want to put those questions to the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, first we have to establish as to how many times the witness got married.
MR. SONGA:
The question has just been asked, Madam President, and her answer was that she was not aware.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you ask her as to how many times she had married? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I at least made allusion to that since I said that in her personal particulars she mentions the fact that she remarried.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How many times?  Ask the question.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, that question was not understood by the interpreters because the microphone was on late.
JUDGE MUTHOGA: 
I asked the question if he asked her how many times she had remarried so that we know how and in what sequence the children are going to be named.
MR. SONGA:
You are suggesting that I should put that question directly to the witness? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, of course.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, how many times did you remarry?
A.	I remarried after the war, so that was the second time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, does this answer suggest that your five children were from one man, from the first husband who had been killed during the war?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  The five children, I had them with my first husband who was killed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Who was killed during the events?
A.	Yes, who was killed during the events.
Q.	For how long were you married to your first husband?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, she has already explained to you that she did not remember for how long she was married before the war.
MR. SONGA:
Of course.  I think there is something subtle here.  The question was whether you were married, and the second question was for how long.  Perhaps it's more or less the same question, Madam President, but there is some slight distinction.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We don't see any distinction.  Please move on to another question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, what were your successive residences with regard to your first husband, where you lived with your first husband?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Hold on, Witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, are you not really seeking to establish these particulars which are part of the protected information?  Are you not on the road to identifying this witness? 
MR. SONGA:
I had already conceded to Madam President and Your Honours that if there was risk of identification of the witness, we could proceed to a closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  It will be in the interests of the witness if there is a closed session.  My only worry was that the line of questioning, to my own opinion, does not seem relevant because, in all due respect, the Professor will know that his client is entitled to public hearing.  That is the reason why we did not apply for a closed session, and now that he is eliciting aspects which I don't consider to be relevant to what was elicited in the examination-in-chief, I'm not very sure what my learned colleague is seeking to achieve.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The relevancy of the question will be seen when the question is asked, so we go into closed session.  Mr. Juma, please arrange for closed session. 

Professor Songa, we believe that you will remain within the ambit of examination-in-chief and would not go off the point.

Mr. Juma, switch off the televisions in the public gallery. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 59] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 44 to 58 by Trevor Gerbes)




















MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are now in open session, so be careful not to disclose your identity.

Professor Songa, can you proceed now?  We still have ten minutes.
MR. SONGA:
Fortunately, we have only ten minutes. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, we were talking about the 7th April, and you stated that on the 7th April your husband is the person who informed you that the Hutus had started looting Tutsi property, and to convince you that that was the case, he took you outside the house to show you some cases; is that correct?
A.	Yes, he took me out to show me what was happening in the neighbourhood, and I saw what was happening in my neighbour's houses.  I witnessed acts of looting of the property of Tutsis.  They were already beginning to destroy houses and to kill people.
Q.	What time was it at that time?
A.	I cannot give an estimate of the time, but immediately after the president's death, those acts started in the morning with killings, and it lasted throughout the month of April, May and June, but I do not know what time it was because I wasn't wearing a watch.  I wasn't a state employee to afford a watch and to be in service.
Q.	From what distance were you -- at what distance were you from your house when you came out of the house?
A.	It was very close to my house because my neighbours started looting and killing, so it was very close to my house.
Q.	What I want to know is whether you stayed just in front of the door or whether you took a few steps to go into the road?  That is the purpose of my question. 
A.	Do you think in such a difficult situation someone could have gone out to be seen?  I tried to hide and to see what was happening from a distance.
Q.	What do you mean, "from a distance"?
A.	What I mean is that I just went in front of the house and I could see what was happening.
Q.	Were you alone or with your husband?
A.	I was with my husband and our children as well as other Tutsi neighbours who were beginning to be afraid.  They were assembling to see what was happening.
Q.	You stated that all this happened when you were -- that while you were observing the destruction of houses, Mika, Sikubwabo, and a communal policeman known as Manassé Ntwaronzima, one Ruhindura Rwigimba, and a large civilian population, and you said that when arrived, they arrived suddenly.  They arrived from where, precisely?
A.	They had already started committing their acts.  They were assailants.  There were no roadblocks. and they went on carrying out those acts.  Nobody could stop them.  There were no roadblocks that could stop them, so they continued doing -- carrying out those acts.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  The names that you cited, do you know any of those persons personally?
A.	Are you referring to the persons who were with Mika?  I did not quite understand your question.
Q.	Exactly.  I'm referring to the persons you mentioned as having accompanied Mika.
A.	We knew each other because I lived very close to the communal office, so I could see them quite often.
Q.	You said that Ruhindura was killed in an attack late on Bisesero hill; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  That was when he was killed.
Q.	Do you know who killed him?
A.	No, I did not find out who killed him.
Q.	And the attack led on Bisesero hill, who told you that attack took place?
A.	People were talking about it because many Tutsis had sought refuge on that hill, so all the attacks converged on that hill, and those who were not participating in those attacks went to kill civilian populations in other villages.
Q.	Can you specify the date?
A.	I have not quite understood your question, Counsel.
Q.	We are still talking about the attack in Bisesero during which Ruhindura was killed.  Can you give an idea as to the date of that event?
A.	I am not aware of that.  I was still with my children who were still alive, so I did not pay attention to what happened to the police officer.  People came from Bisesero and they told us that that police officer had been killed on that hill in Bisesero, so I was not able to know the date or the time because I did not seek any information to know any more than I knew.
Q.	You did not know who led that attack as well?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, if I remember the evidence of this witness, it wasn't that she personally witnessed the attack in Bisesero hill, that she received reports that the policeman had been killed.  I mean, asking her whether she knew who was leading the attack when she hasn't said when she was present at the attack is clearly misleading.
MR. SONGA:
May I proceed, Your Honours?  I take note of your remark. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, is this the right time to stop for the day? 
MR. SONGA:
It is you, Madam President, who asked me to proceed, and that is why I proceeded.  Otherwise I would have preferred that we stop a lot earlier.  I, myself, am very tired.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Madam Witness, we are still continuing with your evidence and you will resume your evidence tomorrow afternoon under the same oath.  Please do not communicate or discuss your evidence with anyone outside the Court.  

Thank you.  We will adjourn and resume tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.  
(Court adjourned at 1900H)
