(Exhibit No. P. 21 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you some questions in relation to the events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994.  Do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I understand you. 
Q.	When, Mr. Witness, did you hear of the death of the president of Rwanda in 1994?  Can you tell us that, please?
A.	On 7th of April 1994 I learnt of this information from the radio.
Q.	Having heard of the information on the radio, can you tell us whether or not you remained at your residence, or you left your residence to go elsewhere?
A.	On that day we stayed at home because the radio had asked everyone to stay at home for security reasons.
Q.	Did you remain indoors throughout the 7th of April, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What about the following day, the 8th of April?  Can you tell us what was the general situation in your area at that time, sir?
A.	We went to a certain region in the environs, that is Mubuga and Gishyita, and also on that day a grenade was launched against an old man -- thrown at an old man who died from the effects.
Q.	When you say "we", who do you refer to, apart from yourself?
A.	I was with other members of my family and members of the population who were our neighbours.
Q.	Let's talk about the members of your family that you refer to, Mr. Witness.  How many members of your family were alive on 8th April 1994?
A.	We were a large family.  I'm not able to tell you about the number or how many we were because we had paternal uncles; we had other members of our family.  There were about 100 of us.
Q.	Were you, yourself, married in April 1994?
A.	No.  I was still young.  I was a bachelor, and indeed I am still a bachelor.
Q.	Do you recall how old you were in April 1994, sir?
A.	I was 17 years old.
Q.	Do you remember what you did on the 9th of April 1994?
A.	As I said, the war almost began on the 8th, but in the locations that surrounded the place where we were living, on the 9th, there was a real attack.  This attack began in the morning and came from Musenyi centre and Gishyita secteur.  It is at that time that the residents of our area, the Tutsi, were attacked by people who came from Gishyita and Musenyi.  From the start, it was said that it was a group of robbers who wanted to loot, and this was said because a similar situation had occurred in 1992 and 1993, where bandits attacked Mara, Murangara and Ngoma secteurs.  The gendarmerie and the government at the time ended this sort of thing.  

When we were attacked, we began to throw stones at these assailants to defend ourselves, and in fact some Hutus did not think that it was the genocide that was beginning, so there was a small group of Hutus that joined the Tutsi to repel these bandits.  We continued throwing stones at them, but leaders of the commune, including policemen who had joined the bandits, and this included the bourgmestre of 1994, who was called Charles Sikubwabo.  Amongst these people was also the conseiller of Gishyita secteur, who was called Mika.  The group of bandits also included Muhira , who was the conseiller of Musenyi secteur, so these are the people who were leading this attack, because if these people were not part of the bandits, they would have tried to stop them and prevent them from killing people.

On that day, the assailants wounded four persons who were taken to Ngoma hospital where there was semblance of security, and when I refer to Ngoma, you must understand that this is the Mugonero hospital which is in Ngoma secteur.  These four wounded people were killed in this hospital when the hospital was attacked, and there were also many other victims in the hospital, so we continued to try to repel the assailants with stone-throwing, and amongst these assailants there were policemen who were shooting at us.  At one time they ran out of ammunition.  Mika resupplied them.  At a given time they withdrew to Dukoni, and we went to Rurebero hill.  The Hutu were below and we were on top of the hill and between us there was a coffee farm, which is why the assailants did not have many victims.  And since we were with Hutus, perhaps the assailants did not wish to kill us all because there were Hutu amongst us.

After Dukoni, the assailants continued their activities and the gendarmes joined the assailants and I think that these gendarmes came from Kibuye because it is in Kibuye that a gendarmerie outpost was found.  These gendarmes called the Hutu and the Tutsi.  They asked the Hutu to stop attacking the Tutsi, and they asked the Tutsi to join them at the place where they were, promising them that they would provide security, claiming that the group of assailants was comprised only of bandits.  But we did not believe them because amongst the bandits there were members of the local administration, but given that the members of the -- or the administrative officials had accepted to join the assailants, and considering that there were also gendarmes, we did not have a choice.  We joined them where they were at the time and they asked us to give up our arms, so we were disarmed and our weapons were stored in the house of a certain Casimir.  I no longer remember his family name.  

The Tutsi went back to their homes and the wounded were taken to the hospital, but I did not see them again.  In the meantime, the Tutsi decided to organise night patrols to repel any possible attacks and inform others by beating the drum.  This is what happened on the 9th.  

However, I forgot to tell you that the conseiller, Mika, himself, was part of the group that was shooting at us.  He actually shot at and hit a young man who was near me.  He hit him in the thigh.  The young man fell, and if you wish, I can give you his name.  His name was called -- he was called Emmanuel and he was studying in Nyamasheke.  Afterwards he was taken to Ngoma hospital.  

That is what I can tell you regarding the date of the 9th.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, I'm going to ask you some specific questions in relation to your narration of what happened on the 9th.  Do you understand that, sir?
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	You have described some people as the leaders of the commune, leaders in the commune.  You've also made reference to the local administration.  Now, can you tell us who Charles Sikubwabo was again?
A.	Sikubwabo was bourgmestre at the time.  It was he who ran Gishyita commune.
Q.	And the person you referred to as Mika, did he have a surname, a family name, do you know?
A.	Mika is called Muhimana.
Q.	What work did he do?
A.	It is he who was the conseiller of Gishyita secteur.
Q.	You've also described to us how you saw policemen shooting on the 9th April during this attack.  Do you know where these policemen came from, sir?
A.	As regards these communal policemen, other policemen that I saw on that day came from Musenyi secteur, but on that day, I cannot tell you exactly from what area they came.  Perhaps they came from the communal office where they had performed guard duty during the night, but I think they came from the communal office because during that time, nobody had the authorisation to keep a weapon with him at home.
Q.	How were you able to recognise these people as policemen when you saw them on 9th of April, 
Mr. Witness?
A.	I knew them well before.
Q.	Were they dressed in any particular manner on that day, sir?
A.	Yes, they were wearing their police -- communal police uniform of the time.
Q.	You also talked about the policemen shooting at you and running out of ammunition and that they were supplied by Mika.  Do you recall telling us that?
A.	Yes, I remember this.
Q.	Was this something you saw, yourself, Mr. Witness, or was this something that you were told, the supplying of ammunition to these policemen by Mika?  Can you help us with that?
A.	I was an eyewitness to this.
Q.	Were you able to ascertain what sort of ammunition was being supplied to the policemen?
A.	I knew that they were cartridges, but I was not able to distinguish them from other kinds of munitions.
Q.	Were you able to ascertain where Mika had obtained the ammunition from before supplying the ammunition to the policemen on this day, sir?
A.	I don't know from where he received this ammunition, but in any case, it may have been from the communal office, but I'm not very sure about this.
Q.	Do you recall how Mika Muhimana, himself, was dressed on 9th April when you saw him, sir?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
On the night of? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The 9th; not "night".
THE WITNESS:
He was wearing civilian clothing.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Was he armed?
A.	He was carrying a gun.
Q.	Are you able to ascertain what sort of gun he was carrying, sir?
A.	I was not able to determine various types of guns, but it was long gun.
Q.	You also described to us seeing some gendarmes amongst the assailants on this day.  Now, can you tell us how you were able to recognise these people as gendarmes?
A.	I recognised them from their outfit.
Q.	How were they dressed?
A.	They were wearing military uniforms, red berets that the gendarmes used to wear during that period.
Q.	Roughly, how many gendarmes did you see on this day, Mr. Witness?
A.	I did not count them.  There weren't that many, given that they came on board a single vehicle.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified that you witnessed an attack on certain people, and if I remember your testimony correctly, you testified that those who were attacked were made up of Tutsi and Hutu; is that correct, sir?
A.	That is what I told you.
Q.	Can you explain to us why that was, if you know?
A.	I think I explained this.  At the beginning of the war when the attackers targeted us, people thought it's thugs that were attacking us, and that is why the Tutsis and some Hutus came together to try to repel the attacks, and you're aware that not all Hutus were guilty of genocide.  There were some Hutus who tried to defend Tutsis.  At the beginning of the attacks, therefore, Hutus and Tutsis wanted to repel the attacks together, because there were Hutus who were not aware that there was a plan that was designed to exterminate the Tutsis, so subsequently Hutus distinguished themselves from the Tutsis, but before, they fought together to repel the attacks.
Q.	You testified that you saw Mika shoot somebody called Emmanuel; do you recall saying that, sir?
A.	Yes, I do recall that.
Q.	Who was Emmanuel?
A.	Emmanuel was a young man, a student in the Nyamasheke secondary school.
Q.	What ethnic group did Emmanuel belong to, Mr. Witness?
A.	He was a Tutsi.
Q.	How old was Emmanuel, sir, on that day?
A.	I did not know his age, but I can reckon that he was between 18 and 20.
Q.	Had you known Emmanuel before you saw him on that day, sir?
A.	I knew him well before because we went to the same school, the same primary school, and at secondary school we attended secondary schools that were close to one another.
Q.	Exactly where were you located, Mr. Witness, when you saw Emmanuel being shot at?  Where were you?
A.	He was close to me.
Q.	In relation to Mika, how near or far away were you from Mika at this time, sir?
A.	I will try to make an estimate.  He was at a distance of about 20 metres, say between 20 and 30 metres.
Q.	You've testified that Emmanuel was close to you.  Can you also, using metres, describe how close your position was to Emmanuel's position at this time?
A.	Are you talking about a distance in terms of metres between the young man and myself, or between him and Mika?
Q.	No, between the young man and yourself, sir -- Emmanuel and yourself?
A.	He was at about two or three metres from where I was.  He was quite close to me.  If I tried to estimate it, you will see the point from there to here would represent the distance that separated us.
Q.	Was Mika the only member of the local administration that was armed with a gun on that day, sir?
A.	Mika was carrying a gun, Sikubwabo as well, as well as communal policemen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was the distance between Emmanuel and Mika when he was shot at by Mika?
THE WITNESS:
I just explained this.  I said it was between 20 and 30 metres.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now we are asking the distance between Mika and Emmanuel.
THE WITNESS:
That is exactly the distance that I tried to estimate.  It was between 20 and 30 metres.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you just told us that there were other persons armed, like Sikubwabo, and my question to you just before the President asked you her question was how, then, were you able to tell that the person who shot Emmanuel was, indeed, Mika, and not somebody else?
A.	I could see him in front of me.  There were few guns.  I could see him clearly.
Q.	Having been shot by Mika on this day, do you know what happened to Emmanuel, sir?  You told us that he was taken to the hospital, but do you know what happened to him after that?
A.	He was shot on the foot, he fell down.  We tried to move him towards the foot of a hill, and after those gendarmes had left, those gendarmes who had said that the war had stopped and after having disarmed civilians, people took the wounded, and there were four of them, and these people, therefore, were brought to the Mugonero hospital.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see Emmanuel again after the incident on 9th April, sir?
A.	I never saw him again.
Q.	Turning to the next day, the following day, 10 April, can you tell us what the situation was on that day, sir?
A.	In that locality, there really wasn't war.  Rather, the attacks were led there on the 11th of April.
Q.	Sorry, I didn't catch the last part of your response.  There wasn't war on the 10th, but what happened on the 11th, sir?
A.	It is on 11th April that attacks began.  On the 10th, there really wasn't war.  I can't quite explain this, but that's what happened.
Q.	Very well.  Let's talk about the 11th April when you say the attacks began.  Can you tell us what form those attacks on 11th April took, sir?
A.	Those were attacks that were launched by Hutus, because there were no longer any Hutus with the Tutsis, an attack that came from Musenyi and led by Mugemba (phonetic) who was a former communal conseiller, so those attacks were also coming from Kiziba, whereas another attack came from Gishyita after the one that I just talked about, and the attack comprised many persons coming from Rwanda and led by Mika, so attacks came from Kiziba.  People defended themselves with stones and by using traditional weapons against the Hutus who were equipped with traditional weapons and others with guns, but subsequently it rained and the attacks stopped and people took back their position, but after it stopped raining, the attacks resumed, and at Kiziba several persons fell and died, and their bourgmestre, Sikubwabo, himself, came, and the Tutsis started weakening.  The Hutus were stronger because they had reinforcements coming to join them.  The attacks, therefore, moved from the Musenyi secteur given that the Tutsis were fleeing towards the Bisesero secteur in the Nyarutovu cellule, and it is there at Nyarutovu that the Hutus waited a bit and it appeared to us that they were holding a meeting.  The bourgmestre, Sikubwabo, was present.  There were clashes.  The Tutsis took refuge at Ngendombi, and it was still at Nyarutovu the soldiers and civilians came and we could not identify them.  They came and fired at people and that was towards the evening at Ngendombi.  Mika, himself, was present.  He was amongst those who were shooting at people.  

What I can recall with respect to Mika is that at Ngendombi, four persons died because a grenade had been thrown, and Mika said the following: "The person who will kill Kabanda will be compensated," and towards the evening of the 11th April, the Hutus went back home and the civilians were the first to go home, whereas the leaders, as well as the soldiers that were equipped with guns, continued to shoot at people, and which was some diversionary tactic that were meant to allow the civilians to go back home first.  They, themselves, later went home as well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you talked about throwing of the grenades.  Can you recall who had thrown the grenades?
THE WITNESS: 
I don't know the person who threw the grenade.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know the location where it was thrown?
THE WITNESS: 
It was at a place called Ngendombi.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the attack that you described as having occurred on the 11th April, did that attack take place at Kiziba, or did the attackers come from Kiziba?  Can you clarify that, please?
A.	As I said earlier, the attackers came from Gishyita and Kiziba, but the attack took place at Kiziba.  People fought against each other at Kiziba.  The others took refuge at Ngendombi and at Bisesero, but the Hutus were chasing them and were cutting them down with machetes.
Q.	Those who you describe as Hutu, can you tell me how you were able to recognise these people as such, and whether or not they were civilians or law enforcement agents?  Can you help me with that?
A.	There were state agents, including Sikubwabo, Mika and a Kananura as well as some policemen.  There were soldiers, whereas the others were mere members of the population; therefore civilians.
Q.	Was it only one attack that you witnessed on 11th, or were there several attacks during that day?  Can you help us with that?
A.	I was an eyewitness to the attack that took place at Kiziba, as well as at Nyarutovu and Ngendombi.
Q.	In which of those three attacks did you see Mr. Muhimana, or did you see him in all of them?
A.	He took part in all three attacks.  It was only at the Rwigimba attack that he didn't take part.  Otherwise he was present in all the others.
Q.	Let's talk now about the Kiziba attack.  What time of the day did that attack take place, sir?
A.	That attack began in the morning.
Q.	At what stage did you see Mr. Muhimana?  What did you see him do at Kiziba?
A.	Mika came there to Kiziba with the others and he came to kill because he was wearing a gun.
Q.	Did you see him kill anyone at Kiziba, sir?
A.	People died at Kiziba.  There are some who were cut up.  Many people were shooting at people.  I can't exactly say if this or that -- who the person was the author of this or that person's death.  I can't say if the people died later from gunshot by Muhimana or Sikubwabo.  What is clear is that they killed people.
Q.	And the attack at Nyarutovu, do you know what time that attack started, or was it part of the Kiziba attack?
A.	I can't say at what time the attack began, since it took place after the assailants had chased refugees, but the attack ended towards the evening, say at about 5 p.m., 5:30 p.m.
Q.	Can you give us an idea of the number -- the total number of assailants that you saw attack at Kiziba and Nyarutovu on this day?
A.	There were many people, especially as reinforcements kept coming up.  At the beginning, the attacks comprised about 100 people, but the reinforcements came from time to time and towards 12 midday and 1 p.m., there was a sizeable number of people.  I can't give you the precise number of persons who were part of that attack.
Q.	In terms of location, can you tell us if Kiziba is a cellule or a secteur?  Can you help me with the --
A.	Kiziba is not a cellule, it is a commercial centre, a small centre.  There were traders who were selling banana beer and some foodstuff.  It wasn't a prosperous centre.  It was found in the Karama cellule in the Musenyi centre.
Q.	Thank you.  What about Nyarutovu?  Can you tell us if that was a secteur or a cellule?
A.	Nyarutovu is one of the cellules of the Bisesero secteur.
Q.	Ngendombi -- what was that?  A secteur or a cellule?
A.	Ngendombi is a name in that locality and it is found between the Nyarutovu secteur and the Gitwa secteur.
Q.	Can you tell us roughly what the distance was between these three places, Kiziba, Nyarutovu and Ngendombi?  Can you tell us, if you recall, how far these three places were from each other?
A.	Kiziba is in the Karama cellule between the Nyarutovu cellule.  Well, I didn't measure the distance between those localities, but from Kiziba towards Nyarutovu, there is a distance that can be covered in 15 minutes if you are tracking, and from Kiziba to Ngendombi, you can walk for about 20 to 30 minutes if you are walking at normal pace.
Q.	Finally, you testified that on 11th April, you heard Mika pass some comments about a man called Kambanda (sic).  Do you recall telling us that, sir?
A.	Mika said that whoever was going to kill Kabanda would be given compensation -- would be compensated.
Q.	Who was Kambanda?
A.	Kabanda was a Tutsi businessman operating in the Gishyita centre.
Q.	Do you recall the location that you were when you heard Mika offer this -- pass this comments about Kambanda?  Where were you located, sir?
A.	I was with my Tutsi companions at Ngendombi.
Q.	Do you also recall the distance between yourself and Mr. Muhimana when you heard him say these things?
A.	I will try to make an estimate, since we did not use a tape to measure it.  It is an accident that this report has been drawn up by the gendarmes so the distance was between 20 and 30 metres.
Q.	To whom was Mr. Muhimana talking when he spoke these words that you heard?
A.	He was talking to the Interahamwe who were with him.
Q.	In what language was he speaking, sir?
A.	He was speaking in Kinyarwandan, since those to whom he was talking didn't speak any other language.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know how many people died following the attack of 11th April that you witnessed?  Do you know the total number of people that may have died following that attack, sir?
A.	Many people died, but I recall that four persons died at Ngendombi.  As concerns the other attacks like below, many people died there.
Q.	Still in the month of April, sir, did you see Mika Muhimana or any of the authorities again during the month of April 1994, sir?
A.	A week went by without my seeing Mika, but I later saw him at Bisesero at a place called Uwingabo and also at a place called Gitwa.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I don't see the spelling of Uwingabo in my spelling list, so I'll spell it for the record.  It's U-W-I-N-G-A-B-O.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you able to tell us when it was in April that you saw Mr. Muhimana at the place you call Uwingabo?
A.	It was towards the end of the month of April.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he say "a month April?"
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
"Towards the end of April."  That's what I heard.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you also tell us, Mr. Witness, if Uwingabo and Gitwa are around the same place, or are they different places?  Can you help me with that, please?
A.	Those two localities are found in two different places.  When you come from Gishyita, you cross Gitwa and then you reach Uwingabo, but when you are coming from the Gisovu direction, you first of all pass through Uwingabo.
Q.	What is Uwingabo?  Is it a secteur, a cellule, a hill?  Can you help us with that sort of a description, please?
A.	It is a hill known as Uwingabo, but there is also a cellule known by the same name.
Q.	So which is the subject of your testimony; the hill or the cellule, sir?
A.	I saw Mika in Uwingabo cellule.
Q.	The area you refer to as Gitwa, can you tell us whether or not that is indeed a cellule or a hill?  What is that location, sir?
A.	It is a cellule.
Q.	You've also described to us how you -- which of these places you arrive at first, depending where you are coming from, but can you tell us what the distance is roughly between Uwingabo and Gitwa?
A.	These are two neighbouring cellules.  Between those two cellules, there is a distance of about two kilometres from where I saw Mika.
Q.	Let's talk about this attack where you saw Mika?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We didn't get this answer.  The distance between these two cellules were two kilometres.  Is this what he said?
MR. ADEOGUN -PHILLIPS:
That's what I thought he said, two kilometres.  The distance from where he saw Mika.  
THE WITNESS: 
I said that from Gitwa, from where I saw Mika, up to Uwingabo where I saw him again on that day, the distance is between two and three kilometres.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, now, can we talk about this day at the end of April.  Which attack did you witness first, the one at Uwingabo or the one at Gitwa?
A.	That started in Gitwa.  People attacked, they confronted the Hutus and subsequently they sought refuge in Uwingabo in a place called Muhira.
Q.	The attack that you describe at Gitwa and Uwingabo, would I be correct in saying that those attacks took place on the same day, sir?
A.	The attack took place on the same day at very close intervals.
Q.	What were you doing, yourself, at Gitwa and Uwingabo on this day, sir?  What were you doing there?
A.	I was leading or assisting the others in throwing stones at the assailants.
Q.	And the people you referred to as the others are who?  Who are the others?
A.	I am referring to all the people who were attacked by the assailants, that is all the Tutsis who were in Bisesero.
Q.	In relation to the area of Bisesero, how far or close was this area you refer to as Gitwa and Uwingabo.  In relation to Bisesero where were these places?
A.	Gitwa and Uwingabo are situated in Bisesero.  I have explained that these are two bordering cellules.  I stated that when you are coming from Gishyita and going towards Uwingabo, you first of all pass through Gitwa.  I also said that when you are coming from Gisovu and going downhill, you first cross Uwingabo cellule.
Q.	What were you doing in Bisesero at this time, sir?
A.	I had sought refuge there like everyone else who were hiding in Bisesero hills.
Q.	Why had you and others sought refuge in the Bisesero hills?
A.	The Bisesero region is constituted of two hills.  There are also forests.  People sought refuge there in order to hide and defend themselves from uphill, from where they could throw stones at the assailants.
Q.	Going back to the attack that you told us about at the end of April, where exactly were you located when you saw the first attack involving Mika Muhimana at the end of April, sir?
A.	The first attack at Gitwa, during which I saw Mika, I was also in Gitwa.  It was a time when millet was almost ripe and we were hiding in millet farms such that the assailants could not see us.  I was in a millet farm above the road.
Q.	What exactly did you see Mika doing at Gitwa at the end of April 1994, sir?
A.	He was shooting at refugees who were at that place.  I mean Tutsi refugees.
Q.	Was Mr. Muhimana alone when you saw him shooting at refugees at the end of April at Gitwa?
A.	You would understand that it was an impossible situation.  One person couldn't shoot at a whole crowd unless he was shooting from a plane.  He was with other assailants.
Q.	Very well, and were you able to recognise who these assailants were?
A.	Among the assailants were our neighbours, as well as Sikubwabo and many other people.  I could recognise some of them, but I didn't recognise others.
Q.	Do you know if anyone died as a result of the attack at Gitwa hill?
A.	People died, but I am not in a position to say who killed them.  Some died from gunshot wounds, others were cut up with machetes.  I am unable to tell you whether people were killed by guns or other weapons.  Other victims were killed with machetes.
Q.	Do you know if Mr. Muhimana was armed, and, if so, what was he armed with at Gitwa?
A.	He was carrying a long gun.
Q.	Did you see him use that gun, sir?
A.	Yes, I saw him use that gun.
Q.	What was the distance between yourself and Mr. Muhimana and others when you saw them at Gitwa hill at the end of April 1994, sir?
A.	I was above the road in a millet farm.  The assailants were on the road.  Others were below the road, so the distance was a short one, about 50 metres.  I could see them very well.
Q.	Did you say five zero metres, or one five metres, sir?
A.	I stated to you that the distance was between 20 and 50 metres.  I would also add that we were not staying in the same place.  The assailants were not in the same place.  At times you would see somebody at a distance of ten metres and they would be moving about, so I'm not in a position to give a fixed distance.  It could have been less or more, so that distance varied between the movements of the various people involved in the attack.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Between you and the attackers, how was the ground?  Level or inclined, or how was it, the surface of the ground?
THE WITNESS: 
Are you referring to the attack in Gitwa? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes.

THE WITNESS: 
In Gitwa, where we resisted the attack of the assailants, there was a valley.
JUDGE MUTHOGA: 
Who was on the upper side?
THE WITNESS:
The Tutsis were on the other side of the road, uphill.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, for how long did you observe Mr. Muhimana during this attack?
A.	I saw him in Gitwa for some time because the attacks didn't last long.  They were stronger than us.  Whenever the assailants were dominated by the Tutsis, the Tutsis fled, so I would say that I saw him for about 15 to 20 minutes, and subsequently we fled to Uwingabo where they pursued us.
Q.	When you say you saw him for 15 to 20 minutes, did you see him constantly for 15 to 20 minutes or is this an aggregate  of the totality of the time you saw him during that attack?  Can you help me with that?
A.	I saw him in Gitwa.  During that period of 15 to 20 minutes, I wouldn't say that it was constantly, because he was not staying on the same position.  He was moving about.
Q.	You then testified that you saw him at another attack at Uwingabo.  How long after the first attack at Gitwa did you see Mr. Muhimana at Uwingabo, sir?  How many hours or minutes?
A.	The time that elapsed wasn't hours.  It was a short space of time.  I would say about an hour, an hour ten minutes.
Q.	When you saw him an hour ten minutes later, what did you see him do at Uwingabo, sir?
A.	He was shooting at people as usual, because he was accustomed to carrying a gun.  He was not carrying a machete like the other assailants.
Q.	And this time around, how long did you have to observe Mr. Muhimana?  How long did you observe him for, sir, during that second attack at Uwingabo?
A.	During that attack at Uwingabo, I saw him for a few minutes because we shortly thereafter sought refuge in Muhira forest.
Q.	Do you know or do you recall how Mr. Muhimana was dressed at the end of April when you saw him at Uwingabo and Gitwa?  Do you recall what he was wearing, sir?
A.	He was in civilian clothes as usual, as before.
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court how he arrived at the area of Gitwa and Uwingabo?  Do you know his mode of transportation to that area, sir?
A.	In Uwingabo and in Gitwa, that month of April, he first of all came on foot.  I saw him again in June, and on that occasion, he was in a vehicle belonging to the former minister of information, who was with him, namely Eliezer Niyitegeka, but in my testimony a while ago relating to what happened in April -

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness didn't complete the statement.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Witness, you were saying -- you didn't complete your sentence.  Can you take your response again?  You saw him in a vehicle with the minister of information, and then what then happened?
A.	I stated that in the month of April, when I saw him in Gitwa and Uwingabo, he had come on foot.  I also stated that I saw him again in the month of June.  He was in a vehicle belonging to the former minister of information, and that minister was with him.
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I want to move on to the month of May 1994.  Do you recall if you saw 
Mr. Muhimana at all during the month of May 1994, sir?
A.	I saw Mika on the 13th May 1994.  That was the Friday.  If you have a calendar for 1994, you can ascertain that.  It was a Friday.  Attacks were launched from Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  The assailants came on board ONATRACOM buses, and there were about eight to ten buses on board which the Interahamwes came, and I would say that was the biggest attack in which many people were killed.  

The following day, that was the 14th, the assailants came.  The refugees could no longer withstand the attacks because the Interahamwe were armed with guns and heavy artillery.  They were carrying sophisticated guns.  On that occasion, I saw Mika shooting at people.  He was with other assailants.  I saw him at a place called Gititi, and it was during that attack that he shot at my sister who was with me.  The other assailants who were with him took my junior brother.  I don't know where they took him to, and they killed him, so I saw Mika in Gititi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what was the location of attacks on 13th of May?
THE WITNESS:
The attack was launched in Bisesero.  I would say that the vehicles (sic) came on board buses.  Those buses stopped in Muhira, and that is where the attack started.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was the location of attack on 14th May?
THE WITNESS: 
The buses came on that occasion, but since there were no longer any people on Muhira hill, many of the refugees had been killed, so the assailants who came on board those buses tried to look for them, to look for survivors to finish them off.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips. 
THE WITNESS:
The buses would leave the Interahamwe in different places so that they could carry out those attacks.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Witness, why do you remember specifically that an attack took place on the 13th May, which you say was a Friday?  Why do you remember this date so specifically?
A.	All survivors from Bisesero know that date because on that day many people were killed.  If you were to ask all the survivors of Bisesero, they would tell that you.
Q.	You testified that the attackers arrived in ten buses, which you call ONATRACOM.  What is ONATRACOM?  What does that stand for, sir?
A.	It is a transport corporation that transports people.  It is a state corporation in charge of transporting people.
Q.	Do you know the location in which these buses were parked after they arrived in the area on 13th of May?  Do you know where they stopped all those buses?
A.	The buses parked at a place called Kucyapa that was on the border between Gishyita and Gisovu communes.
Q.	Do you know what time of day it was that you saw these buses arrive at Kucyapa?
A.	The buses arrived in the morning between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.
Q.	How long after the arrival of these buses did an attack commence in that area?
A.	After those buses arrived in that region, Hutus launched an attack from Rubazo.  Assailants had come from Rutsiro, Kibuye.  However, it was only after the war that we got to know the real composition of those who attacked us, so attacks were launched from behind the hill.  As for the attack that was launched in Kucyapa, as soon as the assailants alighted from the buses, they consulted one another for a short while and then they started shooting at people.  Those who took part in the attack were Interahamwes who had been trained.  Some were using traditional weapons, others were using guns.  These were Interahamwe who had been trained.  They had been trained.
Q.	At what stage during this attack did you see Mr. Muhimana?
A.	After the Muhira attack --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:  
Thank you, Madam President.  I am trying to follow the Prosecutor's line of questioning in relation to the witness statements that were forwarded to us, but I have not seen anywhere any mention of an attack that was carried out from buses of -- I do not no know -- which company in which Mika was involved.  I am objecting to this line of questioning which does not take account of the statements that were transmitted to the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, can you tell us from which part of the statement you are leading your evidence? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  It's the statement of 29 August 2002.  In the English version it's on page 6 at paragraph 1.  I think it's -- unless my learned friend doesn't have that statement, which I doubt.  It's in the bundle.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which one? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In the English, Your Honour, it's page 6 at the beginning of the page.  It starts off by saying "On 13th May".  Sorry, I don't have my bundle of statements here.  I just extracted the statement, itself, so I can't give you the paginated page number.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We he don't see mention of buses in the statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.  If the issue of buses is what is in contention, there is no mention of buses.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Buses and the company.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, but the mode of transportation of the attackers is inherent in the discussion in the paragraph.  If attackers are participating in an attack, then they must have been transported there one way or the other.  I don't see what is so objectionable about that.  It's inherent in the testimony, on the account, and he hasn't said Mika transported them there in buses, so I don't see what the basis of the objection is.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The basis of the objection, Counsel, is that --
MR ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He doesn't have notice of the allegation.
JUDGE MUTHOGHA:
That's right, yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:  
But it doesn't concern his accused person, your Honour.  He's never said Mika transported them there in buses.  He just said they arrived there in buses.  I have never heard him say that Mika has any connection with ONATRACOM, so I don't see what the gripe is.  And it's a minor point.  If he wants it struck off the record, then we can strike it off the record, but I don't see the point, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the problem here is that in introducing aspects that are not included in the statement, the Prosecutor might develop attacks carried out on a site that is different from the one in the declaration.  In regard to the 13th May, if we are looking at the statement of 29 August, at no time is there any allusion to the means of transport or movement, so the witness should not be made to say this unless a question is asked.  However, it must not be suggested that there were any buses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
We believe it was the witness who stated that the attackers -- assailants came in buses.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
That's correct, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
So Professor, you are only objecting to the mode of transportation, is that your only objection, the mode of transportation of the attackers? 
MR. SONGA:
My objection is not limited to the mode, but also to the site.  I am beginning to wonder whether the questions are referring to Gititi or Muhira.
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, that is what you should try and find out, but if your objection is restricted to how they got there, that is a different matter.  

Mr. Phillips, what was the witness -- what attack was the witness testifying about?  The one in --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, he's testifying about the attack on page 6 in the top paragraph.
JUDGE SHORT:
The one in Gititi?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, but I think, what it is, is that that activity happened at Gititi, but then he's given a general overview of the attacks before those particular events happened, but I think I take my learned brother's point, and I'll just go specifically to the aspects that support the indictment that I'm interested in and leave out the generalities, if that suits him a lot better.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That would be helpful, yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified that Mr. Muhimana shot at your sister during the 13th May attack.  I don't want you to mention your sister's name.  Can you just confirm that that is indeed your testimony, sir?
A.	Yes, I confirm it, but before that, I would like to make a request to the Court.  In view of what I have just heard, I do not know whether it is Mika's attorney or it is a judge, but the fact of saying that the attack took place in Gititi or Muhira doesn't matter.  In Rwanda, what happened was a genocide.  It was not a football field where a team is winner or loser.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please answer the question asked by Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honour, it would probably be helpful as well if we have a practice direction from Your Honours that certain conversations that don't concern the witness are not exactly translated to him.  Sometimes it might be helpful to just have that as a general rule, so that we don't have this sort of interjection, but I take the point.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But that will be a problem because it will be the translator who decides what concerns them or doesn't concern.  He wouldn't know whether it concerns or doesn't concern.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We normally have had it in other chambers, and that is why I suggest it, but if Your Honours don't think it's necessary, then that's fine. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, we just want to tell you that we had already made a ruling that all the discussions should be translated to the witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Should.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it must be translated to the witness, yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  I'm grateful.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So going back to my question, Mr. Witness, if you can tell me the circumstances that led to 
Mr. Muhimana killing your sister on 13th May, sir?
A.	He shot at her.
Q.	Can you start off by telling me where this incident took place -- location, sir?
A.	That is what I wanted to explain to you, but I got the impression that my thought was not well understood.  I wanted to tell you that the attack of the 13th -- I did not say that the assailants from Ruhengeri came at the request of Mika.  I did not even say that Mika was on that bus.  I thought that you wanted me to give you the date on which the attack took place.  Mika was one of those people who indicated to these Interahamwe where the Tutsi were found.  When I mentioned Gititi, it was to indicate to you that we were first attacked in Gititi and that we began to run away, and while I was fleeing, I saw Mika.  So it is at Gititi that Mika shot at my sister.  It is true that he shot at other people, but I only remembered my sister's name.  There is also a certain Vincent Omobuga (phonetic) who was also attacked -- participating in these attacks.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, can you tell us what Gititi is?  Is Gititi a hill?  Is it a cellule?  Can you help us with that, please?  What is Gititi and where is Gititi?
A.	Gititi is a hill.
Q.	And that hill called Gititi is located in which area, sir, or which cellule?
A.	Gititi is in Gitwa cellule, which is in Bisesero secteur.
Q.	Can you describe the circumstances that led to Mr. Muhimana shooting at your sister, as you recall them?
A.	When we arrived at Gititi, Mika and his group were on the opposing hill.  They were quite close to us and Mika was with other people and they were shooting at us, but it was Mika who was in front.  He was the closest to us of the assailants, and it is he who shot at my sister.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was the age of your sister at that time?
THE WITNESS: 
She was about 14 or 15 years old.  She was the one who was born immediately after me.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Of all the -- do you know how many of the assailants that were present at Gititi on 13th May, do you know how many of them were armed, sir?
A.	Amongst the people who were armed with guns, I recognised Mika and Vincent.  These were the ones that I was able to identify because they were standing in front of the other assailants.
Q.	How were you then able to tell, Mr. Witness, that the shot that killed your sister was fired by 
Mr. Muhimana?
A.	When Mika shot at her, I could see him.  He was quite close to us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what was the distance between you and your sister when she was fired at by Mika?
THE WITNESS: 
My sister was ahead of me.  We were walking at normal pace because we were no longer running.  She was about two metres away from where I was.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, please, go ahead.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And what was the approximate distance, Mr. Witness, between yourself and Mr. Muhimana's location before he shot your sister?
A.	Are you asking me to give the distance where he was before he shot at my sister, or at the time he shot at my sister?
Q.	Well, the distance between yourself and Muhimana at the time he shot at your sister.
A.	He was very close to where I was.  I would say about 20 metres.
Q.	When he shot at your sister, can you tell me -- and I know this might be difficult for you, but I need to know the details.  Can you tell me whether or not your sister was stationary or whether or not she was in flight at the time?
A.	She was moving, but not fast.
Q.	So do you know whether he shot her from the back or from the front or from the side?  Were you able to tell from which direction the shot came and hit your sister?
A.	Mika was a little off to the side, so he did not shoot at her right from the front.  I would say he shot at her sideways.
Q.	And in relation to your position, did Mika have his back to you or was he facing you or did he have his side to you?  Can you help me with that sort of position in relation to your position?
A.	I told you that he was off to the side.
Q.	What time of the day was this, Mr. Witness?
A.	It was between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.  I think it was late in the afternoon.
Q.	In terms of the landscape of the area where this incident took place, can you tell us whether or not -- what the landscape was like?  Were you all on the same level?  Was it flat?  Were you on a hill?  Can you help me with that sort of description of the landscape, please, when this incident happened, the killing of your sister?
A.	Well, the fact is that you do not know the Bisesero hills.  In Bisesero, there are high hills, and then there are plateaus of a kind, of various levels.  However, at the place where this was happening, we were on a more or less flat hill.  It was not really in the higher hills.
Q.	So is it your testimony that the area where you were located and the area where your sister was located was the same level?  Is that what you say, sir?
A.	Well, it is true that we were not in a valley, but we were almost on the same level.
Q.	Talking about your sister, was she alone or was she with other refugees at the time that she was shot?  Can you help us with that, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Besides the witness? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I didn't get the impression the witness was there.
THE WITNESS:
We were accompanied with other persons.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The victim was with the witness.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Approximately how many of you were there at the time your sister was shot, sir?
A.	We were a group of people, not very many, but not very few, either. 
Q.	And apart from your sister, do you know if anyone else was killed as a result of the shooting on this day, sir, at this time?
A.	Other people died, but I was not able to determine who they were, because even when we went to recover my sister's body, we found it next to other bodies and birds of prey had begun to devour these bodies.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you mean to say that other people died the same day because of the shooting of Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
That is possible.  He did not shoot only at one person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you see the dead bodies? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I saw the bodies of other persons, and when we went to bury my sister's body, we saw other bodies.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
On the same location.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, but not very close to our sister's body.  Let's say five metres or a little further.  There were people who had been killed with machetes.  Refugees fell as they moved.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, please, go ahead. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall how Mr. Muhimana was dressed on that occasion?
A.	He was also wearing civilian dress.
Q.	You testified that he shot at your sister, but are you able to tell us what sort of gun he used in shooting at her?
A.	He used a small gun like a pistol.
Q.	You also testified that your brother was also attacked on this occasion.  Do you recall telling us that, sir?
A.	I didn't understand your question, I'm sorry.
Q.	When you were testifying earlier, you mentioned your sister being shot at, and also there was an incident concerning your brother.  Do you recall telling us that?
A.	That's correct, I remember.
Q.	What happened to your brother on this occasion, sir?
A.	My little brother was arrested by assailants.  I had just passed him several metres behind.  A certain Vincent stopped the person who had arrested my little brother and said, "Bring me that young child," because the assailants had adopted the habit of bringing -- taking young boys away.  He was taken on that day and I never saw him again.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was the age of your brother?
THE WITNESS: 
He was in his first year of primary school.  He was about 7 years old.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who said that this young boy should be brought to him?
THE WITNESS: 
It is a certain Vincent Rutaganira.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips, please, go ahead. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So moving on now to the month of June 1994, do you recall whether or not you saw Mr. Muhimana during the month of June, and if so, when and where did you see him?
A.	In the month of June, I saw Mika at Nyiramurego where there was a cassterite mine.  Many Tutsis were hiding at this place.  They were hiding in holes.  The mining was done by digging holes and the assailants or the victims hid in these holes and covered their hiding places with holes (sic).  They were not discovered until a young boy was caught who indicated where the refugees were hiding.  After the young man gave this indication as to where the assailants were hiding, the refugees were hiding, the assailants went there and discovered many people.  Mika was part of the assailants and he was accompanied by a trader called Obed Ruzindana, and on that day Mika shot at many people.  And there is a horrible thing that he did, amongst others.  He took hold of a child who was a year or a year and a half in age, she was a little girl.  Mika raised her and threw her against the stone, and the young child died.  On that day, Mika was also carrying a gun like a pistol.  There are also young girls who were discovered at this place who were also killed using sticks that were pushed up into their genitals.  The breasts of other young girls were cut off.  On that day, I was in Murego and I was a witness on the acts that Mika committed.
Q.	Where is Murego situated, Mr. Witness?
A.	Near Murego is Nyarutovu cellule, Bisesero secteur, quite close to the road that links Kibuye to Gisovu.
(Pages 1 to 23 by Trevor Gerbes)






1600H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And when in the month of June -- when in the month of June was this attack that you just described to the Court?
A.	At the beginning of the month of June.
Q.	Where were you located, Mr. Witness, when you witnessed this attack at the beginning of the month of June 1994?
A.	I was in a bush quite close to this place, but I was not hiding in one of the holes of the mine.
Q.	You've described to the Court an incident involving Mika and a baby being killed.  Did you know the identity of this child, Mr. Witness?
A.	It was a little girl.  I don't know what ethnic group she belonged to.  Do you want to know whether she was Hutu or Tutsi?  I don't understand you.
Q.	Did you know her name or that of her parents, by any chance?
A.	Her father was called Nsengayire and her mother was Katherine Mukarugwiza.
Q.	And do you know what ethnic group the father, the baby's father belonged to, sir?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	And can you describe the circumstances that led to Mr. Muhimana killing this child on this day?
A.	Regarding the reason why he killed this child, I think that it would be well if you asked the question -- if you put the Mika -- put the question to Mika himself.  Why do you ask me why -- whether Mika killed other people?  
Q.	I didn't actually ask you the reason why he killed the child.  I asked you to describe what you saw, the circumstances.  And I know this may be particularly distressing for you, sir, but I need you to assist the Court in understanding what you saw.  And, in that regard, can I ask you again to describe what you saw Mika do on that day in early June 1994?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And where from this place -- this baby was recovered by Mika?
THE WITNESS:
I have explained to you that people were hiding in pits and that there were other people who were hiding in bushes around there.  When the assailants got the information that people were hiding in this mine, the assailants attacked the mine, pulled the people out of the pits.  The young child was also in a hole, and it is Mika who seized this child and threw her against the stone.  

At this place, young girls were also discovered, that is, young students of the secondary school.  Ruzindana, who was on the road, said, "Bring me these young girls."  We knew that they were students because they were carrying their student identity cards.  In Nyiramurego, there were people who were killed with sticks; and, in regard to the, their breasts were also cut off. 

BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Who was Ruzindana, Mr. Witness?
A.	Ruzindana was a trader, and he plied his trade in Mugonero.  He also had a trade in Kigali; he transported tea from Kibuye to Kigali.  He was a fairly well-known trader in Kibuye.
Q.	Had you known him before you saw him at the mine at the beginning of June 1994?
A.	Who are you referring to, sir?
Q.	Ruzindana.
A.	I had seen Ruzindana several times.
Q.	Now, do you recall how Mr. Muhimana was dressed when you saw at the mine, cassterite mine in the beginning of June?
A.	Mika was wearing a shirt on which you could see the picture of (interpretation unintelligible) of MRND, and he was also wearing a cap that bore the colours of the CDR.
Q.	What was the MRND, Mr. Witness?
A.	The MRND was a political party of President Habyarimana.  I think he created that party after he took over power in 1973.
Q.	And do you know what the CDR was?
A.	The CDR, from what was said, was a Hutu party, but these were Hutus with big noses, and, generally, when they wanted to identify a real militant of that party, they had to introduce three fingers in the nostrils.  However, when the political parties broke up into various wings, and when the MRND broke up into two groups and that -- we had the Power wing.  The MDR also divided into two and the majority of the Hutus adhered to the CDR party.
Q.	You have testified, Mr. Witness, about the killing of some young girls and ladies.  Can you tell me was Mr. Muhimana present when this was done?
A.	Mika was present because he and a certain Joseph, who was the younger brother of Ruzindana, were behind the arrest of the young girls.  So it is Mika and Joseph who took the young girls to the road where they were executed.
Q.	How many girls were there at this time?
A.	Several young girls were flushed out, but as for the girls who were killed on road, there were two of them.  The others were killed in the mine.
Q.	Did you know the names of those two girls, sir?
A.	Yes, I know their names.
Q.	Can you tell us what their names were, sir?
A.	One of them was called Beatrice and the other was called Immaculee.
Q.	And do you know who was responsible for killing Beatrice and Immaculee? 
A.	The first victim was Beatrice.  It's Ruzindana in person who cut off her breasts.  After that, he said, "Since this is a Tutsi, she can go back to school and I will see under what condition she was going to go back to school without her breasts."  And for the other young girl, sharpened sticks were inserted into her genitals.
Q.	How old was Beatrice and Immaculee?
A.	These were young adolescents aged between 18 and 20.
Q.	And are you able to tell us what ethnic group they belonged to, sir?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	Where was Mika Muhimana when Ruzindana killed Beatrice -- or cut off the breasts of Beatrice?
A.	They were together.
Q.	And where were you located, Mr. Witness?  How far aware were you from Ruzindana and Mika Muhimana and the girls on this occasion?
A.	I was in a bush close to where they were because I could see all that they were doing.
Q.	The events that you have described, the killing of the baby and the assault on the two adolescent women, can you tell us how long this these events took in total?  How long did the assault last, the attack?
A.	The attacks on Nyiramurego lasted for quite a while because they had to bring up people from the hole.  The attacks began at nine o'clock and finally ended at about 3:00 p.m.
Q.	And the people inside the hole, were they left in the hole or was everybody seeking refuge inside the hole brought out to the surface?  Are you able to ascertain that?
A.	Many people were brought out of that pit, and only three persons remained therein, but they also were subsequently killed.
Q.	Was there another time during the month of June 1994 that you saw Mr. Muhimana and, if so, where and when?
A.	I saw him again by the end of June because a few days later the French came.  I saw him at Gitwa, in the Gitwa cellule, as I said before, and I saw him again at Uwingabo, in the Uwingabo cellule.  I saw him in Gitwa at about 10:00 a.m., and he was still firing on people who were trying to flee.  I saw him again at Uwingabo, but this time around he was on board Eliezer's vehicle.  He was with some soldiers at the back of the car, and the soldiers were firing at Tutsis who were on the hills.  I was hiding in a pinus tree and I was seeing how people were fleeing.  

In the meantime, they did not fire many gunshots because there were Hutus between Mika and Tutsis, so they shot a few gunshots in order to frighten the refugees or those who were fleeing, but they didn't want to kill those who were from the same ethnic group as themselves.
Q.	Can I ask you, the vehicle that belonged to Minister Niyitegeka, what sort of vehicle was that?
A.	It was a Toyota car, or it was a Toyota Scout, white in colour.  In any case, usually, if they didn't come in a jeep, they used that car I just talked about.
Q.	And was Mr. Muhimana in this car with Mr. Niyitegeka or was he in another vehicle?
A.	He was on board Eliezer's car.
Q.	Was there anybody else on the vehicle apart from the Minister Niyitegeka and Mr. Muhimana?
A.	There were a few soldiers.
Q.	Had you known Minister Niyitegeka before you saw him on this day in June at Uwingabo and Gitwa? 
A.	I had seen him.  He used to come and visit his family, and I would see him.  That was in the Gitabura secteur.  His parents used to live **************************************************************************** ************************************ those I just mentioned.
Q.	Now, you saw Mika Muhimana and Minister Niyitegeka.  What were you, yourself, doing at the location where you saw them?
A.	At Gitwa where I saw Mika for the first time, I was in the company of a few people.  We were trying to flee and to try to fight -- look for an escape route.  We could not, therefore, though, without finding passage.  We were using machetes and stones.  It was a question of defending oneself; but this at high risk, because elderly persons had said, "We are going to die, but nobody should show his neck so that his head could be cut off."  I saw him the second time around at Uwingabo, from where I was hiding in a bush.
Q.	How long after you had seen him at Gitwa did you see him again at Uwingabo at the end of June 1994?  What was the time between both sightings, sir?
A.	After having seen him at Gitwa, we fled, and I went to that bush in the wood.  I saw him again after about four or five hours, given that I saw him at about 3:00 p.m. -- three or six -- or 4:00 p.m.  That is mostly an estimate because I wasn't wearing a watch.
Q.	And when you saw him at Uwingabo, do you know if anyone was killed as a result of his actions?
A.	People died, but I did not know who killed them since there were many of them.
Q.	You testified that there were some Hutus with the refugees.  Do you -- can you explain to us who these Hutu persons were and what they were doing amongst the refugees at the time, sir?
A.	I did not say that the Hutus were with the refugees; I said that they were fighting against the refugees.
Q.	So the Hutus were assailants; is that correct, sir?
A.	Yes, they were assailants who were chasing the Tutsis.
Q.	How did you survive the genocide of 1994, sir?
A.	We lived by hiding in the Bisesero hills, up until the time that the French came and took us over (sic) Bisesero.  They took us into camps of sorts.  A few days later they took us to the FPR camp.
Q.	How many members of your immediate family survived the attacks on Tutsis between April and June 1994, sir?
A.	Why do you want to know the number of persons in the family? 
Q.	I don't think you understood my question.  How many -- did any -- how many members of your family, immediate family, survived the genocide of 1994?  Just give me a number, if you know; your immediate family.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, why don't you ask him how many died during the war?

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Or better still, why don't you ask them face by face, father, mother, brothers, sisters?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I really didn't want to take up the Court's time, but I think I will take up the first option. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	How many members of your immediate family died following the genocide of 1994?
A.	Are you talking of the survivors or of the victims?
Q.	The victims.  The victims. 
A.	It's almost everybody who died.  Right now, the survivors total four or five persons only. 
Q.	You've spoken at length, Mr. Witness, for some two hours or more, about the man you called Mika Muhimana, amongst other people.  Do you think you would be in a position to recognise him if you saw him today?
A.	Yes, I can recognise him.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, can I seek your leave for the witness to look around the courtroom?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.

Mr. Witness, please stand up and look around, if you are able to recognise Mika Muhimana present in the Court.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he's there.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	 Mr. Witness, can you point to the direction which you think Mr. Muhimana might be located and describe what he is wearing, if you can, sir?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you stand up and point towards him? 
THE WITNESS:
I see that he's put on some weight.  He is behind those four men.  He's sitting with only one person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness has recognised the Accused. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You can sit down now, please.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for answering my questions and coming to testify. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have no further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is almost 4:30.  Is it an appropriate time for a short break?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, indeed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before we rise for the short break, can we ask the professor if he has gone through the expert report filed on Thursday last week.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I received it over the weekend.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you in a position to file a response to the oral application made by Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. SONGA:
I would like, first of all, Madam President, to know what is your position vis--vis the time limits provided for by the Rules.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, what the President is asking you -- the Presiding Judge is asking you what is your response to the request that was made to you by Counsel Phillips on Thursday to the effect that he has breached the Rules in delivering the report to you shorter than the rules require, but that he would wish that you would accommodate him and agree to the witness being presented by Friday this week, which will be shorter than the period that is provided for by the Rules.  And, as you had not read the report then, it was intimated that you be given time to read the report and be able to respond to that request so that we know how to go about it.  That's what the Presiding Judge Khan is asking to you indicate what your position is after having read the report, which we understand was in Kinyarwanda, and there was a promise that it would be provided in other languages, not too long after that time. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, it was provided to him in French, and we now have it in English. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am waiting for you to respond.
MR. SONGA:
I have read the report, and I would like to request if it will be possible for you to grant me leave so I take some time and provide my reply in writing.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How soon? 
MR. SONGA:
Forty-eight hours, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
By day after tomorrow, you mean?
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So we expect your reply day after tomorrow, morning.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall break for 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1630H to 1705H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed.  

Professor, you have the floor for the cross-examination.
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President.

Madam President, I would like to ask for five minutes of in camera session in order not to divulge the witness's identity.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No objection, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, arrange for the closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 31 to 33] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 24 to 30 by Judith Baverstock)













MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are in open session, so don't disclose any information which may reveal your identity.  Thank you.  

Professor Songa. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Is it also correct that Seronera (phonetic) was killed by an exploding grenade?
A.	Yes, it is true.  I was not present, but everybody said that this old man died after a grenade exploded.
Q.	So you were not a witness to the death of Leonard through a grenade explosion?
A.	I was not an eyewitness of this death.  I heard news about it.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Where were you when you heard this news?
A.	I was in my parents' home.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that on the 9th of April there was a real attack coming from Musenyi and Gishyita and that, in the course of this attack, four persons were wounded; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that these very persons were later on killed in Mugonero; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How did you learn that they died in Mugonero later?  
A.	These persons were taken to the hospital after they were wounded, and some time afterwards the hospital was attacked and many persons were killed.  Given that they were wounded, they could not move.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  This is still the 9th of April.  You state that at about 11:00 a.m. on that same day, people of Bisesero intervened to assist the people of Gishyita whose Tutsi and some of its Hutus had retreated to a hill in Musenyi secteur; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say the people of Bisesero, what people are you referring to exactly?
A.	I did not understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	My question relates to your statement, a passage of which I cited a while ago.  You say in that passage that on the 9th of April the people of Bisesero came to the assistance of the people of Gishyita.  My question is:  which people of Bisesero?
A.	What I do not understand is this.  I know that the people of a given location are the people who live there, so these were civilians; there were no soldiers amongst them.
Q.	Thank you.  I shall return to the question in order to try to determine what Bisesero is at issue here.  Is it the hill or the region?
A.	This is the region of Bisesero which was mainly inhabited by the Tutsi population.
Q.	Thank you.  In a statement given on the 14th of October 1997 in the Kayishema trial, you state that you went to Bisesero hill; is that correct?
A.	What date do you refer to -- are you referring to?
Q.	Ninth of April. 
A.	On the 9th of April, I remember that I stated that we retreated to our homes.  So we went home, and this was in Bisesero secteur.
Q.	Thank you.  My question, Mr. Witness, is this:  when the population came to the assistance, what did they do exactly?
A.	The people of Bisesero came down to assist the Tutsi and Hutu who were in Gishyita in order to fight the assailants; and at the time, they did not yet know that it was an ethnic problem, so it was to repel this attack.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that you were amongst these people who were defending themselves, in particular, by throwing stones at the Hutu who were attacking you; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How can you explain that you were amongst those people of Gishyita who had retreated to Rurebero?  What -- so what happened, what was your movement that so happened that you found yourself in Rurebero. 
A.	Our cellule borders with Rurebero cellule; in other words, that attack concerned all the members of the population that were living in that region, that is, the members of the population of the neighbouring cellule.
Q.	You also state, Mr. Witness, that you could not say who was leading the assailants; is that correct? 
A.	In the beginning, I did not know who was leading the attacks.
Q.	When, Mr. Witness, you repelled the assailants, who retreated to Dukoni, how long did the attack last? 
A.	I think that they retreated towards Dukoni after 1:00 p.m.
Q.	Thank you.  You testified to the Chamber that after Dukoni, gendarmes joined the assailants and asked the Tutsis to join them where they were.  Can you confirm that?
A.	Yes, I do confirm it.
Q.	And where exactly were the gendarmes?
A.	The gendarmes came in a vehicle and they stopped at Dukoni and went up on foot and joined the Hutus.  They had a conversation, and we did not know exactly what they said to each other; and then they confronted the Tutsis who were found in the coffee farms.
Q.	Probably I didn't phrase my question well.  I am referring to the statement or the testimony that you just made here before the Chamber when you say that the gendarmes joined the assailants and asked the Tutsis to join them where they were.  I would simply like to know where those gendarmes were, precisely?
A.	Do you want to know where they were at the time that they asked the Tutsis to join them?  That was below that hill on which the Hutus were.
Q.	And when you joined them, you say that your weapons were stored in Casimir's home; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And was this after discussion with the gendarmes?
A.	You mean the storage of weapons in Casimir's home?  Well, they took our weapons and then they went back, and the storing was done later at Casimir's home.
Q.	How -- about how many of them do you think were there?
A.	You mean those who were with the Tutsis?  I cannot give you the number because there were many of them.  Besides, there were some who would come and then go back later, probably because they were tired. 
Q.	Did they number about a hundred, for instance?
A.	Yes, and probably more.
Q.	Which are the weapons that the Tutsis were carrying?
A.	The Tutsis had traditional weapons, such as spears and machetes and their clubs; others were using stones.
Q.	And who were those who had to gather the weapons?
A.	A small number of young people proposed to gather those weapons.  They were asked to gather the weapons, and they did just that.  As concerns the disarming, this was done forcibly by the gendarmes.
Q.	So, at no point did you accept to lay down your arms?
A.	I think I have said this.  They surrendered their weapons, otherwise the weapons wouldn't have been gathered if they hadn't been laid down.  So these weapons were laid down and then they were gathered and stored at Casimir's home.
Q.	And who is Casimir, Mr. Witness?
A.	At the time, Casimir was an official of the cellule.  He was a Hutu who was living in that locality.
Q.	Do you know his name, besides his first name?
A.	No, I don't know it.
Q.	Did anyone give an order for people to be disarmed?  
A.	The order was given by the gendarmes as well as the bourgmestre.
Q.	And where was Casimir living?
A.	Casimir was residing on that Rurebero hill.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And when the assailants retreated to Dukoni, what did the population that had been attacked do?
A.	The population that had been attacked remained at the summit of Rurebero hill in order to see what was happening.  Besides, some members of the population got discouraged and returned home.
Q.	At that moment, had you seen a person called Mika?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
(Pages 34 to 36 by Judith Baverstock)

	1745H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Where?
A.	I saw him at that spot where the Hutus were launching their attacks.
Q.	You state, Mr. Witness, that the Hutus who were attacking you had traditional weapons, such as machetes, spears, and clubs; is that correct?
A.	That's true.
Q.	You didn't see any firearm at that moment?
A.	Yes, I saw some.
Q.	Who was carrying them?
A.	Communal policemen were carrying guns, the bourgmestre and the conseiller, Mika.  The only conseiller who wasn't carrying a gun was Muhilgwa (phonetic).
Q.	How many conseillers, did you notice?
A.	I was able to identify two; at least those that I knew.
Q.	And were the two carrying guns?
A.	I have explained to you that one of the two wasn't carrying a gun.
Q.	How many gendarmes were there?
A.	During the attack there was no gendarmes; the gendarmes came in the evening, and I think I explained this.

I was still referring to the 9th of April and in relation to the attack that you said was launched at eleven o'clock.  I said that the gendarmes came later from Kibuye, but I could not know the number thereof; in any case, there were a few of them.  There were between 15 and 30 that came in a vehicle, so there were very many, but I can't tell you an exact number.
Q.	You are going to help us.  When you refer to gendarmes, that doesn't include the policemen?
A.	No.  They were different.  There were communal policemen and there were gendarmes.  There was gendarmerie.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are still on the 9th of April and you state that the assailants came back to attack you; this time around with firearms as well; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Should we understand that before that attack there were no firearms?
A.	There were firearms that were used, but nobody was wounded.
Q.	But why do you say that this time around they had firearms?
A.	Didn't I say that during the first attack there were firearms?
Q.	That is precisely the problem, because your statement doesn't say so.
A.	I'm going to explain to you the following.  The investigators who interviewed me, be it in 1996 or later, did not ask me questions the way you are doing now.  They asked me to relate what happened in the Bisesero region, and it wasn't necessary to relate everything in detail.  Now, in this courtroom, when you ask questions, you ask them differently.  And I've explained to you that in the first attack, there were policemen, communal policemen who were carrying guns, and that later there were some who came from Gituntu were more ferocious and they shot at people to kill them, but before they were shooting in the air, probably, to disperse people.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  How about the assailants who came back that afternoon with firearms, were they the same as those who came before midday or was it a different group of assailants?
A.	The group that came before midday was part of the group of the afternoon, but I can't know if everybody came back in the afternoon.  There were people who had been there in the morning, but then the group grew bigger in the afternoon.
Q.	When it grew bigger, did you have an idea on the number?
A.	During the first attack there were about 80 to 100 or probably a little over 100 assailants, but in the afternoon there were about 200 of them.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state that that is when you recognised, from amongst the leaders of the attack, the conseiller Mika Muhimana; the bourgmestre, Sikubwabo; and the three policemen of the Gishyita commune; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did you know Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Who was he?
A.	I knew him while he was the conseiller of the Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Did you know his living quarters?
A.	Yes, I knew his house.  He used to reside in the centre of Gishyita.
Q.	When you knew him, was he already the conseiller of the secteur?
A.	I think I knew him while he was the conseiller of the secteur.
Q.	Mr. Witness, awhile ago, before the Chamber, I thought I heard you state that you knew him well before he became conseiller, in particular, as you attended the same primary school.  Did I hear you well?
A.	No, I have never made such a statement.  I didn't say that I went to the same school as Mika.
Q.	You didn't say either that you knew him before, since your schools were close to one another?
A.	I think you didn't understand me well or probably what I said was poorly interpreted.  The person that I said I attended the same school with and who was present during that attack was a certain Emmanuel, who was attacked.  I have never said I went to school with Mika, and our schools couldn't be close to one another because I didn't go to the same school as him, and besides I don't have the same age as Mika for both of us to have gone to school at the same time.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for that clarification.  Mr. Witness, I think, all the same, that I heard you that you could not distinguish between the various weapons that the assailants were using.
A.	I stated that I could not make a distinction between the various munitions, but I don't think I talked about distinguishing guns.  I said, besides that, the assailants were wearing long guns or rather long guns here.
Q.	Thank you.  (No interpretation)
A.	Yes, I stated that.
Q.	How is the Kalashnikov?  Is it a long gun?
A.	It is a long gun, but I said that it was a Kalashnikov because it was different from the guns that the communal policemen were wearing and which we commonly refer to as a Rubaho, as a gun that Mika was wearing was similar to the one that the gendarmes were wearing.  R-U-B-A-H-O, Rubaho.
Q.	When you state, Mr. Witness, that Mika was dressed in civilian clothing, can you describe his clothing?
A.	Are you talking of the 9th?
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Yes, on that day he was wearing a white sleeveless short -- short-sleeve shirt and black trousers.
Q.	You state, Mr. Witness, that you saw him fire his gun several times, like the other assailants; is that correct?
A.	That is what I stated.
Q.	At that precise moment did you have an idea of the number of assailants that were carrying guns?
A.	I was able to recognise three communal policemen who were carrying guns, Mika, as well, and Sikubwabo.
Q.	We can take it, therefore, that there were about four or five guns?
A.	Yes, about five guns.
Q.	How long did the attack of the afternoon of the 9th of April last?
A.	It lasted about an hour.  
Q	What I mean is up to the time when the gendarmes arrived.  You said one hour.
A.	Yes, that is exactly what I said.  That is talking about the last attack when the assailants came from Dukoni.
Q.	You also state, Mr. Witness, that the assailants wounded four persons with bullets, amongst whom there was a certain person called Emmanuel; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	During a period of one hour, those five assailants with five guns could only wound four persons?
A.	Yes, I was about to recognise four persons who had been wounded.
Q.	No person died?
A.	I did not know anyone who died on that day and on that particular occasion.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You also talk about Emmanuel.  If I understood you well, he was about the same age as yourself.  Can you further give more particulars on him?  Who was Emmanuel?
A.	Emmanuel was a young Tutsi.  I think I explained this to you.  He was attending a secondary school called Sesepyan (phonetic) called Emansakay (phonetic).  When war broke out I think he was in the third year of the secondary school.  He was aged between 18 and 20.  I couldn't really tell, he's at that age.  His father was called Munyashongere (phonetic) and was residing in the Kamera cellule, Musenyi secteur.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that he was wounded on the thigh by a bullet from Mika's gun; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	When the assailants were shooting at you, what was their position in relation to yourself?
A.	I myself was among the refugees and we were throwing stones at the assailants.
Q.	How far were you from the assailants?
A.	I was at a distance of about 20 or 30 metres from the assailants.
Q.	And were you looking at the assailants in the eye or you were trying to run away from them?
A.	From time to time, when the assailants were not retreating, we retreated.  We were looking at them, and I said that we were in a coffee farm.
Q.	What do you mean?  Did the coffee farm facilitate your stone throwing or your flight?
A.	No, the coffee farm did not assist us in any way in regard to throwing stones or fleeing.  There was a coffee farm, and we were throwing stones at the assailants.  Whenever we felt they were getting close to us we retreated, and when we threw stones at them they retreated.  This is how things happened.
Q.	And in Emmanuel's thigh that was hit, was it the right one or the left one?
A.	It was the left thigh.
Q.	And once he was hit, what did he do?
A.	He fell down.
Q.	And for how long did he lie on the ground?
A.	We immediately raised him to hide him on the slope of the hill.
Q.	When you say "you", were you referring -- when you say "we", were you referring to all the Tutsis which were there or just a few of them?
A.	You would understand that 100 people cannot lift one person.  There was a small group of Tutsis, there were four of us who lifted up Emmanuel.
Q.	Thank you.  When you state that you lifted him up immediately, did you also go uphill immediately?
A.	It was not very far on the slope of the hill.  We were standing at a distance of about 30 metres from where he fell.  We were on the slope of the hill.  We were not in the valley.
Q.	Witness, what I'm trying to get at is to understand exactly what happened.  Did you continue defending yourselves or you took care of the wounded person?
A.	I and the others lifted him up, took him uphill.  The others did the same for their own wounded, and then we returned to confront the assailants.
Q.	Between the foot of the hill and the summit, what distance was there?  Could you please give us an estimate?
A.	That hill does not have a summit.  We are actually talking of a hill which had some kind of plateau or plain on the top and we were very close to the plateau.  People were not lining up to go up hill.  It is very difficult to give you an estimate of the distance between the summit and the foot of the hill.
Q.	The place where you laid Emmanuel, was he safe from the shots by the assailants?
A.	I think the gunshots couldn't reach him.  If at all such shots reached him, it was after all the refugees had been killed. 

Whenever we realised that the assailants were getting close to us we got up and tried to flee away from the assailants.
Q.	When you spoke with the gendarmes, is it true that on that day you went back home?
A.	On that day we went back home.  That is true.  And I believe I stated that here.
Q.	At what time was that, Witness?
A.	It was in the evening.
Q.	Wouldn't you have a more precise idea of the time?
A.	I did not have a watch on me.  I did not consult a watch.  It was around 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 5:30 p.m.
Q.	And what happened on the 10th of April, Witness?
A.	On the 10th of April there were no attacks as such.  The attack that took place was instead on the 11th of April.
Q.	And what happened on the 11th of April and to be more specific, what happened in Kiziba?
A.	An attack led by a policeman called Iredemba (phonetic) was launched at Kiziba.  There was another attack launched on Gishyita and Mika Muhimana participated in that attack; Sikubwabo came subsequently.  This is how the attacks were launched in Kiziba.
Q.	At what time was that?
A.	The first attack, that is the attack in Regemba was launched quite early, at about 10 a.m., and the attack launched in Gishyita occurred shortly thereafter but not very long after that.
Q.	When you state "not very long after," are you referring to 30 minutes, one hour?
A.	Well, try to understand what I've stated to you.  The first attack occurred at about 8 a.m., the other attack occurred at about 10 a.m.  You can roughly evaluate the time between the two attacks; it's about an hour.
Q.	Do we take it that you saw Mika leading the attack in Gishyita?
A.	How could I have seen him at 9 a.m., whereas that attack in which he participated occurred at 
10 a.m.?
Q.	So let us rephrase our question.  So I take it that then you saw him at 10 a.m.?
A.	Yes, the attack in Gishyita took place at 10 a.m.
Q.	My question to you is whether you saw Mika at 10 a.m.?
A.	I saw Mika.
Q.	I am going to quote a passage from your statement in relation to the events on the 11th of April.  "I saw Mika Muhimana at about 3 p.m. still in civilian clothes and armed with a gun.  He shot at us on that day as well."  Is this what you are saying?
A.	I am saying the same thing, because I saw Mika arrive at 10 a.m. with a gun.  He did not kill anybody. But at 3 p.m., while it was raining, I saw him shooting at people.  I cannot assert to you that he did not kill people at 10 a.m. or that he did not shoot at refugees.  I saw him, he was on the side -- he was on one side where I was because there were many people there, but when I say 10 a.m. I do not mean that I saw Mika shooting at anybody.  He came, I saw him; but it was at 3 p.m. that I saw him open fire on people.  When I say 3 p.m., it is only an estimate because I wasn't wearing a watch.
Q.	You state that when you saw him it was raining.
A.	I have stated that at a certain time during the attack it started to rain and the intensity of the attacks reduced.  If you read my statement of 1996 you would find that I make reference to Mika at 10 a.m., but I did not see him at that time, 10 a.m., open fire on people.  It was at 3 p.m. I saw him open fire on people.  That doesn't mean he didn't open fire on people at 10 a.m., because he was on a side of the hill where I wasn't.  I only saw him open fire on people at 3 p.m.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you saw Mika at 10 a.m., what was he doing?
A.	I saw Mika when the assailants, who were part of the attack on Gishyita, came up on the road.  We were up hill and the assailants from Musenyi came.  When they saw that the assailants from Gishyitawere arriving they came back and at that time the elderly persons who were with us told us, "Don't retreat.  Stay put.  You don't have a choice." 
Q.	At what distance were you, Witness, from Mika, when you saw him at 10 a.m.?
A.	I was up the road, I would say, at a distance of more than 15 metres, because I was further up the road.
Q.	You state, Witness, that the assailants used grenades; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  They used grenades in the evening in Ngendombi.
Q.	Who was carrying the grenades?
A.	Do you want me to give names?
Q.	Yes, if you have any names.
A.	I do not know the names of those who were carrying the grenades, but they were carried by people in the group of Hutu assailants.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You also state that there were several dozen who died; is that correct?
A.	That is correct, they died.
Q.	Can you be more specific as to whether it was still in Ngendombi?
A.	These are the names of the people I know fell in Ngendombi, there are four people but there were other people who were killed fell in Kiziba, others in Nyarutovu several people were killed by gunshot while others were killed with traditional weapons.
Q.	Among the dozen dead, or the dozens of people who died, could you identify any of them?
A.	Among the victims in Kiziba I recognise a certain Dieryta (phonetic), he fell at that place, but there were also Hutus who died as well because while the Tutsi were defending themselves they killed a few Hutu.  I also know people who fell in Ngendombi.  Among these people was one of my cousins known as (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  There was also a certain Fidel who came from Mubuga who also fell in that place.  As for the others, I do not remember their names.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You state that on the same day, at about 5 p.m., the assailants ran out of ammunition and withdrew to Nyarutovu; is that correct?
A.	Yes, at a certain time they ran out of ammunition and they retreated to Nyarutovu.  They only returned after a military vehicle arrived.  I believe it was those soldiers who supplied them with ammunition.  Among those assailants, at that time, we found some soldiers who were armed with guns.
Q.	When you state that, "there were some soldiers armed with guns," was that the only time when you saw soldiers armed with guns or you had seen them earlier in the course of that day?
A.	I explained that those soldiers came on board the vehicle in the evening, and that was when I saw them.
Q.	You are telling us that it was those soldiers who resupplied ammunition to the assailants?
A.	It is possible that it was those soldiers who resupplied them.
Q.	Maybe I once more did not hear what you said clearly, but did you not state before this Chamber that the ammunition was provided by Mika?
A.	I do not know whether you did not hear my answer properly.  When you were putting that question to me, was it with regard to the 9th of April or the 11th of April?
Q.	My question is related to the 11th of April. 
A.	I made mention of the fact that Mika provided ammunition on the 9th.  I don't know whether the others heard me correctly.  I made reference to that supply of ammunition in relation to the date of the 9th.  I did not state that Mika supplied ammunition on the 11th.  What I said was that he opened fire on people on the 11th in Ngendombi.
Q.	Thank you.  We shall have time to ascertain that.

Witness, could you explain to us what happened in Nyarutovu that same day in April?
A.	What I can say with regard to Nyarutovu is that Hutus held a short meeting there before the soldiers arrived.
Q.	No attack took place there, Witness?
A.	We crossed Nyarutovu from Kiziba but they were pursuing us.  There was a short conflict.  There was a short brief fighting and in Ngendombi large-scale attacks took place and subsequently in Nyarutovu.
Q.	We are talking about victims in Nyarutovu.  Could you tell us who those victims were?
A.	I do not know the victims of Nyarutovu.  I only know those who fell in Ngendombi  but it was still in Nyarutovu cellule.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you heard the assailants say, "Bring back Kabanda's head," where were you, exactly?
A.	I was in Ngendombi.
Q.	When you state that the assailants were saying, "Bring back Kabanda's head," can you be more specific?  Who was saying that?
A.	I did not state that the assailants said, "Bring back Kabanda's head."  What I said was that Mika himself said, "Look for Kabanda and kill him."  Did I say that all those that were in the attack said that Kabanda's head should be brought back?
Q.	I am going to read this passage from your statement of the 29th of August 2002 to you, Witness.  "I heard the assailants say, 'bring back Kabanda's head'.  He is a major trader in Gishyita.  Mika was one of those said so."  This is a passage from your statement which justifies my question.
A.	I made mention of assailants, but you are talking of all the assailants.  I made mention of Mika as one of the assailants.  I did not give the name of any other person.
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, since we are referring to Kabanda, do you know what became of him subsequently?
A.	Kabanda was killed subsequently.  He was decapitated, but I wasn't present when he was killed.  Neither was I present when he was decapitated.  People were talking about it, and saying that Mika had been among -- was among them, those who had brought the head.  When we got back, we who came from Gishyita, people from Gishyita, said, "We brought the head." and we were told that the head was hung up on his house, and that it was Mika who had hung up the head there.  I didn't say I was an eyewitness.  I'm only relating events that were related to me.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I should ask you, Professor, whether we can expect your usual courtesy today.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, I usually give a different answer from the preceding one because the cases are always unique, but please be sure that I am taking into account time management and making an effort to meet the Court's expectations.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
MR. SONGA:
I also thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In your statement, Witness, that is your statement of the 22nd of March 1996, you state that you knew the names of victims who fell in the attacks and you give ten names on a list.  Do you recall that?
A.	Which attack are you referring to?
Q.	I'm referring to all the attacks you witnessed.
A.	Those persons whose names I listed are not the only people I know.  I was asked to talk about victims of those attacks, and only ten names were noted, but many more people fell victim to those attacks.  So that list of ten names is only a short list of all the people who were victims of attacks.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Those names you mentioned in your statement, are they names of victims whose death you personally witnessed or are they names that you heard from other people?
A.	I witnessed some of those deaths with my own eyes, but I do not know what names were listed in my statement.  What I did was mention the names of people whose deaths I witnessed.  Other names were given to me by other people.
Q.	Witness, can we make a distinction between the victims whose deaths you witnessed and those whose names were given to you by other people?
A.	Many people died.  The persons whose deaths I witnessed are more than the names I gave and many other people's names were given to me because if you didn't find somebody you knew, you drew the conclusion that that person had died.  Generally you talk about names of family members who lived far from you, and they would tell you such-and-such a person died.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would seek the Court's leave to ask the witness to take time as regards to -- with the list of names on the statement of 22nd of March 1995 (sic) that the Witness should distinguish the persons whose deaths he witnessed personally and the names of persons whose death he learned through third parties.  I don't know whether this is feasible, Madam President.  I leave it to your discretion.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you are able to read and write?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let him read his statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you wanted him to be shown the statement of 22nd March 1996?  Yes.  Show this to the witness, the statement of 22nd March 1996.  Professor, you may now ask your question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have before you a list coming from you and in which you list the names of victims of attacks, and on that list there are ten names.  Can you tell us those whose deaths you witnessed?  For the remainder, we will understand that you did not witness their death but you learned of it from other sources.  So my question is this, tell the Court of the people on this list whose deaths you witnessed.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Before the witness answers the question, Your Honour, there's a witness protection issue here.  My learned friend can see from that list there are several persons related to this witness and the relationship and the name is outlined there.  So if we can operate with numbers it would be better.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, just give us the numbers.  Don't mention the names on the list.
THE WITNESS:
The person whose name is at number 1, of this person I heard that this person died.  I was not an eyewitness.  The same applies to number 2.  As for number 3, we arrived after he had been killed.  I was an eyewitness to the death of the person who's named under number 4. 

I arrived after the death whose name appears under the name of 5 and number 6.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, just give us the number of the persons to whom you were witness.  (Unintelligible) Okay, answer the question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go to six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
THE WITNESS:
We arrived after the death of the person whose name appears in number 6.  This is the case for number 7.  The same for number 8.  For number 9 -- for number ten, sorry, I was an eyewitness to the death of the person whose name appears there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Below number 9?
THE WITNESS:
I arrived after he had been killed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you witnessed the death of number ten and 4.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Four; ten and four.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was an eyewitness to the deaths of the persons whose name appeared under numbers 4 and 10, but there are others whose deaths I witnessed.
MR. SONGA:
Can the witness give us the copy of the statement that he used?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed.

MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before I forget, I would like to point out that we shall ask the Court to take the statement of the 22nd of March 1996 as an exhibit for the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statement of this witness, statement of 22nd March 1996 and is entered as Exhibit 31 to be kept under seal.  F for the French version and E for the English.
	(Exhibit No. D. 31(F) and D. 31(E), under seal)
MR. SONGA:
May I proceed, Madam President?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to ask questions on the date of the 13th of May 1994, a Friday, as you so kindly informed the Court.  Where did you go to on this 13th day of May 1994?
A.	I was in Bisesero.
Q.	On Bisesero hill or in Bisesero region?
A.	In Bisesero region.
Q.	Mr. Witness, may we be told what cellules you visited on this 13th May, this Friday?
A.	I was in Gitwa cellule.
Q.	Did you spend the entire day there?
A.	I didn't spend the entire day there.  Even if you asked me where I was, I was not a resident of this place.  I had taken refuge the night before.  I spent the night of the 12th in Gitwa, and the attack took place on the 13th and we were running here and there, as I explained.
Q.	I would like to have a concise answer, Mr. Witness.  On the day of the 13th of May, did you spend the entire day in Gitwa cellule; yes or no?
A.	No, I did not spend the entire day in Gitwa cellule.
Q.	How much time did you spend in Gitwa cellule on this 13th day of May 1994?
A.	I am not able to estimate the time, because we left this Gitwa cellule when the attacks came up and we hid in the surrounding hills in Bisesero and Muyira.  The attacks were launched, the Interahamwe came and brought buses.  Other Hutus from the environs came; they came from Rutiru and Rubazu (phonetic) and when we were chased out of there -- and when many people were killed I returned to Gititi.  So I can therefore say I ran through this place several times when I was fleeing.
Q.	Mr. Witness, on what Bisesero hill did you go to this 13th of May?
A.	I do not know whether you understand what I was saying.  I was not on a hill.  I was constantly on the run.  I therefore could not stay on a single hill.
Q.	I do not know whether you understood me correctly.  I am asking you about the different hills that you visited on the 13th of May.  You may not know and, of course, your response will be duly noted.
A.	I know those hills.  I know the Bisesero hills.  You could cross the Bisesero hills in a few hours, if you were being chased.  We crossed on the Bisesero hills on the run.  Do you want me to tell you the names of the Bisesero hills?
Q.	Yes, I would like to know the names of all the Bisesero hills you crossed on this 13th day of May.
A.	Let us start with Gitwa.  We crossed Ruengabo (phonetic).  We arrived at Rurambo (phonetic).
MR. SONGA:
I would like to ask the translator -- the interpreter to confirm the succession of hills.  What was the first hill?
THE WITNESS:
I do not understand the question.  Are you asking me the question -- that is you want to know all the hills I crossed on the 13th of May?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Exactly, Mr. Witness, and I am saying if it is difficult we can move to another question.
A.	Let's not move on to other questions.  I am going to tell you about the hills on which fighting took place.  I cannot know all the hills and you may not know them either. 
Q.	On the contrary. 
A.	The first hill is Gitwa.  We crossed other hills in Muyira.  And in Muyira there were many Tutsis because this is a very high hill.  We had spent months there, and that is where the Interahamwe focused their attacks because this place had resisted the Interahamwe and many assailants had fallen there.  There was even a lieutenant who fell there.  This Hutu had requested the reinforcements of the Interahamwe, and it is the leaders who came to show the assailants this hill after the death of several persons due to knives and grenades.  So the situation deteriorated.  We crossed Bisesero to arrive at Gititi, then we crossed Mataba and then Gititi -- Gititi is where we arrived and we experienced the attack of Mika, then some other people who shot at us; other people died.  We went to Kigarama and we continued to Kigarama, Kazirandimwe and other hills.  I do not know whether you know these hills.
Q.	Help me to take notes correctly.  If I understood correctly, there's Gitwa, Muyira, Bisesero, Gititi, Kigarama, Kazirandimwe; is that correct?
A.	Would you mind repeating that list and would you please take it slowly?
Q.	As you wish.  Gitwa.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Muyira, Bisesero?
A.	No, I told you of Mataba hill, which is between Muyira and Gititi, and this is in Bisesero.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
These are very important questions, Professor?
MR. SONGA:
Very, very important.  Your Honours, I also tried my hand at the English.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is good.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	After Gititi I noted Kigarama and last Kazirandimwe.
A.	We came back to Gitwa.  Counsel, I understand that you understand Kinyarwanda quite well.  You no longer require the services of an interpreter.
Q.	It is the Court that needs the services of the interpreter.

Very well.  We're still on the 13th of May and you state that you saw Mika Muhimana in Gititi where you moved after an attack using rocket launchers that was carried out by Interahamwe that came from Gisenyi; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	When you state that there was an attack using rocket launchers carried out by Interahamwe, did you see this new weapon before or had you seen this new weapon before or were you seeing it for the first time?
A.	It was something new.
Q.	Later, in another place, did you see rocket launchers borne by Interahamwes?
A.	Are you talking about the period that followed the 13th of May attack?
Q.	Yes. 
A.	The Interahamwe returned on Saturday the 14th, but this time they did not use heavy weapons, they used light weapons, as well as traditional weapons, sticks and other traditional weapons.
Q.	Why did you state, Witness, that the Interahamwe came from Gisenyi?
A.	I say this because amongst these Interahamwe some died during this attack and they were carrying on them identity cards.  Also, the language of inhabitants of Ruhengeri and Gisenyi is different from language we speak because I know how my fellow students who came from Gisenyi and Ruhengeri spoke.  Subsequently, the Hutu told us that the attack had been carried out by Interahamwe who had come from Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In fact, Mr. Witness, I have noted that there is some minor confusion both in my questions and in your answers in regard to this attack with the rocket launcher.  I would like to make myself clearly understood.  Regarding the attack carried out by Interahamwe, who came from Gisenyi, that is, using rocket launchers?  Didn't it happen before Gititi?
A.	It was before, some hours before.
Q.	Some hours before.  How many hours would that be, please?
A.	The Interahamwe arrived at Muyira at about nine or ten o'clock and the Gititi attack was launched one or two hours afterwards.  I would say in the afternoon or after midday.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state the following.  You saw Mika in Gititi where he had moved following an attack.  Do you mean that the rocket launching attack occurred in Muyira before Gititi?
A.	How do you want me to explain so that you can understand?  I have told you that we left Muyira on the run and we arrived at Gititi.  What attack came before the other, in your view?
Q.	I shall take the liberty of answering your question.  It's Muyira.
A.	Exactly.  That is where the attack was launched first.
Q.	We are coming to a clearer understanding.  So it is in Muyira that the rocket launchers were used?
A.	Exactly.
Q.	Thank you very much for your cooperation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, before you proceed we may ask you how much time would you take to conclude your current cross-examination?
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm sure the Professor is about to conclude, he's always been very generous and considerate.
MR. SONGA:
But I have also been known to disappoint you, Your Honours, Madam President.  I hope you will not be too disappointed but I beg you to grant me another hour, considering the important events that we have not yet treated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us stop for the day and continue with your cross-examination tomorrow.  I will inform you that after the conclusion of the evidence of this witness tomorrow we would like to be addressed on the motion under Rule 92bis trial by the Prosecutor.

Cross-examination to continue tomorrow after 2 p.m.. 
(Court adjourned at 1900H)
