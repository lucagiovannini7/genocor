MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning to all.  The Court is in session.  The appearances are the same as before? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, same appearances. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Defence. 
MR. SONGA:
The team is the same, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe we have staff from the witness support section.  Mr. Constant?  
MR. CONSTANT:
That is so, My Lord. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness support section, can we ask you how many -- do you have six witnesses for this week?  We have already heard four witnesses.  We are left with two witnesses.  Can you arrange some witnesses for tomorrow? 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Thank you, Madam President.  I probably must specify here that the pace at which --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat it, please. 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
We bring in witnesses according to the schedule that was given to us by the Defence counsel.  And there is something which I think must be emphasised here, which is that these witnesses, we have to make a lot of arrangements.  Most of them are not here in Tanzania.  They are, like, for the present session, the witnesses we brought in came from Rwanda, and before getting them in here, there is a lot of administrative issues to be cleared that involve the UN, certainly here and in Kigali, because of the Rwandan government.  Then there was another one which is above the control of all of us, which is the will of the witnesses.  Normally, there were to be eight witnesses at the beginning of this session, but two decided not to come.  So at the end of the day, we only had six left.  

And as we are talking now, yes, we are unlikely to have -- we might have ten witnesses coming in from (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), if all the arrangements we are having now go through smoothly, and we hope so.  Even if they come tomorrow, I doubt -- I don't think you can have them appearing for this Court tomorrow.  We are also likely to have one witness coming from (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  He will be here on Saturday, and there are many others.  We hope that by next week most of them will be around.  

Now, even after all this, we still have another issue at hand, which is -- concerns the detained witnesses who are in Rwanda.  And I think the counsel -- the Defence counsel will have to file a motion, discuss it before -- to have it discussed by this Chamber so that we get the proper authorisation and have the Rwandan authorities release these witnesses to us.  

So we have all these preparation, matters to handle before you can have the witnesses the way you see them coming here.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You say that two witnesses did not wish to come.  Did they refuse to appear for the Defence?  Okay. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did they say they will not come this week or they would not come at all?  What is the position?
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
According to the reading we have from the way they were (unintelligible), they simply said they don't feel like coming, which means somewhere along the line they must have changed their opinion or whatever.  So we do not consider them as witnesses any more because they said they are not willing to appear. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the problem we have is that the estimated length of time for each witness given by the Defence 
	is 45 minutes, so we would like to have at least 12 witnesses for a week.  Can that be done? 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
I am hesitating because, in fact, as I said earlier on, there are a lot of administrative and other arrangements to be considered.  In fact, if it was only left to WVSS, we would like to bring all the witnesses at the same time, but also we have to take into consideration the fact that among these witnesses, some are detainees and we cannot, for operational purposes or for other obvious reasons, we cannot put all of them in the same -- for instance, we are using the UN flight -- we cannot put all of them in the same flight because they do not belong to the same category, and also for security reasons we cannot do that.  

And apart from that, there are other considerations, like the facilities that are available, when we are dealing with detainee witnesses, the facilities that are available.  Right now, the UNDF premises also restrains our ability to increase the number of witnesses, especially when we are talking about the detainees.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So how many witnesses can be flown in next week?

MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Next week? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
I think all in all, starting from, at least, 11.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Eleven is okay. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If that's what they can do, that's all.  What we would like you to appreciate is, is that we would like to fill in the time so that we don't have gaps of time that is not spent because witnesses are not available.  So make every effort you can to have the largest possible number of witnesses available so that we can ensure that Court continues without breaks.  As it is now this week, we are only going to be able to sit three days instead of four.  But we would wish to be able to have witnesses consume the whole time, between Monday and Thursday, which are our sitting days. 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Thank you, sir.  You can rest assured that we are going to do our level best.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You are free to go now.  

Thank you. 

Mr. Issa, please call in the next witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you are a protected witness, and we are sitting in open session.  You will be called by your pseudonym, DN.  You also do not give any information that would compromise your identity.  Now you'll be sworn in to speak the truth.  

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness. 
	(Declaration made by Witness DN in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you have a piece of paper in front of you? 

THE WITNESS:
I have a document before me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read it? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot read, but I know who I am. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter, please, to come to the witness box and assist the witness with the translation.  Is he coming? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter is coming, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has confirmed all the information contained in that sheet detailing her particulars.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  May the witness -- can you also verify your thumb impression at the bottom of the page.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is my thumbprint. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  This personal information sheet would be Exhibit D. 45, to be kept under seal. 
	 (Exhibit No. D. 45 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, now you can begin with your examination-in-chief. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS DN,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I am going to ask you a few questions regarding the events that occurred in Rwanda between April and July 1994, and here goes my first question.  Do you know when President Habyarimana died?
A.	Yes, I know.
Q.	Where were you when you learnt about it?
A.	I was in the area where I normally live.
Q.	Is it the area or zone found on the information sheet shown to you a while ago?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Were you alone when you learnt about it?
A.	I was with my husband.
Q.	How was the day on which you learned about the death of the president in respect of your safety?
A.	When we learnt of the death of the president, I was with my husband.  The president died during the night of the 6th, and on the next day, on the 7th, people said President Habyarimana was deceased.  Others were saying that the Kinani had died, and my husband, since my husband was still (unintelligible), he went and told the other Tutsi the following:  "Do you know that the Kinani has died?"  "Yes, we know."  

There was a young lady who was studying in Burundi who immediately took her back and went away.  Those are the conditions under which we learnt about the death of the president.
Q.	After learning of the death of the president, did you continue to live at the address that you've indicated?
A.	No, we did not remain there after the death of the president because the security deteriorated.  People started killing people.  My husband and myself took flight, and we went to hide in the house of an ********** who was in our neighbourhood.  She hid my husband in her house.  I stayed there, and the war continued.  My husband remained in that ********************.  And it was in ****************** ******************* used to come and visit ************* and I said the following to Mika:  "My husband is here and the people are hunting down the Tutsis to kill them.  What is going to happen?"  He asked me to call my husband so he could talk to Mika.  I called my husband and Mika told him, "How is it?"  My husband said, "Well, things are not going on fine."  And Mika told him, "Try to be courageous.  I will continue to help you.  I will always come to reassure you."  That continued, and Mika frequently came and met my husband in ****************** house and reassured him and said, "Have courage; nothing is going to happen."  

In June the French came, and when the French came, Mika came and told my husband, "Come, I am going to accompany you in order to help you to meet the Frenchmen."  Mika accompanied my husband and handed him over to the French, and the French took him to Bisesero.  And it is under those circumstances that my husband was able to survive.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You have just given Mika's name.  You've just called Mika's name.  Did you know him during the events of 1994?
A.	I knew Mika.

MR. SONGA:
I am sorry, Madam President.  I was talking in Kinyarwanda.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Now, Witness, how did you know him?
A.	These are the circumstances under which I knew Mika:  He was our conseiller.
Q.	Did you know him only as conseiller?
A.	I did not know him only has conseiller, since I used to meet him often in his secteur.  That is how I knew him.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You talked about your husband.  Can you tell us what is his ethnic group?
A.	My husband is Tutsi.  We had just had a child together.
Q.	Can you also tell us about Mika's ethnic group?
A.	Mika is Hutu.
Q.	Tell us, Madam Witness, about the distance that could have been between the house of the *******you talked about and the house in which Mika used to live. 
A.	The distance wasn't very long between those two houses.  We were neighbours.  The distance between my house and the house of that ******* cannot be assessed in terms of kilometres.
Q.	Very good.  And when you were in the ******** house, were you also hidden with your husband?
A.	Well, I wasn't hiding myself.  I could come out and go to the courtyard and even up to the entrance of the compound.  So I wasn't hiding myself.
Q.	Your husband, was he able to survive the events of 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	According to you, did he survive because he was hidden in the ****** house?
A.	From what I know and given the situation that was prevailing at the time, I can say that he survived because he hid himself in that *********** house and Mika helped him to reach where the French were and who took him to Bisesero.
Q.	Where were the French when Mika took your husband to them?
A.	The planes of the French used to land at the centre of Gishyita.
Q.	Did you see your husband again?
A.	I saw my husband again.  I mean that I saw him after the war. 
Q.	Is he still alive?
A.	He died in 2002 of ill health.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, with your permission, I would like the registry to show the witness a name on this sheet of paper, and then I will ask her a question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give the piece of paper to the witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Perhaps the interpreter could help her to read that name. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you read the name on the piece of paper that has been given to you just now? 
THE WITNESS:
I can read the name.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Could you please confirm to the Chamber that it is indeed the name of the Tutsi person who is your husband and who went into hiding in the ****** home.
A.	Yes, that is indeed his name.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
I crave your indulgence, Madam President.  I have another name which I would like the witness to read. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give the witness the piece of paper.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, are you able to read that name?  If you can't, then the registry can assist you. 
A.	I have been able to read the name.
Q.	Can you tell us who that person is?
A.	Would you like me to read the name out?
Q.	No.  Simply tell us whether or not you know him or whether or not you know her.
A.	Yes, I know the person in question.
Q.	Do you also know her husband?
A.	Yes, I know her husband.
Q.	Can you tell us his name; that is, the name of the husband?
A.	Yes, I can tell you her husband's name.
Q.	Please, go ahead. 
A.	His name is ****************** (phonetic).
Q.	Where is -- no.  I withdraw the question.  Can you know the person whose name -- there's another person whose name is on the sheet of paper.  I'll ask you whether you know that person as well. 
MR. SONGA:
With the assistance of the registry. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You didn't tell us who the other person is.  You didn't -- you asked that question, but it wasn't answered.  The lady, the lady whose name you wrote down, she didn't tell us who she is, although she said she knew her. 
MR. SONGA:
I will take that question over again. 

Madam President, I think we should try to do things in an orderly manner.  I have given three names to the witness.  The witness does not read.  The first name is that of her husband and relates to the events.  And I would like the interpreter to help the witness read the second name, make sure that she did indeed read that name.  I have not yet got into the third name, which is still being shown to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you read the second name? 
THE WITNESS:
I indeed read that name. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She said she could read. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She doesn't need assistance to read the name, so you can ask her the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you read the third name?  

Mr. Interpreter, it's okay. 
THE WITNESS:
I am looking at the second name.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Right.  Thank you, Witness.  Do you confirm that you know that person?
A.	Yes, indeed, I know that person.
Q.	Did you know her during the events of 1994?
A.	Yes, I knew her.
Q.	Do you know what has become of her, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I do.  During the war, or shortly after the war, that person was living in ************************ *************** and war broke out while she was still in **************.  She continued to live there.  She did not go elsewhere.  She did not go into hiding elsewhere.  She continued to stay in ***************.  At one time, ******* took her to the French.  That person was Tutsi.  She survived while she was in Bisesero.
Q.	And what became of her, as far as you know today, Witness?
A.	That person is currently living in **************.
Q.	And can you tell the Chamber who her husband is?  What is the name of her husband?
A.	Her husband's name is ****** 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, did you say that this second name lived in *****************************?  Madam Witness, did you get my question? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understood your question, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What's the answer then? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not quite understand your question, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, did you say that the second person was living with ***************** the house?  Do you confirm -- as ******? 
THE WITNESS:
That is what I said, Madam President.  She was living with ***************. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you have before you, I believe, a third name.  Have you been able to read it?
A.	I have not succeeded in reading that name.
Q.	You will be assisted. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we request the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you have been assisted to know the third name before you. 
A.	Yes, I have.
Q.	And who is that third person whose name is before you?
A.	I know the person whose name is before me.  She is a **************; his wife.
MR. SONGA:
I would like a more faithful translation. 

JUDGE SHORT:
What do you mean by a more faithful translation?  Did you explain your question?
MR. SONGA:
The witness said ************(phonetic) in Kinyarwanda.  I did not hear the translation in French. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But you heard her in Kinyarwanda. 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I followed.
JUDGE SHORT:
And what did you understand?  What (overlapping microphones) in Kinyarwanda?  Is it equal to "a ************"?  The English translation which we got is that she is the *******************************.  Is that what you heard in Kinyarwanda? 
MR. SONGA:
In Kinyarwanda, what I understood specifically was that **************** went to live with that woman and she became his wife.  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, what was that woman -- who was she? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you repeat your answer, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I indeed said that that woman was ********.
JUDGE SHORT:
Why do you describe her as a ********? 
THE WITNESS:
Because she lives with ********. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is she his wife? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, she is his wife.  They cohabit. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did they get married?  In addition to cohabiting, did they get married? 
THE WITNESS:
They did not get married.  She was living with him as a concubine.  Yes, there are still living together. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, Professor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam President -- sorry, Madam Witness.  Professor Songa, you are making me confused.  
Madam Witness, you mean to say that two women are living with *************** at the moment, in the house which belonged to *****?
THE WITNESS:
************** cohabits with the woman who was in *************, actually, and the other woman was taken home as a ************ 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Professor, go on. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us continue.  During the events, did you hear that Mika committed rape in your secteur?
A.	I was never an eyewitness to such acts, and I never heard anything of the sort either.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In his capacity as conseiller of secteur, where was Mika working?
A.	He worked in his home.  He never had an office.
Q.	Do you mean that in 1994 your secteur did not have official offices for the conseiller?
A.	In 1994, our secteur did not have offices, and even as of now, it doesn't have offices. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to end my examination-in-chief, saying that I used very little time for this examination-in-chief.  Could I recover the time left in the next examination-in-chief of the next witness?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Use as much time as you need for this witness and you use as much time as you need for the next witness, no more than you need. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you for your liberal attitude, Your Honour.  

Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief.  

Madam Witness, I thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor for cross-examination. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good morning, Your Honours.
					     CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA.
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Madam Witness, before you came to testify here, did anyone approach you in Rwanda in order to discuss your testimony today, in Arusha?
A.	I did not discuss it with anyone whatsoever.
Q.	How did you find yourself to be a witness in this case, if you did not discuss your testimony with anybody?
A.	I came to give testimony here because I met somebody called Mr. ******** who is there.  He came to my home.  He asked me to come and testify to what I saw during the war.
Q.	Now, during the war, that is between April, May and June, you saw several things, did you not, Madam Witness?
A.	I explained what I saw.
Q.	Now, when you were discussing with the person who came to see you, did he take some notes from what you were telling him?
A.	To the best of my knowledge, he took down nothing.
Q.	You mean you were just discussing and nothing was being recorded, no record was being made of your discussions?
A.	We had a discussion, but he wrote down nothing.  He asked me to come and testify to what I had seen or testify to what Mika had done, good or bad.
Q.	Now, did you tell that person that you took refuge at ******** during 1994?
A.	I did not understand your question, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	My question is very simple, Madam Witness.  In the course of your discussion with the person who came to talk to you about your testimony of Mika, did you tell him that during the war, that is April, May and June, you took refuge *********?
A.	I said nothing about it because the person in question was asking me to come and testify to what I had seen Mika do during the war.  I did not tell this person that I went to hide *******************  ********** with my husband.
Q.	So if this person has said somewhere that this is what you said to him, then he should be lying.  Is that your testimony?
A.	Yes, he would be lying.  I said nothing to him about that.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, do you have -- are you related to Mika Muhimana in any way?
A.	I am not in any way related to him.
Q.	Are you not by any chance the cousin of Mika Muhimana?
A.	I am not his cousin.
Q.	Is your mother and Muhimana's mother not related?
A.	There is no relationship between them.
Q.	Very well.  Do you know Mika Muhimana's younger brother?
A.	Yes, I know his younger brother.
Q.	Is it not true that there is a time when you and he had a relationship?
A.	There was never any relationship between me and him.
Q.	So if someone says that you and he had a child, that person would be lying.  Is that the position?
A.	Yes, they would be lying.
Q.	All right.  Now, you testified here that there was a time when you took your husband to a certain ***** ****** house for refuge.  Was that your testimony, Madam Witness? 
A.	Yes, this is what I stated.
Q.	Is there a relationship between you and that *******? 
A.	There is no blood relation between this woman and I, except for the fact that I stayed with her.
Q.	And is there a relationship between that woman and Mika Muhimana?
A.	This ***************.
Q.	How far did this lady live from Muhimana's residence?
A.	Between the residence of Mika Muhimana and the residence of his (his) house, there is a distance that can be covered by an hour's walk.
Q.	And what is the distance between your residence and *********** residence?
A.	The distance was short.  This ****** was our neighbour.
Q.	Now, can you tell Their Honours how often between April, May and June you lived at ***************** house, if you can recall?
A.	Are you referring to visits?
Q.	Yes, please.
A.	I did not understand your question properly, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Okay.  Let me rephrase my question.  When your husband went to live into ************************** **********************, did you also move to that house?
A.	I was at the place where my husband was hiding with our child.
Q.	All right.  Now, how often, do you recall, did Mika visit you at that place between April, May and June?  How many times?
A.	I saw him four times.  He came to calm down my husband.
Q.	On the first occasion, do you recall how long he stayed with you?
A.	For the first time, he came in the morning.  He stayed for an hour and we chatted.
Q.	Right.  And on the second occasion, how long did he stay?
A.	On the second occasion, he came at midday and he stayed for two hours.
Q.	And how long did he stay on the third occasion?
A.	On the third occasion, he came in the evening but he stayed for a while.
Q.	How late in the evening did he come on this occasion?
A.	He came at 5 p.m.
Q.	And what time did he leave?
A.	He went away at 5 p.m.
Q.	I thought you said he came at 5 p.m.  Now, my question was, what time did he leave?
A.	To the best of my knowledge, you did not put the question to me regarding the time when he arrived at this place.
Q.	Okay.  I'm asking you now, what time did he come and what time did he leave?
A.	He arrived at about 3 p.m. and he went away at 5 p.m.
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us whether the four visits were made in April or May or June of 1994?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Or all three months.
MR. KAPAYA:
I didn't get your question, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They could also have been made in all three months; some in April; some in May; some in June.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's what my question amounts to, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, your question was whether they were made in April or May or June. 
THE WITNESS:
I did not note what month he came -- on what month he came, but I know that he came to this place.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, you testified that Mika helped your husband to escape; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Can you tell us the month in which Mika helped your -- handed your husband to the French?
A.	It was in the month of June, after the arrival of French troops.
Q.	Did Mika take him personally or did he send somebody to go and hand him over to the French?
A.	It is Mika who took him personally.
Q.	Now, during the course of your testimony, you talked about a person called ***********************.  I didn't quite understand.  Who did you say he was?
A.	I was asked the name of the ************.
Q.	In other words, you are saying this is the name of ***********; is that your testimony?
A.	That is exactly it.
Q.	Witness, you were shown names of two people, two women, who you say they are either married -- one whom you say is married to ************ and then you say the other is a ******************.  Now, can you tell me where the first person you were shown, the first person among these two you were shown, lived in 1994?  Can you tell me where she lived?
A.	I did not understand your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you are referring to which name?  The third one, the second one? 
MR. KAPAYA:
The second one.  The second name.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	My question is, can you tell us where that person lived *********?
A.	This person was living in *************** before the war and after the war, and today this person is still living in **********
Q.	Was there a time in April, May, June that you visited Mika's house?
A.	Yes, I did go there.
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you went during April, May, June?
A.	I did not go there on several occasions.
Q.	Can you tell us whether you know the people who -- apart from this person, the other people who lived in ***************?
MR. SONGA:
Objection.  Objection, Madam President.  The witness did not say that the two persons whose names **********************************************************.  The witness did not say that.  The witness said that it is the first person, the person who is first on the list who lived ***************.  Unless of course there is an error as to the name, in which case it should be verified.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The question, Professor, is not whether the person lived there.  Mr. Kapaya is asking the witness whether she can say how many people lived, other than the second name -- whether any other person lived in that house.  Is that not the question?
MR. KAPAYA:
That was my question, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, whether any other person lived there. 
MR. SONGA:
Unless I did not understand correctly, what I understand is that the witness said apart from these two people -- or what was said was apart from -- what should have been apart from this person, not these two persons. 
JUDGE SHORT:
The question is whether she knows the persons that lived in *********.  It's a very simple question.  Either she knows or she doesn't know. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please proceed.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yes.  Can you tell us, Madam Witness, whether you know the people who lived in ************ apart from this first person -- the second name we have been talking about?
JUDGE SHORT:
You mean during April, May and June?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's the question.
THE WITNESS:
There was his wife who lived with him.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us all the people you recall who lived in that house, apart from the wife, and the name of the second -- the second name which we have just showed you?
A.	There was another person who lived there.
Q.	Can you tell us the name, please, of that other person?
A.	It's a certain ****** who had sought refuge in ******
Q.	And who else lived there, apart from these three?
A.	I know of no other persons.
Q.	Is it your testimony that *********lived with three other people or that there are others that you do not know?
A.	I did not see other people in ***** house apart from those persons whose names I have mentioned.
Q.	You were also shown a third name.  Now, can you tell me, where did that person live in April, May, June '94, the third name which you were shown?
A.	This person lived quite close to the commune office.
Q.	Right.  Now, in the course of your discussion with the person who came to see you about your testimony, did you discuss these two people?  Did he tell you that these two people may have given evidence before this Tribunal?
A.	No, he did not talk about it to me.
Q.	So how come that you talk about them in your evidence?  What is the relationship between your testimony and these two people, if you did not discuss them with the person who came to see you?
A.	I mentioned these two persons because ******took over ********* houses, and that is where he lives now.
Q.	So what is the relationship between that and the charges that are facing Mika before this Tribunal?  What is the relevance?  Can I get an answer, please, to that question so that we can proceed?
A.	I said -- told -- recounted what I saw.  And I only told you of the events that I witnessed personally. 
Q.	Madam Witness, is it not true that the person who came to see you about your testimony told you that these two people have said that Mika was involved in rapes? Is that correct?
A.	No.  He did not talk to me of these things.  I cannot tell you things that I did not see or that I did not hear about. 
Q.	If he did not talk to you about rapes, how come that in the course of your testimony you said that Mika didn't rape anybody?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, she said she did not personally witness any rape and did not hear that Mika had raped anybody.  I don't think that that is inconsistent with -- she didn't see Mika rape anybody; she didn't hear somebody say Mika raped anybody.
MR. KAPAYA:
	Your Honour, my question is directed at the basis upon which she said that.  Did she say it just out of the blue?
JUDGE SHORT:
Actually, it was a question from counsel, so you can't blame her.  It wasn't a voluntary statement.  She was responding to a question from her counsel.
MR. KAPAYA:
I withdraw the question.  Your Honour, that's the end of my questions.  Thank you, very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Professor, do you have any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
I wouldn't do any re-examination, Madam President, but I would like that the documents bearing names should be entered as exhibits. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document bearing the first name is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 46, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 46 admitted, under seal)
MR. KAPAYA:
Just one matter, Your Honours.  I request also to enter as an exhibit the summary furnished to us by the Defence pertaining to the testimony of this witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How do you enter that?  But you haven't put it to the witness.  You cannot enter it unless the witness has seen it. 
MR. KAPAYA:
But I cross-examined extensively on that issue.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, which entitles you to comment on it because it is part of court record, but you can't put it in an exhibit.
MR. KAPAYA:
Well, if Your Honours are saying that it's already part of the record --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is part of the record; that's correct.  You are entitled to comment on it as part of the record, what you have been provided for, and that will refer to the issues and questions you have referred to this witness, but you can't tender it in as an exhibit itself. 
MR. KAPAYA:
If that's the position the Court adopts, then it is fine with me, because I hope it also will take it into account when assessing the credibility of this witness.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The second name on the sheet is Exhibit D. 47, and the third one is Exhibit D. 48, under seal. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. 47 and D. 48 admitted, under seal)
JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Witness, is it your testimony that all the evidence you have given are matters which you saw yourself and that you know personally?  They are not matters that anybody told you; is that your testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, those are things that I saw personally, nobody talked to me about.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  For example, how do you know that it was Mika who took your husband to the French, that he personally took your husband to the French?
THE WITNESS:
I was at the place where my husband was hiding.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you accompany them? 
THE WITNESS:
I accompanied them right to Gishyita where the French troops were positioned, and I came back home to take care of my child. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How long did you live with this -- you said you stayed with this old lady.  How long did you stay with her? 
THE WITNESS:
From the time I left my house to take refuge in the *********** house, I stayed there for a short while and then I fled towards Congo.
JUDGE SHORT:
If I understood your testimony, you said that you stayed with ****************** and that's how you got to know her.  That is *******************.  And I am asking you for what purpose did you go to stay there and for how long did you stay there? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't quite understand your question, Your Honour.

JUDGE SHORT:
Why did you have to stay with the *********? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May Your Honour speak into the microphone.  Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why did you have to go and stay with this ******? 
THE WITNESS:
You mean from the time the war started?  Is that what you want to know? 
JUDGE SHORT:
From whenever.  How long did you stay with her?  Did you stay with her for several periods, and if so, what periods?  I'd like to know how long you stayed with her and during what period. 
THE WITNESS:
I lived in ****************** house two different periods.  First, it was before the war and I wasn't married yet, and for the second occasion it was when we took refuge at her house.  So I don't quite understand the period you are referring to.
JUDGE SHORT:
Before the war, how long did you stay with her? 
THE WITNESS:
I stayed there for a short while.
JUDGE SHORT:
And after the war, how long did you stay there?  And during the war -- did you stay there during the war? 
THE WITNESS:
During the war, I stayed there for some time, and then we took flight subsequently. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And during the war how long did you stay there? 
THE WITNESS:
I stayed at that ************** place for a period of a week and we fled after that. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, ***************, did you know him before he came to see you to testify in this case? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know him.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you ask him how he came to locate you or how he came to contact you? 
THE WITNESS:
When he came to me, he said he had been asked to find out where I was. 

JUDGE SHORT:
Did you ask him who asked him to find out where you were? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not ask him that question, because when he came to me, he said, "I have come to see you to ask you to go and testify in respect of what you saw, and I would therefore like you to go and testify on behalf of Mika."  I knew that Mika was in custody and therefore I accepted to come and testify. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When did you go to Congo? 
THE WITNESS:
I went to Congo in mid-June.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you go all alone or you were accompanied by someone? 
THE WITNESS:
We went in a compact group and there were many of us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who made the arrangement for a trip to Congo? 
THE WITNESS:
I went of my own volition.  I passed by the road and there were many refugees on the road. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you were not a refugee, were you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was a refugee. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When did your husband take refuge?  What day did he go to take refuge in the ************* house? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not quite recall the day.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How long after the war started? 
THE WITNESS:
At the beginning of the war.  It is at the onset of the war that we went to take refuge at that ************* house.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And who suggested to you that you should take refuge in the ****** house?
THE WITNESS:
Nobody proposed this to us.  We knew that **************** was a good person and that she couldn't do anything bad towards us.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were any other people taking refuge in her house?
THE WITNESS:
I didn't see any others.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So there was only you and your husband? 
THE WITNESS:
We were the only ones at her place.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was ************ there? 
THE WITNESS:
He had died a long time before.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
A long time before.  So there were only three of you: the ********, your husband and yourself? 
THE WITNESS:
There were also other children who were living under the same roof. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And how did you know the attackers would not come to that house? 
THE WITNESS:
As to knowing how nobody was going to attack that residence, you know, when you are seeking refuge, you make choices.  You say, "If you are lucky, I am going to survive and if you are not lucky, you are going to lose your life."  So we did not take into account that this or that assailant could attack that residence.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes.  I am asking you, why did you choose that residence instead of many other places where other people took refuge?
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that we knew that that ********* was a person of good morality and that she couldn't denounce my husband and that is why we took refuge in her house. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, I am asking you, how did you know that her house was protected against attacks, there was not going to be attacks in the house?  You did not stay in your own house; you went into her house.  Why did you do that if you didn't know that it was not going to be -- there were not going to be attacks? 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that we had placed our hopes on that old lady because we found her to be good and she was telling us that -- we felt that she couldn't do any harm to us.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She could not do any harm to you.  Attackers could do harm to you.  That's what I am asking you.  How do you know she would keep the attackers out? 
THE WITNESS:
During that period, there were no attacks against her residence.  Probably, if the assailants had come to that residence, they would have killed my husband.  Fortunately, they didn't go there and that old lady didn't go to call the assailants to come attack my husband.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, you said that while were you there you visited Mika's house.  Do you remember that? 
THE WITNESS:
I went to pay Mika a visit after Mika had handed over my husband to the French to take him to Bisesero.  I went to see Mika to ask him if he had any information concerning my husband.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you went to his house after your husband had gone to the French? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, my husband had already left and had been taken to Bisesero.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you said that there was no particular relationship between you and Mika. 
THE WITNESS:
There was no relationship between Mika and myself, except that at a certain point *************** **************.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And was there any relationship between your husband and Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
No, my husband was Tutsi and Mika was Hutu.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what was the basis of ************* before the war? 
THE WITNESS:
I went to ****************************** because, you know, at a certain point a child could decide to go *********** or that person's house.  You don't ************ your parents or with the people with whom you have a relationship.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You *********** people, just decide to ********** people you don't know? 
THE WITNESS:
The most important thing is that the family that is accommodating you is taking good care of you, because if they take good care of you, you can live with them.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why would you want to ******************** with your own parents? 
THE WITNESS:
At a certain point, it may occur that you have problems with your parents.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You yourself, did you?  What was the reason that led you to go and stay with *****************?  That's the question I am asking you. 
THE WITNESS:
The reason why I went to live with Mika's mother is as follows.  I realised that I wasn't taken good care of, as ************* were, so I prefer to go and live at ********** house. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you asked to live -- your parents to go and ******************************** so that she can take good care of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I didn't ask them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How did you go, then, if you didn't ask them? 
THE WITNESS:
I liked that ********.  I wanted to stay with her, and that is why I went to live in her house.  My parents knew where I was and decided to leave me there.  That is at ********** house. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, thank you.  We have concluded your evidence.  We also thank you for your testimony before the Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's five to eleven.  We'll take a short break and resume after 15 minutes. 
	(Court recessed from 1054H to 1124H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings of the Court resume.  
THE WITNESS:
Can somebody say something so I know I can hear you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness. 

THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you are a protected witness, so you will be referred to by your pseudonym, DQ, instead of your real name.  You also do not disclose any information that may identify you.  Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you have a sheet of paper in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
I see a sheet of paper in front of me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read it? 
THE WITNESS:
There is information that appears here in French.  I can't read French, but the ones that appear -- or the information that appears in Kinyarwanda I can read. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm the information contained therein is correct? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She can't read the French ones. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we ask the Kinyarwanda booth to assist the witness with the French. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has confirmed all the information that appears on the identification sheet. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.  

Madam Witness, you also confirm your signature at the bottom of the page? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness's microphone is not on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Switch it on.  

Can you repeat the answer, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is indeed my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This protected information sheet is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 49, to be kept under seal.

WITNESS DQ,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
By MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I am going to put a series of questions to you, and here is the first one:  How did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	This is how I learnt of the death of President Habyarimana:  It was on the morning of the 6th, I left my house to go to work.  I met a neighbour who used to work in another neighbours' house.  I greeted him, and he said to me, "We are very happy the wicked man is dead."  There is a child who was called Rubyogo, and I asked his parents how this Rubyogo had died.  I was mocked, and they said "Don't you know what happened?"  And I said, "No, I don't know anything.  I have just heard about it, and I want to know what happened."  And they said, "No, our Rubyogo is in good health.  It is Rubyogo Habyarimana instead who is dead."  And I said -- I asked them, "Is it Habyarimana that you called Rubyogo?"  And they confirmed this.  I left this place and I continued on my way.  When my husband returned, I told him what I had heard, and he told me that he had heard the same thing that "People had told me that Rubyogo had died."  We were very surprised, because we didn't understand anything about it.  In the evening, there were many rumours going about.  And on the next day at about 8 o'clock, we were told that two bodies had been discovered in a house where an old person was living; that is, an old single person.  I went to that house and I saw the bodies.  Some of our friends began to come to us to give their property over to us for safekeeping.  We were very surprised at the events that were unfolding.  On the evening of Friday, there was much unrest.  The next day, which was a Saturday, I went to pray.  When I was returning, I realised that people were going in large numbers to the Adventist churches, and it was only one ethnic group that was seeking refuge.  This is how we experienced the situation, and it is war that followed after.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  When you were going through all these experiences, were you living at the same address as that which is indicated in your list of particulars?
A.	Yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has just given the name of her cellule.  So we await what you will decide on this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of her cellule should be struck off the record.

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the rest of my questions would require a closed session.  I would be grateful if you would allow it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please arrange for a closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 28 to 40] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 26 to 27 by Haruna Farage)






























(Court resumed at 1442H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

Madam Witness, now you'll be asked questions by the Prosecutor on your right in order to test the accuracy and credibility of your statement given in evidence-in-chief.  Please understand the questions and answer them as briefly and concisely as possible.

Mr. Phillips, you have the floor for cross-examination. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
 CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm going to ask you some questions in relation to your testimony this afternoon. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have had four documents placed before you numbered 1 to 4.  Everybody else in the courtroom has those documents in the same order, and at some stage I'm going to be referring to some, if not all, of those documents.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm going to ask that you be shown a name and I'm going to ask you some questions in relation to that name.  I don't know if you can read, but try and see if you can read the name first, and if you can't, we will assist you. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the document numbered 1 shown to the witness, please? 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see the name on that document, Madam Witness?  Don't say the name, just answer me yes or no.
A.	Yes, I can see the name on the document that is before me.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that the person named on that document is indeed ************?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Very well.  Can you tell me how old he is, please?
A.	The person in question is 40 years old.
Q.	Is he married?
A.	This person is married.
Q.	How many children does he have?
A.	This person has one child, a female child.
Q.	Do you know what the name of the child's mother is?  Just answer yes or no. 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell me if the person named on that document is still married to the child's mother?  Just answer me yes or no. 
A.	I would say that the person in question is deceased.
Q.	So is it your testimony, Madam Witness, that the mother of this person's child is deceased?  Is that your testimony?
A.	Are you referring to the mother of this child?  No, the mother of this child is still alive.  It is the father of the child who is deceased.
Q.	Very well.  In other words, is it your testimony that the person whose name appears on that piece of paper is deceased?  Is that your testimony?
A.	Yes, the person whose name appears on the document that has been presented to me is deceased.
Q.	Very well.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have document 2 shown to the witness, please.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So, Witness, when you say he is 40 years, are you saying he died when he was 40 years? 
THE WITNESS:
No, when this person died, he was not 40 years old yet.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I thought you said he is 40 years old.  That's what I heard.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  From the time he was born to now, the person would be 40 years old, even if they are dead, so it is 40 years from the time he was born up until today.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was he younger or older to you?
THE WITNESS:
This person was younger than I am.
JUDGE SHORT:
And when did he die? 
THE WITNESS:
The person in question died 19 -- listen, I'm a bit confused, but when the Kisangani refugees reached Rwanda, this person died.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips.  Go ahead. 

BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Have you seen the second document that I have had placed before you, Madam Witness.  Do you see the name there?
A.	Yes, I saw the document.
Q.	Do you know the person named on that document, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I know this person.
Q.	How do you know this person?
A.	I know this person because this person comes from the same region as I do.  I know that this person got married not far from my home.  In addition, I know that the person's child and husband were Tutsi.  The husband was Tutsi.  ******* took these persons to our mother's house and kept them there.  This person died after a plague that struck, but the daughter is already a young girl approaching adolescence.  I know the daughter and I know the mother.
Q.	Very well, so are you telling me that the person that appears on that document is not alive?  Is that your testimony?
A.	No, the person whose name appears on the document is still alive.  It is her husband who is dead.
Q.	Very well.  Now, can you tell me, what is the relationship between the person you describe as Mika and the person on this document?
A.	This is the relation between these two people and Mika: the person in question, that is the person whose name appears on this document, has a relationship, almost close relationship between this person and *****, because ***** is considered as the *********.
Q.	Can you tell me since when ***** has been considered the *****************************; how long in terms of years?
A.	You want to know since when ******* has been considered as *********** the person whose name appears on the document?  Listen, all of us in the family have the same respect as the parents or relatives of this person, because when this person got married, and even during the war, the members of my family did good things for this person and her husband and her child by taking them in, and this person respected the members of my family as her elders.
Q.	Very well. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have document number 3 shown to the witness?
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you see the name on the third document that I have had placed before you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you know this person?
A.	I know the person.
Q.	How do you know this person?
A.	This is how I know this person: this person lives to the north of my home.  Also, I have known this person for about eight years, when this person began to go to school, so I've known this child since she was an infant.  We knew each other from our childhood.  This is somebody who lives near me.  She doesn't live far from me.  I know her.  When this person became an adult and when ***********, whom you see here, was an adult, they had a relationship and they had a child together.  In fact, we wanted this young lady to come into our family to strengthen our links, but this girl or this lady had an influential parent or relative of some means, and this person decided that the child would grow up and decided to pay the school fees for this young lady.  So we maintained contact with this person, but**** ******** did not marry the person.  When the child was given to us, we accepted the child.  It's a child of our family.  We have no problem with this person if this person had decided to separate from us, because when she was young there was a problem between her and us.  Up until now there has been no problem between us and this person.
Q.	The child that you refer to, the product of this union you have described, is that child male or female?
A.	It's a young girl.
Q.	Do you know how old she is today?
A.	Listen, I'm a fairly advanced age, I'm not good at arithmetic, but I think that this person cannot be less than 17.  I think she's between 15 and 17.  That is the age I would give her.
Q.	Whereabouts is that child located now?  By that I mean I don't want her address, just tell me if she is in Rwanda or she's elsewhere?
A.	This child is still in exile.  The child went away with her father when her father was going into exile.  Up until today, she has not returned to Rwanda.
Q.	Very well.  Can you tell me what the child's name is, please?
A.	I know the name of this child.
Q.	Please tell us?
A.	The child is called *************.
Q.	Very well. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have document number 4 shown to the witness, please.  Take the other documents away, please, so she only has one at a time, thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you see the name on document number 4?
A.	I've already seen the name.
Q.	Do you know that person, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How do you know that person?
A.	I know this person since this person was a child.  He was a very small person brought up by a person elder to the person, someone elder to this person.  He had work and was married, so the person grew up within this family and this person became a beautiful young lady with -- who was well behaved, and at the time the war broke out this person was at her sister and brother-in-law's place and this person is currently married and already has children with her husband.  These are the conditions under which I know this child.  This is a person who was connected by marriage to our family, so that is how I know her.
Q.	Can you tell me the name of the person that this lady was married to?
A.	Her husband is called ****************.
Q.	And the person you called **********, how is he related to you?
A.	There is no relation between us and *********.  The only relationship that we have is between us and the person who was brought up by us and whom we considered as a sister-in-law.
Q.	Very well.  And would I be correct in saying that that person is related to a lady called ******?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have one final document to hand to the witness.  Your Honours wouldn't have it in front of you.  I've just had it written out. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Document number 5 is just on its way to you, Madam Witness.  You have it already.  Do you see the name I have written on that piece of paper?
A.	Yes, and I know the name.
Q.	How do you know the name and the person?
A.	I know the person who bears this name, and this is the circumstances under which I know this person: I knew the person during the war in the cellule next to ours.  This person had a mother and brothers and sisters.  The person in question came to seek refuge with her parents, and her parents had also given refuge to other people who were still alive, and considering that people who used to give refuge with refugees maintained contact with each other, I knew that this person was hiding at that particular place.  Even after the war, I have met her from time to time.  This is somebody I know.  When I meet her, we chat.  We try to tell each other about happenings or events that concern our family.  This is not somebody I meet often, but I do meet her.  When the situation became very complicated during the events, I used to meet the person in question.
Q.	Very well. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, can I just enter these five documents at this stage as the next Prosecution exhibits.  Then I will move onto a separate area.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name on page number 1 would be Exhibit P. 32 to be kept under seal.  The name on page number 2 would be P. 33 under seal.  The name on page number 3 is Exhibit P. 34 to be kept under seal; 4 will be P. 35 under seal, and the name on page number 5 will be Exhibit P. 36, under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 32 admitted, under seal)
 (Exhibit No. P. 33 admitted, under seal)
 (Exhibit No. P. 34 admitted, under seal) 
 (Exhibit No. P. 35 admitted, under seal)
 (Exhibit No. P. 36 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Witness, do you still have document number 5 before you?
A.	Yes, the document is still before me.  I would also like to say something else concerning that person if you grant me leave to do so.
Q.	Very well, can I just ask you before you do that, is this person a woman or a man?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are referring to which person? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Number 5.
THE WITNESS:
The person is male.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	That's what I thought, but the translation that kept coming through was that she was female.  That's what I thought I heard 

Madam Witness, what were you going to say, now that we have clarified that?
A.	I would like to add the clarification that I made in respect of that person that in spite of the state of affairs, we could not keep a person in one single spot.  The person had to change hiding from time to time when the situation became difficult, and it is in such situations that we accommodated that person and she used to move from place to place according to the circumstances.
Q.	I'm still getting through the "she" through my headset.  I don't know where the problem is, and the questions I want to ask have an impact on whether this person is a man or a woman.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, be precise.  Is it a man or woman?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Actually it is the French that is misleading, because when they say "le person", the normal thing to say is the "elle," which is "she", and that is how the "she" and the "elle" is considered as she, but apparently, since we know the person is male, we will do the conversion henceforward.
THE WITNESS:
Is it a question that you put to me?
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	No, Madam Witness.  
Madam Witness, can you tell me, the person on page number 5, can you tell me if that person was married?  Was he married, and if so, who was his wife?
A.	Do you want to know his current wife, because it is today that that person is married, because during the war that person was not married, but today the gentleman has a wife?
Q.	Yes, I'm interested in who his wife is today. 
A.	I do not recall the name of the woman.  Besides, it's a household to which I don't go often.
Q.	Very well.  Do you know if his wife is Tutsi or Hutu?  Can you help me with that?
A.	His wife is Hutu.
Q.	Do you know if his wife is a relation of the accused person in this case?
A.	No, there is no relation between that person and the Accused.
Q.	Moving on to a slightly different area now, Madam Witness, would I be correct in saying that you do not like *********** very much, do you?
A.	I don't have any reason to hate ***************, but between him and myself there is a problem, and besides, I don't have the right to hate him because I can't do anything against **********.  I am of no importance vis-a-vis that person.  If I talked about what is happening between ************ and me, it's because these are things that everybody is aware of, that everybody knows.
Q.	Yes, and would I be correct in saying that you are rather unhappy at the fact that **************** occupies the property in which he currently lives?  Is that correct?
A.	You are correct.  I'm not satisfied with this situation because the property was supposed to belong to my family, but ****** appropriated the property, so we can't be satisfied.
Q.	And you certainly are not happy also that he took over the banana plantation and the cows belonging to your family, are you?
A.	I will give you an answer.  After refunding the bank loan, and besides, the bank compelled me to refund the loan.  I ************************************************************************************* the property.  Up ***************************************************************** who lent money to me, people who helped me to reimburse the bank loans.  I suffered to refund this money, ***********************.  I'm definitely not satisfied with the current state of affairs.
Q.	Very well.  You testified earlier today -- now moving on to a slightly different area now -- you testified earlier on today that you knew or you were aware of the identity of the people who lived in the man we referred to as *********************.  Do you recall telling us that?
A.	Yes, I do recall that.
Q.	I want to ask you about some of those people, and the first person I'm interested in is *****.  Do you recall that name?  Sorry, do you hear me, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I'm listening to you.
Q.	Very well.  Now, do you know when the person you referred to as ********* started living at 
Mr. *********?
A.	I won't be able to give you the exact year or month.  What I know, however, is that she came while she was still very young and that is where she grew up.
Q.	And from the time that she was young, is it your testimony that she continued to live in that house until the events of 1994?
A.	Since the time she was young, she attended primary school and the trade school, she was living with that family.
Q.	Do you know if she ever got married, and if so, when?
A.	I didn't have interest in when she was married.  I had no reason, therefore.  I have other problems in my family.  She was there.  Sometimes she would go to her parents' home.  This does not mean that she didn't have time to pay her parents' visits.  She used to visit her parents and have time to come back to her brother-in-law during the holidays, or during the holidays she would go to her parents' home.  I was busy with my own business and I wasn't that much interested in what was happening to her.  There were illnesses.  I was taking care of my family and I didn't have that much interest in what was happening to her.
Q.	Do you know if she was married in April 1994?
A.	I don't have an idea on that because I didn't have cause to have interest in it.  If I talk about things of the past or things of the future, it wouldn't be the truth.  The reason for my presence here is to say the truth.  When we met she was already married.  She didn't have children yet.  We conversed.  We were not living in the same secteur.  She's on the border of the commune and I'm on the other border, so it is not often that we meet to talk about things like that.
Q.	Did you say that when you met her she was already married, Madam Witness?
A.	When we met after the war she was already married, and until now she is the mother of three or four children.  I knew her when she was still -- or I knew them when they were still very young.  The first is still alive; the second one died, and she told me that the first one was still alive and that the second one had died.  She, therefore, has three children.
Q.	And the three children, to your mind, were born after the war, or before the war?
A.	Those children were born after the war.  One of the children was born after the war.  There were problems.  People were returning to the country and during the war she already had a baby.
Q.	So she had a baby during the war as far as you're concerned.  Is that your evidence now, Witness; not after?
A.	It was after the war when people were returning from exile, and during that period people had taken possession of other people's property and during those difficult times, she already had her baby.  Right now the child is big already.
Q.	So in April 1994, you cannot confirm whether or not this person was married; can we agree on that?
A.	In April 1994 -- I can't talk about that.  I didn't have interest in those matters, if she was married or not.  I don't know.  We saw each other again after the war and by then she was already a woman and married.
Q.	Very well.  You did not live inside Mr. Muhimana's house, did you, in April, May and June 1994?  You were not resident at that house, were you?
A.	Are you talking about his residence?  No, I did not live in his house.  I used to go there **************.  I didn't live with his family.  I had my own family.  I didn't live in his house.  I used to visit him ****** ******.
Q.	Therefore, you are not able to testify as to the things that may have occurred at his residence between April, May and June 1994, are you?
A.	I can talk about things that I know, but I can't say everything that happened there as if I was somebody who was living in that family.  I can say, for instance, what took place during the war.  There were disturbances then.  There is a person, a relative who was carrying a baby, that person's eldest child, who went to that family, and in co-operation with Mika's wife, they gave what they had to people who were in hiding, so that person was living close to his home and I know the person's names.  If it's necessary, I can give you those names.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you do this for me, please?  Do you think you can just respond -- just listen to me.  Just listen to the question.  Do you think you can respond only to the questions that I ask you?  Do you think you can do that for me this afternoon? 
A.	I agree.
Q.	Now, you listen to the question very carefully.  My question is this: if you did not live or reside inside Mika Muhimana's house between April and June 1994, you are therefore not able to tell us about the things that went on in that house, are you?
A.	I have explained to you that I used to go there *************** and I used to enter the house and I could chat with those people, but I wasn't living in that family.  I can tell you what I know, but not all.
Q.	So did you go there every day?
A.	No, I didn't go there every day.
Q.	Did you go there every week?
A.	Once a week or sometimes once a fortnight or sometimes twice before the end of two weeks I used to go there for one reason or the other.
Q.	Very well.  Let's move on to something slightly different now.  Madam Witness, can you tell me how you came about being a witness in this case?
A.	I came here as a witness.
Q.	I know that, but how did you become a witness?  Did somebody approach you, and if so, who?
A.	Yes, a person came looking for me.
Q.	Do you recall who that person was?
A.	Yes, I will talk to you about that person.  It was Mr. *************
Q.	How many times did you meet with Mr. *****?
A.	We met for the last time when I was getting ready to come, and that was the third time.
Q.	When was the first time you met with Mr. ************?
A.	I met **********for the first time -- I can't be quite exact insofar as the dates are concerned, or even the period, but I think that we met during this year in May.
Q.	Very well.  And when you met with Mr.***********, had you known him before?  Had you known him before you actually met him in May?
A.	No, I didn't know him.
Q.	When you met with him, did he ask you questions about what you knew about the events -- from the events of 1994?  Did you have a discussion with him?
A.	He came as an official.  We didn't know each other.  He asked questions relating to the war and we were giving the answers on what we knew.  We broke up and we understood that the officials -- authorities were undertaking investigations, and when I understood what he had told me if I'm coming to testify on what I had said, I was surprised by that and I told myself, "Well, I've had a dialogue with an official, and now it so happens that this concerns important things," so I came, and I said I was going to speak the truth hoping that God was going to stand by me.
Q.	When you spoke with the man you describe as *************, did he take any notes of what you were saying to him?
A.	For the first time he asked us questions and then he went away; for the second time, the same thing happened, but for the third time, he committed our statements to paper.  We used to -- when we come here, to authorities who ask us, "Where were you during the war?" and we explain what we know.  That is how we knew about things.  He, himself, he concealed -- he hid his secret from us, some we were surprised.
Q.	So he wrote something down.  It's your testimony that he actually was taking some notes when he spoke to you the last time; is that correct?
A.	He asked us to tell him our names.  He asked for our names.
Q.	Very well.  Madam Witness, you testified this morning in relation to Languida.  Do you recall your evidence in that regard?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	And in your evidence to Their Honours this morning, you testified that you hadn't seen her since 1975; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.  Since she left with her husband, I have never seen her again.  They left for Nyanza.  Her husband was a tailor.  They both left.  Their children are now grown up.
Q.	So if a statement is attributed to you that Languida only fled from Gishyita on the 8th of April, would you agree with that statement or would you disagree with it?
A.	Would it be insinuating that I'm the one who said so?  No, it was not Languida.  You asked me whether Mika raped Languida, and I said that when she got married -- and I also said that the person who fled on the 8th was rather Languida's junior sister.  She left with her brother and the children.  As regards the other, when she left, she never came back.
Q.	So is it your testimony that you never told *********** during your interviews with him that Languida, on the 8th of April, fled towards Mubuga and neighbours never saw her again, and so Mika couldn't have raped her?  Are you saying you never said that to *****?
A.	I have explained everything regarding her junior sister.  We are dealing with three sisters.  One got married in Mubuga and the other fled, and it is the junior sister who left with her sister.  As regards the other sister, she left and never came back to our area.  Only her three children come to the region to visit their relatives.  That is what I know.  As for other matters, I know nothing about them.
Q.	Did you ever say to *********************** in order to own his property?
A.	If we go by the explanations I gave him regarding my concerns, I briefly mentioned the fact that I couldn't go back because I was not safe.  He was conducting an investigation with several people.  It is possible that someone else informed him of the insecurity that prevailed in that area.
Q.	We will come to that subject, but the question I asked you is very straightforward, Madam Witness.  Did you tell ********* at any time during the three occasions that you met with him that *************** had, in fact, murdered Mika's wife in order to own his property?  Yes or no?  Did you say that to him?  Just a simple yes or no.
A.	No, I did not say that.
Q.	Did you say, Madam Witness, to *************************************************************** had caused ***************** to be imprisoned for more than a month at Kibuye prison because she had refused to testify against Mika and rejected racist ideas?  It's a bit of a long question, but if you don't understand it, I'm happy to repeat it.  Did you say that to *****?
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel for the Prosecution? 
Q.	Did you say to ************************************************************************, caused************** -- ***********, that is -- to be imprisoned for more than a month at the Kibuye prison because ********* had refused to testify against Mika and rejected racist ideas?  Did you ever say that to ********** during your interview?
A.	He took statements from several other people, but I personally did not state that.  He conducted investigations with other, many other people, and they talked about what happened during the war and they gave several explanations.
Q.	Can I take it as your answer that you didn't say what I just asked you; you didn't say those things to him?  Just yes or no. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I think she's considered that.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well. 
THE WITNESS:
It is possible that I said so.  Many people gave testimonies.  I wouldn't be able to say that I didn't say so and say no, because we talked about the insecurity encountered by ******* and how she was troubled by her co-spouse.  Many people present said so.

JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Witness, you spoke to ******, you said, in May of this year? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe.  It seems that that was the period.  I didn't know what was going to happen.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you're saying that you cannot remember --
THE WITNESS:
I didn't try to bear in mind when we met.
JUDGE SHORT:
But it was some time this year.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you say that you cannot remember whether you told ******************************* and his wife caused Mukabetera to be imprisoned? 
THE WITNESS:
I stated that we explained the death of Mukabetera.  We spoke about her death.  Those two people had the same aims.
JUDGE SHORT:
And what did you say about -- whose death are you referring to? 
THE WITNESS:
I am referring to Xavera's death.
JUDGE SHORT:
I was asking you about Mukabutera -- the imprisonment of Mukabetera.  Are you saying you don't remember what you told********* about the imprisonment of Mukabetera? 
THE WITNESS:
I stated that Mukabetera was imprisoned following what was found in his house.  That is, we are talking about a man and a woman, a man and his wife.  We talked about the difficulties they encountered because they had occupied property and they wanted them to abandon the property, and this caused problems.  There was a problem in that she had come and left her husband.  That was the cause of her death.  We talked about the insecurity she experienced.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, please go ahead.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you recall the date Mika's son died in April 1994?
A.	I will explain things to you by trying to recall what happened as of the date of the death of President Habyarimana, that is 6th of April.  The following day, that is the 7th of April, right up to the 8th and the 9th of April, the child died between the 9th and the 10th.  It was around that date that the child died.
Q.	And do you recall in that case when the -- what you describe as the seven-day or eight-day mourning period ended?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us?
A.	That child was buried on a Sunday.  His mortal remains had been brought on a Friday.  He was not buried on that day.  On the 16th, yes, I believe the mourning period ended on the 16th.  On the 15th, preparations were made to put an end to the mourning period and invitations were sent out and drinks were prepared to that effect.
Q.	So what did you do on the 16th of April, Madam Witness?
A.	On the 16th of April, the ceremony marking the end of the mourning period took place such that the people who had come to join our family on that occasion could resume their usual activities.
Q.	You haven't told me what you were doing on the 16th.  What did you do throughout that day?  Where were you?
A.	You mean on the 16th?  On the 16th, I returned from the religious service.  People came to tell me that the ceremony marking the end of the mourning period had ended or had taken place.  At the end of the day I went to visit that family as usual.  I was selling various commodities.  It was market day, so I went to the market on the 16th of April.  I believe it was a Saturday or a Sunday, so I visited that family on Sunday.
Q.	Do you recall the church where you had worshipped on the Sabbath, on the 16th?
A.	Yes, I know that church.  Since we were in a difficult period, going through difficult times, we attended the religious service and assembled for the Sabbath day service.  We did not get to the church.  By the way, I did not take part in services organised in the church, so we met in our cellule.
Q.	And after this service, you went to the market; is that your testimony, to sell some things?
A.	No.  I stated that I went there the following day, that is the Sunday, and on Sabbath day I went to pray and I went to the marketplace the following day.  That was the Sunday.  That is what I stated.  That was the first day of the week according to the Adventist calendar.
Q.	So after the church service on the Sabbath, on the 16th, what did you do for the rest of the day?
A.	Are you referring to the Sunday?  I remained in Gishyita to chat with people.  That was in the afternoon.  I was in Mika's house, and in the evening I went back home.
Q.	Are you talking about what you did on Sunday or what you did on Saturday?  My question was what you did on the Sabbath, on the Saturday. 
A.	I have talked to you about the activities of Sunday, because on the Sabbath day all I did was pray.  I did nothing more.
Q.	That's what I wanted to get out.  Okay, so we've established what you did on the Sabbath.  
Now, can you tell me, Madam Witness, did you witness any massacres at all in Gishyita during the month of April?  Did you see any dead bodies?
A.	Yes, I have explained this.  Besides, I did that at the beginning of my testimony.  I stated that on the 7th, in the morning, very early in the morning, I saw the bodies of people who had been killed in their homes, so I saw two bodies.  Subsequently, I saw the body of Leonilla's child as well as that of his elder -- his grandmother.  I saw many people who had been killed in Goma, Gishyita and Mubuga, so many people were killed.
Q.	So you worshipped at the church?
A.	Yes, I have explained to you that even prior to the war, I did not attend a service in just any church.  I had stopped going to church, so I got together with other people.  Besides, during the war, we used to meet to hold religious services.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you are being asked a question, a very direct question.  Please try and answer it.  On the Sabbath, on the 16th of April 1994, where did you pray?  Just answer that question.
THE WITNESS:
I prayed in the home of a brother in Christ in Kagano cellule.  We did not hold a religious service at any church.  We held it in the home of our brother in Christ in Kagano cellule.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness --
A.	I don't know whether you want me to give you the name of the person in whose house we prayed.
JUDGE SHORT:
Was it your evidence that there was a religious ceremony on the 16th to mark the end of the mourning of Mika's son? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I stated.
JUDGE SHORT:
And therefore you are saying that you did not attend that ceremony.
THE WITNESS:
I could not attend that ceremony because it was on the Sabbath.  I went to pray, so I visited that family on the first day of the week according to the Adventist calendar.
JUDGE SHORT:
And could you tell us exactly what time of the day on the 16th the mourning ceremony came to an end? 
THE WITNESS:
If I were to tell you the time at which this ceremony began, it would be a total lie because I didn't participate in this ceremony, so only those who were present can tell you when the ceremony began.  I would just tell you that there were several families that had come together on this occasion.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, finally, let me ask you -- you've talked about seeing several bodies and attacks in various places in Gishyita.  Do you know if any leaders, administrative heads, leaders, commune heads, bourgmestres, those sort of people -- do you know if any of them were involved in these attacks?
A.	No.  It was people who came from various places.  There were very many of them, so it was difficult to identify the assailants.  There were very many of them.
Q.	Would it be your testimony, for example, that someone like Charles Sikubwabo, the bourgmestre, was never involved in any attacks?
A.	I did not come here to give testimony against this person.  However, the bodies that I saw were those of neighbours.  One of these persons was a little girl.  The other one was a female neighbour.  I saw their bodies.  In addition, I could not see what was going on apart from this place.  These people were killed during the daytime and one of the victims was the mother of Leonilla and the other was the child of Leonilla, and I was hiding ******* who was being sought by the assailants so that she would be killed, so those are the bodies I could see.

	1600H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	What about the question I asked you, Madam Witness: do you know if Charles Sikubwabo was involved in any attacks, Yes or no, the bourgmestre?  Have you ever heard anything said about him being involved in an attack in Gishyita commune after the genocide or during; yes or no?
A.	After the war, I heard about it on the radio.  Yes, I heard about this on the radio.
Q.	Did you hear anything about about Clment Kayishema, the prfet being involved in attacks in Gishyita and Kibuye prfecture on the radio?  Did you ever hear that?
A.	Yes, I heard about it on the radio, during the news, the newscast, but I cannot tell you what happened because I didn't see it with my own eyes.
Q.	What about Conseiller Rutaganira, have you ever heard anything about him being involved in attacks in Gishyita?
A.	Recently, we heard it said that he had been arrested and was detained here and that he's accused of murder.  We heard about it on the radio.
Q.	Did you ever hear anything on the radio about Mika Muhimana being alleged to have been involved in attacks in Gishyita?  Did you ever hear that on the radio?
A.	Yes.  If I remember correctly, 1999 or 2000 towards the end of the month.  I heard it on the radio.  It was being said that Mika had been arrested and that he was detained here.  I heard it on the radio. 
Q.	And how did you feel when you heard that, Madam Witness?  What did you feel when you heard that on the radio?  Tell us.
A.	When this news was announced -- in fact, a person who heard the news came and told me.  I was working in my farm.  You understand that I was not pleased to hear this.  I had no news of him because the last time we had met was when he had taken flight, so I had no news of him.  And that is how I received the information.
Q.	Were you surprised at the news that you heard?  Were you surprised at the allegation?  Can you help me with that?  Were you shocked?
A.	Do you think I was going to be happy about what was being announced on the radio?  I don't think anybody would be pleased if they heard such news.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that you're not pleased that he stands accused before this Tribunal, are you, Madam Witness?
A.	There's something about this that I'm pleased about.  What I'm pleased about is that the Judges have nothing against Mika, and the fact that Mika is still alive, and that I can see him.  And that before -- he is before a court -- in front of a bench like yours is something that causes me pleasure.  I'm not joyful as if I were attending a wedding, and I'm not sad as if I were at a funeral but, in any case, I am pleased in some way.
Q.	Very well.  Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for being so kind to answer my questions this afternoon. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have no further questions.  

I need to secure indulgence in relation to a simple document.  It is a calendar that I have had printed out for April '94 which I want to enter as an exhibit.  We've referred to dates and the days of the week.  And if Your Honours would accommodate that request, it's a simple calendar, I just -- so that there's a record of the month that we've been talking about.  I'm grateful. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Show it to the Defence, yes.  Calendar of April 1994 is entered as Exhibit P. 37. 
(Exhibit No. P. 37 admitted)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Provide copies to us.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I do have copies, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence, do you have any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Madam President.  I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.
MR ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours can I just seek a further -- we have actually copies of May, April and June.  Would you rather that, or you just want copies of -- we just normally have it for our own ease of reference. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is that exhibit? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, the exhibit is only April but, you know, I just found the other ones in my wallet.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think this is okay. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Witness, did you say that ***********was an official? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not know him.  I did not know his identity.  I saw him.  I welcomed him.  And I considered this person as an authority because authorities come and conduct their investigations, and who contact people to put questions to them.  Similarly, during meetings we used to see authorities come.  I did not know them.  I did not know him.  I just saw him.  I -- so I gave him the honour that he deserved because I did not know him.  I couldn't just consider him as any citizen. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did he introduce himself to you, and if so, as what, or as who? 
THE WITNESS:
He explained to me that he works for the Tribunal.  And he was asking me to come and give testimony before this Tribunal.  And that is how he introduced himself to me.  I don't know whether he's a judge in this Tribunal.  I don't know whether he's an accountant, but I gave him the honours that I felt were to be given to him as an authority.
JUDGE SHORT:
And, lastly, you said that he spoke to many other people.  Who are the other people that you know he spoke to? 
THE WITNESS:
When we were at this place, he interviewed us and -- if you were next to where he was, you could come close to him and he would put questions to you.  For example, there is a certain *************, another person called ********, another person called **********.  These persons were with us when he was talking with us.  There were people going about and when they felt that this topic was not of interest to them, they went back to their usual occupations, but we stayed there and we listened to what he said to us.  The people whose names I have called are those who stayed with him and who listened attentively to what he was saying.
JUDGE SHORT:
And, sorry, lastly, since you said that he introduced himself as coming from the Tribunal, did he discuss the kind of evidence that had been led before this Tribunal against Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
No, he did not talk to us about that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, are you married? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am married --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What does your husband do?
THE WITNESS:
-- and legally, and in -- before the members of my families, all of the families.  My husband is deceased, but we are farmers.  We live off the land. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
***************, where are the other members of your family? 
THE WITNESS:
You want to know about other members of my family.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Whether you have other members of your family? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes; I have a younger sister, but who lives far from where I, myself, live. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Have you got a brother? 
THE WITNESS:
(By order of the Court, this sentence has been extracted, and filed under seal)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, during 1994, how close did you live to the Accused?
THE WITNESS:
We lived in neighbouring cellules. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you visit him often? 
THE WITNESS:
Listen, I didn't go there every day.  However, I used to visit him to ask for advice from him.  I didn't go there every day, but I could go there from time to time as one might visit one's family. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this brings us to the end of your evidence.  We thank you for having come to Arusha to testify before the Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey and a very safe and secured life in your country.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
May the Almighty bless you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will resume on Monday morning at 9:00. 
(Court adjourned at 1620H)
