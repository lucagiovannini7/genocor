MADAM PRESIDENT:
We open the session and proceed with the Defence case.  

Let me inform you about the timing of the Court.  The Court will be from 9 to 5, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a short break at 11 and lunch break at 1, from 1 to 2:30 p.m.  Thank you.  The sitting will be from Monday to Thursday.  We won't be sitting on Friday.  

Professor Songa, you now have the floor for opening statement.  Thank you. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, it is with serenity and detachment between difficulties inherent in judicial procedure on the one hand and possible chances of winning the case on the other hand that I have the honour to make this opening statement on behalf of my client, Mika Muhimana.  

During the Prosecution case, we all heard the charges against the Accused and the evidence adduced by the Prosecution to establish those charges.  If human society contented itself with hearing the Prosecution, it would be ignoble, as it would make innocent persons victims without any regrets on his part because it would be unconscious of that.  The overriding beauty in law consists in the possibility it has never to condemn anyone without having heard him or her and especially without giving him the opportunity to make full defence and answer during the proceedings, which would be all the more unfair as it is done in the public and contradictory hearing.  

Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence recognises the immensity of your role as administrators and -- administrators of justice and it is with confidence that it intends in its turn to present to you the evidence which, unless it receives the absolute certainty on the part of the Accused will be -- will convince you beyond a reasonable doubt of the innocence of Mika.  The Defence would like to seize this opportunity to state what its role will be.  It does not lose sight of the gravity of the events of 1994:  The tragic destiny and the loss of so many people of all ages and ethnic groups and immense suffering of a nation.  It honours and salutes the memory of all those who died in that catastrophe.  

Our statement today consists of contextual, factual and legal aspects.  Regarding the general context, I would like to call your attention to the importance of -- or the gravity of these events by reminding you of Decartes' thought.  "We can only reign in nature by obeying it.  It is better to change its desires instead of the order of the world."   The context, general context, which brings us not only to the venue of the events and the moment when those events -- the alleged events took place, it also brings to mind the configuration and evolution of Rwanda so as to be in a position to enable us to come to terms -- Rwandans to come to terms with the truth, to show falsehood and to place the uncertainties in context, hoping to understand what happened in Rwanda in 1994, the role that a conseiller communal could play and that played effectively by Mika Muhimana.  

The charges in this case consist in genocide or, in the alternative, complicity in genocide, murder, and rape which constitute crimes against humanity, baring in mind the criminal responsibility of the individual -- individual criminal responsibility, as specified in the ICTR Statute, Article 6(1).  

Beyond criminal categorisation, genocide in Rwanda is a hallmark of Rwandan history.  Today, Rwanda is a republic, but it has not always been so.  Without going back to the floods, the era when Rwanda did not even exist, eminent historians rarely mention the reign of Rwabugiri, 1867 to 1897, and his successors who promoted an inevitable rise in the reign of terror, which went from the court of the king and plunged the country in abyss, almost culminating in a social crisis which became secular.  And the truth, historically, today, is what has caused violence in corridors of power.  And it was a hallmark of the political setup at the time in Rwanda.  

The events of the advent of the German protectorate in 1899 and later on of Belgian tutelage in 1916 put the dampers on violence in political situation, particularly in -- particularly Belgium, which divided the kingdom into casts of lords and slaves, did everything to promote infighting within the country and made the people -- and enslaved the people.  Right up to the 1950 emancipation, this vision did not change.  The Tutsi and the Hutu lived in a society of casts, the one crushing the other arbitrarily and enslaving them, causing inequalities under the ubuhake, which was handed down -- a system that was handed down from father to son, from son to grandsons, from generation to generation.  

The inequalities in land tenure became acute in Rwanda during the period before independence, and this was observed unanimously.  People even talked of a veritable show of apartheid that favoured Tutsis.  The changes became necessary and inevitable.  In the '50s the winds of freedom swept across the world.  Europeans had just gained their freedom against the onslaught of narcissism and colonised persons were aspiring to their right to be masters of their own destiny.  

It is within that context that on the 24th of March 1957 nine Hutu personalities signed a memorandum on the social aspect of the indigenous racial problem in Rwanda which was recorded in the annals of history under the name "Manifest of the Bahutu."  The reply of the Tutsi lords was swift and expressed depth of the yawning gap between the Hutus and Tutsi, which people want to attach today to identity cards under the Second Republic.  
This radical misunderstanding was going to lead to events that occurred in 1959, known as the Social Revolution of 1959.  The Belgian colonialists up until then had considered that there was a Tutsi race which was exclusively ruled -- which was born to rule exclusively, and a Hutu race which was exclusively born to obey.  The colonalists decided to change their war strategy and they subscribed to the claims of the Hutu and contented themselves with rehabilitating the majority Hutu to the detriment of the Tutsi.  This change in alliance and the transfer of power which followed were not hit free.  The ethic confrontations that culminated in plunder, burning of houses and killings, and especially the exile of numerous Hutus, namely to the neighbouring countries, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  

Since then, Rwanda has not known any lasting peace.  In 1963, 1965, 1967 and 1973, attempts by the exiles to return to the country were greeted with reprisals and even massacres of Tutsi people who were considered as the enemy within the fifth column.  Failure to resolve the problem of the return of refugees was going to fuel obsessions and ethnic hatred in each camp.  The Tutsi appeared henceforth as the invader; whereas the Hutu, who lived under fear of the return of the exiles, were seen as synonymous to Tutsi domination, and the ills remained in the collective memory of the people.  

When the RPF attacked Rwanda in October 1990, the Hutu-Tutsi divisions crystalised.  This movement constituted Tutsis who fought for the return of the Tutsi refugees, and the government in power was that of the Hutu.  The advent of multiparty politics in 1991, the mechanism of infighting became aggravated. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we are having a problem with the translation.  You are going too fast for the interpreter. 
MR. SONGA:
(No translation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you slow down a little bit.  

And we also ask the translators to translate what Professor is saying instead of reading from the text. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Should I start where I ended or should I go back to the beginning of the text? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can continue. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you.  When the RPF attacked Rwanda on October 1990, the Hutu-Tutsi divisions crystalised.  These movements which consisted of Hutus who were fighting for the return of Tutsi refugees and the government in power, which was in Hutu hands, the advent of the multiparty politics in 1991, which was a mechanism of competition par excellence, aggravated the divisions.  The Arusha Accords of the 4th of August 1993, which were aimed at organising power sharing between the various political and ethnic forces present, were at times considered as having been negotiated in bad faith by protagonists, all of whom believed more in arms than in the ballot box and made a peace agreement a preparation for war.  

The assassination of President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994 triggered the events, which are today this material jurisdiction of your Tribunal.  Is it possible to discuss the categorisation of genocide in Rwanda without running the risk of incurring the wrath of all well-meaning people who are quick to denounce revisionism and negationism?  In all statements that are responsible, fair and 
well-pondered, and that are dedicated to posing the proper question while hoping to find the right answer independently of mediatisation and excessive manipulation, which have always accompanied events in Rwanda.

Through history and across the world, serious events have occurred which were not qualified as genocide: the massacre of the Amerindians, the massacre of the Red Skins, the massacre of the Hereros and so on and so forth.  In Ouidah, a town in Benin, when you follow the path of the slave trade, we find where 4,000 people were buried alive, people who were destined for the transatlantic slave trade, but who did not arrive at their destination due to fatigue or illness.  

At the beginning of the 19th century, there occurred the Armenian genocide and the international community were slow in recognising its existence, and none of the perpetrators were sanctioned.  Only the Jewish genocide -- the Polish, Jewish and Gypsy genocide were the subject of trials, and their perpetrators were condemned by the Nuremberg International Tribunal.  I concede that all this came before the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and the Punishment of Genocide, but previous events do not belie my statements.  

Vietnam and its melee, the Algerian war, the massacre of Hutu populations in Rwanda and in refugee camps in Zaire have not yet been qualified as genocide.  Rwandan refugees, estimated at 800,000, who were massacred in the Congolese forest in 1996 and 1997, have not yet been recognised as victims of genocide.  Since 1998, the most objective estimates give the figure of 3.5 million Congolese who were victims of various external acts of aggression on their territory, but no genocide is mentioned to categorise this tragedy.  

In Darfur, black Sudanese may continue to die. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please continue. 
MR. SONGA:
In Darfur, black Sudanese may keep dying.  Nobody has had the courage again yet to say that perpetrators of genocide are at work and that their actions are tantamount to genocide.  

When, therefore, can we talk of genocide and of perpetrators of genocide?  It is neither the number nor the race of the victims nor the manner in which the crimes are committed that would provide us with an answer to this question.  There is genocide when the leaders of the world, referred to as the international community, so decide, so that those committing the actions become perpetrators of genocide. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I would like henceforward to address factual issues.  Born in 1961, Mika Muhimana completed his primary education in 1974.  He got married in 1985 to a Tutsi girl, who today is a blessed memory, and who died while she was under the responsibility of those who are accusing him today.  He remarried in 1996, once again to a Tutsi woman, who is his current wife and who will come to bear testimony to the love that a Hutu has been able -- or has been capable and is still capable of giving a woman of Tutsi origin.  

Mika Muhimana worked in his country.  He carried out commercial activities, but he also undertook political activities in his capacity as a conseiller communal.  In one secteur or the other, he had to live, to co-habit, and to work in harmony with Tutsi.  And during difficult times, the Tutsi had the benefit of his assistance each time that he was capable of providing it, even during the events of 1994.  

At the beginning, at the commencement of trial, the Defence expected the Prosecution to prove the crimes with which the Accused is charged beyond any reasonable doubt.  The Prosecution, particularly, had to prove that Mika Muhimana had real power on a good number of the inhabitants of Gishyita secteur.  Prosecution had to prove that Mika Muhimana had legal or factual relationships with Interahamwe militia and other forces of defence and security.  

The Prosecution is expected to prove that Mika had a crucial role within the MRND; that Mika Muhimana, that it be proven beyond any reasonable doubt that meetings were held and that the date of the person who signed the convening notice should be seen.  The date, the agenda, the particulars of the participants, the minutes relating to the decisions taken for planning genocide, that all this be proven.  It is expected to be proven beyond any reasonable doubt that there was a genocidal scheme that did indeed exist.  The element making -- comprising it, such as the stages and the executioners, as well as the implementation stage of that scheme, existed.  It needed to be proven that Mika took this or that part in the preparation and the implementation of such a plan.  It has to be proven beyond any reasonable doubt that Mika distributed weapons, and that the number of such weapons and the brand names thereof are known, just as the identity of those who received the weapons from Mika ought to have been known.  It had to be proven beyond any reasonable doubt that Mika prepared a list of names of targeted persons.  It needed to be proven beyond any reasonable doubt that Mika was a member of the interim government.  In particular, that he took part in forming the government, which should have had the name of my client.  It needed to be proven that Mika, better than the préfets or the bourgmestres who were above him, and even better than the chief of the commune, who were above him in rank, that he was the closest administrative officer to the population and that he was the most important administrative officer in the mobilisation of the population to kill the Tutsi.  It needed to be proven beyond any reasonable doubt that Mika committed acts of rape in the Gishita secteur, in the Mubuga church, the Muganero complex and in the Bisesero region.  The Prosecutor is expected to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that Mika led attacks at the various sites. 

At this stage of the trial, the Defence is pleased to note all the difficulties that the Prosecution witnesses had in trying to prove the above-mentioned facts.  Those witnesses and their statements rather brought to my mind time and again this saying by Lamennais, according to which -- and I quote, "When the lies or untruth prevails -- when untruth prevails, the angels wept in the skies, for they were foreseeing that much violence and the many crimes and the many scourges were going to be inflicted upon the earth."

No international court, let alone any national court, can charge an accused on the basis of a meeting whose conclusions are unknown.  As for the scheme or plan of genocide, it has always been a problem in the count of the highest authorities of the Rwandan state of the time.  It is even more so in the charges against a conseiller communal who can barely read or write, for that matter.  And besides, what plan is it all about?  If today we all agree that it is the assassination of the president that triggered the genocide, the Prosecutor failed to demonstrate that Mika and his accomplices in their plan targeted the downing -- or targeted the presidential plane or aimed at downing that plane as a means or as a phase that would lead to genocide and culminate in their taking over power, keeping it, and staying in it.  

The Prosecution was unable to demonstrate how an interim government, which was formed after the demise of President Habyarimana, could have been able to plan an event prior to the formation of the said government.  Never was it asserted or even proven.  The share -- or the level of participation of the Accused in the preparation or in the implementation of the Hutu Power ideology, which, besides, remains vague insofar as its existence is contained, and the nexus between it and the events of 1994 are concerned.  
The instances of rape that were mentioned throughout the indictment all smack of fabrication on the part of the witnesses.  By accusing my client -- by charging my client with 27 rapes, 16 of which were supposed to have been committed in the month of April alone, ten on the 16th of April alone and six in the residence which his children were living and where his wife and ***************** were hiding, the Prosecutor almost succeeded in making Mika a social monster.  The hero or the protagonist of the (unintelligible), and he made other witnesses purely storytellers.  

Fortunately, the witnesses themselves were trapped in contradictions and memory lapses insofar as the venue or the site of the crime, the particulars of the victims were concerned, to the extent that sometimes we were faced with rape without victims or without the sites on which the crimes were committed.  

The allegation according to which Mika Muhimana committed acts in the company of Interahamwe that were operating under his orders was not satisfactorily proven or no witness was able to give the structure or the organisation of the Interahamwe in Kibuye, in order to determine the position that Mika held and the capacity that he had of giving orders to the Interahamwe, being under their command, and giving them orders and being obeyed, even whereas such orders were manifestly of a criminal nature.  

The Defence witnesses will help the Tribunal to hear the truth and to apply the law, either by proving that Mika could not have been where the indictment states that he was, or by proving that the alleged acts were never committed by him, but rather by someone else, or even that those acts were never committed. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I wish now to address the last part of my statement by developing a few legal issues.  The Defence has had the opportunity of giving its opinion on the key legal issues when he gave his pre-trial brief, and the Defence is requesting the Tribunal to consider the legal arguments that developed on that occasion.  However, the Defence will like, once again -- or for the first time, to give its views on the following issues.  One, the definition of genocide; two, the burden of proof; three, the fate of the counts that are not contained in the indictment; and four, the concept of joint criminal transaction. 

Insofar as the definition of genocide is concerned, and this very sensitive issue that we cannot circumvent, states that -- I cannot afford to be original, rather, I will endorse the terms of Claude Willame, professor, or lecturer, of the Catholic University of Louvain and the author of the book entitled Going Back to the Sources of the Rwandan Hecatomb, l'hécatombe rwandaise, which was published in 1995.  These are the words he used in respect of genocide.  "It presupposes the intention of extermination of a people or of an ethnic group.  But we know that the concepts of people or ethnic group used to qualify the Hutu and the Tutsi are debatable.  Furthermore, it is not 
evidence -- it is not obvious that the promoters of genocide 'targeted the eradication of a Tutsi as such in the main'.  There is reason to believe that the Tutsi, who were seen as the enemies within under Hutu opponents or adversaries who had accepted to collaborate with an invader, the RPF were earmarked for public vengeance, not that they were ethnically branded, but because they were seen as the fifth column of the invader." 

But even by conceding that there was genocide in Rwanda in the strictly legal sense and in the fullest meaning of the term, this would not suffice.  This would not be enough for (unintelligible) to determine whether the Accused should be liable to this or to answer for this and therefore to engage his personal responsibility.  And in this connection, we are comforted by the Jean Paul Akayesu case where, in paragraph 129 of the judgment of 2 September 1998, your Honourable Tribunal determined as follows: "That this being the case" -- and I am quoting from the Akayesu judgment.  "This being the case, the Chamber considers that the fact that genocide was actually committed in 1994 in Rwanda, and even more specifically at Taba, cannot influence its findings in the current proceedings.  The Chamber will only determine the individual criminal responsibility of the accused for the crimes with which he is charged, including the crime of genocide, the evidence of which must be tendered -- must be adduced by the Prosecution."  

I will continue with the reading of the excerpt of this Akayesu judgment.  "So in spite of the obvious atrocities of the crimes committed in Rwanda in 1994, the Judges must analyse the facts that have been presented in our serenity and must always bear in mind the presumption of innocence.  Indeed, the seriousness of the charges brought against the accused make the consideration or analysis all the more necessary and detailed of all the exculpatory as well as the Prosecution evidence within the framework of a fair trial that is respectful of all the rights of the accused."

As concerns the burden of proof, Madam President, Your Honours, the Rules of Procedure and Evidence makes provision for the representation of evidence by both parties.  However, this cannot be understood as meaning that the parties are being imposed the same burden insofar as proof or burden is concerned.  And the interpretation of the rules cannot culminate in the negation of the general principle of law, according to which the burden of proof should lie with the Prosecution.  And this holds -- there is a general principle of law which holds both for internal -- or national jurisdictions as well as for international jurisdictions.  

From the juridical standpoint and stricto senso, without having to wait for the Defence case, the Defence evidence, where there is no obligation or burden of proof, and what's more, the Defence is entitled or even has the right to remain silent.  The Tribunal has the right and is in a position to acquit Mika Muhimana immediately of all the charges for which the Prosecution did not provide any material evidence or any credit-worthy statement.  

As is the case where a witness claims to have been witness to events during the day for a period of an hour and beyond, while remaining immobile, five minutes away from the armed assailants who had as intention the extermination of the Tutsis, including the witness, him or herself, and the same witness relating the same events -- or the same witness doing the same thing on nine sides and on nine different occasions and still survives because his day of reckoning hasn't arrived yet or because (unintelligible) had not yet decided on the contrary.  

Just as it was also the case of this witness who, crouching under a well three metres deep and above, was able to tell the position of the assailants on the ground, was able to hear what the assailants were saying and was able to determine who shot a victim and at what position the victim was shot.  I will give you the case of another witness who, while fleeing from the assailants and looking ahead of him, was able to witness all the crimes that were being committed behind him.  Just as again was the case of this witness who was a victim of rape in a place that doesn't exist, at a site that does not exist.  Or once again, and finally, as was the case where victims could not be identified. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I think we should recall the Kupreskic case where it is stated where the prosecution charges an accused of having personally committed criminal acts, the key facts, such as the identity of the victim, the moment and site of the crime and the manner in which the crime was committed must be related in detail.  

With respect to the fate of counts that are not in the indictment, the Defence would like to seize this opportunity that has been afforded it to tell the Chamber that the Accused will seek to defend himself only for charges in the modified indictment.  He will take into account the indictment, the entire indictment and nothing other than the indictment.  It is therefore out of the question for him to defend himself in respect of additional charges brought against him during the pre-trial brief of the Prosecutor or of any of the statements made by the Prosecution witness -- by a Prosecution witness, who with saddening inspiration or enlightenment while before the Chamber, is able to remember even the rape whereof she was victim or of murders that were committed, whereas when questioned in the past on several occasions by the Prosecution, or even once, he or she said nothing about it.  And the Prosecutor could not make mention of it in the indictment.  

Finally, with respect to the concept of joint criminal transaction, this allegation of joint criminal transaction came up for the first time in the records when the Prosecutor was presenting his pre-trial brief.  The fact that it is not contained in the indictment gives sufficient cause for it to be dismissed by the Chamber and that the Accused be allowed not to have to defend himself with respect to that charge.  

However, there are other reasons that justify this dismissal.  One, the principle, as explained in this case, the presumption of -- violates the presumption of innocence.  Secondly, the principle is going back to the indictment charge of complicity, which was found in the initial indictment under which was never retained in prior trials or proceedings.  The admission of joint criminal transaction in the current proceedings violates the principle of presumption of innocence.  

And to satisfy ourselves in this respect, we merely need to read the pre-trial briefs of the Prosecutor in paragraphs 38, 39, 59 thereof.  The Prosecutor's conclusion is clear and simple.  Since in the various trials, the accused were sentenced, the Chamber should also sentence Mika Muhimana.  But what the Prosecutor fails to say, under which he could have and should have said, is that all those he prosecuted for the count of complicity in Kibuye under the initial indictment were not convicted for that count.  Rather, one of the accused who was part of the initial Kibuye indictment was merely and simply acquitted, both in the Trial Chamber and in the Appeals Chamber.  And we are referring here to Ignace Bagilishema.  

The admission of joint criminal enterprise would represent going back in a roundabout way to the initial count of complicity.  The complicity was in the initial indictment under -- because of lack of evidence, the Prosecutor himself had expunged it from the indictment.  

Above all, no accused of the Kibuye prior trials was condemned on that count.  So -- which is why Mika Muhimana, who is a least qualified person amongst the accused, is alone to answer for that count, while at the same time, the Prosecutor has continued to fight a joint trial in order to be granted a separate trial. 

Madam President, Your Honours, this brings me to the close of my opening statement.  The Defence would like once again to express its confidence in your Court.  The Defence is counting on your usual understanding in the accomplishment of its task.  Defence would like to express once again its deep respect for you.  Thank you for your attention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.

Professor Songa, now you may lead your witness.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, I would like to submit a motion for a closed session in view of some of -- certain relations that we may need to detail during the examination-in-chief.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any objection? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, not really, but I just wondered if my learned friend could enlighten us a little bit more as to what the nature of the relationship is.  Maybe it's inherent in his application, but I just thought that he could particularise a little bit more why he can't deal with this in another way as opposed to going into a closed session, and perhaps if he can indicate exactly how long he intends to be in closed session for.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I fear that the basis for my motion may be revealed as long as the public is present.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How long will you be in closed session? 
MR. SONGA:
Thirty minutes.

Mr. Issa, please enter a closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are now in open session.  You will need to be careful with your identity.  

Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that on 7th April, you were at the Mubuga health centre.  Did I understand you correctly?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And what were you doing in Mubuga health centre?
A.	I was attending to a patient.
Q.	Who was that patient?  In answering the question, you should be careful not to divulge your identity.
A.	Her name was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted).
Q.	I pointed out to you that it was not necessary to give the name.  You should have simply stated who was that person without giving the name for the sake of your safety, Madam Witness.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I propose that we retain the relationship without mentioning the name.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Who was that patient to you, Witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you want us to strike off the name of the patient from the record? 
MR. SONGA:
I would like the name mentioned by the witness to be struck off, that only the relationship be retained.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the patient given by the witness will be struck off.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Who was that person to you, Witness?  Did you say?
A.	It would endanger my safety if I mention the name.
Q.	Bear with us, I will not insist on that.  And what happened in the Mubuga health centre?
A.	On the 7th we were there and we saw a crowd singing and beating drums.  They assailed us and we had to flee.
Q.	At what time of the day was that?
A.	I no longer recall the date and the hour.
Q.	And what was your reaction in the face of the attackers?
A.	I fled.  I went to a hill opposite the place where I was, waiting for those people to leave.  I was hoping to go back and take care of the patient.
Q.	Did you go back to take care of the patient?
A.	That was not possible.  I had to return home to the house where I was living at the time.
Q.	Before arriving at the home, did you seek refuge anywhere?
A.	I arrived at the house on the same day.
Q.	Were you able to hear what had happened at Mubuga church?
A.	I left, and when I arrived at home, I spent days on that hill.  Attackers from other secteurs assailed us, and everyone thought the church was an ideal place of refuge, since it was **************, so everyone thought of going to the church, as I, myself, did.
Q.	When did you go to Mubuga church?
A.	I went there on the 12th.
Q.	Did you go there alone or were you accompanied by other people?
A.	I was with others.  There were many of us.
Q.	You went to Mubuga church on the 12th.  At what time did you arrive at Mubuga church?
A.	I no longer recall the time.
Q.	Was it during the day?
A.	Yes, it was during the day.
Q.	When you arrived at Mubuga church on 12th of April, what did you see?
A.	I saw many people.  There were many people inside the church.
Q.	Did you have the impression that the church was full?
A.	Yes, the church was full.  There were many people.
Q.	On 12th April, while at the church, did you enjoy any protection whatsoever?
A.	During that period, there were gendarmes who were telling us they were providing for our safety.
Q.	And on that date of 12th April, was the safety provided real and effective?
A.	Yes.  During that period, our safety was provided for, and at one time, people came and surrounded the church, and at one time they fired at people.  People died and the killings continued.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, who fired?
THE WITNESS:
We did not know the people who were firing.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, prior to the attacks you refer to, did you pray while inside the church?
A.	Yes, we prayed.  Even though we were of different denominations, prayers were intoned.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this was a kind of leading question.  Anyway, now she has answered the question.  Proceed.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, remember you are examining her in chief, so when you want to find out the information, ask her what happened, not telling her what she did, because that constitutes telling her what to tell us.
MR. SONGA:
Excuse me, Madam President, Your Honours.  I will be careful to avoid such questions.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you receive any assistance whatsoever with the prayers?
A.	Yes, we were assisted.
Q.	What did such assistance consist of?
A.	Since I am not a Catholic, someone intoned the prayers, and the others answered.
Q.	Were you able to identify that person?
A.	It was a certain Xxxxxxxxxx, Xxxxxxx.
Q.	Who was he?
A.	The Catholics said he was the xxxxxxxxx of that church.
Q.	Did you see him often?
A.	We could see him when we were not distracted by others who were speaking, and when he led the prayers, we could see him.
Q.	And how did you feed yourself in Mubuga church?
A.	How could we find food in Mubuga church? 
Q.	How did you survive, then?
A.	Since the decision had not yet been taken to carry out killings, people could buy something with money.  At times we only drank water the whole day.
Q.	Had you already heard of Caritas of Mubuga?
A.	Yes, I have heard of that.
Q.	What did she do?
A.	That same Caritas had food warehouses.
Q.	What was that food meant for?  Who had access to that food?
A.	The food was meant for poor people, and during that period the food was used to feed refugees.
Q.	Did Caritas give the food to you?
A.	At one time, some rations were handed out, but I don't know how that was organised.  There were many of us, so those rations were scanty.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you receive those meagre rations right up to the time of the attack which you mentioned a while ago?
A.	At one time the food was looted and we no longer received any.
Q.	Who looted the food?
A.	People who were trying to smash in the doors.  We women and children were inside the church, and we heard that a certain Xxxxxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx was amongst looters of the food.
Q.	Did you not see them?
A.	No, I did not see them.  I could hear people who were standing near the door say so.
Q.	You mentioned some names.  Are those the only names you heard or there were others?
A.	We were in a very precarious situation.  We could only hear snippets of information.  That was all I could hear.
Q.	Witness, did you hear of any rapes committed in Mubuga or the surrounding areas?
A.	I did not hear of any.
Q.	Prior to the attack --
MR. SONGA:
I think I will withdraw the beginning of my question, Madam President, because it's not well expressed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You made mention of an attack on Mubuga church.  Can you say more about that attack?
A.	On a certain date, that is around the 15th, the time had come when we saw many people, including gendarmes, and they calmed us down.  We calmed down and we thought we had found protectors.  At one time they started hitting the doors and breaking in the doors and they entered the church, and many people flooded into the church and started killing.
Q.	Madam, we shall go back to the attack of 15th of April.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, I hope you have not forgotten 45 minutes.
MR. SONGA:
I will do my best to manage the time to the best of my ability, Madam President.  I am very sensitive to the question of time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much more time would you need to conclude this examination-in-chief? 
MR. SONGA:
I believe by the break time I would have finished with this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Go on.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I was saying, Madam Witness, and I would like to ask you whether we can go back to the period prior to the 15th of April, and whether you can tell us whether or not you heard that girls had been killed at the cemetery?
A.	Regarding girls killed at the cemetery, I heard about that while we were inside the church.  People continued seeking refuge in that place from the time when I got there, so it was people who came after me who related the events to me.  They stated that those girls -- the bodies of those girls were at the cemetery.  That is what I heard.
Q.	Did they tell you who killed those girls?
A.	No.  I didn't hear anything about that personally.
Q.	Witness, you made mention of the attack of 15th of April.  Where were you precisely when the attack started?
A.	I was inside the church.
Q.	Did the assailants enter the church?
A.	Yes, they entered the church.
Q.	Were you able to identify some assailants?
A.	I couldn't do that.  When you are under threat of death, you do not have the time to identify people.
Q.	And how did you survive that attack?
A.	There were very many of us.  They killed people, and for those who were more cunning, they used to hide under corpses and pretend to be dead, and in the evening, at nightfall, during the massacres we really realised that people were being killed at doors or near windows.  There were other houses, in the outhouses of the church and in the back yard of the church, where people went to and then escaped.  I was therefore able to hide in a small house behind the church.  I hid there and I left that place during the night.  In fact, I arrived at midnight and I left that place at about 7 o'clock.
Q.	Are you talking about 7 a.m., 7 o'clock in the morning?
A.	No, I was talking about 7 p.m. instead.
Q.	Thank you for the clarification, Madam Witness.  And which direction did you take after 7 p.m.?
A.	If I answer that question, my safety will be in danger.
MR. SONGA:
Fine.  Probably we could use a sheet of paper.  If the registry can assist us in this respect, 
Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Issa, give her a piece of paper.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you indicate the persons to whose house you went, your destination, that is the secteur and the cellule?  Indicate the name of the person who opened the door for you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The information provided by the witness is in Kinyarwanda.  Can we ask the English interpreter to translate it for us -- the Kinyarwandan interpreter.
 
This will be entered as Exhibit D. 40, to be kept under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 40 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed.  
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you stated that if you gave the names of the person, that this would undermine your safety.  However, you have just written the name down on a piece of paper.  Do you know what events occurred in the house of that person while you had taken refuge there?
A.	Yes, I know.
Q.	Can you talk to us about them?
A.	I think it would be better for us to do this in writing.
Q.	I wonder if the President will give you leave to do that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor --
THE WITNESS:
It won't be long. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, do you have many other questions which you are going to ask which are likely to require to be written down? 
MR. SONGA:
As far as I'm concerned, I didn't think so, but it would appear that the witness is very concerned about her security or safety.  Otherwise, I have about three or four questions and I think this would bring the examination to its close.
JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Witness, how would these events that occurred disclose or compromise your identity? 
THE WITNESS:
This is because of the family relationship that exists.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give a piece of paper.

We'll get this information translated by the Kinyarwandan interpreter.

Professor, proceed.
MR. SONGA:
I hope that the following questions will not raise any problems. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, when you left your hiding place, you went towards another destination.
A.	Can you rephrase your question, Counsel.  I didn't quite understand you.
Q.	Well, there is a date that you have shown and on which you said you were in somebody's house.  Now, up to what date did you remain there?
A.	I stayed there up until the mid-May, up until mid-May.
Q.	And after mid-May, you went somewhere?
A.	Yes, I went somewhere else.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, let me first enter the document with the answer given by the witness as an exhibit.  This is Exhibit D. 41, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 41 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please proceed, Professor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can you tell us where was your destination after you left that hiding place, or do you wish to write it down again on a piece of paper?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I like to make things easy for the Chamber and the witness.  I would like to propose that she commits to paper that destination.  At the same time, she should mention if she met other persons who were hiding at that place.  So what I'm saying is if after being in somebody's place up to when she left in mid-May, she should say where she went and if she met other persons where she went next after the initial hiding place, and I think that will be enough for me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.  It's better that we go into closed session instead of writing answers on a piece of paper. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please arrange for a closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 29 to 30] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 22 to 28 by Trevor Gerbes)












(Court resumed at 1441H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the court are resumed.     

Madam Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor on your right side.  Please understand the questions and answer them briefly.  

Yes, Mr. Phillips, you have the floor for cross-examination.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.               
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Can you hear me at all, Madam Witness?  I can't hear myself.  Maybe you can't hear me either?
A.	I can hear you quite clearly.  I would like to tell you that I have a small problem.
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me now?
A.	I can hear you very well, but I have a small problem that I wish to present to you.  I would like to know whether this is a closed session or not.
Q.	We are in open session as far as I am aware.
A.	All right.
Q.	Madam Witness, I am going to ask you some questions about your evidence in this court earlier on today; do you understand?
A.	I understand you.
Q.	You have described to the Court that -- you described your relationship with the Accused in this case.  And can I ask you, without mentioning any names, can you tell me whether or not you xxxxx the same xxxxxx and xxxxxx with the xxxxxx with whom you are xxxxxxx to the Accused?  Just yes or no, and if so, we will develop the answer.
A.	Yes.
Q.	So, is it, therefore, your testimony that that person's xxxxxx and xxxxxx are the xxxx as xxxxx, you have the xxxx; is that what you say, yeah?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  Now, I'm going to have -- I want to ask you about somebody else.  And the name of your spouse, your husband, is indicated on your personal information sheet.  Can you tell me what ethnic group he belongs to, please, your husband, your spouse?
A.	I could answer you on a piece of paper.
Q.	That wouldn't be necessary.  I just want you to tell me whether he is a Hutu or a Tutsi.  There is nothing confidential about that.  Is your husband Hutu or Tutsi, Madam Witness?
A.	My husband is a Tutsi.
Q.	Now, have you always been married to your present husband?  Have you always had one husband or have you had more than one husband?
A.	Yes, I had another husband.  I thought you were going to put questions to me in regard to my first husband; regarding my first husband, he is dead.
Q.	Now, let's talk about your first husband, shall we?  Let's start off with the following, when did your first husband die?
A.	He died in 1994.
Q.	Do you recall the month of his death, Madam Witness?
A.	I no longer remember.
Q.	Can you tell us whether it was during the genocide, Madam Witness, after or before the genocide?
A.	It was during the genocide.
Q.	What ethnic group did your husband belong to Madam Witness?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	Very well.  Did your first husband have any relationship with Mikael Muhimana?  Just answer me yes or no.  Don't tell me what the relationship is, if, indeed, there is one.
A.	No.
Q.	Madam Witness, how many children do you have?
A.	I have xxxxx children.
Q.	Do you have all xxxxx children for the same father -- for the same man?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  I'm going to have a name handed out to you, if I can have the assistance of the registry.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you hand a copy out to my learned friend and the Honours.  I have several copies; give the witness one, please.  I have five copies.  Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you read that name, Madam Witness?  Don't say it out; can you at least make sense of it?
A.	Yes, I have read the name.
Q.	Do you know that person?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	What is your relationship with that person?
A.	He is my xxxxxxx-xx-xxx.
Q.	And by saying that he is your xxxxxxx-xx-xxx would I be correct in saying that that person has a relationship with the Accused in this case?  Is that not the case, Madam Witness?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Have you ************** that person, Madam Witness?
A.	No, I ******* this person.
Q.	Have you ever had a relationship with him?
A.	No, there has been no relationship between me and this person, but given that he was the brother of *************************, I would say that at some point in time he was my boss, or my superior from an ***************** view point.
Q.	I see.  Now, what exactly is that ************ view point?  Did you work with him; did he ******* you; can you help me with that, please?
A.	This person was a ****** for me.
Q.	How long have you known this person?
A.	Well, I would say that I've known this person since 1984.  It is from that year on that I became acquainted with this family, while I was staying in their home?
Q.	And do you know the whereabouts of this person today?
A.	I learned that this person is deceased.
Q.	Now, I want to talk to you about something slightly different and I want to go back to your present spouse.  And I want a yes or no answer to what I am going to ask you.  Is your present spouse currently residenced in Rwanda or is he elsewhere?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was he ever -- talking about your spouse, was he ever imprisoned during the genocide?
A.	Yes, he was arrested and detained.
Q.	And how long did your present spouse serve in detention, Madam Witness?
A.	He stayed in prison for ******.
Q.	Are you sure about that?
A.	I am telling you -- I'm talking to you about things that I know very well because I was a witness.
Q.	Very well.  Now, can you tell me why your husband was imprisoned for that ************* that you've stated?
A.	In response to this question, I find that it is linked to the other elements that we have discussed here, I don't know whether I may be allowed to answer using a piece of paper; this is in relation to my security.
Q.	I withdraw that question.  Was your husband detained, Madam Witness, because he was involved in the genocide of 1994, wasn't he?
A.	No.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's just confirm that we are talking about the same person.  I don't have his first name on my personal identification sheet, so I want you to be shown a name which -- together with his surname, just to acknowledge that we are talking about one and the same person.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you assist from the registry?  Can you give the Judges and my learned colleague copies, please?  Thank you. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see that, madam?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Is that your husband's -- are those your husband's names?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Madam Witness, you testified earlier on today that you -- you lived at a certain location from the time you were in primary school in **************** and the time you got married in February 1994, is that correct?  Just answer me yes or no, without telling me which location that was.
A.	Would you please repeat the question?  I didn't understand it.
Q.	Okay.  Would I be correct in saying that you -- do you recall telling us this morning that you lived with a certain family from the time you were in primary school, ************ of your primary school, until you got married sometime in February in 1994?  Do you recall telling us that?  I think you wrote it down as well. 
A.	I stated that I left this family in 1990 to go and meet my husband.
Q.	So, let's go through that date again.  You left the family in 1990 or in 1994.  Can we just clarify that?
A.	It is in 1990 that I left this family.
Q.	Very well.  And -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you mean February of 1990?
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember the month very well, but I know that I left this family during that time.  It is in February that I got married.  I no longer lived with this family, I had gone back to my own family.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And, therefore, in 1994 --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry, Counsel.  

You got married in February of which year?
THE WITNESS:
I married in February 1994.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So what happened in 1990?
A.	It is in 1990 that I left this family, that is, where I used to live.  I went to my own family.  I was in the home of this family but it was not my family.  So I went back to my original family.  And it is in February 1994 that I got married.
Q.	Very well.  I understand you now.  Now, from 1990 when you went back to your own family to the beginning of 1994, how many times had you visited -- I'm getting confused about families, but I -- let me withdraw that.  It is not terribly, terribly important.

Now, Madam Witness, you testified earlier that you knew of two ladies that resided in the home of the person that we have been talking about today, where you stayed for the month during the genocide; do you recall telling us that?
A.	Yes, I said this.  And, in fact, I referred to three young ladies.  You forgot to mention one of them.  When I arrived there I was, therefore, the fourth.
Q.	For the sake of any confusion, I'm going to have the names that I recall you mentioning handed out to you, and I will refer to this piece of paper as opposed to by names.  Can we work that way?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Can you hand this out please?  This is for the witness and the Judges and my learned friends, please.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Did you -- can you read those two names on there and confirm that these are at least two of the three people that you told us about that were also residing at that location, madam?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We seek certain clarification.  We are confused. 

Madam Witness, you said that you got married 1994, February 1994.  Where were you at that time?  Where were you living in the year 1994, February 1994?
THE WITNESS:
In February 1994 I was living with my parents, my father and my mother, in my parents' home.  This is because before I was living with another family, but even though I was living with this family they were not my father and mother.  The time came then for me to return to my father and mother.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	I have had placed before you a sheet of paper with two names.  Do you recognise those names as, at least, two of the three people that were living at that house?
A.	That is correct, these people were with this family.
Q.	And would I also be correct in saying that the third person that you referred to that -- her name does not appear here, is the person we've referred to as ******or is it somebody else?
A.	It is somebody else.
Q.	Okay.  Now, are you in a position to tell us who that person is?
A.	This might reveal my identity.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She told us in the morning.
THE WITNESS:
This might reveal my identity.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	I don't think she did.  My notes certainly don't indicate that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Unless there is something -- in my notes there is a name that starts with a B.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
No, not at that location, Your Honour; not at that location.  She indicated that that Witness AP, which is the name that starts with B, has a relationship with the current occupier of that residence, but that that person herself is not a resident at that residence, so it is not the same question I am putting to the witness.  I am more interested in April 1994 than anything else that happened afterwards.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, going back to my question, the three people that you say were resident at that location between April and May 1994, were these two ladies I've written here and a third person.  And I ask you if that person was *******; do you recall me saying that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Okay.  Now, is it your testimony that the third person was ********* or was it somebody else apart from ******?
A.	The third person was not******.
Q.	Very well.  Now, I'm going to have you write the name of the third person on a piece of paper for me who was living in that house in April 1994, since you said there were three of them.  Thank you.  On the other side.

Who was this person, Madam Witness?  Don't tell me her name; just tell me if she had any relationship with the two other ladies that lived there at the time.
A.	She had a relationship with these other two ladies.
Q.	What was that relationship?
A.	These other two ladies were cousins to the person whose name I have just written down for you on the piece of paper.
Q.	Very well.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Can the witness be asked the second name of that person?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Sure, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you please write for us -- I don't know if that is the family name or her first name.  Write please all of her full names.
A.	This person has another name, but I don't know it.
Q.	Very well.  Can I have the piece of paper back?

Now, can you help us with this person's ethnic group; is she Tutsi or Hutu?
A.	This person was Tutsi.
Q.	How old was she?
A.	I do not know her age, but she was a child.
Q.	In 1994, madam, you were some 23 years of age.  Was she older than you or was she younger than you in 1994?
A.	This person was younger than I was.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, would it be appropriate to enter these documents as an exhibit?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	The ones I have been going through earlier?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Some of them maybe; some of them maybe not.  Not necessarily, Your Honour, the -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you want them to be --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	They were essentially to avoid -- the last -- the one I am referring to at the moment, yes, because they refer to things that I would discuss, but the other two -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Because they -- I just didn't want to say the names out.
JUDGE SHORT:
But if you do that, you make the record  --

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	I take the point, yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
So you can always cross reference when you are reading.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, if I may, can I enter the one with the  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The first one with the --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	The name that starts with the M, for mother, that is the single name, as the next Prosecution Exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This will be Exhibit P.  26.
	(Exhibit No. P. 26 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	The one that starts with S, for Sierra, as the next - Prosecution's next exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Twenty-six.  And the next?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Twenty-six, and then the one that has the two names on it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That will be Exhibit 27, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 27 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Twenty-seven.  And the one I have in front of me, which Your Honour doesn't have, is the one she has just scribbled the name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And what about this one with two names?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	I thought that was 27.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, 27 is --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Oh, sorry.  The one with two -- I see, it is my mistake.  Okay, so the one with No. 1 and 2 will be 
No. 28.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This exhibit will be 28, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. 28 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	And we have the one that she has just written, scribbled on, which I have here, P.  29, I think.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	So there is one more that is going to be handed to Your Honours, but I probably need it back, P.  29.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This will be Exhibit P.  29.
	(Exhibit No. P. 29 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Grateful, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, you indicated that this person was slightly younger than you were or younger than you are -- sorry, could you repeat your answer again, please?
A.	I told you that this person was very much younger than I was.
Q.	Now, this third person -- thank you.  This person who you wrote her name for us now, was she the sister of the two names that I showed you earlier?  Was she their sister?
A.	(No verbal response)
Q.	I saw you nodding, but the record doesn't pick up your nod, if you can just say yes into the microphone.
A.	The fathers of these two persons and the person in question were brothers.
Q.	Right, so they were cousins, okay.  So the relationship between -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  Did she say brothers?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Their fathers were brothers, so that is the relationship.   
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, you now tell us that there was also somebody in that house by the name ********.  Do you remember telling us that, or didn't you?
A.	I said this.
Q.	So, before you arrived at that location is it then your testimony that there were four women living in that house besides yourself?
A.	There were the two persons whose names I gave to you, as well as the lady or the woman who was the lady of the house.
Q.	And then what about the name of the person you wrote for us just now, that makes it four, doesn't it?
A.	Yes, there were four.
Q.	Okay.  Now, so when you then arrived there were then five of you, is that not the case?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, can you help me with this; did you have any children of your own in 1994, 
Madam Witness?
A.	I did not have any children.
Q.	And your husband, what had happened to him when you had sought refuge or had gone to this location that we are talking about with these other women -- where you found these other women?  Where was he during this time?
A.	We were separated.  I did not know where they were.
Q.	You say "they".  I asked you about your husband.  Who else were you referring to?  Did you have more than one husband?
A.	What I mean is that when our area was attacked, my husband asked me to seek refuge, and he joined the other men in order to face the situation.  I have explained to you that I currently have a second husband.
Q.	Yeah, sure, okay.  So, is it your testimony then that around about the 7th of April, or the 6th, after the president died, you and your husband separated and went in different directions; is that what you are saying, in essence?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What about your parents?  Did you know where they were?  What had happened to them?  Did they seek refuge with you as well?
A.	I had left my parents home to form my own family.  They lived in another secteur, so I never saw members of my family on parents' side again.
Q.	Very well, very well.  Now, you testified that around about the 12th of April you found yourself at the Mubuga parish church.  Do you recall telling us that?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	And you told us also how you found that the church was full of other refugees like yourself; do you recall telling us that?
A.	Yes, I do recall.
Q.	You also confirm, Madam Witness, do you not, that the church, the Mubuga parish church was indeed attacked at some stage; do you not?
A.	Yes, I do assert that fact.
Q.	And you describe that this attack took place around the 15th of April 1994, do you not?
A.	Yes, I assert that as well.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that you were not in a position to identify those who perpetrated the attack at the Mubuga church on the 15th of April, were you?
A.	I did not know those attackers.
Q.	Madam Witness, you described to the Court that you had become aware that some food delivered to the church by an organisation called Caritas had been looted or stolen.  Do you recall telling us that?
A.	Yes, I do recall.
Q.	You were not in a position to identify those who perpetrated that act of looting the food supplies, were you, Madam Witness?
A.	I explained to you that the women and children remained within the church while the men stood near the doors and it was those same men who said that the food was being looted.  And they talked about the looters, Sikubwabo, the bourgmestre, and a certain Nkundiye.
Q.	But you did not see the looters with your own eyes, did you, Madam Witness?  That was my question.  Could you identify the looters yourself?
A.	We were informed by those men who could see them and who could talk to us about those looters.
Q.	Very well.  So, you relied on what those men told you, did you not, Madam Witness?
A.	There were events to which we were eyewitnesses, and we could receive some information from those men.
Q.	Very well.  Moving on to a slightly different area, you testified that you had become aware of the -- an attack on some women at the Mubuga cemetery; do you recall telling us that?
A.	Yes, I do recall that.
Q.	But you were not present at the cemetery, were you?  You didn't witness the attack yourself, did you?
A.	No, I was not present.
Q.	On the 7th of April, before you found yourself at Mubuga a few days later, you told us that you had gone to some health centre at Mubuga, attending to the patient.  You gave us the name of the patient.  We struck it off of the record.  What I want to ask you is, what was your relationship with that patient?
A.	Provided I -- we are allowed to write down her name.
Q.	I didn't ask you for her name, Madam Witness.  Listen to my question carefully.  I don't want the name.  I want your relationship.  In other words, I want you to tell me whether she was your sister, brother, cousin, that sort of thing.  That is totally harmless.  Can you help me with that, please?
A.	You put the question to me on that, and I mentioned the name.  You told me that I didn't have to mention the name.  I don't know whether it is necessary to mention the relationship I have with that person.
Q.	Well, I'm going to have a piece of paper handed to you.  It is necessary that I ascertain that relationship, and if you don't mind just put it down on this paper for me.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She is going to write the relationship on a piece of paper?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The name and relationship since she has decided to opt for the writing, so she might as well give me the full information. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, I want the name of the patient and if you have a relationship with that patient, him or her, could you outline what the relationship is or was?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Again, this is a relationship that -- can we ask the Kinyarwanda booth to please intervene?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Okay, while that is being done, I think I can move onto a slightly different area.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Adeogun-Phillips, this relationship may be important to --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
	It may be, it may be.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let me enter it as Exhibit P.  30.
	(Exhibit No. P. 30 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Your Honour, yes.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's to be kept under seal.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Yes, Your Honour, yes.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I have noted that information.  Now, the person that you have indicated that you went to the clinic  -- the Mubuga health centre with, did you also go to Mubuga with her, or what happened with her after the 7th, after the health centre visit?
A.	That person was sick.  I, therefore, went to fetch her from the house to take her to the health centre.  I believe we went back but she was hospitalised. 
Q.	Is it your testimony that she remained in the hospital throughout the month of April and May or did she leave to go somewhere else?  Can you help me with that?
A.	Habyarimana died while I was at the hospital.  We heard of his death on the 7th.  I was, therefore, at the hospital and bandits launched an attack and I fled.  I could not go back to the hospital.  I had to continue fleeing to my home.
Q.	Very well.  Now, you testified that you did not go to the house where those four women were until about the 15th of April; do you recall telling us that.  After the Mubuga attack, that is when you went into this house that we have been talking about all morning.
A.	That is what I stated.
Q.	And you remained at that house approximately for about a month, between the middle of April to around about -- between the 13th to 16th of May, do you recall telling us that, about a month?
A.	Yes, I made that statement.
Q.	And during the time that you were at that location with those other women, can you tell me where exactly was one of those ladies, the lady called *****************************, where was she located at that premises, at the location?  Did you share a room with her, or can you tell me where her location was?
A.	She did not go far from that house.  She did not have to hide.
Q.	Yes.  And that is what I thought you told us earlier on today, that she was free to move about, wasn't she?  That was your testimony, wasn't it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, was she living in the same premises? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, she was living in that house because it was her house.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And as far as you recall this person was able to move around, around this time, and get food for you and do other household chores.  Was that your testimony, as far as you remember?
A.	That is correct, she was the person who prepared food for us.
Q.	Do you also know whether she was able to go to the market and things like that, buy foodstuffs?
A.	She could not go to the market, the situation was very worrying.
Q.	But she would remain in the premises and she would cook your food and stuff like that.  Do you remember where the kitchen was located in that premises there?
A.	We used a pot and I knew where that pot was kept.
Q.	And the other people that lived in the house, the names you have given us and yourself, whereabout in that -- in the premises were you located, the four of you now?
A.	They were in a house behind.
Q.	Okay.  So -- and that included you or didn't it?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Okay?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the witness -- could you clarify who was living in the house?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	I'm just about to go over it again.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, if you describe the premises to me, is it your testimony that there were -- there was one house or there were two houses located in the premises, can you deal with that first?  How many houses were in these premises?
A.	There was a house in front which had two doors; there was another house behind that one which was in the process of being built.
Q.	Very well.  Now, the lady we talked about earlier that we call ***********, which of these two houses would she be located in at this time, the one at the back or the one in front?
A.	She was in the house in front that house -- that house had two rooms.
Q.	Very well.  Now, who was then located -- don't mention names, now.  The others in the house, apart from the lady we have called ********, the other ladies in the house, whereabouts were they located, in the front of the house or the rear house -- the house in the rear?
A.	She lived in the house behind, the rear house.
Q.	I heard you say "she," referring to at least more than one person, including yourself.  Where were you located in that house, in the front house or in the rear?
A.	I was in the rear house.
Q.	Very well.  Now, how many rooms did the rear house have, Madam Witness?
A.	That house was built in my absence; I do not know the number of rooms therein.
Q.	Now, were you in the same location with the three other ladies that we wrote their names down that we talked about earlier, were you all together or were you in another location?  Could you help me with that now?
A.	We were together.
Q.	Now, can you -- you stay in this house about a month, in this warehouse with three other women, can you describe what a typical -- can you describe what a typical day was like for you, Madam Witness?  I mean, what would you do in the morning with these three other women in this room?  Were you free to walk around, wash your clothes, that sort of thing?  Could you tell me what you did just one day, for that one month?
A.	We could not reveal ourselves in public; we were not free to move around, but we could move about on the veranda of the house in order to stretch -- or stretching our legs.	We used to ask a friend to help us.  In any case, we could go out and stretch our legs around the house but when we became tired we would sit down there.
Q.	Very well.  And when you stretch your legs around the house, would I be correct in saying -- or maybe can you help me with this.  Would you go to the front of the house where the road is, stretching your legs?  Would you do that often?
A.	No, we did not often do that.  And when we did that, we didn't go to the road.  We would go a bit down the house, and we would go around the house, and probably we would just go around the house once and then we would return.
Q.	And when the lady that you referred to as ****** prepared your food, where did you eat?  Where did you eat?  Did she bring it into your room or did you go into her house or where?  Can you help us with that?
A.	When she finished cooking the food, given that it is in the front house that there was a table, that is where we would go and eat.  One day, however, that lady brought food to us in the house where we were since we thought it necessary not to go and share our food with the other women, so we took our meal where we were.
Q.	What about the man of the house?  The man of the house, would he sometimes join you at the table?
A.	The head of the household shared his meals with his wife.
Q.	Okay.  So you wouldn't necessarily sit with him in the front room during meal time, would you -- you didn't?
A.	In fact, in the front house there were tables all over.  Sometimes we would be eating in a room or in the room where they were, but on other occasions we would eat apart.
Q.	The man that we have now quoted as the head of the house and the man of the house, did he ever have any visitors?  Did anyone ever visit him, and if so, who; and if so, how often?
A.	Since we were hidden, we couldn't reveal ourselves to the public, and, therefore, be in a position to see who were the visitors, we used to hear people converse and we'd hear them leave.  And we wouldn't go to ask their family head to give us the names, a list of those who had visited him.
Q.	I see.  Isn't it the case, Madam Witness, that you never sought refuge at that house at the time that you say you did?   Rather, you were elsewhere?
A.	I am telling you what I know.  If you told me that I didn't go there, then you have your own source of information that may be better informed than myself, but I am telling you that I was there.
Q.	Isn't it the case, Madam Witness, that most of what you have told us in this courtroom today are not things that you have any personal knowledge of, things that have been told to you by others?
A.	According to you, who would have given me the information?  I gave a testimony following what I myself was witness to, as for what you are telling me, I think you have your own sources of information.
Q.	The lady that you claimed you met at **********'s location, do you know if that lady was a witness in this case?
A.	I am not aware, but you are trying to confuse everything.  You are trying to undermine things by giving names.  I am referring here to my safety.
Q.	Isn't it the case, Madam Witness, that the lady that you referred to as ***********, in fact, remained in hiding throughout the months of April, May and June in another house, apart from the one you have described to us?
A.	I have testified to you that I was with her, myself.  I do not know what you want to say.
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness, but I have a document which I intend to enter as a Prosecution Exhibit.  And I would have the document circulated.  The original document is in French, and then we have a translation in English.  

So, if you would give their Honours one copy of each.  I am holding the French in my left hand and the English here.

It would become apparent, Your Honours, why I seek to enter this document once you see it.  It has been the subject of a different application before Your Honours, but this is an entirely different matter.  The original is in French and I think that for completeness, you ought to have the original because that is the one that bears the signature. 

And before I -- before I proceed to enter -- my learned friend is on his feet.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you leave Mr. Phillips to complete his sentence.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honour, before I make my application, there is just one matter that I need to put to this witness to be fair to her and to give her an opportunity to write her explanation to the Court, and that is in relation to what you would find on page 1, if you turn the page over -- not the front page, but the page 1, under paragraph 8 in the document that I have just handed to you.  If you hold that in one hand and you hold the personal identification details of this witness which has been produced in this court, you will see what I am driving at.  And I think it is only fair for me to put this to her, and provide her with an opportunity to explain because she has indeed said something that is contrary to what appears there.  And then I will seek to enter the other document as a Prosecution exhibit for a variety of reasons. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, what is your application?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honour, I'm not going to show her the witness statement because that in itself wouldn't -- what I have done is I have written a name on a piece of paper which I've taken from paragraph 8 as the name of the mother there.  I'm going to show it to her, just for fairness, and ask her to confirm whether or not if that is, indeed, her mother.  And that would satisfy me.  

So with that, Mr. Registry, could you please assist me in that process.  If you could show it to 
Their Honours first and my learned friend before you show it to the witness, please. 
MR. SONGA: 
Your -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, this is the name of the mother of the witness, this is what you allege?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Yes, that is what I want to be put to the witness, Your Honour, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Songa. 
(Pages 31 to 46 by Donna M. Lewis)



	1600H 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, you invited me to exercise patience so that the Prosecutor could finish making his statements, but I -- I feel compelled to raise an objection right now because this is -- this concerns a statement that was given by a person who is either dead or cannot be found, and who has already been the subject of a motion by the Prosecutor who wanted the statement to be taken into account.  You are going to dismiss this motion for the reasons that right now the statement concerns the actions and the behaviour of the Accused, whereas these statements are made by people who are no longer around or cannot be brought before your court.  So -- especially as this concerns the behaviour and actions of the Accused.  

Furthermore, Madam President, you have sustained your -- you've sustained your decision by stating that persons who are dead or who cannot be found cannot allow for a cross-examination.  So, we are rather surprised -- we, on the Defence, are surprised that a document that has been rejected outright is finding its way in surreptitiously.  So, we would, therefore, object that this material be entered into the records.  And thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you dispute the authenticity of this document -- witness statement?
MR. SONGA:
We do challenge it, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The objection of professor is sustained to the extent that you can put the name which you have written on a piece of paper to the witness, but you can't enter this statement into evidence.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the problem is that I hadn't actually made my application.  I never made an application.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But you did say -- you did say you wanted to enter this statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I didn't -- I shouldn't make the application, Your Honour.  I was providing a foundational basis for distributing the statement in the courtroom, Your Honour, so that you understand the basis under which I distributed it.  I hadn't made an application, and my application may or may not be necessary, depending on the response I get from the process I am about to elicit from this witness. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, but then what is the purpose of our looking at this document?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That would have been the subject of my application, Your Honour, and I haven't made that application.
JUDGE SHORT:
All you needed to do was to write the name on a piece of paper and ask what relationship that name has.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's one part of the application.  There is another part of the application, Your Honour, which I haven't actually made, and we are only dealing with the first part, which is what I have done, and written the name on a piece of paper, and we haven't done that.  And then there is a second application containing the contents of this statement itself and I haven't made that application.
JUDGE SHORT: 
Well, you go ahead with the name?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What -- professor -- counsel.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I think your memory isn't as good as it should be. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Perhaps, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before you pass the document to us, that's the only last thing you have to do to enter a document.
ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
May the Honourable Judge speak into his microphone?  Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before you -- before you began you said the only thing you are left to do is to enter a document, and the document you were holding is this statement.  That is the time that Professor Songa jumped to his feet, and you pointed to the President that Professor Songa is on his feet, and Professor Songa was then asked to keep his mouth closed until you finished your sentence. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Until then, the suggestion that you were going to enter this document came from you, not from Professor Songa. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
That must have been an error.  I think what I intended to say was that I had to deal with the document, and, you know, the process that follows therefrom.  Your Honour, I take the point, however.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay, go ahead. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the piece of paper shown to the witness, please?
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, you would recall that I had asked you earlier -- let me ask you this:  Have you seen the name that I have written on a piece of paper?  Do you see that?  Do you know that person?  And if you do, can you tell me how you know that person?
A.	I do not know that person. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is as far as that document is concerned.  Can I have the document back, please?   And I seek to enter that document that she has indicated as the next Prosecution exhibit, which should probably be 31.  Now --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 31, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 31 admitted, under seal)
 MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I am grateful.    

Your Honour, the application that I propose to make is in relation to this statement that I have had placed in front of you.  And I make this application under Rule 89(C) for the simple reason that a paragraph or two in that statement is of probative value to the Prosecution's case, and it goes to the credibility of this particular witness.  I am not going to mention who made the statement.  Suffice it to say, that it's made by the *********** that we've been talking about in this courtroom throughout today, and it is indicative of her own version of events, her activities during the genocide and, indeed, things that she was engaged in and where in particular she was located.  

Looking at the English version, Your Honours, I am particularly interested in the paragraph that starts off, "During the genocide", which is on the first page but one of that document, and in relation to her location.  It is my position that the content of that paragraph cast some very serious doubts on the credibility of this witness, and some very substantial parts of her statement in this courtroom.  

I would also draw your attention to the paragraph that follows that and, in particular, the paragraph that starts off, "************ was housing six Tutsi women", and then what comes from that, because I don't want to mention the name.  And the number again, which again, would affect the credibility of the testimony that you have heard in this courtroom this afternoon.  The statement itself has a bit of history to it.  It has been disclosed to the Defence ever since we have made our initial disclosures on this case.  It is a statement that is made by somebody that is in a position to know the events that transpired at the location that has been subject of this witness's testimony.  The maker of the statement herself has been the subject of this witness's testimony this afternoon.  And we believe that under Rule 89(C), you would consider that the contents of those paragraphs that I have drawn your attention to would cast doubt on her credibility.  There is a no prejudice to my learned friend whatsoever.  

The application that he referred to was made under 92 bis.  That's a different application entirely.  This is, in as far -- inasmuch as it affects those particular sentences and paragraphs in the statement as opposed to asking you to accept the entirety of the statement itself.  And that is the application we propose to make in relation to this witness.  And you will observe that I haven't actually put the witness -- the content of the witness statement to this particular witness herself.  But what I have done, rather, is to cross-examine her with information that is contained therein, which is fair enough, because it differs substantially to what she has had to say rather than challenge her with it.  

And I also would like to draw your chamber -- Your Honours' attention to Rule 90 -- Rule 90(G)(ii) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and in particular the rule that states that, "If in cross-examination of a witness" -- "in the course of a cross-examination of a witness who is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the cross-examining party, counsel shall put to that witness the nature of the case of that party for whom that counsel appears which is in contradiction of the evidence that is given by the witness."  

I believe that to the best of our ability, that's what we've tried to do this afternoon.  To complete that process, we would seek to enter that statement and indeed the contents of those particular paragraphs that I have drawn Your Honours' attention to into evidence, so that you can refer to it during your deliberation in assessing the credibility of this particular witness in relation to the matters that she seeks to testify.  

Your Honours that's -- that is my humble submission before you and the application that we propose to make.  Bearing that, Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Phillips. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mister -- Mr. Phillips, do you want us to rely on this document to attack the credibility of this witness?   
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's it, Judge.

JUDGE SHORT:
And Professor Songa had already told you that the question of the authenticity of this document --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Oh, pardon me, Your Honour.  I didn't actually deal -- I didn't deal with that part of his submission because I guess I thought it was entirely ridiculous, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, it's a very relevant matter.  If counsel says he challenges the authenticity of this document, and the author of this document has not appeared before us --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
-- and this document is not in evidence, has not been produced, do you think it is safe for us to rely on the contents of this document in order to -- to assess the credibility of a witness who is in the box?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, I ought to have dealt with the issue of the authenticity of the statement.  I am quite taken aback by my learned friend's submission in that regard.  The statement is no different from any statement that has been obtained in the course of this trial.  That is the first point.  

The statement -- the original statement is the French.  It is signed by the witness, who, as you say, of course, is not here, but what we have, the investigators that have taken this statement.  And as you know, statements are pretty much THIRD party statements in this organisation, and the 
investigation -- the investigators that have taken this statement are present.  But what is most pertinent, 
	
Your Honour, is that my learned friend hasn't shown any basis in which this -- on which he seeks to challenge the authenticity of the statement.  I mean, why should the statement be different from that of every other witness that we have sought to rely on in the Tribunal?  And he hasn't established any basis why the statement should have been tampered with rather than --
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, but Mr. Phillips, you and I know that witnesses have come before us, they have signed statements and they have come to deny some of the contents of those statements.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm sure, Your Honours, but I am not too sure that was the application that my learned friend was making. I mean, I didn't -- the problem I had with it was that he didn't actually characterise the problems he had with the credibility and all the matters done in the statement.  

I mean, Your Honours -- Your Honours are free to exercise their discretion.  We just think that under the provisions of Rule 90 and Rule 89(C), you would be interested in actually --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
There are some serious concerns which you ought to address if you really want us to give consideration to what you are saying.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The first and foremost is that the maker of the statement being dead --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA: 
-- cannot assert or deny the contents of this statement.  He cannot say that, "Yes, what is said here is what I said".   
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's quite right.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- or was correctly recorded.  Now, the recorder of the statement hasn't been called to say, "Yes, I recorded this statement from the deceased witness and this information is exactly what he told me to say", so that we have his oath to rely on.  The statement then tells us that it is dated 13th November 1996.  Nobody has told us when the witness actually died -- the maker of the statement died.  And then comes Professor Songa's, in my judgement, quite acceptable response saying, "I doubt" -- "I challenge the authenticity of that statement".  He didn't do anything more than that.  He didn't say it is different from others.  He only needed to say that there being no one who accepts the statement is his or that it was recorded by him or he listened to the person who gave the statement, I doubt or I do not accept, as he would obviously be expected to say, not to accept the authenticity of it.  So, if that -- at that level, if those things are not satisfied, is it really evidence receivable at the rule that you have given us, Rule 89(C), that still will remain as evidence receivable when it is not a statement  acknowledgeable or touchable to anyone?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the -- there is an acknowledgement on the statement itself. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is if we -- if we can accept -- if the signature is authenticated, but it isn't. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, and, of course, I mean, you know, we do take the point and, as rightly raised, in relation to just to answer -- address the issue that you've pointed out, in relation to the death of the witness, we did -- this was a subject of a separate motion 92 bis.  We attached the death certificate of this particular witness, which actually indicates where and when she died.  I mean, I don't know if she has that death certificate here, but it's in the court record as we speak in relation to this particular witness and the date of her death.  Of course, it is open to the Prosecution to call either the investigators in rebuttal of this and -- or, indeed, other witnesses to report at the time.  We simply thought it necessary to make this application, and it is in Your Honours' discretion.  And that's as far as we can do. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Songa, what's your response?
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I am somewhat pained to note that my learned colleague persists in trying to -- in trying to go round the text or the instruments which maybe very hard for him.  But the law is the law; however hard it is, it should be applied.  A long time ago, this Court decided on this matter in particular by establishing the primacy of Rule 92 bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, referring to facts that are proven other than by hearing a witness.  This Trial Chamber decided that this provision had primacy over Rule 89, and this rule was adopted when Rule 89 was already in existence.  It was, therefore, known that the Trial Chamber could receive any relevant evidence.  However, this power was clearly defined by stating that, in regard to evidence or facts proven other than by the hearing of a witness, there would be no question of admitting such evidence if it pertained to the acts and behaviour of the Accused.  That is the first point.  

Secondly, I would like to draw the attention of this Trial Chamber, Madam President, to the fact that the persistence on the part of the Prosecutor in returning to what has already been decided upon, what has already been determined, is part of a widespread conspiracy headed by Mr. *************** who is still the xxxxxx of the purported xxxxxx of this statement.   We have every reason to believe that there is no basis whatsoever that would led -- lead us to follow what the Prosecutor is suggesting unless we decide to dispense with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and systematically violate the law and thus ignore any justice.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

	We have deliberated.  We have considered the submissions of the parties.  We find no force in the application, Mr. Prosecutor.  The application is hereby dismissed.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
As it pleases the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, do you have any re-examination?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, just a question or two to get some clarifications.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, the Defence would just like to understand exactly when you left the family where you lived, with whom you left to go back to your own family?  Could you be more specific on this?
A.	I arrived to that place in 1984 and I left that place in 1990.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I think a question was put to you regarding the girls who were killed in the graveyard near Mubuga parish.
A.	Yes, I spoke of those girls.
Q.	Perhaps the Defence was not paying attention, but would you allow me to put the question whether you learnt that these girls were raped?
A.	I didn't hear of it.
Q.	Did you learn that they were disembowelled?
A.	I didn't hear of it.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my re-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Madam Witness, your --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, there are two matters in which I would like you to help me again.  One of them is -- concerns what counsel has just asked you.  When you left the house where -- in 1990 when you left the house where you had been staying since 1984, when did you come back to that house?
THE WITNESS:
I returned to that house in 1994.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When in 1994, after or before your marriage?
THE WITNESS:
It was after my marriage.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
After your marriage, when?
THE WITNESS:
I arrived on the 15th of April 1994.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Fifteenth April 1994.  When you were taking the patient to *************************, where were you coming from?
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I described to you the relationship between myself and this person.  If you have the document before you, you will see that I took the patient, the sick patient from his or her home.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is from his or her home or from your home?  Your and his or her home was not the same home at that time, was it?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were two different homes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So, you went to the house -- the house I am -- we are referring to, on 15th of April.  Was that from ***************?
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE MUTHOGA.
	And how long did you stay in the house?
THE WITNESS:
The attack in*********** found me there.  I had just spent two days -- two days in that place when it happened.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, no, I'm told -- you told me you went back to the house on 15th of April.  You remember that?
THE WITNESS:
This is how things happened: I told you that this person fell ill.  I realised that I was the only person who was able to take her to the dispensary.  I went to her home.  I took her to the dispensary, and the war broke out.  When we were attacked where we were, I went towards my husband's residence, and then I left this place to go to the church.  And then on the 15th of April at night, I went to the place in question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Good.  How long did you stay in the home -- the home in question?
THE WITNESS:
I stayed there for about a month.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
One month.  And when did you go to the home of the other person whose name you wrote down?  You remember you wrote down the name of somebody to whose home you went, starting with a "P".  When did you go there?
THE WITNESS:
I went there on the 15th, the day of the attack on the church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But that's the day you went to the other home where you have been staying since 1984.  Do you recall telling us that you -- after the attack you went to the home of somebody else whose name started with a "P"?  Do you remember?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I remember.  I remember this.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You remember that.  Now, when did you go to the house of that person whose name started with a "P"?
THE WITNESS:
I remember.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When did you go?
THE WITNESS:
I don't remember the dates clearly, but I think I went there between the 13th and the 16th.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thirteenth and 16th of what -- which month?
THE WITNESS:
Of the month of May. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
	So you went from the home where you stayed in 1984 to this other person's home.  You did not go from the church to this other person's home.
THE WITNESS:
I did not leave the church to go to P's residence.  However, I went through somebody else's house; that is, before I went to the residence of P, I had already stayed elsewhere before.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And before you left the -- before -- did you go through anywhere before leaving the house you had stayed in since '84?  Did you go church to the house of '84?  Or did you go church through some place to the house of '84?
THE WITNESS:
I left the church.  I passed through the place where I had been living since 1984.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You passed through?
THE WITNESS:
In fact, I went there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So, you went there?
THE WITNESS:
And I stayed there for a month.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you didn't go to any other place between the church and the -- and the place you had stayed in 1984; you did not go to any other place?
THE WITNESS:
I went nowhere else.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And is that the time you found these other four women in that house?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is when I found them, because these four women usually lived at that place.  That is why I found them there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Had you left them there when you went away in 1990?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I left them there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You had left them there.  Okay, now, the other matter I want you to assist me on is: How did you get out of Mugowa -- Mubuga church?
THE WITNESS:
During the attacks -- during the massacres, I explained to you that there are houses around the church, behind, and those who were able to hide under the bodies  to protect themselves --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let's not deal with the other people, you yourself, what happened to you.  Give me evidence of what you did, not what other people did.
THE WITNESS:
In my case, I went out through the main door of the church towards the back, towards the rear courtyard of the church.  There was a door there of a small house.  I opened the door.  This was the small house that was behind the church.  I stayed in the house.  And during night, I left that place and I went away.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What time during the night?

THE WITNESS:
I left this place at about 7 p.m., because I wanted to move under cover of darkness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you then went to the house of 1984?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What time did you arrive at the house of 1984?
THE WITNESS:
It was at night, but I do not remember the exact hour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How far is it, the house of 1984 -- from Mubuga church to the house of 1984?
THE WITNESS:
I cannot give you an estimate of the distance, but I left the church at 7 p.m..  I am unable to give you an estimate of the time it takes.  I went through the bushes to be able to arrive at that house. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were you alone or with others?
THE WITNESS:
I went alone.  I was alone.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were not escorted by anybody?
THE WITNESS:
Nobody.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you have a watch with you?
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No.  How did you know it was 7 p.m.?
THE WITNESS:
It is an estimate.  It was already dark, and when you -- when it's raining, you know, you can know that it is going to rain, and then you can know -- tell the weather.  You can say that it is 6 p.m., just by looking at the sky, for example. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was it raining at the time?
THE WITNESS:
During that month, it was raining, but on that day it did not rain.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That day it did not rain.
Now, I'm sorry, I am asking too many questions about this, but I -- it is important that I understand it so that I can come to an understanding of it.  

Now, at Mubuga church, yourself, when the attackers came, where were you within the church?
THE WITNESS:
The church was full of people.  On all sides there were people in the church.  I myself was quite close to the place which is referred to as an altar in a church.  I was quite close to the steps that led up to the altar.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, and you said people were killed.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is true.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, could you tell us what was used to kill them?
THE WITNESS:
The assailants used various weapons: clubs, machetes, firearms, grenades, all sorts of weapons. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In the church, they used grenades?
THE WITNESS:
First, they threw grenades, but the attack itself was not launched immediately, only a few people died, but the attack did not take place immediately.  Afterwards, the assailants used guns, clubs and machetes and many people died.  And it is from that time that people tried to seek to flee.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you where were you at that time when that was happening?
THE WITNESS:
At that time when the assailants attacked -- when the small number of people had died, we were inside.  We didn't have a choice.  The assailants did not attack immediately.  The doors were open and people were struggling to get out, and I went out through the other door of the church which leads to the back of the church to go to the rear courtyard of the church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you -- while that happened, did you have occasion to see the assailants?
THE WITNESS:
We were being guarded by gendarmes.  And, in fact, they were pretending to protect us.  And at one point, we would try to see whether we could determine who the assailants were.  We often saw Bourgmestre Sikubwabo amongst the assailants.  There were other people whom we were not able to identify and many others.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.  

And if counsel wishes to ask questions arising from my other lengthy discourse with the witness, we would be quite happy to allow you to do so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you have a safe journey home.  

Mr. Registrar, please assist the witness to the exit the door.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, is it possible for you to indicate the calling order of your witnesses so that we are better informed or is it the order of the list?
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, up until now, we would like to maintain the order as shown on the list.  However, there is a consideration that we do not master.  This is the order of arrival of the witnesses here.  If all the witnesses are available, we shall follow the order as it appears on the list that we have given to you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what is your honest estimate of the examination of the next witness?
MR. SONGA:
One hour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
One hour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you sure?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We have -- we have 15 minutes left now for the day, we are wondering whether it is better to start now or start in the morning.  But if you tell us you will not exceed a single hour, then we can start in the morning, but you would have to be bound to be restrained within that hour.
MR. SONGA:
I have always been obedient to you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is not a truthful statement, Professor.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Going by this morning's performance, there is this to say your obedience has been declining.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is quarter to five now, we will start with the second witness tomorrow morning at 9 a.m..  We adjourn for the day.  
(Court adjourned at 1646H)
