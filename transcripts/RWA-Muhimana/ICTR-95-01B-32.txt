MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning to all.  The Court is in session now.  

The appearances for the parties are the same as before, Prosecution?
MS. MADENGA:
Good morning, Madam President, that is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Madenga

Professor.
MR. SONGA: 
	Good morning, Madam President; good morning, Your Honours.  The Defense team remains the same.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are continuing with your evidence.  You are reminded of the oath that you have taken yesterday to speak the truth.  We may also remind you not to reveal any information that may lead to identify you.  

Professor, you have the floor for your evidence-in-chief.
MR. SONGA: 
	Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS DAA
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, witness.
A.	Good morning, counsel.
Q.	Yesterday when we broke up you had just answered a number of questions.  I'm going to continue with the following:  In 1994 was there an ethnic problem in Rwanda?
A.	Before the beginning of the war, I don't think I knew of such a problem.
Q.	And what happened at the onset of the war?
A.	When the war began there was an ethnic problem from what I heard.
Q.	And what exactly was the problem, Mr. Witness?
A.	At the beginning of the war there was a problem between the Hutu and the Tutsi following Habyarimana's death.  It was said that the Tutsi were the ones who would have killed him, but this is something that was being said in the highest tiers of politics.  I wasn't well informed to know to tell you exactly what was the origin of the problem.  I wasn't that interested in that kind of problem.
Q.	In April 1994, did you know Mr. Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which you knew him?
A.	Mika was conseiller in Gishyita.  For me, he was one of the officials that is how I knew Mika.
Q.	Did you have any ties or any relations with Mika?
A.	Mika was a high-level person; I was a mere peasant.  What kind of relationship could I have with him?  I could not go and share a drink with him.  I had nothing to do with him.
Q.	Do you know the Mubuga  parish?
A.	I know that Parish because X xxxx xx xxxxxx xxx xxx xxxx the parish.
Q.	Did you learn that it played host to refugees during the month of April 1994?
A.	After Habyarimana's death gendarme had came and had stationed themselves in that parish, not far from the centre.  And the gendarmes began to beat people.  They created insecurity.  

Please, sir, listen I would like to apologise to you because I mentioned the term Tutsi, since the Tutsi had taken refuge in the church -- or rather the Tutsi took refuge in the church.
Q.	Did you see, with your own eyes, the Tutsi taking refuge in the Mubuga church?
A.	Yes, I was a witness to this.  Some of them were my neighbours.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when we read your identification particulars sheet where you appended your thumb mark, it says that your current address is the prison.  Why were you put in prison?
A.	I am under detention because of the killings that took place in Rwanda.
Q.	Can you be more specific and tell us which killings were the cause of you being put in prison?
A.	I am being accused of having taken part in the killings that took part in the church -- in the killings that took place in the church.
Q.	And what do you have to say about that?  Did you take part in the killings?
A.	Yes, I took part in the killings because I went to that church.
Q.	Thank you, witness.  Can you tell us under what circumstances you went to the Mubuga church?
A.	I am ready to tell you.  This happens during the day, the attacks by the gendarmes and soldiers.  In fact, at the beginning the gendarmes started attacking the church with firearms, and then later they called on the members of the population and when we arrived we realized that they started throwing grenades on the church.  They were throwing bombs at the church.  

	They asked us to surround the church, which we did.  And the people moved towards the refugees who were inside of the church and killed them.
Q.	And you were able to identify the leaders of the attack on the church?
A.	Regarding the leaders of the attack on the church, you had Sikubwabo, the bourgmestre.  He was the most prominent figure amongst the leaders.   There were also gendarmes; Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx                       , our xxxxxxxxxx.  Those were the people who were leading the attacks that were launched against the church.  And what I am telling you is the truth because this happens during the day.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, who called you to go to the church?
THE WITNESS:
Vincent came to my house.  I was in front of my door, or on my doorstep.  And he asked me, "What are you doing there?"  And, I said, "What do you want me to do?"  And he told me come, "Come and join the others."  And I asked, "Why should I have to go and kill people?  I don't have a shop; I don't have cows.  You have enough assailants."  And he told me, "Come immediately because you have to join the others."  And immediately he took a stick which was against my fence, and he asked me, "Why are you coming empty handed?"  So I went back and I took a piece of a stick and I followed the conseiller.  

And when I went a bit higher up, I saw the bourgmestre who was pushing members of the population, asking them to surround the church.  And that is how we began the attack.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, who was this person, Vincent?
THE WITNESS:
Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was he?
THE WITNESS:
He was a Conseiller.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Consieller of?
THE WITNESS:
He was the conseiller of the Mubuga secteur.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA: 
	Thank you, Madam President.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what weapons were the assailants carrying?
A.	Are you talking about the civilians or the soldiers?
Q.	Can we begin with the civilians, Mr. Witness.
A.	The civilians were armed with machetes, clubs and other weapons.
Q.	And how about the soldiers, or the gendarmes?
A.	The gendarmes were carrying grenades, chains of cartridges, cartridges of bullets and other firearms.  I'm not very versed in military weaponry.
Q.	Thank you, very much.  Did you witness the distribution of arms to the civilian population in front of the Mubuga church?
A.	No, the gendarmes had their weapons.  There were many gendarmes and many military men.  Gendarmes had enough equipment.  And it is as if all of the gendarmes of Rwanda had decided to meet at that place.  So there was no distribution of arms there.
Q.	Were you able to identify the victims or some of the victims?
A.	Yes.  There were some of my neighbours and people for whom I used to work who were killed at that church.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned the bourgmestre.  How did he get to the location?
A.	He had a vehicle.  What could stop him from going to that place?  He never used to walk on foot.  He left his place.  He reached Ryaruhanga and continued to the church.  There was no roadblock that could hamper his movements.
Q.	Did you see him as he came?
A.	Are you referring to the bourgmestre?  Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Did you see the vehicle that he used on that day?
A.	On that day he went about in a vehicle that belongs to a certain Gahinda.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, coming to the fighting at the church, can you recall at what time or from what time to what time it lasted, even if you are only estimating the duration?
A.	This is what I can tell you:  The gendarme began shooting at the church at about 9:00, I can't recall exactly the hour, but I think that the killings took about two to three hours.  I do not know if we can talk of fighting.  

As a matter of fact, you only had the gendarmes that were attacking those who were inside of the church.  There wasn't fighting as such; there were merely the victims.  They were not armed so you cannot talk of fighting.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We have understood you well.  Did you personally take part in the killings?
A.	Yes, I took part in the killings.  There is a xxxxx  xxxxxx who was about 17 to 18 years of age who came out, I don't know from where.  This person came by and I saw him trying to fend a way for himself.  And I said, where is this person going; he should be killed.  I was in front of the church and he -- somebody pushed me on the shoulders and asked me to kill that person.  So I hit that Xxxxx man on his back.  

And another person who was close to me, ******************* who was bolder, gave the final blow to the Xxxxx xxxxxx.  That is how I participated in the killings.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if someone were to tell you that Mika was amongst those who were leading the attacks, how would you react?
A.	I cannot agree with such a person because I was on the spot, I was on the scene, I wasn't sick, I wasn't blind, I wasn't drunk; I, therefore, cannot agree with that person.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Were you in the know that women were raped in the Mubuga cemetery?
A.	No, before I was taken into custody I didn't hear anything of the sort.  And as you are aware, information like that one -- cannot be kept secret; you know, you cannot put a lid on such information.
Q.	Were you able to learn that women were killed at the Mubuga cemetery?
A.	It is possible that women were killed at the Mubuga cemetery.
Q.	Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you hear, that is what you are being asked; it is not whether it is possible.
THE WITNESS:
I heard about it.  I wasn't on the spot.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, witness, you said that you would disagree that Mika was one of the leaders.  Is that what you said?
THE WITNESS:
That is what I said.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, was Mika one of the authorities?
THE WITNESS:
Mika was a conseiller.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And Vincent was the conseiller also?
THE WITNESS:
Vincent was also a conseiller in the Mubuga secteur, but Mika was conseiller in the Gishyita area.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And both of them were working and Sikubwabo, the bourgmestre?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Sikubwabo was the one who gave them orders.  He was the bourgmestre.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And would you expect Mika not to be present?
THE WITNESS:
I told you that I was at the scene and that the attack took place during the day and near  -- I was able to identify the people who were in the scene.  Why wouldn't I have identified Mika even though I knew him?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you identify all of the people who were on the scene?
THE WITNESS:
Those I knew before, I was able to recognise.  Those whom I didn't know, well, I couldn't recognise them, I couldn't know them.  But the leaders on their part never hid themselves.  They did everything in broad daylight.  They were not hiding from anything.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And the only leaders you could identify were Sikubwabo and Vincent?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Vincent and Sikubwabo, because they were the ones who were leading the attack; I was able to identify them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Those are the only two leaders you were able to identify?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, those were the only ones I was able to recognise.  And beside nobody knew that -- we didn't know that we were going to be in front of, you know, before the courts today.  Probably we would have been more careful; we would have been keener to look more closely at people's faces.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, when you say the only two leaders that you recognised was Vincent and Sikubwabo, is this because they were in front of the attackers?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were in front of the assailants.  I mean, they were there for you to see.  I don't know how I can explain this.  It was so obvious.
JUDGE SHORT:
In other words, if there were other leaders who were not standing in front of the attackers, you would not have noticed them.
THE WITNESS:
Well, those I didn't know I couldn't see, but those that I knew I saw and recognised.  And amongst those who were leading the assailants, I was able to identify the persons whose names I have just given you.  

	We were standing in front of the church.  Left and right you had gendarmes, but those two leaders who were leading the attacks they were the officials of the secteur and of the commune.  I mean, I was seeing them.
JUDGE SHORT:
How many attackers were there in all?  And I mean the gendarmes as well as the population.  What was the total number of the assailants, please?
THE WITNESS:
Please listen, it is true that I didn't undertake study, but even a person who has gone to school wouldn't be in a position to give a number of the people who were there.  I mean, it was a huge crowd.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, there was a huge crowd.  Are you not able to give an estimate?
THE WITNESS:
I would run the risk of telling a lie if I tried to give an estimate.  Probably, I can tell you 5,000 - 10,000.  In any case, I can tell you that there were about 2000 gendarmes or 2000 and some hundreds.  And as concerns the population, I can say that there were about 1,500 of them.  That is only an estimate that I am giving you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And about 2000 gendarmes and 1,500 civilians, that makes 3,500 persons.  You still can take oath and say Mika was not there?
THE WITNESS:
I can swear -- I can swear it.  I know Mika.  He wasn't the kind of person who would hide himself where people were revealing themselves.  I can swear to you that he wasn't there.  The leaders were doing what they were doing in broad daylight.  They weren't hiding from anything, so I don't understand why Mika would be hiding himself.  No, he couldn't have been there.
JUDGE SHORT:
When you say, "He was not the type of person who would hide himself," does that mean you knew his character; you knew him as a person, apart from being the conseiller?
THE WITNESS:
No.  I did not meet him every day, but I could see him let's say once a month or once every couple of months.  I used to see him as an authority.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That morning did you look for him?
THE WITNESS:
No, he wasn't there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you -- I'm not asking you whether he was there, that you have said several times.  I'm asking you, did you look for him?  Did you try to find out whether he was there or not?
THE WITNESS:
He lived in Gishyita; I lived in Mubuga.  He wasn't my neighbour.  If, when the Mubuga attack took place, he was at his home I wouldn't know about it.  But what I am saying here before the Judges is that when the attack began in Mubuga, I did not see Mika.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What the Judge is asking you is,  did you look for Mika at that time?  Did you have any reason to look for him; to look out for him?
THE WITNESS:
This is what I told you before.  Mika was not the sort of person to hide.  He was not the sort of person who would act hiding behind a tree or a house; I don't know him as such.  In my view, Mika was not there because I did not see him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you said you xxxxxx a xxxxx xxx by hitting him.  What weapon was used to hit this xxxxx xxx?
THE WITNESS:
I used a piece of wood.  I hit him and a certain **************** gave him the death blow.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How many blows did you give him?  How many times did you -- 
THE WITNESS:
Just one.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you telling us that you killed the boy only with one stick blow?
THE WITNESS:
No, it is not I who gave him the death blow.  I hit him one blow and left him there and it is a certain ************* who finished him.  So it is ************* who gave him the mortal blow.  This is ************* son of Xxxxxxxx.  I think ************confessed to his crime, I think so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What weapon was used by ********* to kill the boy?   
THE WITNESS:
He was carrying a club.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the events of April 1994, did you know a person named Agnès Mutagatare?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you know anybody named Alphonsine?
A.	No, I didn't know her either.
Q.	And did you know a person called Colette?
A.	No.
MR. SONGA: 
	Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief.  Thank you. 

	Mr. Witness, I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you too

Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor on your right side.  Please understand the questions and be brief in your answers. 

Yes, Madam Ms. Madenga, you have the floor for cross-examination.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Do you know the name of the xxxxx xxx that you hit and was subsequently killed by the other man you mentioned?
A.	No, I do not know his name.
Q.	How many times did you visit the Xxxxxx church?
A.	I went there only once.
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honours, I want to place before the witness a document which I will refer to extensively during the course of cross-examination.  It is an interview the witness had.  And the original document is in Kinyarwanda, the interview which the witness purportedly had with the Prosecutor in Rwanda.  So I have copies in the original language, which is Kinyarwanda.  And also attached to the copy --
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	If I can ascertain from the witness whether he can read Kinyarwanda or whether he needs assistance from the Kinyarwanda interpreter?
THE WITNESS:
I cannot read.
MS. MADENGA:
Can we please have the assistance of a Kinyarwanda interpreter?  Can you please place the original document with the witness and can you also give my colleague a copy and also Your Honours each a copy.

And also for my learned colleague I have the official translation in English.  Unfortunately, we don't have -- in French; unfortunately, we do not have an official translation in English.  So what we have done is just to make a working copy.  So we've made an unofficial translation, but the official translation will be submitted in due course.  I want to apologise for that, but we got the document late.  And the language section has been trying to work that out, but we could not get the official translation.  

So, for the -- to assist the Defense team, if you can give them a copy of the official translation in French, the French copies for purposes of the record, you can just give them to Your Honours. 

So the document I will be referring to, that is the unofficial translation, is attached to the original Kinyarwanda copy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, do you want the interpreter to read out the document and be translated to the witness?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would only request those portions which I want to use in cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	So firstly, I would like the witness to tell me whether he recognizes that document, especially the signature appended at the time bottom of the document.
MR. SONGA: 
	Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. SONGA: 
	The question of my colleague asking whether the witness recognises the document and the signature is, I believe, a difficult one for a person who can neither read nor write.  And we know from yesterday that he is even unable to sign the document. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why don't you wait for the witness to answer the question instead of intervening.  I mean, the witness is in the best position to answer that question, not you.  And I think it is not fair for you to intervene in such a matter and more or less put ideas in the head of the witness.  
	I will advise you in the future in a situation like this where a witness is asked a question about his ability to read a document, you should allow the witness to answer.  
MR. SONGA: 
	I offer my apologies, Your Honour, and I will take the advice to heart.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, proceed.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise that document?
A.	I used to ask other people to write for me.  I cannot write, so how can I recognise the document?
Q.	Let me assist you.  On the 31st of August 2002 did you appear before the inspector of judicial police in Rwanda?
A.	I think that we met.  I don't remember exactly what year it was, but we did meet.  I do not know whether it is the judicial police inspector or the Prosecutor.
Q.	When you met with that person you had an interview with that person which interview was recorded and you were asked to thumb print the document; do you know?
A.	Are you referring to the judicial police inspector or to the Prosecutor?
Q.	I'm referring to the judicial police officer.
A.	A person came to interview me but I don't remember either the year or the month; however, I placed my thumb print on the document that he drew up.
Q.	This is now the document I am referring to, your interview with the authorities in Rwanda which you acknowledged by thumb printing.  Do you understand?
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, could you further establish the time and place so that we could have more information to link the document with the witness?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, very much, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	The document was recorded at the minister of justice?
JUDGE SHORT:
Ask the witness to confirm.  Ask the witness to confirm the time, the hour of the day that this interview took place and also the location of the interview.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you want to furnish us with the details of where the interview took place; do you recall?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Don't ask the witness whether he wants to do so.  Ask the witness where the interview took place.

JUDGE SHORT:
Or ask him where it took place and let him confirm, if you have the information.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	This interview which you are talking about which you said occurred on the 31st of August, the year you have forgotten, could you confirm that this interview took place at the Office of the Prosecutor in Rwanda?  We are referring to Kibuye, in Kibuye?
A.	The person who interviewed me interviewed me in Gisovu and not in Kibuye.
Q.	Gisovu is in Kibuye préfecture; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is where our prison is.
Q.	In Kibuye, so we are talking about the same place.  Do you also recall -- 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you still recall the time of the interview; was it in the morning or was it in the afternoon?
A.	It was in the morning between 9 and 10 a.m.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Just to make sure we are talking of the same document, I will just read an extract from the interview, then you confirm whether this is the interview you recall which took place in Gisovu, Kibuye préfecture.  

Were you asked during the course of the interview where you were in April of 1994?
A.	Yes, such a question was put to me.
Q.	Thank you, very much.  We will proceed from there.  I had asked you a question, how many times you visited Mubuga church.  And you had responded that you only went to Mubuga church once.  Now, I am referring to the interview which you had on page 2.  The same question was asked to you, and I'm reading from paragraph 4 on page 2 of the interview, the English unofficial translation.  The question was:  

"During the time people were killed at Mubuga church, how many times did you go there?"  The response to that question was:  "I went there twice.  I had taken food to one xxx and his wife Xxxxx" --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Read the correct -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Read Xxxxxxxxxxx and his xxxx Xxxxx.  Give the full -- both names.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, my fear was that I might identify a surname which might link the -- because I don't know the actual relationship since he was taking food to people, so that is why I just used first names so that I don't jeopardise the safety of the witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Then you mischaracterise the evidence, because you are saying what he responded, isn't it?
MS. MADENGA:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, and that has to contain the full response; otherwise, it is a mischaracterisation.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, very much.  And I will ask, since we have the assistance of the Kinyarwanda interpreter if he has identified that portion to read to the witness the full names.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Actually, counsel, the better and easier way of doing it is asking the Kinyarwanda interpreter to read that question to the witness in Kinyarwanda; it will be translated to us.
MS. MADENGA:
That is correct, Your Lordship, that is what I am saying that if he can identify the portion,  read out the question to the witness and the response in Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, switch off the mike. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So, interpreter, have you seen the relevant portion that you are supposed to read to the witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Not yet, Your Honour.
MS. MADENGA:
It is on the second page.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On page 2, third way down from the bottom.
JUDGE SHORT:
Maybe he is looking at the Kinyarwanda version, which may not be the same.
MS. MADENGA:
It is on page 2 of the Kinyarwanda version.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, would you earmark all of those portions, all of the questions which you will be referencing to the witness.
MS. MADENGA:
Mr. Issa, can you give him the marked copy so that he can quickly refer to that portion. 

Did you manage to -- the English translation starts, "During the time people were killed at Mubuga church, how many times did you go there?"  And the response starts with, "I went there twice."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, it does not correspond with what is indicated here on this document.  What the Prosecutor has just read out to me does not correspond with what is indicated here.
MS. MADENGA:
If it is not corresponding I think it is because of the translation.  Maybe we can use the French which is an official translation because the English we are using is an unofficial translation, so we are bound, maybe, to have those problems.
JUDGE SHORT:
Interpreter, are you saying that there is no question there where the witness was asked how many times he went to the Mubuga church?  Is there no such question at the portion which has been shown to you?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The portion that was indicated to me reads as follows:  "I would like you to tell us how you killed ***************."
JUDGE SHORT:
You are reading the previous question.  That is the question about two questions before the one you are requested to read.  Go further down, about two lines down.  And it starts:  "During the time people were killed at Mubuga church, how many times did you go there?" Do you see that?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, I have been able to find it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Read out that portion to the witness, please.

	Have you read the question to the witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Madam President.  Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does he confirm his answer?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, he confirms that he recognizes that this question was put to him and that is the answer that he gave.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the answer that he gave?  That is the one we are after.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let him give the answer in the mike.  

Mr. Witness, what is your answer to the question just read out to you by the interpreter?
THE WITNESS:
All right.  When I brought food to the people for whom I was working the war had not yet begun, so do not confuse events.  When the war broke out I went there only once.  I explained that I took food on two occasions.  I took food there twice.  And after war broke out, after the gendarmes had shot at people, I only went there once.  So you must not confuse the two occasions.
JUDGE SHORT:
Why did you have to take food to somebody in the church when the war had not broken out?  What was the need for that?
THE WITNESS:
They were in the church when the gendarmes arrived at the centre, so they took refuge in the church.  They didn't have a place to cook.  And anybody who had friends like me, I could bring food to these people.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are you saying that is before the war broke, or is it after the war?
THE WITNESS:
It was before the war.  These people could leave the church to go and buy sugar or salt.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, is it before or after the death of the president?
THE WITNESS:
They took refuge in the church after the death of Habyarimana.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
After the death of Habyarimana.  So, now that is the period we are calling it after the war, and that is the period you were asked how many times you went there?
THE WITNESS:
Before people began to be shot at in the church I went there twice where I took food there, but afterwards I only went there once.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the question asked was: "During the time people were killed at Mubuga church, how many times did you go there?"  The question was, when did you go there.  It was during the killing of the people at Mubuga church.
THE WITNESS:
I went there only once --
JUDGE SHORT:
How many times --
THE WITNESS:
During the war, during the killings.

JUDGE SHORT:
People were killed at Mubuga church during the war, after the death of the president; is that not so?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, people were killed after the death of the president.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	In 1994 after the genocide, why were you arrested?
A.	In Mubuga itself?
Q.	The question is why, do you know the reason why you were arrested and put in prison?
A.	People were arrested for knowing the massacres that took place in this region.
Q.	Do you recall the specific allegations?
A.	I am accused of having participated in massacres.  When I was questioned in the Prosecutor's office I was accused of participating in massacres.  I had asked why I had been arrested and detained, and the answer given was that I had to face charges involving massacres in my region and I explained what happened.
Q.	Were you specifically accused of killing one Xxxxxx?
A.	Yes, I was accused of killing Xxxxxx, who was a soldier.
Q.	Besides the xxxxx xxxxxx that you said you hit and was subsequently killed by another person, did you kill any other person?
A.	No.  I killed no one else; otherwise, I would have said so.  We were asked to tell the truth during gacaca sessions.  We were asked to state the crimes we committed.  We said everything regarding what we did during that war.
Q.	Let's come now to how you were recruited by the conseiller of Vincent to join the attacks.  Is it not correct that the attackers were organised per cellule or secteur.  The reason why your own leader Vincent Rutaganira came to your house?
A.	No, there was no precise place of assembly; people were rallied haphazardly.  There was no organised system, be it in the cellule or in the secteur.
Q.	Specifically, you were recruited by Vincent Rutaganira; is that not so?
A.	I wasn't the only one who was recruited; he took other people as well.
Q.	We are currently focusing on you; I will come to the other people.  You said Rutaganira came to your house and said, "Why do you go empty handed?"  That is why you took a stick to go and kill the person.  You were specifically recruited by Rutaganira; is that not so?
A.	It is true that the road to the church xxxxxx xxxx xx xxxx, and when Rutaganira found me he asked me what I was doing.  And he said, "The others have gone.  Habyarimana is dead, he has been killed, and yet you are just there twiddling your thumbs."  And my answer to him was this, "Why should I fight?"  And Rutaganira said, "You have to fight for your survival."  And that is when I took the stick and I went.
Q.	Now, when you and Rutaganira want to the church, Rutaganira was also liaison with the bourgmestre, Charles Sikubwabo; is that not so?
A.	The bourgmestre came from Gishyita on the road leading towards the cemetery.  As for Rutaganira he was asking the people to go up; and, subsequently, we met the bourgmestre opposite the church.  I was afraid because Rutaganira was in front of me.  

	I caught up with Rutaganira, accompanied by the bourgmestre, very close to the school, opposite a statue.  Those were the circumstances under which we found Rutaganira on the scene.
Q.	Now, a follow-up to that question; at the scene of the attack you would get your instructions from Rutaganira and the bourgmestre; is that not so?
A.	Yes, they were the ones asking the people to surround the church.  However, the important proportions of members of the population participating in those events were smaller than that of the gendarmes, which was a lot larger.
Q.	Can you just --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, do you still need the interpreter beside the witness?
MS. MADENGA:
At a later stage because the evidence is interrelated, so I wanted to establish something and then go back to the document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, go ahead. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are talking of the members of the population.  When you refer to members of the population, who are you referring to?
A.	When I say so, I am alluding to peasant farmers as myself.
Q.	Yourself and others who were mobilised by Rutaganira to go and attack the Tutsis who were in Mubuga church; that is correct?
A.	That is correct.  If those people hadn't come to rally us, things wouldn't have happened that way.  We did not have any problems with our neighbours.  We were on good terms.
Q.	Mr. Witness, these members of the population which you were working closely with on this day are people from your cellule who were led by the conseiller and the bourgmestre; is that correct?
A.	The bourgmestre brought other members of the population on board his vehicle, but I am not in a position to state to you who they were.  By the way, I did not know the names of the all of the inhabitants of the secteur.  
	The bourgmestre could have gone to Mara or Gishyita to bring people.  He brought people from various locations.
Q.	Do you know any of the persons who were brought from Gishyita secteur?
A.	No.
Q.	Let's go back now to the document.  Let's look on page 1 of the document.  The unofficial English translation relates to paragraph 4.  The person is referring to a name, which I want the Kinyarwanda interpreter to read out to the witness without reading it through the mike because it might jeopardize the safety of this witness.  The question is, "Why did you say yourself to --" and then my question is going to come from that question that during the war or the genocide were you using this name.  And that is the name which is appearing on paragraph 4.

	I had marked it on the Kinyarwanda documents but I can -- yes, in red.  But we can give you another copy if you cannot identify that name.  We have one set of questions, then the second one,  the third set of questions starts with -- the question starts with, "Why did you --" that is the part I am referring to.  Are you able to identify that one?
JUDGE SHORT:
Interpreter, have you found the place she is referring to?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She is referring to the question.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, I have found it.
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, turn off the microphone and read it to the witness.
MS. MADENGA:
Does the witness recognise that name?
THE WITNESS:
I have recognised that name.  That is my boss who gave me his name.  I know him.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Now, the person -- 
A.	It is well known.
Q.	Can I repeat the question?  The question is, during the genocide you did not use your actual name, the name which appears on your particulars.  You were referred to using that name; is that correct?
A.	I was known by the two names and I do not deny any of those names.
Q.	The reason why you used that name was to disguise yourself since you were also participating in the killings; is that not so?
A.	No, I wasn't trying to hide my name.  That name was known to everyone.  Why would I have tried to hide that name?  That is my name.
Q.	Let's move on to another aspect.  Do you know Xxxxxx Xxxxxxx?
A.	No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, why you were given this name?
THE WITNESS:
I have stated to you that there was a xxxx for xxxx I was xxxxxxx and had been xxxxxxx for him since xx early xxxxxxxxx, and I xxxxx in xxx xxxxx.  The name wasn't given to me because I was unkind to him.  Since early childhood, I had borne that name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	I just asked you a question whether you know Xxxxxx Xxxxxxx, and you had said you don't know Xxxxxx Xxxxxxx.  Were you ever xxxxxxx of participating in the xxxxxxx of Xxxxxx Xxxxxxx?
A.	I did not know Xxxxxx.  I did not know that name Xxxxxx; all I knew was Xxxxxxx.  Yes, I was, indeed, accused of having participated in Xxxxxxx's murder, but I do not know the circumstances under which he was killed.
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Obed Ruzindana?
A.	Yes, I know Odette Ruzindana.  During the war he used to move about in our region.  I do not know him because I went to his home or went to his parents' place or ate with him, but since he was someone who was very well known, he used to pass in our region and I would ask, who is that person.  And I was told he was Ruzindana the son of Murakaza.  

	I remember him because saw him.  I know him because I used to see him.
Q.	Did you ever see Ruzindana in the company of Mika Muhimana?
A.	No, I hadn't saw him in the company of the bourgmestre in our region, in our secteur.  I did not see Ruzindana accompanied by Mika.  If they met elsewhere I know nothing about that.  I was a farmer and I went about my activities.  I had never seen them together.  By the way, I never saw them in the same vehicle in our region.  What I mean is that Ruzindana accompanied by Mika -- Ruzindana was never accompanied by Mika.
Q.	(Overlapping microphone) ... I'm referring to the person of Agnès, a medical person at Kukarugabira; do you know Agnès?
A.	I know a person by the name of Agnès who use to work in a health centre.  Yes, I know Agnès.
Q.	During your interview in Gisovu, the question came, "Do you know the circumstances under which she died?  Do you know those circumstances?  Do you know how Agnès died?
A.	No, I do not know the circumstances under which Agnès died.  If I had known them I would have explained that.  I know Agnès, but I do not know the circumstances under which she died.
Q.	Do you, at least, know where she died?
A.	No, I do not know where she died.
Q.	Can you please -- 
MS. MADENGA:
I'm asking the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist me.  Can you read to the witness the first question on page 2, which starts with, "I want you to tell us how you killed, by suffocation, one Agnès."  That is the question, but what I am interested in is the answer; but in all fairness, I think, can we just read out the question to him so that he puts the answer into context.  

It is also marked on the Kinyarwanda document.  Have you identified the portion?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Yes, I have, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, please read out the question to the witness in the mike, loudly.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Question:  I would like you to explain to us many" -- excuse me, would you like me to read it into the microphone, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The question, yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"I would like you to tell us the circumstances under which you killed Agnès Mutagatare, where you killed her and with what weapon you killed her, as well as the weapons used by your accomplices, as well as the date on which you killed her."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, what is your answer, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
That is not correct; I don't know where Mutagatare was killed.  I never saw Mutagatare at the beginning of the war.  Yes, it is true that that question was put to me, but I did not see that person.
JUDGE SHORT:
Could you read the answer he gave, and ask him whether that was not the answer he gave.  Read the answer as well.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the English interpreters do not have the English version of that document.

	"The answer:  Agnès Mutagatare was a nurse.  She died at Mubuga church where she had sought refuge in the company of other people."  
The witness says:  "I was not the one who gave that answer.  The person who prepared that document wrote that, but I did not say so."
MS. MADENGA:
We will move on now.  Before we move on, with your leave, Your Honours, I would like to tender this document, the original version; the Kinyarwanda document is the next Prosecution Exhibit which will be Prosecution Exhibit No. 69.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You will have to tender all of the three.
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Your Honour, so the original document, which is in Kinyarwanda, will be Prosecution Exhibit 69K.  The official translation --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Exhibit P.  69.
MS. MADENGA:
K for Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
K for Kinyarwanda, E for English. We don't have the --
MS. MADENGA:
The French will be P.  69F.  The unofficial English translation will be submitted temporarily for purposes of the record while we are waiting for the official translation from our colleagues in the language section.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Madam Prosecutor, it can be for the purposes that you find it.  You have referred to it now so it comes in as an exhibit itself --
MS. MADENGA:
That is -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- whether a better translation is provided or not because this is the one you refer to.
MS. MADENGA:
I'm obliged, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is then Exhibit P.  69E, under seal.  All of the exhibits should be under seal.
	(Exhibits Nos. P. 69K, P. 69F and P. 69E admitted, under seal)
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Lastly, when you described how the gendarmes were assembled at Mubuga church, you said it looked as if they came from all over Rwanda.  Did you identify gendarmes from Gishyita?
A.	Yes, there was a gendarme from our secteur known as Kimenyi.  I saw him.  I believe that person's name is Kimenyi.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Were those gendarmes accompanied by any other official from Gishyita secteur?
A.	(No interpretation)
MS. MADENGA:
I did not get the answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat the question.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	You have just indicated that there were gendarmes from Gishyita and you identified one by name.  The follow-up question to that one was, did you also identify any other officials that had accompanied the gendarmes from Gishyita secteur?
A.	I have given you the names of the authorities I saw.  Those were the persons who were giving orders to the gendarmes.  I also gave you the name of Kimenyi, who was a gendarme.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I just want to put it to you that you were recruited by Vincent Rutaganira to go and kill.  You indicated that there were gendarmes from all over, including Gishyita, so even if Mika Muhimana was there, you might not have recognised him because you were organised according to your secteur, and you were operating under the orders of Vincent Rutaganira.  Can you comment on that one?
A.	This is what I would say regarding Vincent: Vincent was leading the attacks as secteur conseiller.  I want to emphasize that fact.  

Now, let me come back to Mika.  I stated to you that I knew Mika.  I didn't know him because I used to drink with him or eat with him, but I knew him.  If he had been there, I don't know why I would have avoided stating that if he was there.  I had no relations with Mika; I have never shared anything whatsoever with him.  Why would I have hidden the fact that he was there?  No, I did not see him there.  

I would like to admit that I participated in that attack.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours, I have no further questions on cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Professor, any re-examination?
MR. SONGA: 
	I have some, Madam President, and thank you.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned the name of Vincent Rutaganira.  Did you see him issuing orders to the gendarmes on the day of the massacre at the Mubuga church?
A.	While he was at a bus stop I saw the body of a soldier which was being brought from Ngoma.  And Vincent was with the gendarmes and he consulted with the gendarmes and immediately they wore their jackets, they took their guns and they went up.  But when they stopped at the bus stop, I wasn't there to know exactly what they told each other, but I saw them go up and I saw what they did.  And the gendarmes had just held a discussion with Vincent.  The gendarme came from different areas and didn't know where the church was.  

	To us, if the gendarmes knew where the church was, it was because Vincent had discussed with him, because he was from Mubuga.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned the name of a certain Agnès who used to work in the health centre.  Did you know her other name, if possible?
A.	Please hear me, a Rutaganira was xxx xxxxxxxxx and I knew him.  Xxx xxxxx was xxxxx to xxxx.  I can't hide this from you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are the questions being properly translated?  

Professor, can you repeat your question?
THE WITNESS:
I understand very well what is being translated to me.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Then why are you giving answers which are not related to what you are being asked?
THE WITNESS:
I was asked if I knew Mutagatare, if I knew her name.  And I said her name was Agnès Mutagatare.  That was her name.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you also know her age?
A.	No.
Q.	Was she a young girl?
A.	She was a bit advanced in age.
Q.	Did she have children?
A.	No, I did not see them.
Q.	Did she have a nickname or any other name?
A.	I think she was also called Mamaya (phonetic).  There is a nickname that she used to have, but I think it was more or less Mamaya.
Q.	And if somebody told you that she was called Mutagatare, would that refer to the same person; yes or no?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	Can we hear your last version with respect to the circumstances surrounding the death of the Agnès in question?
A.	I know Agnès; I knew her while she was working at the health centre.  I don't know any other thing concerning her.
Q.	Last question, Mr. Witness.  You mentioned a gendarme called Kimenyi; do you recall which was his secteur?
A.	He was from the Mubuga secteur.  I think he was from Mubuga, precisely from Kizibaziba.
MR. SONGA: 
	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

Madam President, I have ended my further examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.

Mr. Witness, when were you arrested by the Rwanda authorities?
THE WITNESS:
I was arrested in xxxx, on the xth of xxxxxxx xxxx.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And when did you confess your guilt?
THE WITNESS:
On the xxth of Xxxxxxxx xxxx.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Why did it take so long to admit the crimes you committed?
THE WITNESS:
That is when my conscience dictated that I say exactly, I confess to what I did.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Were you advised by someone to make confession?
THE WITNESS:
No, nobody.  I did this of my own volition.  The unity government in Rwanda had asked us to confess for those who wished to do so and to ask for forgiveness.  It was, therefore, necessary for us to say what we had done.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, who asked you to give -- to come and testify in this trial?
THE WITNESS:
There is a gentleman who came to Gisovu.  I did not even know that I was going to appear before this Chamber.  I was called and asked where I was residing before my arrest, I explained to him.  He asked me what had happened to that place and I told him.  And from what I realised, he wasn't taking any notes.  Anyways, I don't know how to read.  

Subsequently, he asked me, "If you were asked to repeat what you have just said, would you be able to do so?"  I said I would be able to do so.  A few days later I saw a vehicle that was sent to my cellule to bring me here.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did that person ask you whether you had seen Mika at the church?
THE WITNESS:
No, he did not ask me anything concerning Mika.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did he ask you anything concerning the church and the attack at the church?
THE WITNESS:
I thought he was from the Office of the Prosecutor because he asked me questions concerning the church, and I told him.  And later he asked me, "Would you be willing to repeat what you have just said?"  And I said, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did he ask you if you knew Mika?
THE WITNESS:
No, he did not ask me anything concerning Mika.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did he ask you anything concerning Vincent?
THE WITNESS:
Even if he hadn't asked me a question concerning Mika, I think rather I'm the one who took the initiative to talk to him about Vincent.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did he ask you  --
THE WITNESS:
Yes, even if the person didn't ask any question concerning Vincent, I would have told him about him because the person asked me what had happened during the attack on the church and it is normal that I talk about Vincent like someone who was leading the attack.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did he ask you about Sikubwabo?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he asked me how Sikubwabo was behaving.  He asked me a question, how was Sikubwabo behaving.  And I told him that Sikubwabo's conduct was not good.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But he did not ask you how Mika was behaving?
THE WITNESS:
I don't think the person asked me anything concerning Mika.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, I asked you a question earlier and I don't think you answered.  You say that Mika was not the kind of person who would hide if he was present during this attack.  And my question to you was, how do you know that Mika is not the type of person who would hide during an attack of this kind if, according to you, you did not know Mika as a person but only as the conseiller?
THE WITNESS:
During that period, a conseiller could not hide because a conseiller was an official.  He didn't have anything to fear.  He is a conseiller.  I didn't hear anything in the secteur.  It is on the basis of that that I said he couldn't hide himself.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  You said this conflict -- this attack took about two to three hours.  During this entire period where were you located?  Were you always in the front of the attackers or did you move around?  Where was your -- what was your location? 
THE WITNESS:
I was standing in front of the church during the entire period.  Now, at a certain point I left that place but if I have to go back to the beginning after the shooting, after the time when it stopped, I can say that the attack lasted two hours, but of course during the entire period I wasn't in the same spot because I left the place where I was at some point.
JUDGE SHORT:
You left and went where?
THE WITNESS:
I went back home.
JUDGE SHORT:
How soon after the attack started did you return home?
THE WITNESS:
I went home after about 40 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for assisting the Court with your testimony.  Thank you.  You are free to go now.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please call the next witness.

testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	We're going to ask you a number of questions, and we hope that you will be concise and brief.  My first question is as follows.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you repeat your question, please. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I hadn't asked a question as such, but this is my first question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you learned of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	Yes, I can do that.
Q.	Please proceed. 
A.	On the night of the 6th to the 7th, very early in the morning, the neighbours in my cellule told us that Habyarimana had been killed during the night.
Q.	And how was the security situation the day following the death of the president?
A.	The day that followed, there was good security.  The Hutu and the Tutsi, together we tried to ensure security in our cellule in order to forestall any attack against us by people from other cellules.  We did this for three days, and subsequently the Tutsi broke away from the Hutu.  Some Hutus went to seek refuge in Bisesero and others at the Mubuga church.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And when they left the Mubuga church, what was the reaction of the Hutu on his part?
A.	The Hutu continued to ensure their own security in their homes while trying to see whether people coming from other cellules were going to attack our cellule.  But at a certain point, the bourgmestre of the Gishyita commune encouraged Hutu to kill Tutsi.
Q.	We'll come back to that, Mr. Witness, but for now, I would like to ask you this question: Did you know Mika before the events of 1994?
A.	I knew Mika.
Q.	How did you get to know him?
A.	He was conseiller and I used to go to his Gishyita secteur where he used to live, and I would see him there.
Q.	When you tell us that the bourgmestre encouraged the Hutus to attack the Tutsi, how did the Hutu react to such encouragement?
A.	They listened to the advice of the bourgmestre and took up their weapons and started going towards Bisesero.
Q.	You have talked to us, Mr. Witness, of Tutsi who had gone to the church.  Were you referring to the Mubuga church?
A.	Yes, I was talking about the Mubuga church.
Q.	And how was their security ensured in the Mubuga church?
A.	They did not enjoy any security.
Q.	Can you tell us what happened at the Mubuga church?
A.	This is what happened.  At a certain point, I went to have a walk at Ryaruhanga from our cellule, at about 10:30 or eleven o'clock.  Gendarmes came with weapons.  They ordered everyone to go and kill the Tutsi who were in the church.  The gendarmes gathered many people and took them towards the church.  There was a road towards the church which used to bypass the church.  Those people were lined up there and they were ordered to kill all the Tutsi who were going to come out of the church.  Immediately thereafter, the gendarmes opened fire on the church and threw grenades on the church.
Q.	In the sheet showing your personal particulars, Mr. Witness, you say that the prison is your current address.  Why are you in prison?
A.	I am in prison because of the genocide.
Q.	Have you acknowledged the genocide?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And have you also acknowledged your participation in it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What did you do, precisely?
A.	This is what I did.  I came together with some people to form an association of evildoers and we went to kill people at the church.
Q.	When you say that you formed an association of criminals, that included you and who else?
A.	The gendarmes were the ones leading us; the bourgmestre of the commune as well.
Q.	Who was the bourgmestre of Gishyita?
A.	Charles Sikubwabo.
Q.	On the day of the attack on the church, did you see him?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	And where did you see him?
A.	I saw him near the entrance into the church.
Q.	You mentioned a centre from where you left to go to the church.  Did you go of your own volition to the church or did someone ask you to go there?
A.	I did not go of my own free will.  The gendarmes compelled us to go there, and besides, they beat us on the way to the church.
Q.	How many of you were there to go to the church from that centre?
A.	There were very many of us.  There were more than a thousand.
Q.	At what time do you recall having reached the Mubuga church?
A.	We got there at about 10:40.
Q.	Were you wearing a watch?
A.	No, I wasn't wearing a watch, but when we tried to see how the hours go by, we can say -- I can say that we reached the place at 10:40.
Q.	Very good, Mr. Witness.  And what was the situation at the church when you got there?
A.	When we reached the church, we realised that the Tutsi were screaming and they weren't feeling safe.  They were so scared because they had realised that people were coming to kill them.
Q.	Those you met at the church, and when you got to the church -- did you tell us who was leading you?
A.	The gendarmes, the former bourgmestre of Gishyita, Charles Sikubwabo, were those who were leading us. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how long will you be with this witness? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I think that I can take some 30 minutes more.  I am just at the very beginning of my examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break for 15 minutes. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
	(Court recessed from 1105H to 1130H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The sitting is resumed.  

Professor, please continue with your evidence-in-chief. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, before we took our break, we were discussing the prevailing situation during the attack on Mubuga church.  Can you tell us now what weapons the assailants were carrying?
A.	The assailants were armed with grenades and firearms. 
Q.	You refer to gendarmes but you also referred to other groups.  Apart from the gendarmes, can you tell us specifically who those other people were who were not gendarmes?
A.	They were Hutus.
Q.	Would we be saying the same thing if we said they were civilians?
A.	Yes.  They were civilians, but they were Hutu.
Q.	These Hutu civilians, how were they organised?  Can you tell us?
A.	These Hutu civilians had surrounded the road.  There was no problem.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, are these Hutu civilians part of your criminal group, the one you joined? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, and I was with this group.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What was the name of the group? 
THE WITNESS:
They did not have any particular name. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I don't know whether you told us before the break when you arrived at the church. 
A.	I told you that it was at 10:40 a.m.
Q.	And this attack that began at 10:40 a.m., how long, in your view, did it last?
A.	The attack lasted about four and a half hours.
Q.	Did you stay on site during these four and a half hours?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's a leading question. 
MR. SONGA:
I beg your pardon, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, where were you?
A.	I was moving about on the road where the gendarmes had lined us up.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I wanted to find out whether my -- question is not a leading one.  My concern here is to determine whether during the entire period of the attack the witness stayed at the place that he described to us; that is, where he was moving about. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, you may ask the witness whether he participated in the whole attack -- the whole period or not.

MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, most obliged. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	During this entire period, did you participate in the attack on the church?
A.	Yes, I participated in this attack.
Q.	I thank you.  What weapons were the Hutu civilians carrying?
A.	They were carrying sticks.
Q.	And you yourself, what weapon were you carrying?
A.	I was also carrying a piece of wood that I had wrested from a hedge that was close to this place.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When you say that you participated in the attack for its entire duration, what precise act did you commit?
A.	During this attack that lasted about four and a half hours, where I was posted -- that is along this 
road -- I walked about, and the gendarmes had said that if we were to intercept a Tutsi coming from the church who was trying to pass through the window, we should kill him.  But no Tutsi was able to come out of that church.  All of them were killed inside the church.
Q.	If I understand correctly, you killed no one in Mubuga. 
A.	Yes, I killed no one.
Q.	And you hit nobody. 
A.	I hit no one. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Overlapping microphones)
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if somebody were to put it to you that he saw Mika amongst the assailants at the Mubuga church, how would you react?
A.	I cannot accept this because I walked about around this place and I was looking about me.  If I had seen him, I would not have hidden it.  In any case, his name does not appear on my -- on the document where I confessed my guilt.
Q.	Let's talk about your guilty plea.  Apart from events that took place in Mubuga church, are there any other actions to which you confessed?
A.	Yes, there are.
Q.	Can you tell the Court.
A.	Willingly.
Q.	Go ahead. 
A.	I participated in the attack that took place in Mubuga, where the girl from CERAI was found.  I also participated in another attack at the Mubuga health centre. 
Q.	Did you learn during the events of April 1994 girls were killed at the Mubuga cemetery?
A.	I heard about it when I was under detention in the central prison, during gacaca court sittings, because people confessed about this -- or confessed to this.
Q.	Do you know the names of people who confessed to these crimes?
A.	I know their names.
Q.	Can you give us some of these names?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Please do so. 
A.	There are *************************************************************, and these are the only two people I know.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, were you able to find out the names of the victims of the killings?
A.	No, I do not know the victims of the killings.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Overlapping microphones)...when people are confessing -- when he was in remand, are you suggesting that he would have known the names of the people who were killed?  Or are you asking him whether he -- those who confessed gave the names of those they killed? 
MR. SONGA:
That will be my last question, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I put a question to you, that is, whether the persons who told you about the killings in the Mubuga cemetery also told you about the names of the victims. 
A.	They did not tell us about the victims of those killings, and I could not know about that because gacaca sittings -- in prisons, each cell organises itself separately, so I would not have known, seeing that the people in each cellule or cell stick together.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you know a person called Agnès Mukagatare?
A.	Yes, I knew her before the war.
Q.	Can you tell us who she was?
A.	She was a young girl who had just completed CERAI.
Q.	Do you know what became of her?
A.	After the war, she sought refuge, but I never saw her again.
Q.	Would you be able to remember where she sought refuge?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Do you know a person called Alphonsine?
A.	I do not know Alphonsine.
Q.	And do you know a person named Collette?
A.	I do not know Collette either.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief.  

Mr. Witness, I thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Yes, Mr. Phillips. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell me, do you know how many cellules -- sorry, how many secteurs there were in Gishyita in 1994?  Secteurs, not cellules. 
A.	Yes, I know the number of secteurs that made up Gishyita commune.
Q.	Can you give the number?  Don't mention them.  Just give me the number, if you know. 
A.	There were eight.
Q.	Very well.  Now, did you see a person called François Gasigwa, G-A-S-I-G-W-A?  Did you see that person during the events of 1994?
A.	I did not see him.  I don't even know him.
Q.	What about Able Bahunde; do you know that person?
A.	I don't know him either.
Q.	Do you know a man called Eraste Kayinamura?
A.	I do not know him.
Q.	What about the person called François Bucyana?
A.	I don't know him either.
Q.	I see.  A man called Elisha Munyabandi (phonetic)?  Do you have any idea who is he?
A.	I don't know him.
Q.	But you know Mika Muhimana.
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	Do you know that those six names that I just read to you, do you know -- what would your reaction be if I told you that those people were the conseillers of the various secteurs, the eight secteurs -- six of the eight secteurs that you have told me that existed in Gishyita commune in 1994?  So you don't know any of those six conseillers but you know Mika Muhimana, do you?
A.	There were eight conseillers, but amongst them I knew two.
Q.	Which ones did you know, Mika Muhimana and Vincent Rutaganira?
A.	That's right.
Q.	Okay.  Now, Rutaganira was the conseiller of your secteur, wasn't he?  That's understandable.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, what was so special about Mika Muhimana that made him of significance to you, since the others were unknown to you?
A.	Gishyita secteur was the headquarters of the commune and we used to go there often to get identification documents, and that is how I used to meet him there.
Q.	So are you saying that Muhimana's office in Gishyita secteur was in the communal office, so you bumped into him every time you went to the communal office?  Is that your testimony, sir?
A.	No.  Sometimes he walked about in the centre and people would point to him and say, "That is Mika, the conseiller of Gishyita secteur."
Q.	And the conseiller of Ngoma, Mpembe and Mara, those people didn't walk around in the centre; is that your testimony, sir?  So people didn't point to him and tell you that, "That is Abel Bahunde walking down the street," did they?
A.	No, these people could not be seen at this place.
Q.	Very well.  Now let's move on to something slightly different.  You were asked a question in examination-in-chief how the attackers, people like yourself, how you were organised.  I didn't quite get your answer.  Can you tell me again how you were organised, those of you who were involved in the business of killing Tutsis?
A.	The answer that I gave regarding the organisation used by the gendarmes -- that is to kill Tutsis in Mubuga church, the gendarmes took us by force.  But the people did not have the objective to kill those people.  We were taken over by force, and they trained us by beating us.
Q.	So is it your testimony then that every Hutu civilian like yourself who was engaged in the business of killing Tutsis did so under duress?  Is that what you say?
A.	Yes.  They were forced to do so.
Q.	All right.  Now, those gendarmes, when they came to your respective homes to take you out by force, didn't they do that cellule by cellule or secteur by secteur, to your knowledge?
A.	No.  These gendarmes did not go inside.  Instead, they surrounded the people who were at this centre.
Q.	Which centre?  Which cellule, or in which secteur was the centre located?
A.	This centre was located in Mubuga secteur in Ryaruhanga cellule.
Q.	Precisely.  So, the gendarmes came to Mubuga secteur and rallied round all the young Hutu men who were available to join the killings, did they not, sir?
A.	That is how it happened, yes.
Q.	So that those of you, you and your friends and your comrades that were involved in the killings, were all from Mubuga, from your group, Mubuga secteur?  Is that not so, sir?  You were all from the same secteur, were you not?
A.	We all came from these different secteurs.
Q.	So in your group, is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that in the group of your attackers that you, your accomplices that carried out this attack, you all came from Mara, Gishyita secteur, Mpembe; is that your testimony?  Your particular group. 
A.	The people who came from the various secteurs met at this centre.
Q.	No.  You haven't understood my question.  The question is very simple.  All right.  You had a group, didn't you?  You had your friends, your group.  Forget about the other people.  I'm talking about your group now.  Do you understand that so far?
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	So in your own group, you all came from the various cellules within Mubuga secteur, didn't you, in your own group?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You then met up with similar groups that had come from different secteurs within the commune, didn't you?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Now, isn't it also true, Mr. Witness, that you were therefore not able to identify the people from those different secteurs, were you, sir, because you didn't know them?
A.	It was not impossible for us to identify them, but we could identify those of them that we knew, and I have given you the names of those people that we were able to identify.
Q.	Very well.  Now I'm going to have a piece of paper handed to you.  It's got some names on it.  I want you to look at these names and tell me if all those people are from Mubuga secteur, very quickly.  I'm going to show you a list.  You can read, can you not, sir? 
A.	I do not know how to read. 
Q.	Well, you can read names at least, can you not? 
A.	Yes, I can do that.
Q.	Very well.  Now, help us with that, then.  You saw all those nice names on there, eight of them.  Can you read all those names?
A.	Yes, I can see the names that appear on the piece of paper.
Q.	Now, take your time and go through that list, one after the other.  Do not speak the names into the microphone.  I do not need that from you.  What I want you to do is to look at the entirety of the list and tell me if there was a single person on that list that didn't come from Mubuga secteur.  Can you help me with that, do you think?
A.	I'll do it.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, first you should ask the witness whether these persons are known to him.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If they are not, it would be in his answer, Your Honour.  If they are unknown to him, he will say they are unknown to him.  I think it's only fair to --
THE WITNESS:
I know these names.  The person who did not come from Mubuga is --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Don't mention the name of the witness (sic).
THE WITNESS:
-- is number 8.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Number 8.  Don't mention the name, please.  So there's one person there.  To your mind, the last one didn't come from Mubuga, is that correct, as far as you are concerned?
A.	Yes.  Number 8 did not come from Mubuga.  The same applies to number 7 and number 6.  Number 5 was from Mubuga, so was number 4.  Number 3 was from Mubuga.  Number 2 was from Mubuga.  The same applies to number 1.
Q.	So 6, 7 and 8.  It is your testimony that 6, 7 and 8 were not from Mubuga?  Is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very well.  Now --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the list back, please, from the registry.  Can you take the list from him.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, is it also your testimony that you were present at the Mubuga parish church when an attack took place there?  Is that your testimony?
A.	Yes, I was.
Q.	And it is your testimony that you participated in the attack at the Mubuga parish church, sir?
A.	Yes, I did participate in it.
Q.	And would I be correct in saying that you -- the form of participation was that of killing Tutsis gathered in the church during the attack there?
A.	You would be right in saying so.
Q.	And I would imagine that when you made your confession you also confessed to having been involved in the attack at the Mubuga church, didn't you, sir?
A.	I did that.
Q.	Very well.  And did you also testify, Mr. Witness, that some local authorities were involved with people like yourselves in the various attacks that you were involved in in 1994, sir?
A.	I could see and identify the bourgmestre of the commune, Sikubwabo, as well as gendarmes.  I could not identify any others.
Q.	And were you able to identify the conseiller of your secteur, a man called Vincent Rutaganira?  You told us earlier that you knew him very well.  Alongside with the others, were you able to recognise him, too, during any of the attacks that you were involved in?
A.	Since there were many people, I could not identify him.  However, while in prison, during gacaca sessions, some persons said that they saw him on the scene.
Q.	So the magnitude and the number of people, as you say, during the attack or attacks prevented from you identifying Rutaganira, but it enabled you to identify Muhimana; is that your testimony, sir?
JUDGE SHORT:
To identify Muhimana as not being there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, this witness has not said anything about Muhimana being there or not being there, so far as I can remember. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Overlapping microphones)
THE WITNESS:
I did not see Vincent on the scene, but some of my co-detainees said that they saw him on the scene during gacaca sessions.  As regards Mika Muhimana, I did not see him.  And while in prison, during gacaca sessions, no one mentioned his name to the effect that he was present during that attack.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Very well.  Now, is it also your testimony, Mr. Witness, that you mentioned the fact that you were involved in an attack at the health centre in Mubuga in your confession to the authorities?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And the attack at the CERAI, the school, is it also your testimony that you confessed that to the authorities, your involvement in that particular attack, sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, if I recall your testimony correctly, you just acknowledged the fact that you were involved and participated in the attack of the Mubuga parish church, didn't you, sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Is it still your testimony, despite your -- despite what you say and your acknowledgment of your involvement, that you didn't kill anyone during that attack?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you didn't hit anyone during that attack either. 
A.	I did not hit anyone.
Q.	So what exactly were you doing there, sir?
A.	I have explained it on several occasions.  I stated that gendarmes stationed us on that road, ordering us to arrest any Tutsis fleeing, but that did not happen.  No Tutsi succeeded in getting out.
Q.	So you were not actually at the church, were you, sir?  You were stationed on a road further down from the church to arrest fleeing Tutsis.  Is that not the case?
A.	That is the case.
Q.	Good.  Now, let's talk about the things that have been going on since you have been in prison.  Is it your testimony, sir, that you know the eight people on the list that I showed you earlier, sir?
A.	Yes, I know all those persons.
Q.	Are you currently detained with them at the location where you are presently detained?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, how often have you met with these seven individuals at block nine in that location in that prison?  How often have you met with these comrades of yours to discuss the events of 1994?
A.	People were called according to the secteur they hailed from.
Q.	Not only were they called because they came from that secteur, isn't it true that they were called because that was the secteur in which they performed their criminal acts?  That's how you were organised. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, are these eight names members of your criminal group that you talked about before? 
THE WITNESS:
People were called depending on their secteur, but when we arrived, people were again divided according to their various cellules, their respective cellules.  The people who could meet were from our cellule, so it was not possible to know what people from other cellules had said.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
My question is, I asked you if these eight persons were members of the criminal group which you said you joined. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know whether you properly understood my answer.  My co-perpetrators of the crimes at the church included the person who is number 2.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Is that the only person?  What about in other areas? 
A.	That was the only co-perpetrator at the Mubuga church.  The others are not co-perpetrators.
Q.	Is there anybody else from that list that was a co-perpetrator anywhere else, apart from Mubuga church?
A.	No.
Q.	Very well.  Now let's talk about your weapons.  Where did you get the weapons that you used from?  You told us earlier that --
A.	I do not remember the number of that person.  I believe it is, rather, number 3.
Q.	Good.  Where did you get the weapons you used from?  Who gave you the weapons you used to kill Tutsis?
A.	Those arms were in the possession of gendarmes as well as the conseiller of Gishyita secteur.
Q.	I see.  Now, tell me --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
	Can I have the witness's confession statement shown to him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The conseiller of Gishyita centre you mean is Mika, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
It is not the conseiller or, rather, the bourgmestre of Gishyita  commune.  That is Charles Sikubwabo.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, when you spoke about those who had possession of the arms, did you not mention the word conseiller? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not mention that word. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You did not mention conseiller of Gishyita secteur?
THE WITNESS:
I did not mention it.  I did not state that he was one of those distributing weapons.  I instead referred to the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune, Charles Sikubwabo. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have just asked the Court (sic) to assist to distribute some documents.  The document on top is the original confession of this particular witness in Kinyarwanda, and then there is a second document, which is a handwritten letter from this witness, purportedly from this witness, to the prosecutor, which is document number 2.  Now, each of those documents has been translated into French and English.  

Again, the English translation is unofficial.  The French is official, but the English is not.  And we have for ease of reference -- we have provided Your Honours with our own mediocre, if I may call it that, translation from French to English for the purposes of this cross-examination and I'll undertake to provide you with an official translation as soon as I get it from the language section.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have a copy of the -- of your confession statement before you, sir?  Do you see that document? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recall having made a confession to the prosecutor on the xxrd of Xxx xxxx, sir, prosecutor of Kibuye?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	Now I want you to go with me, now, to column two in that document, and if you need me to show it to you, I'll show it to you.  The heading of that column is, "The place where the crime he confesses and for which he is indicted took place." Column two.  After your identification then it comes to column two.  Can you see that, those two places where you indicated you participated in killings?  Can you see that, sir?  I don't want you to read the whole document.  Just confirm whether you can see it or not, and if you can't, let me have the document.  I'll show it to you.  Do you see that, sir, those two places?
A.	Yes, I can see that column.
Q.	Can you -- would I be correct in saying that it's indicated there that you participated in killings in Mubuga secteur and also for forming a criminal group or being part of a criminal group, again, in Mubuga centre in Rwaniko cellule?  Is that what you see there, sir?
A.	You are right.
Q.	So would I be correct in saying that there is no indication in that document that you ever confessed to having taken part in an attack at the Mubuga parish church, is there, sir?  Witness, your answer is either yes or no. 
A.	I participated in crimes in all those places.
Q.	That was not my question.  Now, can you look at me and just listen to the question.  Would I be correct in saying that, in the document you have there in front of you, in those two columns, it is not mentioned there that you took place in an attack at the Mubuga church, is it?
A.	I went there.
Q.	Is it mentioned in the document that you took place -- you took part in an attack at the Mubuga parish church; yes or no?  Do you see it in that document, in those two columns?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Where is the location, or the sites, of the crimes mentioned in these two columns?  We don't see it here.
	(Pages 28 to 42 by S. Eboe-Osuji)






	1230H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I still don't get a response from this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm asking you a question.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where's the location mentioned in these two columns?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The location?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I mean the sites of the crime. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In the cellule, the secteur. 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot read very well.  Maybe you should give me someone to assist me. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
With your leave, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the Kinyarwandan interpreter please come to the witness box? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And to answer your question, it is as it is indicated there, killings in that cellule, secteur and district.  The answer being that if he was involved in a particular location, it would have been stated on there.  Rather, he was involved in a series of attacks in the general locality.  That is the whole essence of that entry.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What the President, the Honourable Judge is saying, is for instance, Muguba church --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
May well be included in something number one.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that is a matter for the witness, in my humble submission.  Respectfully, that is a matter that must be elicited from the witness's response.  I don't think it is appropriate for us to pursue this line of questioning.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are waiting for the interpreter.  Is he on his way? 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, it would be easy if we had the document so that we could work in our booth.  If one of us left to go and assist the witness, we would have problems.  It is better for the document to be given to us.  It would make things easier for us, because if one of us leaves to go and assist the witness in the box, we would have problems.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, do you have an extra copy for the interpreters? 

Mr. Interpreter, please read out the two columns of paragraph 2 to the witness. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
It is done, Madam President.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is not on the record.  That's the problem.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read them in the mike?  Read them loudly. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, do you want us to translate this into French?  Because we've already read it into the microphone for the witness. 
JUDGE SHORT:
We didn't hear it.  We didn't hear you read.  We didn't hear you read anything. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
It was read in Kinyarwanda for the witness, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You read it out.
JUDGE SHORT:
And there was no translation of what you read, for our benefit.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Unfortunately, Your Honours, the interpreters in the Kinyarwanda booth cannot work both into French and into Kinyarwanda at the same time.  It's technically unfeasible.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you -- it is not indicated in your confession of xxrd Xxx xxxx that you ever participated in an attack at the Mubuga parish church, is it?  Just yes or no.
A.	The crimes were not committed on the same day.  The Mubuga church is one place and Rwamiko is quite another location.  The crimes were not committed on the same day.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This English translation is a written translation of Kinyarwanda? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, it's French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, the confession statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The original is Kinyarwanda, then the French, then the English came from the French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
English came from the French? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.  The person who translated the English reads French, not Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Under paragraph 2, we have four columns in Kinyarwanda.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Under paragraph 2.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Paragraph 2 --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- describing the place of the crime he confesses and for which he is indicted took place.  This is 
para 2.  And then the columns under this paragraph are -- there are 4 in the original document, whereas in the translation, the English translation that we have, there are two.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour, there are actually three.  Yes, I have seen what Your Honour is pointing out.  There are three entries in the original document, No. 1, 2 and 3, and they all say Rwamiko, Rusenyi in Mubugu cellule.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There are three.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The reason why the third one was not translated is that it is the same as the second, if you look at the second and the third.  I take your point that they should have written exactly what was there, but if you look at the second and the third, it's a repetition and I think that's why the translator didn't repeat it.  Because I noted that earlier myself.  You are right, they should have reproduced exactly what was in there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you talk into your microphone, Your Honour? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Would you get a better response to your question if you used his statement, his handwritten plea, in which he details event by event? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I was just working my way there, but there were some issues I wished to deal with in the confession statement and I was going to work my way into the second document, because even within the first document there is a chapter there that also details the events, and I was coming to that as well.  So I'm grateful for your observation.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, it is not in your confession statement, is it, that you participated in the attack at Mubuga parish church, is it?  Can you at least answer that?
A.	I participated in the crimes at the Mubuga church.
Q.	But it is not in your confession statement, is it, in this column?  You don't see it there, do you? 
A.	As concerns the crimes that I committed, it is written here that I committed the crimes in the Rwamiko cellule, in the Rusenyi district, Mubuga secteur.  This is a crime apart.  There is another crime which I committed in Mubuga, but the crimes were not committed on the same day.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's turn very quickly to column 6 of your confession which --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the help of the registry?  Can you just bring it out?  Show him where it is.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	You go to column 6, which is on page 6, incidentally, of your statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And if the Kinyarwanda interpreter can read the entire thing to him, if he can't read it himself.  It's the last-but-one page or last-but-three pages.  So if that entire narration can be read to the witness, if he can't read himself.  And, if not, I am quite happy to read it to him and he can get a translation. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see the declaration on page 6, the narrative that you've written there, talking about all the nice things that you did between April and June 1994, sir?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I've seen it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- someone to read this into the system and have it translated.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I can read my --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, you will be reading English.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And English, we've already said, is not the best translation, but if this were read into the microphone and translated by our translators, we would get the correct translation and the witness would also hear it.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's what I asked the translators to help me with, and it's been done.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's been done, sir.  I believe they are doing it at the moment.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
To read it to the witness? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, but we wouldn't be able to hear it because of the technical problem they have.  So it would be read to the witness in Kinyarwanda so he would know what it is, but we wouldn't have the benefit of hearing the translation for the record because they have a problem.  So he will understand what is in there, sir. 

THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
It's been done, Madam President. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, just an observation.  I think so that we can actually have what has been read onto the record, it would be more appropriate to read to the witness the French official translation and it then goes into English and Kinyarwanda and then -- because the French is indeed an official translation, and then it can be translated for him into Kinyarwanda and for us into English.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You want the interpreters to first translate into French?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, no.  They read the French document.  Next time.  This is done -- because we're going to be referring to a lot more things, and I will give them the French to read the French, so it goes on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The same document? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The same document, Your Honour, yes, the French. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that in paragraph 6 that has just been read to you, paragraph 6, chapter 6 of your confession statement which is titled "Commission of the Crime" in which you have written a statement of all the events you were involved in and the people you were -- your accomplices, it is not indicated in that narration that you were involved in the attack or participated in the attack at the Mubuga parish church, is it?  From what you've just heard. 
A.	I am going to explain things to you.  Concerning that confession, I made it in 2002, on the xnd of Xxx xxxx.  But after that confession, we were sensitised and we understood that there are certain crimes that we did not reveal and that it would be necessary to add them to our confession.  So in this first confession, there's no mention of the Mubuga church, but in my second confession, there is a mention of the Mubuga church. 
Q.	Would I also be correct --
A.	As the gacaca sessions went on, we used to recall increasingly whatever we did and we added the fact to our confessions.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying that there is no mention of your involvement in the CERAI school attack, that is C-E-R-A-I?
A.	Whether it is the Mubuga church, health centre or CERAI, all those three locations I indicated in my second confession, and I have copies of my second confession.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, do we have a copy of the second confession statement?

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We don't even accept as a second confession let alone have copies of them, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, you say you have your second confession.  Where is it?  Where is your second confession? 
THE WITNESS:
The document remained in the prisons.  I didn't bring it along with me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did you make your second confession? 
THE WITNESS:
I made that confession, the second confession, in the year xxxx. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you remember the date and the month?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't recall the exact date.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, is there a reason why you omitted to mention in your first confession the three events that you've told us about today, CERAI, Mubuga church and Mubuga health centre?  Is there a reason why you didn't put them all in your first confession?
A.	We had a reason.  We were afraid, and we said that if we confessed to all that we had done, we ran a risk of being killed.  But when we learned that if somebody confessed to his crimes in all honesty, he had the chance of being released.  So when we learned that, we decided to confess to all that we had done. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have a copy of the -- another document which is with you, in front of you.  It's your own handwritten statement or written for you by someone, which is described as --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the registry show it to him, please?  So it's with him, the witness.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	It's described as a correction to your confession of **************.  Do you recall ever making that correction to your confession this year, in January of this year?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Phillips, hold on a second.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't have the complete document. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
	Your Honour, we are giving you a fresh copy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Issa, can you show him the letter that I'm talking about?  It's the last one, I think.  It's loose, actually.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see that document there, sir, the correction to your confession dated ******************? 
A.	I also recognise that document.  This is a document that was supposed to rectify or correct my first confession.  So it's a document that I prepared to correct my first confession.  After that document I also recognised that I took part in crimes at the health centre, CERAI, at Bisesero, at the Mubuga church.  That document also exists.
Q.	You wrote the document of *************** yourself, didn't you, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	That's what I thought.  Now, since you acknowledge having written the document yourself, isn't it true that you have not mentioned in that document anything about the Mubuga church, the CERAI and the Mubuga health centre, sir?
A.	That is true, I didn't mention them in that document, but there is another document.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, do you recall ever testifying in this Court this afternoon that you are unable to read or write?  Do you recall ever telling Their Honours that?
A.	Yes, I said so.  I said that I can make an effort to read Kinyarwanda.  I didn't study much.  I attended evening classes.  I didn't as much as attend the first year of primary school.
Q.	But you lied, Mr. Witness, because you are capable of reading and writing Kinyarwanda, are you not?  You lied. 
A.	I merely make an effort, and besides, I am not the one who drafted the document that you are seeing here.
Q.	Right.  So you've changed your mind and you no longer drafted that document; is that your testimony now, sir?
A.	We have officials during gacaca sessions who draft what we say.  I made a statement and it was written down for me.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very well.  Your Honours, I would leave my cross-examination at this rather opportune stage and I would seek to enter the documents I have referred to in the following manner:  The Kinyarwanda confession statement of ****************** is the operative document and that would be my document No. 1 in its original form as the next Prosecution exhibit.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
And this will be exhibit -- let us do it time by time.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Time by time, yes 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Kinyarwanda confession document would be Exhibit P -- what's the number, the next number, Mr. Issa?  P. 70.
	(Exhibit No. P. 70K admitted)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the handwritten letter would be 71, P. 71K.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This would be P. 71K.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, P.71K.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The handwritten letter will be entered as Exhibit P. 71K, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. P. 71K admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The French version of the confession statement would be P. 71 -- sorry, P. 70F.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It will be Exhibit P. 70F.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the letter will be P. 71.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
F.  And whenever we produce the English it would bear the same 70E and 71E respectively.
	(Exhibit No. P. 70E, under seal)
	(Exhibit No. P. 71F, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And for the time being -- well, for the time being, we can enter this English translation.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Provisionally 70E and 71E.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Then we have the list of -
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It would be P.70 E for the confession statement.
	(Exhibit No. P. 70E admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In English.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In English, to be kept under seal.  And the letter will be Exhibit P. 71 E, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. P. 71E admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And then there is --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The sheet with eight names.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And that would be Exhibit P. 72, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. P. 72 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you done with your cross-examination, Mr. Phillips? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'm grateful, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
I don't know if the Prosecutor has concluded his examination, madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, he has.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I have two or three questions, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  


RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the Prosecutor asked you a question to which I thought I heard you answer to the effect that you were not at the Mubuga church.  Tell us exactly what was the location at which you were during the attack on the church. 
A.	At the time of the attack on the church, I was present at the church, and when an attack was launched against CERAI I was also there.  I was also present during the attack at the health centre.  I was also at Bisesero.  I added that in my confession.  I don't know why we can't find this document. 
Q.	Did I hear you well, Mr. Witness, when you mentioned a road on which you were during the attack?
A.	This happened on different days.  There was an attack against the church on the first day.  There was an attack on the health centre, and the CERAI was attacked on a different occasion and so was the attack at Bisesero.  Those attacks did not take place at the same time.  They took place on different days and I confessed to having participated in the various crimes on the different dates under the different locations.
Q.	Now talking about the attack at the Mubuga church, I thought I heard that you were put on the road that goes by the church.
A.	That is what I said.
Q.	Now, my question is to know whether -- with respect to the church, what is the distance between the church and the road?
A.	There are some 100 metres separated the church and the road.
Q.	How many minutes would you take to cover that distance on foot?
A.	I would instead talk of seconds.
Q.	When you say 100 metres, can you tell us what distance in this hall would correspond to a meter?
A.	I would say the whole hall; that is from one end of the hall, to another.
JUDGE SHORT:
Would be one meter?  The length of this hall would be one metre, right?  Is that what you're saying? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you 100 metres; 100 metres.  From the entrance or the door of the church to the road, the distance was 100 metres.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can we find 100 metres in this hall, that is, from where you are?
A.	Yes, if you go from that spot to the other end, you will have 50, 80, 100 metres. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for your effort at estimating the distances.  How many confessions have you made with respect to the crimes you committed in Rwanda, Mr. Witness?
A.	I have made two confessions and I made one correction to one of the confessions at a later time.
Q.	Confessions regarding the acts committed at the Mubuga commune, was it the second or the first confession?
A.	It was the second confession.
Q.	Do you confirm that this confession is in your file in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, that confession does exist and it bears the seal of the prosecutor.  I don't know why it wasn't brought here.
Q.	Can you confirm to us that you can produce a copy thereof?
A.	Yes, I will promise that.  I have it, a copy of that confession.
Q.	Here in Arusha or in Rwanda? 
A.	I did not bring it with me here.  It is in Rwanda. 
Q.	And when you state that you can produce it for us, how long would that take?
A.	As soon as I go back to Rwanda, I will send it.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Mr. Witness, Madam President.  And Madam President, I am through with my additional examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, this confession, second confession which you don't have, when did you make it?
THE WITNESS:
I made that confession in 2003.  I cannot quite remember the month or the date, but that confession does exist. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You say that your letter of correction, a letter which was written to correct your confession, is dated *******************.  By that time had you made the alleged second confession? 
THE WITNESS:
I made corrections concerning the confession of 2002.  As for the acts committed at Mubuga or at the CERAI, I didn't make any amendments thereto because what I said was correct.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the French translation is not very faithful, Madam President. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let me repeat my question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you understood the question, Professor, and the answer, too? 
MR. SONGA:
Well, things are fine now, Madam President.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, listen to my question and answer it.  And the question is this:  By the time you wrote your correction of confession dated *********************, had you made your Mubuga church confession, alleged confession? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I had, I made corrections to the confessions of 2002 because the deputy prosecutor had come to see me and had pointed out that the confessions that I had made in 2002 were not correct.  He asked me to see again the chief of the gacaca sections for corrections.  Concerning the correction confessions of 2003, I didn't make any corrections thereto because it was correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is there any reason why you did not make a mention of it, even if it's only to say you have made it, in your letter of **********************? 
THE WITNESS:
The reason was that I had mentioned those facts and they were with the prosecutor.  There was no problem with it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, is there any reason why you didn't mention the fact that you had done a second confession in this letter? 
THE WITNESS:
The reason is that I was aware of the fact that the acts committed at Mubuga, CERAI and Bisesero were correct and I had sent the confessions to the office of the prosecutor.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did I not hear you say that you made two confessions and one correction?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, the correction which you made in your letter of 2004 was a correction of your confession made in 2002; is that not correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, who were the leaders of the attack against the Mubuga church?  You said you were present.  Who were the leaders of this attack?
THE WITNESS:
	They were gendarmes and the former bourgmestre of the Gishyita commune; that is 
	Charles Sikuwabo.
JUDGE SHORT:
You didn't see any other leader of this attack apart from Charles Sikuwabo? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not see all the persons.  I wasn't able to identify any others.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And you were also not able to see Vincent, conseiller of your secteur? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not see him there, but once I was in detention there are people who gave his name as being amongst those who were present.
JUDGE SHORT:
How many attackers were involved in this attack on the church?  How many people were involved? 
THE WITNESS:
There were more than a hundred people.
JUDGE SHORT:
So it would be between 100 and 200, you would say; between 100 and 200?
THE WITNESS:
No.  The number was more like between 100 and 150.  Of course, that is an estimate.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay, and of these hundred -- between 100 and 150, how many were gendarmes and how many were civilian Hutus? 
THE WITNESS:
The members of the civilian population totalled more than 800 and there were gendarmes, and if you add up the numbers, you will see that there were more than 1,000 people.
JUDGE SHORT:
I asked you earlier, you said between 100 and 150.  What was that supposed to mean?  What did the between 100 and 150 represent? 
THE WITNESS:
Those were the gendarmes.
JUDGE SHORT:
So the gendarmes were between 100 and 150 and the civilian population was 800; is that what you're saying? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the civilian population totalled more than 800.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, who invited you to testify in this case? 
THE WITNESS:
The people residing in Arusha.
JUDGE SHORT:
Which people are you referring to?  Do you know their names or you know who they work for? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know the name of that person, but a person who contacted me on his behalf is the president of the gacaca sessions in our prison.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony before this Tribunal.  Thank you.
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's quarter past 1:00.  We will take the lunch break and resume at quarter to 3:00.   
	(Court recessed from 1315H to 1500H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness, and to protect your identity, you'll be referred to under your pseudonym, DL.  You also make sure that your identity is not disclosed.  Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth.  
	(Declaration made by Witness DL in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you have a sheet of paper in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read the document, the personal information contained in the document? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can read the information on the document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm that the information in the document is your personal particulars? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information in the document identifies me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And you also identify your signature at the bottom of the page? 
THE WITNESS:
It is indeed my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
This personal information sheet is entered as Exhibit D. 73, under seal. 
	(Exhibit D. 73 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, go on with your evidence-in-chief. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before I proceed, I have a motion to make.  I don't know whether I should table it or submit it now or at the end of the day.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the motion about? 
MR. SONGA:
The motion concerns the preceding witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I respectfully request this Trial Chamber to decide to order the Rwandan legal authorities to produce for the ICTR the confession made by Witness DZ in respect of the acts he may have committed in the Mubuga church, in CERAI and the Mubuga health centre.  That is my motion, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to the second confession statement which he made in 2003, which he allegedly made in 2003? 
MR. SONGA:
The second confession, yes, but I believe he referred to 2003 instead, if I'm not mistaken. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, are you aware that he had made a confession in 2003?
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honour.  That -- perhaps that information might help me raise my motion more efficiently.  I respectfully request that you decide to instruct the Rwandan authorities to first and foremost check whether this confession exists, and if it does exist, to request that a copy of it be sent to this Tribunal.
JUDGE SHORT:
What I mean is when you or your investigator interviewed the witness for purposes of testifying before us, did the witness indicate to you that he had made a confession in 2003? 
MR. SONGA:
The information we have received is that he confessed to Rwandan courts.  We do not have any further details.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What the Honourable Judge is asking you, Professor, is a very simple matter to which you could respond very simply, and this is this:  When you prepared the witness -- when you interviewed the witness to decide to include him in your list of witnesses, did he disclose to you that he had in fact made two confessions? 
MR. SONGA:
He said so, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If he did, why did you not seek to see it then? 
MR. SONGA:
Is certainly a shortcoming on our part, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And why did you not ask the witness of it ahead of cross-examination today?  In your examination-in-chief, why didn't you cover the area of the second statement and inform us then that it has been withheld by the Rwandan authorities? 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, that is in fact the import of my motion.  During the re-examination, I put the question to the witness.  He did in fact confirm that he had made a confession, and I even asked him whether he could provide us with such confession, to which he replied, "Yes."  But on second thought I feel that this is not the most appropriate approach, which is why I am raising this motion before you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
This motion you are raising before us presents some difficulties.  One such difficulty is that we could not -- we cannot possibly identify a confession that is being referred to.  You are relying on its existence from what the witness told you from the dock, which may or may not be true.  It is not unusual for witnesses to say things that are not true when they are in the witness box.  Accordingly, it will be very difficult for the Chamber to direct or to order or to seek or to request or to require the Rwandan authorities to bring in a document which we are not even capable of identifying because even the date when it was made is not known.  And the person or authority with it is not known.  It's just the mere allegation by the witness that he did make a statement.  It is with the Rwandan authorities.  He hasn't got a copy.  He appears not to have told you about it before, which means he couldn't have thought it was important.  And now you move the Court to ask for such an incredibly difficult document to identify.  
	(Pages 43 to 59 by Karen Holm-Porter)







	1515H
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I quite understand your reasoning, but I don't know why it would be said that the document is difficult to identify if the person who made the confession is known, if the year when it was made is known, and when the location where the acts are said to have been committed is known and where the place of detention of the person in question is known.  But if, in spite of all these elements, the Court still judges that it is difficult, then I cannot request this Court to do what is impossible.  I am only requesting it to the extent that it is possible to meet such a request.  That is my reasoning, Your Honour. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, you see, the problem is that normally you would make such an application where you had such information and you had made attempts to get the information from the Rwandan authorities and you had not succeeded, and therefore, you then attend to the Chamber to assist you, you see, but where you did not have this information, you have not made any efforts to get the document, and then out of the blue, because of what the witness said in the box, you are making this application, it's -- it poses difficulty for us because this is not the normal procedure to go by, for the Court to make an order addressed to the Rwandan authorities.  You yourself must have made efforts and hit a blank wall, and then you approach the Chamber. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And even then, Professor, it's difficult to approach the Rwandan authorities if the person who made the statement isn't willing to tell you on which date he made the statement, because that's an identifying detail that is important for whoever is going to look for it to find it. 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, in reasoning on this matter, I respectfully request that you consider the possibility of taking this aspect into account:  When our collaborators went to Rwanda and requested access to the files of detained witnesses, they were always denied, for the reason that this file was still open and therefore it was under seal.  It has never been possible for the Defence to obtain a copy of any file of a potential detained witness.  This is one aspect that I request that you take into account in rendering a decision. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have deliberated and we rule that first you should try to get a copy from the Rwandan authorities and if you fail in your efforts, then you make a motion and we'll consider it, in getting the copy, in assisting you to get a copy from the Rwandan authorities.
MR. SONGA:
I am most obliged, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
WITNESS DL,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are going to put a series of questions to you, and the Court would be grateful if you keep your answers as clear and concise as possible. 

Mr. Witness, how did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I learned of the death of the president on the day after he died; that is Thursday, in the morning.  It is my wife who informed me, because she had just heard the news on the radio.
Q.	And what was your personal safety status the day after the death of the president? 
A.	The next day, I went very early in the morning.  I stayed in my home because an announcement had been made on the radio that nobody should go out. 
Q.	And do you remember your activities on the following day, that is the 8th of April? 
A.	The 8th of April was a Friday.  It was a market day.  I stayed at home, but in the evening, my wife and I went to her parents' to discuss that situation with them, and we returned home late in the evening.
Q.	What was the distance between your home and the home of your wife's parents? 
A.	It was about 400 metres away.
Q.	And the day after that, did you still stay at home? 
A.	It was Saturday.  I stayed at home.  I did not move.
Q.	And when did you move for the first time; that is, out of the house?
A.	The day following that; that is, on Sunday, I moved.
Q.	What was your day like?  What activities did you undertake? 
A.	On that day, I accompanied people who were seeking refuge to the dispensary, and I went back home.
Q.	Why were these people seeking refuge? 
A.	We had learnt that we would be attacked, and we decided to flee.
Q.	Who was going to attack you?
A.	At that time, Tutsis and their accomplices were being hunted down.  My family and I were considered as accomplices of the Tutsis.  This is why I decided to flee.
Q.	Were you with those people who went to seek refuge at the dispensary?
A.	I accompanied them, but when we arrived there, I went back home.
Q.	Can you tell us who these persons were that you accompanied?
A.	I accompanied my wife and my children.
Q.	Did they feel more at risk than you? 
A.	Yes.  Considering that my wife was targeted because of her ethnic identity, I was only considered as an accomplice.  So she was more at risk than I was.
Q.	Can you tell us whether you were of the same ethnic group?
A.	No.  I am a Hutu.
Q.	And she is?
A.	She is of the Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.	Mr. Witness, for how long did your wife and children stay in the dispensary, as refugees?
A.	They didn't spend much time there at the dispensary because they were attacked.  From there, they sought refuge in the parish.
Q.	Do you remember those who attacked them at the dispensary?
A.	I do not know who they are.  These are people who used to roam the hills in search of people whom they wished to kill.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember the date on which they reached the church? 
A.	They went to the church on that Sunday.
Q.	What church is this you refer to?
A.	This is the Mubuga parish church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, I'm a little lost.  You said they went to the dispensary on the Sunday, and you say that they did not stay there long because they were attacked, and then you say they went to the church on the same Sunday.  When were they attacked and when did they go?  Is it the same Sunday you're talking about? 
THE WITNESS:
We left our home in the morning, on Sunday morning.  We went to the dispensary, but they did not spend the night in the dispensary.  They immediately went to the church.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you know a person called Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	And how did you get to know him? 
A.	I knew him as a trader and conseiller of the secteur.
Q.	When your wife and children went to the Mubuga church, were you still at your home?
A.	Yes.  I stayed at home.
Q.	Did you stay in touch with the woman and children?
A.	The following day, that is on the Monday, I went to visit them.
Q.	What was the situation you found in the church on that Monday?
A.	Many people had found refuge there.  Some were inside the church and others were in the presbytery.
Q.	And in what part was your family?
A.	My family was inside one of the rooms in the presbytery.
Q.	Apart from the visit on Monday, was there any other visit? 
A.	On Monday, I returned home with the children.  My wife remained in the church, and she left the church only subsequently.
Q.	When you say "subsequently," was that on the same day or on another day?
A.	She left the church on a Wednesday.
Q.	Did you hear any information regarding her from Monday to Wednesday? 
A.	On Tuesday, I didn't return there.  I stayed at home.
Q.	Can you tell us how she left the church? 
A.	A young man came to see me.  He told me the person who was the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune had helped xxx xxxx to xxxxx, and he asked me to give him xxxxx xxxxxx to help xx xxxx to xxx xxxx.  That was impossible.  Subsequently, I saw a gendarme who was at the centre.  I pleaded with him.  He asked for xxxxx, which I gave him.  And he begged other gendarmes to allow my wife to xxx xxx.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The person who was what helped her get out? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who helped your wife to get out of the church? 
THE WITNESS:
It was a gendarme who helped my wife to get out of the church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What did the person do who was the conseiller of Gishyita do? 
THE WITNESS:
He had helped another woman to leave that place before my wife came out of the church.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Are you referring to the conseiller of Gishyita? 
A.	No.  That person was not the conseiller of Gishyita.
Q.	Could you please be more precise? 
A.	With your permission, I would like to write a name on a piece of paper.
Q.	Why would you like to write it down? 
A.	In my capacity as a protected witness, I believe it would not be good for that person's identity to be known to everyone because -- because the officials of this Tribunal are supposed to know that name.
Q.	The Tribunal, the Chamber, will respond to you. 
MR. SONGA:
Can we give the witness a piece of paper? 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, can you give the witness a piece of paper? 

This is something in Kinyarwanda.  Can we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to translate it into English? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, this person whose name you have written on the piece of paper, what did you say he did?
THE WITNESS:
I stated that that person left the scene thanks to Bourgmestre Sikubwabo.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who?  Sikubwabo?  Where did you state that? 
THE WITNESS:
I stated that when I was explaining that my wife left the parish, after hearing that the bourgmestre had helped another woman who had been with my wife to leave the parish.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What you stated, Mr. Witness, is that the person who was the conseiller of Gishyita xxxxxx xxxx xxxx and that he needed xxxxx.  That is what you stated. 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I did not make that statement. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Unless there is a problem with translation.
THE ACCUSED MUHIMANA:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is what came through the machines.  And you did not in any of your statements then talk about Sikubwabo. 
THE WITNESS:
Let me repeat what I stated.  The question was put to me as to how xx xxxx xxxx the xxxxxx where xxx had xxxxxx xxxxxx, and I said that a xxxxx xxx came to xxxx xx that Sikubwabo had xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx to xxxxx the xxxxxx, and he told me, "You must get xxxx xxxx xxx of the xxxxxx."  So I xxxx xxx xxxxx francs so that he could xxxx xx xxxx xx xxx xxx.  That was not possible.  Subsequently I saw a gendarme, to whom x xxxx xxxxx Rwandan xxxxxx, and x xxxxxx xxx to xxxx xxxx xxx xx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxx, which is what he did.  That is what I stated. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you also say that the conseiller of Gishyita had helped another woman to leave the place? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I did not make any such statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name which you have mentioned on the piece of paper is the name of a xxxxxx xxxxx xxxx was xxxxxx to xxxxx the xxxxxx?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  That is indeed the name of the husband of that woman. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know the name of the gendarme to whom you xxxx xxxxx? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What was his name? 
THE WITNESS:
His name is Xxxxxxx.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you did mention the conseiller of Gishyita.  In what respect did you mention -- you talked of conseiller of Gishyita? 
THE WITNESS:
The question was put to me as to whether I knew the conseiller of Gishyita secteur.  I made mention of that conseiller, stating that Mika was the conseiller of Gishyita secteur.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That, Mr. Witness, is much, much earlier in your testimony.  That's not what the presiding Judge is asking you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And in that answer, you said, "I knew Mika.  He was a trader and conseiller of secteur." 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That was much earlier. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Go ahead, Professor. 
THE WITNESS:
I do admit having said that. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, Professor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, where did your wife go to after she came out of Mubuga church? 
A.	She came back home.
Q.	And what became of her?
A.	It wasn't easy for her to return to the house, even though she was accompanied by a gendarme.  I had to take two -- I had to take two ladders to put on the fence in order for her to go up, and I put another one inside so that she could come down, and that is how she could get in without making people know how she got in.
Q.	I don't know whether I properly understood the answer.  What I wanted to know was whether your wife survived the events of 1994. 
A.	Yes.  She survived the events of 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you hear what happened later in Mubuga church? 
A.	Yes.  I heard about it.  I heard that people had been massacred. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry, what did you say you had to put under a ladder? 
THE WITNESS:
In order to enable my wife to return home, I had to hide her from public eyes.  I had to take two ladders, put them on both sides of the fence, in order that she could go up the ladder and descend down into the compound without being seen.  That's without passing through the entrance.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On her way in, when she was returning into the house? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  She was returning home from the church. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on.  Sorry, Professor, we tried to understand the witness.  We now have.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, my question was aimed at finding out from you whether you learned of what happened at Mubuga church.  Are you in a position to tell us any more about that? 
A.	I heard about it, but since I was threatened and I couldn't leave my house, I could only have heard it from others, particularly while we were in prison during gacaca sessions.  Gendarmes were guarding the church in collaboration with members of the population, and those were the very people who killed people in the church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that you heard while in prison? 
THE WITNESS:
While in prison, we participated in gacaca sessions.  We discussed them.  Some people confessed to what they did.  Some even confessed to having participated in the massacres in the church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that is where you got the information you are now giving us? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I witnessed some of the events.  I myself was even a victim of some of acts.  Even my family was a victim of those acts. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you talking about the Mubuga church attack or you are speaking about the events generally? 
THE WITNESS:
I am speaking about events at Mubuga church.  That is the attack against Mubuga church. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And you are saying that you were a witness to the attack at Mubuga church and you were also a victim?  Is that what you said?  Because earlier I thought I heard you say that you stayed at home and therefore did not know anything about the attack; you only learned it during the gacaca sessions in prison. 
THE WITNESS:
I did not participate in the attack on the church, but I heard about it.  However, during gacaca sessions, people explained the circumstances in which they went to that attack. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you make confession before the Rwandan authorities? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
To what events did you confess to? 
THE WITNESS:
I admitted to my criminal participation in an attack that was carried out against Bisesero region.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, even before the gacaca sessions, did you hear that there was looting in Mubuga? 
A.	I had heard about it.
Q.	Did your informant tell you who the looters were?
A.	Yes.  We knew some of the looters.
Q.	What did they loot, precisely?
A.	They looted rice, motorcycles and even vehicles.
Q.	You state that you knew some of those looters.  Were you able to get their names? 
A.	I can make mention particularly of Sikubwabo and the conseiller, Vincent.
Q.	Did you also hear that weapons were distributed at Mubuga church so that people could use them to kill Tutsis?
A.	No.  I am not aware of that.
Q.	Did you also hear the names of those who led the attack against the church? 
A.	If I go by confessions given during gacaca sessions, it was said that it was Vincent who called people to go and participate in the massacres in the church.
Q.	Did you hear that women were raped at Mubuga cemetery? 
A.	No.  I did not hear that.
Q.	Did you hear that women were killed at Mubuga cemetery? 
A.	I heard about it.  I heard that women were killed there.
Q.	Did you also learn who killed those women?
A.	Some of those who murdered those women confessed to having done so.
Q.	If a piece of paper were given to you, would you write down their names? 
A.	That is all right.  I can write down the names of the persons I know.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If they have confessed, why would you be unable to say their names? 
THE WITNESS:
The question that was put to me did not require that I simply cite their names. 
MR. SONGA:
I asked that question, Your Honours, because I didn't rule out the possibility of some of those persons being protected persons or witnesses.  That is why I asked that question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Merci. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you.  If the registry could assist us? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give him a piece of paper.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have just written down the name of persons about whom you heard that they killed the girls in the Mubuga cemetery.  Now, my question:  If someone were to tell you that Mika was amongst those who killed the girls at the cemetery, what would be your reaction? 
A.	I was lucky to meet one of the survivors of the cemetery.  That person gave me the name of one of the assassins or one of the murderers, and during the gacaca sessions in the Gisovu prison, I was -- I played an active role in pushing that person to talk about the murders that were committed at the cemetery, since I knew that that person had taken part in leading the people to the cemetery.  The person accepted to confess, and he gave us names of the assailants but did not mention Mika's name.  And on the basis of the above, therefore, I can say that the persons who confessed that they took part in the murders at the cemetery did not mention Mika's name.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  If a witness or another person were to tell you that Mika was leading the attack at the Mubuga church, what would be your reaction?
A.	Those who confessed that they participated in the attack against the church in our prisons and within the framework of the gacaca sessions did not mention Mika's name, and from this I can say that Mika did not take part in the attack.  Within the framework of the gacaca sessions, we meet according to groups and cellules and the secteurs.  We talk about damage that was caused.  And amongst those who confessed of having taken part in the attack in the église, none of them mentioned Mika's name as being one of those who took part in the attack.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, these names you wrote on a piece of paper, are they the persons or do they include the persons who confessed or the names of persons you heard were responsible for the killing?  Can you clarify that information for me? 
THE WITNESS:
Three of those persons confessed to their crimes.  I don't know where the other person is.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know a person called Agnès Mukagatare? 
A.	I do not know Agnès Mukagatare.
Q.	I probably -- I'll ask you the question in a different way.  Do you know the names of the victims of the killings at the cemetery? 
A.	I do not know their names.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you talked to us of a person you were lucky to know and who is supposed to have survived the cemetery killings.  Can you help us further by giving us the name?   
A.	It's a young girl whose first name is Thérèse.  I don't know her family name.
Q.	How did you get to know her?
A.	She was a daughter of a neighbour, and I knew her parents' home.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I wanted to ask you, Mr. Witness, if you knew a person called Alphonsine in Mubuga?
A.	No, I do not know her.
Q.	Did you know a person called Colette? 
A.	I didn't know that person either.
Q.	Now, let's come back to the survivor whose name is Thérèse.  Did she tell you how she was able to escape from the killings?
A.	We talked about it, because I went to visit her, and besides, she was not afraid that I meet her where she was hiding.  We talked on two occasions and she told me that during the killings, she was hit with a club on the head and people thought that she was dead, and subsequently she came to, and went and hid with a family.  And it's in that family that I met her and she told me the circumstances under which she survived.  She gave me the name of one of the persons who had led them to the cemetery, and while we were in prison, I told this person what I knew, and I asked him to explain to me what had happened, and the person accepted to confess his crime, to confess to his crime, and encouraged others who had participated in the same crimes to confess as well.
Q.	When Thérèse was telling you about what had happened at the Mubuga cemetery, did she tell you or was she able to tell you whether these girls were disembowelled or not after having been killed?
A.	No.  She didn't tell me that.
Q.	Did you know any person by name Kayihura?
A.	I knew two people who bore the name Kayihura.
Q.	Were they from the same ethnic group?
A.	No.  One of the Kayihura was Tutsi and another -- the other Hutu.
Q.	And do you know what has become of them?
A.	Kayihura, the Hutu, is still alive, but the Tutsi is dead.
Q.	Were you aware of the circumstances surrounding his death?
A.	No.  I am not aware of them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you answered a question put to you by the Honourable Judge, you said that you confessed for acts committed in Bisesero.  Can you talk to us about those acts?
A.	This is what happened in reality.  I told you that I was seen as an accomplice.  I therefore had to hide.  At a certain point, there was people were all rounded up at the same time to bring out people who participated in the attack.  At a certain point, I think, I was forced to participate in the attack.  I reached the Mubuga school but I came back to my home, but I was at the crime scene, and that is what I confessed in writing.
Q.	Do you recall the period or the date on which you were in Bisesero? 
A.	I do recall the date.  That was before the 9th of May.
Q.	And how was the attack organised?  Were there leaders directing the attacks?
A.	At the beginning, the bourgmestre, Sikubwabo, came to the centre, rounded up everyone with the help of policemen, and besides, he even beat some of those people.  And people who were assisting him to flush out people who were refusing to take part in the attacks were there, and it is under those circumstances that we were compelled to take part in the attacks.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Apart from Sikubwabo you've just mentioned, were there other leaders that you might have seen?
A.	I saw another individual who was very prominent in (unintelligible).  His name was Busoro (phonetic).
Q.	And how long did the attack last?
A.	Well, I -- when I reached the crime scene, I returned home immediately -- I didn't stay there for long.  I think it took me about 50 minutes for me to go back home.
Q.	Did you have the time to see the weapons that the assailants were carrying?
A.	It was obvious I was seeing them.  They were equipped with spears, with clubs, and machetes.
Q.	Amongst the assailants, were there any who were carrying guns?
A.	No.  I didn't see any.
Q.	Did you see Interahamwe there?
A.	No.  I did not see Interahamwe there.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are going to talk about your commune.  When the bourgmestre was absent, who replaced him? 
A.	I recall that there is, first of all, the conseiller of Murangara, who used to act in his stead.  And then there was the conseiller of the secteur of Musenyi.  That was after the death of Muhungara (phonetic).  
	(Pages 60 to 71 by Mark Porter)
































	1615H
BY MR SONGA:
Q.	In 1994, was that protocol order respected?
A.	Muhirwa was still conseiller.  He's the one who used to act in the place of the bourgmestre, in his absence. 
Q.	Do you know the Mara secteur?
A.	Yes, I know that secteur.
Q.	Can you remember the cellules it comprised?
A.	I will try.  There was a Karwa cellule, the Gisizi cellule, the Nyagatovu cellule, the Gikomero cellule, the Mara cellule, the Nyatiro cellule.  I think that secteur comprised six cellules.
Q.	And if someone were to tell you that -- that you omitted Musenyi, what would you say?
A.	Musenyi is not a cellule; rather, it is a secteur.  It is one of the secteurs of the Gishyita commune.
Q.	Mr. Witness, will you confirm that you confessed only to the Bisesero attack?
A.	I also testified or -- testified in respect of crimes of which I was accused.  For instance, if you decide to resort to that procedure, even if you don't accept that you took part in a crime, you testify with regard to what you're being charged of.  So I definitely had to give testimony regarding crimes for which I was accused.
Q.	And if someone were to tell you that at the Bisesero attack Mika was amongst the leaders, how would you react?
A.	I have told you that I know Mika.  If he were there -- if he had been there I would have seen him. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Prosecutor.     
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that throughout the gacaca proceedings that you were part of in the prison, you never heard the name of Mika Muhimana mentioned in relation to any of the events of 1994, did you?
A.	During the gacaca sessions and insofar as that secteur was concerned, Mika's name was never mentioned.
Q.	Very well.  And your secteur is the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) secteur; is that what you say?
A.	That's correct.
MR. SONGA:
A piece of information, Madam President.  That may put the witness's security in jeopardy.  Can that be expunged from the transcripts? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There are several people from the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) secteur.  I don't see what my learned friend's point is.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the secteur of the witness mentioned by Mr. Prosecutor will be expunged from the record.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that the three people whose names you wrote on that piece of paper all told you that they had confessed to having been involved in the attack at the Mubuga church, had they?  Is that your position?
A.	No, it doesn't concern the attack against the church, but the attack that was carried out at the cemetery.
Q.	Pardon me.  Pardon me.  Is it therefore your testimony that those three people had informed you that they had actually confessed, in their respective confession statements, to the attack on Tutsi civilians at the Mubuga cemetery?  Is that your testimony, sir?
A.	Those persons did confess to those crimes.
Q.	Apart from the crimes committed within Mubuga cellule in 1994, would I be correct in saying that you did not hear any mention of Mr. Muhimana's name in relation to the attacks in Kibuye apart from Mubuga, or did you, and if so, which ones did you hear his name mentioned?
A.	I never heard Mika's name being mentioned as being one of those participating in this or that attack.  If I heard it, I would have told you so.
Q.	I am grateful. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for assisting the Court with your testimony.  Thank you.  You can leave the court now.

Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to put a certain number of questions to you regarding the events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994.  I'd like to thank you in advance for providing brief, clear and concise answers. 

Mr. Witness, how did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I heard it on the radio.
Q.	And when did you learn of it?

A.	Yes, I remember the date.
Q.	Could you tell us?
A.	It was on the night of the 6th of April 1994.
Q.	Can you describe how the security situation in your area changed after this event?
A.	On the morning of 7 April, gendarmes were sent to provide security in our area.
Q.	Was there a risk of insecurity?
A.	Yes, there was a risk of insecurity because of the events that had just taken place had a nation-wide impact.
Q.	We shall return to this in greater detail, Mr. Witness.  Do you know a person by the name of Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	How do you know him?
A.	I knew him as a trader and a conseiller of the secteur. 
Q.	Did you also know his family?
A.	I know some members of his family.
Q.	Can you give us some of their names?
A.	Yes.  His wife was called Xavera Mukabutera.  They had two children.  The elder of which was called Lionceau, and the younger of which was -- of whom was called Gaston.  There were also young girls who lived in his house.  They were the nieces of his wife.  There was also Espérance Mukagasana whose alias Commandant.  There was also Nyira Buzana, but I don't know her real name.  There was also a small girl whose name was Béatrice.
Q.	Thank you.
A.	I thank you too.
Q.	You referred to two children of Mika's.  Do you know what became of them?
A.	On the 7th, the younger of Mika's children was taken to the Mugonero hospital; that is, Gaston.
Q.	What happened to them today?
A.	He died.  He died in this hospital.
Q.	You referred to the 7th of April.  On the 7th of April, did you go to Mika's home?
A.	Yes, on the 7th of April, I went to Mika's home. 
Q.	Where were you coming from?
A.	On the 6th of April 1994, I learnt that my father was ill and that he would need medicine.  On the morning of the 7th, I went to the hospital to find medicine.  When I bought the medicine, I returned home.  And it is at this hospital that Mika's son was hospitalised, so I saw Mika's wife and she asked me to tell her husband that the child was seriously ill and that there was a risk that he might die.  So I stopped at Mika's home to give him this message.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you have any particular ties with Mika Muhimana?
A.	No. 
Q.	When did you say Mika's child died?
A.	I learnt of the date, the death of Mika's son, on the 8th.
Q.	On the 8th, did you see Mika?
A.	Since they lived in the centre where Mika also lived, I used to see him every day.
Q.	Did you go to the funeral of Mika's son?
A.	Yes, I was at the funeral of Mika's child.
Q.	How long did the funeral last?
A.	In Rwandan culture, the mourning period is normally of seven days' duration, so Mika -- the mourning period of Mika's child lasted for several days.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It was asked how long the funeral took, not the mourning period.
THE WITNESS:
The burial started about 11 a.m. and we left that place at about 5 p.m.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Do you know the mourning period -- on what date the mourning period came to an end?
A.	The mourning period came to an end a week afterwards; that is, the 16th of April 1994.
Q.	During this week of mourning, did you see Mika?
A.	Yes, I saw him during the mourning period.
Q.	Where did you see him?
A.	I saw him at his home.
Q.	Let us go back somewhat, Mr. Witness.  Do you remember what you did on the entire day of the 7th of April?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	Can you try to tell us about it?
A.	On the 7th of April, in the morning, I went to get medicine in the Mugonero hospital, and I left the hospital at ten or 11 in the morning.  Meantime, I had met Mika's wife at the hospital.  She sent me to tell her husband that the child was seriously ill and that she had little hopes of his recovering, so I went to Mika's to deliver this message from his wife.  I don't know whether you want me to tell you of anything else that I did on that day. 
Q.	Can you remember at what time you reached Mika's on the 7th of April?
A.	I didn't stay long at Mika's place.  So I arrived at Mika's place at about 11:30.
Q.	And can you tell us how much time you spent there?
A.	I stayed there for about two hours.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  During that time, did you see him organise a meeting?
A.	I did not see him organise a meeting.
Q.	I am going to put a question to you regarding a person.  Did you know a person called Charles Sikubwabo?
A.	I know him.
Q.	Who was he?
A.	He was the bourgmestre of the former Gishyita commune.
Q.	Can you remember whether you saw him on the 7th of April?
A.	I did not see him when I left the hospital and I had not seen him beforehand. 
Q.	Do you know a person called Obed Ruzindana?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Who was he?
A.	He was a trader, but he conducted his business in Kigali.
Q.	Can you remember whether he was at the place where you were on the 7th of April?
A.	I did not see him on the 7th of April.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have stated that you knew Mika Muhimana well.  Do you know where he was working at a conseiller?
A.	I don't quite understand your question.  What do you want to know? 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that Mika was a conseiller of a secteur, so as a conseiller, did he have a place of work?
A.	Mika did not have an office; he used to work from home.
Q.	Thank you.
A.	I thank you too.
Q.	If I remember correctly, you referred to a niece of Mika's wife who was called -- a niece of Mika's wife who was called Espérance Mukagasana.  Do you know what happened to her in April 1994?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Could you tell the Court?
A.	Even if this happened in my absence, I do remember that towards the end of May, Mukagasana, Espérance was kidnapped by Interahamwe who had come from Gisenyi.  It is Mika's wife, herself, who had told me this when I went to her home.  Mika was absent, and his wife told me that her niece had been kidnapped and she did not know where she had been taken.  She told me that Mika was probably attending the burial of his uncle called Timothé.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You referred to other girls who lived in Mika's home.  What became of them?
A.	I was able to see one of the two girls -- one of two girls after the war, but I know that they both survived the events.  Nyira Buzana and -- is currently the wife of the conseiller of the secteur.  I have a little problem.  I have a small question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have a small matter I wish to present to you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please go ahead. 
THE WITNESS:
I'd like you to give me a piece of paper so that I would write down my answer on it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What answer?  Answer to which question?

THE WITNESS:
A question was put to me regarding the two young girls who lived in Mika's house.  I wanted to answer this question to say where they were, and that is why I wish to put my answer on a piece of paper.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where they were, or where they are? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I thought you already answered that you met one after the war and you have reason to believe that both of them survived the war.  You have not been asked any other question.
THE WITNESS:
If the answers I have given are satisfactory, then I shall end there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If the counsel requires you to give another answer, he'll ask you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have already mentioned the names of those two ladies.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have mentioned their names.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we shall not dwell more on this question.  I'm going to put this to you instead.  When we look at your identification particulars, we note that your current address is at a prison.  Why are you in prison?
A.	I am in prison because of what happened in 1994, and it is, in fact, for that reason why I am here.
Q.	They are certainly precise acts that you committed for which you went to prison.  Could you tell us what these are?
A.	It is the killings that took place in 1994.
Q.	Are there specific killings at a given site?
A.	I did not witness these killings, but people -- many people report what happened.
Q.	Did you admit to any crimes in Rwanda in 1994?
A.	Yes, I admitted to the crimes that I committed and I asked for forgiveness.
Q.	I will ask you once more what crimes these were, Mr. Witness.

THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, I'd like to give this answer in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Why do you want to answer this question in closed session? 
THE WITNESS:
For reasons of my personal safety, because if I answer this question in open session, I think my personal safety would be at risk.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are in prison.  How will your personal safety be at risk?
THE WITNESS:
I am in prison, but I do have a family. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How will your confession statement risk your security or the security of your family?
THE WITNESS:
I think if I told you how I confessed to my crimes in open session, my family members would be under threat.  Their personal safety would be at risk even if I, myself, is in prison.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, you already confessed your crimes to the authorities in Rwanda.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I did so in writing. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And you don't think that puts your relatives at risk, but if you did that here that would put them at risk?
THE WITNESS:
When we confess in Rwanda, the documents containing our confessions are kept under seal.  It is not just anybody who may have access to them, but I think that what is said here may be announced or published on the radio.  Consequently, this may place me at risk.
JUDGE SHORT:
But your name would not be mentioned.  Nobody would know who gave this evidence, that is why you have been given a pseudonym. 
THE WITNESS:
It is true that I have a pseudonym, but there are things that can be said that would give people a reference if they hear about the location where certain events took place.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, it is 5 p.m., so we continue tomorrow morning, and tomorrow we may consider the request of this witness for going into closed session. 

Mr. Witness, you are still continuing with your evidence, and we'll consider your request tomorrow.  You are directed not to communicate or discuss your evidence or proceedings of this Court with anyone outside the court. 

We adjourn and resume tomorrow morning at nine. 
(Court adjourned at 1704H)
