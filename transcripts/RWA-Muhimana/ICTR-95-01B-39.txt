P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session now.  

The Prosecution appearances are the same as before?  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good morning, Your Honours.  That is indeed the case.  We remain the same.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

And the Defence, the same?
MR. SONGA:
Good morning, Madam President and Your Honours.  The Defence team hasn't changed.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor for all the remaining submissions.
MR. KAPAYA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, Mr. Songa.  

Your Honours, my submissions are limited to count 4, as pleaded in the indictment.  That is 
	paragraph 7 of the indictment, and this relates to the murders that we say Muhimana committed in Gishyita town and Mubuga church, the Mugonero complex and in the Bisesero area.  

I will conclude my submissions by talking about sentencing, something which is not included in our brief.  Now, murder as a crime against humanity is discussed on pages 144 to 176, paras 1 to 164 of our closing brief.  Now, before I discuss the evidence and the law relating to murder, I would like firstly to talk about a general legal principle, and this relates to two things.  One relates to murders which were not pleaded in the indictment, and the other one relates to murders which were pleaded in the indictment but no evidence was relayed in that regard.  As regard to the murders that were not pleaded in the indictment, it's my submission that this -- they contravene the provisions of Article 74, Rule 47(C), read together with Article 22, 24(A), 20 -- this is at paragraph 4(A), and 20, 
paragraph 4(B).  And in that regard they render an indictment defective.  

Now, the murders I'm talking about are the murders that are not included in the indictment; that is those which are referred to on pages 176 to 182, paragraph 167 to 182 -- paragraph 167 to 200 of the Prosecutor's closing brief.  You will note, Your Honours, that these murders incorporate the murder of the children of Witness AX, to which Honourable Judge Short has asked us to say something about them.  
Now, my submissions regarding matters not pleaded in the indictment will also cover on the issue which the Honourable Judge had raised.  As I said, Your Honours, failure to describe them in the indictment rendered the indictment defective in terms of the legal provisions which I have just shown.  And we say they are defective principally because the Defence did not have adequate notice to prepare.  Now, this defect comes in various ways.  Firstly, a matter may be referred to in a witness statement -- a material fact may be referred to in a witness statement and in one way or another would not plead it in the indictment.  Now, an indictment which does not refer to a matter which is read in the witness statement becomes incurably defective.  You cannot subsequently come and say, "Well, the matter is in the witness statement; we forgot to include it in the indictment, but we still request Your Honours to consider it."  In our view -- my view is that such a matter which is contained in the witness statement and was available at the time the indictment was being prepared but is not included in the indictment renders an indictment incurably defective.  There are other matters which arise in the course of a trial.  The witness refers to something which you think is important.  Now, that -- such a matter was not available at the time the indictment was being drafted.  The option available in such a circumstance is to apply for an amendment at the earliest available opportunity.  Failure of that, the other opportunity that is open to the Prosecution is to provide timely, clear and consistent post-indictment information to the Defence.  You will be in a position then to come forward and say, "Well, this is something that came up in the course of trial; we didn't know that Witness AX would say she was raped or some -- the Accused killed so-and-so.  This is something completely new."  But, 
	Your Honours, we agreed that the indictment in that regard is defective, but we have provided timely, clear and consistent post-indictment information to the Defence.  Therefore, we request to consider the matter as being cured.

Now, these issues, Your Honours, are adequately considered in the Ntakirutimana appeal to which I would request you to go to sometime.  That's the Ntakirutimana appeal which is dated the 13th of December 2004.  

Now, as regards the matters that arose in the course of trial, my colleague Madam Madenga told you yesterday that some of the rapes were not pleaded in the indictment, but we made reference to them in our pre-trial brief, and the Defence had also time to cross-examine on these witnesses.  So she submitted that you -- and requested Your Honours to consider those particular rapes as being part of the rape charges that are laid against the Accused person.  Mr. Phillips also invited Your Honours to consider all the killings along with the lootings and all the rapes as part of the evidence of  genocidal intent, and he invited you to also consider that as evidence of showing a consistent pattern of conduct of the Accused person in terms of Rule 93 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  And, likewise, 
	Ms. Madenga had considered -- had requested Your Honours to consider the rapes which happened as forming part and parcel of the consistent pattern of the Accused in terms of the allegations that were made against him.  That is one aspect.  

The other aspect, Your Honours, relates to the murders that are pleaded in the indictment but in which we led no evidence.  You will find these in paragraph 7(B)(i).  They relate to the murders of Colette and Alphonsine at Mubuga parish on the 15th of April.  The other one is pleaded on 
paragraph 7(C)(ii).  It relates to the murders of Bahati Nyiransengimana, Helen Mugiraneza and Rachelle in Ngoma in May '94.  My colleagues yesterday stated that one of the reasons that we didn't lead evidence on these particular murders and the other rapes is that the evidence was contained in the witness statements which were the subject of a 92 bis motion which was thrown away.  So in that regard, Your Honours, we wish -- we may as well say that these counts -- these particular two counts, we are withdrawing them so we will not ask you to consider them in your deliberations.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why don't you, instead of as well saying it, actually formally ask that we withdraw whatever counts you want to be withdrawn so that the record is quite clear what is left for us to consider.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  I'm formally applying to withdraw paragraph 7(B)(i) and paragraph 7(C)(ii) of the indictment on the ground that no evidence was laid against these particular paragraphs.  

I now wish to talk about the substantive crime of --
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:    
	Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
You indicated that where you have led evidence about certain crimes and they were not pleaded in the indictment, the indictment is incurably bad.  Right?  However, you went on to state that in certain circumstances the indictment may be cured by timely, clear and consistent information provided to the Defence.  I didn't get you clear on the circumstances under which the indictment can be cured by timely, clear and consistent information being provided to the Defence.  Can you repeat your submission on that point again?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And to follow up Judge Short's question, there are certain substantial allegations against the Accused which are not spelled out in the indictment, though they do feature in the pre-trial brief.  How would you justify whether this pre-trial brief could cure the infirmities in the indictment? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I said that there are two categories of defects.  That are those defects in the indictment which relate to material facts which were available at the time of drafting the indictment, but for one reason or another they were not included in the indictment, and then there are those defects where they arise in the course of trial.  A witness comes up with evidence which was not available at the time of drafting the indictment.  My submissions, Your Honours, were that in respect of the first scenario, the indictment invariably becomes incurable, because you had the evidence before you.  The defect -- you had the evidence before you, but you didn't include it in the indictment, and therefore there was actually no -- there may not be grounds for which you may now come and say that the defect can be curable.  The other circumstance is where evidence arises in the course of trial.  A witness talks about something which at the time of drafting the indictment you had no knowledge about it at all.  In such circumstance, that defect can be cured by what we say timely, clear and consistent evidence that comes after the drafting of the indictment.  Ms. Madenga yesterday referred you to such evidence.  She drew your attention to issues which we raised in the pre-trial brief regarding the certain rapes, and it was our submission that the Defence had adequate notice because they were notified through the pre-trial brief that such evidence will come up in the course of trial.  

So our humble submission, Your Honours, is that such defects which arose in the course of -- matters that arose in the course of trial are curable.  We also say that that type of evidence -- this is another category of -- this is another set of -- this is another category of submission -- that such evidence is evidence of a consistent pattern of conduct.  We are not saying that we make a specific finding that this person raped or killed so-and-so, but we wish to -- we invite Your Honours to consider that as evidence of either genocidal intent or as evidence of a consistent pattern in terms of Rule 93 of the Rules of Evidence and Procedure.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, so you are drawing a distinction between material facts which were available at the time of drafting the indictment --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
-- and those which were not available at the time of drafting the indictment?
MR. KAPAYA:
That's what I'm saying, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, are you saying that this distinction applies to individual crimes committed by the Accused?  Crimes -- for example, rape of a specific individual, you are saying that even if that information was not available at the time of drafting the indictment and it came to your knowledge during the course of the trial, you can cure that defect by saying that you've provided timely, clear and consistent information to the Accused?
 
MR. KAPAYA:
That is what -- that is my submission, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Don't you think that there is a distinction between crimes which the Accused physically, individually committed and other crimes?  So that, for example, the rape of a specific individual which comes to your notice at the eleventh hour during the course of the trial or -- sorry, not at the eleventh hour -- but which comes to your notice after you've drafted the indictment but you provide information about it in your pre-trial brief and maybe even in your witness statements, do you think those can form the basis of a conviction of the Accused for that rape? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  That is our submission that they can, and --
JUDGE SHORT:
That is your submission?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  And, if you recall, Your Honours, in the course of trial, some of the information that came to us after the indictment was confirmed but in the course of trial and before the witness had testified was disclosed to the Defence through reconfirmation statements.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And what about allegations which are contained in the pre-trial brief but not mentioned in the indictment?  Would the pre-trial brief cure the indictment?
MR. KAPAYA:
That is our submission, Your Honour, that any information that adequately informs the Defence of what we allege against the Accused person can cure that defect.  Because the issue is whether the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But in the Gacumbitsi case it has been held that the pre-trial brief or any other document cannot be used to amend the indictment.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that is -- it's a general proposition of law but they qualify it and say in exceptional circumstances it can be used.  That is exactly what they say in the Ntakirutimana appeal, 
	Your Honours.  In particular in paragraph 125, it says that in exceptional circumstances 
post-indictment information to the Defence can be used to cure a defective indictment.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Kapaya, are you in a position to tell us now what counts -- what claims you think you would want us to, one, remove from the indictment; two, add on to the indictment or are in fact stated in the indictment so that we are able to know that Mr. Muhimana faces the following charges and not others?  Because what you suggest which is stated could be done in extremely special circumstances is really something that no one does unless you have specifically admitted that the charge sheet of the indictment shall be read as if it were amended because this evidence is now proffered over to you, you may now challenge it and let us know what your position is on it so that a decision can be made.  Because I am unable to see how just because a witness gets up and says an accused person killed so-and-so or raped so-and-so that becomes a charge on the indictment itself by virtue of that statement by that witness at that point.  Because we will need to consider whether there was in fact what you now call clear, consistent and --
MR. KAPAYA:
Timely.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- timely disclosures.  We will need to consider that.  Can you give us in chapter and verse this is what I want you to consider, this is the charge, and it was disclosed in this way and that way at this time so that we are able to come with you?
JUDGE SHORT:
In addition to the biblical guideline given by Judge Muthoga by referring to chapter and verse, I would like you, for example, to say that with regard to the rape of such-and-such person, timely and clear and consistent information was provided to the Defence.  Can you demonstrate that?  Tell us why you think timely, clear and consistent information was provided.  You refer to your pre-trial brief, you refer to your witness statements and the date on which the witness statements were served on the Defence to demonstrate that you have provided timely, clear and consistent information.  So you need to give us all that information.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, we will endeavour to do that in the course of my submissions.  And as regards the murder counts which we say we are not proceeding against, I have just outlined them.  And the other ones which were not pleaded but which we are also not proceeding against are to be found on 
	pages --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Give us the indictment paragraph or paragraphs as opposed to --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I talked about the murders, Your Honour.  It was 7(B)(i) and 7(C)(ii).   As regard the rapes, Madam Madenga will provide the information in due course and then we will proceed and I will give them to you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it not possible for us to pass over a sheet of paper to you and tell us so --
MR. KAPAYA:
For the rapes it is 6(D)(i), Your Honours, and then -- and 6(C)(v). 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
6(D)(i) and -
JUDGE SHORT:
6(C)(v).
MR. KAPAYA:
And as regard to the rapes -- and, Your Honours, I recall that Madam Madenga yesterday submitted that we are not proceeding on the rape allegations which are contained on pages 138 to 143 of our closing brief.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where are they in the indictment? 
MR. KAPAYA:
They are not pleaded in the indictment, Your Honours.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So we can safely ignore them.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, yes.  You can save the Court's time.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Because you are not going to invite us to change it. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's the point, Your Honours.  But we will invite Your Honours, respectively, to take on board the rape of AQ.
JUDGE SHORT:
Wait, before you go to AQ, you say rape committed -- referred to in paragraphs 138 to --
MR. KAPAYA:
No.  Pages, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Pages 138 to --
MR. KAPAYA:
-- 143.  
JUDGE SHORT:
You are no longer relying on them as the basis for conviction.  But are you relying on them for any other matter? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, as --
JUDGE SHORT:
As demonstrating a pattern of conduct.
MR. KAPAYA:
Of genocidal intent.

JUDGE SHORT:
Of genocidal intent.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
All right.  Could you also tell me the rapes which you indicate that the material facts of which were not available at the time of drafting the indictment but timely, clear and consistent information were provided to the Defence and therefore you are relying on them as a basis for conviction; which are those rapes? 
MR. KAPAYA:
We will --
JUDGE SHORT:
That one you said Ms. Madenga will provide.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, sir.
JUDGE SHORT:
Are there any in relation to murders? 
MR. KAPAYA:
No, there are not.
JUDGE SHORT:
All right. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I now wish to proceed to consider the substantive allegations of the crime of murder that we -- that are laid at the door of the Accused.  Your Honour --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Just before you do, Mr. Kapaya, let me understand you fully.  When you say an indictment is defective because it was not charged, a matter was not charged in it, you are obviously using defective to that extent.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, the defect relates to that material allegation.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That material allegation is the one which ought to be struck out.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's the point, Your Honour.  It's not the whole indictment.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not the whole indictment.

MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour.  No.  That's not what I am inviting you to do.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, are you telling us that this material that is -- the indictment to the extent of that material is defective because the indictment does not mention the charges? 
MR. KAPAYA:
The indictment is defective to the extent of that material or that factual allegation because the Defence did not have sufficient notice of that particular allegation.  That's the basis of -- and it contravenes Article 20 of the rights of the Accused and that he may be prejudiced.  That is why we say that the indictment is defective to the extent of the material not pleaded.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If I can just sum it up so that I make sure I understand what you said.  You are saying -- you are not asking us to convict Mr. Muhimana on any ground which is not stated in the indictment, even if -- where evidence of it came to you before the indictment was drafted.  We must assume that because you knew the evidence you did not wish to charge him with it.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you are not now asking us that you have changed your mind and you want him convicted of them.  Is that --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's the general statement.  It's qualified with regards to two or three people as regards rape.  It's qualified as regards to rape which we say we have provided post-indictment information which adequately informed the Defence.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But that is rapes about which you were not aware at the time the indictment was drafted.  Is that the case? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  That's the point.  Yes.  

Your Honour, murder as a crime against humanity is the unlawful killing in the context of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds.  That's the standard definition according to paragraph 589 of the Akayesu judgement.  Now, the key element of murder is the widespread or systematic nature of the attacks.  We have led evidence, Your Honours, from AT, BI, AU, BG, BH, W, BB, CC and AP to attest to the widespread or systematic nature of the attack.  Defence witnesses DI, DF, DY, DK, DL, DD and TQ8 acknowledge the presence of the attacks and the widespread and/or systematic nature.  The other key element for this crime and for which the Defence agrees is that the attacks should be directed against a civilian population.  We have led evidence to prove of killings in Gishyita town, Mubuga, Mugonero complex and Bisesero.  There is no suggestion, Your Honours, let alone proof, that those who were killed in these places were not civilians.  The other major element is that the murders should be committed on any one of the discriminatory grounds, and we have proved that the murders were committed on ethnic or political grounds.   

Now, in the light of what I said were the murders which now remain against the Accused person.  Our case in this regard shows that we are accusing Mr. Muhimana for the murder of 11 Tutsi civilians, 
	11 individuals, and the geographical distribution of these murders is as follows:  In Gishyita we say that he murdered Goretti and Languida on the 7th of April '94 and Esperance Mukagasana on the 14th of April.  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Goretti --  
MR. KAPAYA:
Goretti Mukashyka and Languida Kamukina, and Esperance Mukagasana on the 14th of April.  These are the murders which we say the Accused committed in Gishyita town.  

Then in Mubuga church --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat it? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honours.  I'll come to them, but they are Goretti Mukashyka, Languida Kamukina -- Mukashyaka is M-U-K-A-S-H-Y-A-K-A and Languida, L-A-N-G-U-I-D-A, Kamukina, K-A-M-U-K-I-N-A
	-- which relates to the murder of these people on the 7th of April, and Esperance Mukagasana, 
	M-U-K-A-G-A-S-A-N-A, on the 14th of April.  Then in Mubuga church we allege one murder, the murder of a person called Karera who was well known in Mubuga town.  We say that this murder took place on the 15th of April.  Then in Mugonero we say that the Accused person killed 
	Mukasine Kajongi; Mukabarore, Immaculée -- Mukabarore is M-U-K-A-B-A-R-O-R-E, Immaculée .
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mukabarore? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Mukabarore, M-U-K-A-B-A-R-O-R-E, Immaculée.  And then Mukangorero, Bernadette, 
	M-U-K-A-N-G-O-R-E-R-O, and Mukankwaro, Josephine, M-U-K-A-N-K-W-A-R-O, Josephine.  That's on the 16th of April.  
For Bisesero, Your Honours, we have three people:  Pascasie Mukaremera, M-U-K-A-R-E-M-E-R-A, and then Kankuyu, Felicité, K-A-N-K-U-Y-U.  And we say that these murders occurred on the 11th of May --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What was the second name?
MR. KAPAYA:
Felicité.  

-- in Bisesero.  And the controversial murder of Kabanda -- Assiel Kabanda, which we say happened on or about the 22nd of June '94.  

Your Honours, it's my submission that if you accept the testimony of any one of the witnesses whom we called in support of any one of the 11 murders, any one of the 11 murders, in Gishyita town, the Mubuga church, Mugonero complex or Bisesero, you have a duty to convict Muhimana of murder as a crime against humanity -- any one witness in relation to any one of the murders.  That is my humble submission, Your Honours.

Now, Your Honours, that is briefly the Prosecution's case in relation to the count of murder.  The Defence generally have raised an alibi.  They have said that he was at home in Gishyita during the time we say he was committing the murders in all these places -- in Gishyita town, in Mubuga church or Mugonero complex or Bisesero.  The Defence have told Your Honours that the Accused was at home.  And in relation to the murders which we say were committed in his house, he says that actually nobody has heard about them and that they simply didn't take place.  And --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Well, the Defence also says he was not there; he was not at those places where the murders occurred, without necessarily saying where he was. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that is what I say, Your Honour, that he raised an alibi, that he was not at the places where we say he was committing these crimes at the time and place --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, but his alibi is not conditioned upon his being at his house.  You see, some witnesses have said he was at the house or must have been mourning at his house, but other witnesses have just come and said, "I was there at Mubuga church; he was not there.  Everybody else was there but he was not there.  I don't say where he was but he was not at Mubuga church."
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that is their position, Your Honours.  And actually it's Witnesses DR, DL, DQ, DS, NTI, TQ1, TQ8, TQ13, NM6 and AH8 whose testimony we have analysed -- summarised and analysed in the brief attached to this position.  

Now, let me now proceed to consider the specific events, the specific murders in specific places.  We have Gishyita town.  As I said, Your Honours, it was Goretti Mukashyka and Languida Kamukina who we allege in paragraph 7(A) of the indictment that the Accused was responsible for his (sic) death.  

Now, we rely on the testimony of Prosecution Witness AP, whose evidence we summarise on 
	pages 146 to 148, paragraphs 12 to 22 of the brief.  Now, my colleague talked at length about the testimony of this witness.  But briefly, the witness said that in the morning of the 7th of April she left her residence in Gishyita and went to Bisesero where she took her cattle for safety, and she came back in the afternoon.  When she came back, she found that the authorities, Sikubwabo, along with the Accused, were looking for her.  She was arrested and put in jail.  Sometime in the evening, towards the evening, she was released, and after she was released, around seven, she saw the Accused -- she saw Muhimana come to the in-laws, to her in-laws.  Now, she lived close to where her in-laws lived and she lived close to where Muhimana lived.  So she saw Muhimana in the evening going to this place, and she saw him come out of the house with Goretti and Languida.  
	Your Honours, the witness testified that she was -- actually, she was not surprised for the Accused person to take these two girls.  Why?  Because she knows that her father-in-law and Muhimana had exchanged cows before, previously.  Now, according to Rwandan culture, when you exchange cows this is a very, very significant act.  It shows respect, it shows friendship, and, above all, it shows trust.  And this is something that Witness KNN1 testified to in Rutaganira two days back when in the sentencing they said, if you exchange cattle with somebody, he just becomes your relative.  So it was not -- considering the security situation that was prevailing on the 7th, AP was not surprised to see that, to see Muhimana go to her father-in-law and take these two girls, hoping that he was taking them for security.  So because she also had two children born of a Tutsi father, she had children whose father was Tutsi, her children were also at risk, so she sort of followed Mr. Muhimana to his residence; she trailed behind him to where he was taking these girls.  They ended up in his residence.  She testified that Muhimana's residence was well lit.  Muhimana was a conseiller so he had electricity at his house.  And she saw him enter this house with the two girls.  Two hours later, as my colleague had submitted to you, she saw the two girls come out staggering, walking in a very awkward manner.  She suspected something was very much amiss.  No sooner had she seen this than she saw an Interahamwe killing one of the girls, and Muhimana was present.  She was scared and she ran away; she went back -- she went to Bisesero.  This, Your Honour, is the basis for charging Muhimana with the murder of these two girls.  Now, the evidence of --
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Although she witnessed the killing of one girl? 

MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  Subsequent to that, she has never seen -- she's a person who ordinarily would have seen these two girls in the course of her life, and she has not seen them both.  And so because the last time she saw them they were in Muhimana's residence, so the presumption is that they were killed in the course of that same transaction on that day.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you say she saw somebody else kill them, or did she say she saw Muhimana kill them?
MR. KAPAYA:
No.  She said she saw an Interahamwe in the presence --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In the presence --
MR. KAPAYA:
-- of Muhimana.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So Muhimana is in this case being charged for conspiring or participating --
MR. KAPAYA:
Participating in the -- his mere -- his presence as a conseiller, he was supposed to have done something and didn't do it.  

Now, Your Honours, the Defence claims two things in respect of these killings.  The first witnesses, TQ13, TQ14, NT1 and DL, the testimony is that they never heard of any rapes or killings in that vicinity in this time on this particular day.  So if somebody says, like AP, that people were killed or raped, according to them it couldn't be right.  The second defence they advance is that the victims were not properly identified.  Now, the question of -- in the same breath, they say yes, there was Goretti and then there was Languida, but these were not the Goretti or Languida you are talking about.  You are talking about Languida or Goretti who were students and who were on leave at that particular occasion.  Now, the Goretti and Languida we know, one of them left Gishyita town way back in '85; the other one was married and actually was killed in Mubuga church.  Now, at least there is consensus, there is agreement that Goretti and Languida existed; the identity of these victims has been established.  The issue left, Your Honours, is that -- is whether you believe the Prosecution case that the Languida and Goretti are those who were resident in AP's residence and that Muhimana took them and killed them subsequently, or that the Languida and Goretti are the ones which the Defence are talking about, that they are elderly people who were married and who died somewhere else.  In our respectful submission, Your Honour --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you said that the Accused killed them, the two girls, Goretti and -

MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, was responsible for their killing, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He was responsible for --
MR. KAPAYA:    
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But he did not kill them?
MR. KAPAYA:
Well, he killed them, Your Honour, because he was responsible.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I think you are saying, Mr. Kapaya, unless I misunderstood you, that somebody else killed them in his presence when he was -- must be taken to have participated.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, sir.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They killed one of them; the other one vanished.  That is, a killing is not witnessed by anybody else but she can't possibly be alive because all the people who would know if she was alive say that she -- she's not there, she was taken away, and we are making a presumption that she was taken away to her death.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that is what we are submitting, Your Honours.  So we have analysed the Defence case, 
Your Honours, and, as you see, it has so many contradictions and inconsistencies to such an extent that we requested -- that my colleague Ms. Madenga asked you yesterday to dismiss it.  And on the basis of the evidence of AP, I submit that Muhimana was responsible for the murder of these two girls and should be convicted accordingly on that count.  

There was also the murder of Esperance Mukagasana which we allege in paragraph 7(A)(i) of the indictment.  Your Honour, you will note that there were minor variations in the evidence we led and the factual allegations.  We allege in the indictment that Mr. Muhimana directed somebody to kill this lady.  We think that that is not the position; the evidence has shown otherwise.  And my submissions are that in this regard that this violation is minor, and that the witness who supports this particular allegation, Witness AQ, was effectively cross-examined by the Defence, and if prejudice there was, then it was completely removed.  The Defence and the Accused person knew exactly what he was meeting; namely, that we are charging him with the responsibility of the murder of Esperance.  And actually, in respect of this murder, he raised a defence.  He said that he was not there.  So my submission is that the Accused was not prejudiced.  He knew exactly what we were saying and actually offered an alternative explanation for the disappearance of Esperance.  So it cannot be said that Mr. Muhimana was prejudiced by alleging that somebody else killed her; whereas, he was actually responsible for the murder.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, how could you say that this defect in the indictment is minor?
MR. KAPAYA:
You are saying, Your Honour --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) ... where in the indictment under para 7(A)(i) is minor?  It's totally something different.
JUDGE SHORT:
What was the variance between the testimony of the witness and the allegation made in the indictment?  Could you tell us?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
And then we will be able to know whether it was a serious diversion or inconsistency.  Will you just remind us what the evidence was? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  7(A)(i) reads as follows, Your Honour: "On or around the 14th of April '94 in Gishyita town, Gishyita secteur, Gishyita commune, at his residence, Mika Muhimana directed an Interahamwe named Gisambo to kill a civilian woman, Esperance Mukagasana.  The said Gisambo executed the said woman in the presence of Mikaeli Muhimana at his residence."  That is the variation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the evidence?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the evidence? 
MR. KAPAYA:
The evidence is that on this particular day, Muhimana, in the company of Sikubwabo and other assailants, left with Esperance sometime in the afternoon.  In the evening, Muhimana came back.  He came back alone; he didn't come back with Esperance.  The presumption, Your Honour, is that Muhimana killed this lady.  That is the evidence that we led from AQ.  And this actually was following other offences like rapes.  She was raped repeatedly, and then on this particular day is when Muhimana left with her, and then he came back alone; never came back with her.  So she has never been seen by --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where did she say that Esperance -- that the Accused left the house with Esperance? 

MR. KAPAYA:
It's in the evidence, Your Honour.  That's the evidence, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you are saying now, Mr. Kapaya --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are saying now that the charge ought to be in 7(A)(i) that Mr. Mikaeli Muhimana, in the presence of or in the company of Sikubwabo and others, went away with Esperance Mukagasana, who not having been heard of again is believed to have been killed?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that is the evidence we led, Your Honour.  So on the basis of that, we request --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On the basis of that, you ask for a conviction of murder? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  That is our submission.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Kapaya? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That proposition perplexes me.  Suppose Mr. Mikaeli Muhimana took this girl across to the Congo to save her from the possible killing, and that she's gotten herself married to some Congolese soldier and she is still there now tending cows and goats?  Is that not a possibility?  Can that be excluded? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, there is a grossly remote possibility.  Because, as we say, AP knew this lady, AQ is her sister, her relative, so these ought to have known.  So at least the Accused could have told them -- we are not talking about possibilities.  The Accused could have told them, "Oh, I have taken her across to Ijwe island, so she is safe there.  There is no problem."  But no such evidence has come either from the Prosecution nor have the Defence alluded to that.  So we take the legal presumption, 
Your Honour, that she was last seen in the company of the Accused, he came back alone, so --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But she was last seen in the company, according to the evidence now, of the Accused, Sikubwabo and another person.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They all vanished together.  You haven't charged Muhimana with the murder of either Sikubwabo or the other person, right?  So they all vanished; only that when Muhimana returned, he didn't return with her.  And that, in your judgement now, makes it possible for us to say we have excluded all other possibilities and the only probable possibility is that Muhimana killed this Esperance.  Does your circumstantial evidence lead us to that? 
MR. KAPAYA:
But, actually, there is some evidence from the Defence witnesses who were called to rebut this particular allegation.  They told Your Honours, you heard them here say, that it is true that Esperance was abducted; it is true that Ruzindana and the Interahamwe took her away, you see, but the Accused was not there.  This is what -- that is what they are saying.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But none of taking her away becomes murder.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, under those circumstances -- I think it is the most reasonable -- the reasonable inference under the circumstances -- even the Defence are implying that she was killed by these people but not the Accused.  So -- but our case, Your Honour, is that she left with the Accused; therefore, he's responsible for her disappearance and subsequent --
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, isn't it possible that Sikubwabo killed -- if this woman were killed, isn't it a possibility that Sikubwabo killed her rather than Muhimana?  I mean what is your evidence to support your version that it was Muhimana who killed her and not Sikubwabo and the other person with whom they left?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Or that it must be assumed that it is Muhimana?  What is your evidence that it must be assumed that it is Muhimana and not anybody else that killed her, if she got killed?
JUDGE SHORT:
You cannot raise it beyond the level of speculation, can you?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, it must be assumed it was Muhimana because Muhimana was related to her.  Muhimana was staying in her residence; she was under his care and protection.  Muhimana raped her on several occasions in the presence -- in the house.  Muhimana -- she was a Tutsi; the witness was a Tutsi.  Muhimana would naturally be interested to see that this lady disappears.  The pattern of conduct in this case, the evidence has shown, that women were first raped and then killed; they were raped and then killed.  There are only a few survivors who we are left with.  On that particular day, Muhimana left with these people in a truck to an unknown destination.  The Defence says that Muhimana didn't leave, but it is these people who went with her and didn't bring her back; therefore, Muhimana shouldn't be held responsible.  But on the reasons I have stated, Your Honour, is that Muhimana is the one who is answerable for the disappearance of this lady.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, how would you term the variation in the indictment under para 7(A)(i) as minor, whereas it is said that she was killed at his residence, whereas the evidence led on this charge is that she was taken away by Muhimana and his accomplices?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, what I'm saying is that the Defence have had adequate notice of what exactly we are saying about the killing of Esperance.  They have adequate notice in the -- we have stated in our 
pre-trial brief, it is contained in the witness statement, and -- it's contained in the witness grilling - the corrigendum that was served on the Defence.  So she -- the Defence had adequate notice.
(Pages 1 to 18 by Leslie Todd)



























	1200H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is in the corrigendum?
MR. KAPAYA:
What did you say? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What did you say?
MR. KAPAYA:
It's contained in the summary of the witnesses, the pre-trial brief.  Basically, it's contained in the 
pre-trial brief.  He had notice through that.  And that is why he said that, actually, it is not him who abducted this lady but it was Ruzindana and the others.  He knew what was facing him, so he was not prejudiced.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Now, I wish also to bring to your attention that the Defence had consistently said that Muhimana never had any meetings at that place and that he was always in his house, and that no attackers and whatever came at his place.  

Now, Witness AQ had testified to meetings that the Accused regularly held at his residence, and on that particular day, on the day Esperance was abducted, we say that the Accused held security meetings.  He denied this but then, if you look in the Defence brief, on paragraph 75 of the Defence brief, we have Witness DN, who is cited there by the Defence, and there is a long explanation there which supports our theory, our allegation, that the Accused actually held meetings, contrary to what the Defence had said in the theory of their case.  And, apparently, the Defence could have put this -- forgetting that they had said that the Accused never held any meetings.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are convicting him on an own-goal? 
MR. KAPAYA:
A what, Your Honour?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
An own-goal.  He has scored in his own court.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  It is like a penalty, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which Defence witness? 

MR. KAPAYA:
It is DN, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
DN? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, DN, Defence witness.  There is a quotation there which reads in part, the last paragraph, page 16 of the Defence brief, paragraph 75.  Page 16, there is a paragraph which reads, "And during meetings, in order to ensure their security, Mika used to reassure those who were hiding these people and those who were feeding them.  He's the one who did that.  Otherwise, without the intervention of Mika," and so on.  DN acknowledges that the Accused held security meetings.
JUDGE SHORT:
And so if he held security meetings, then what?  What follows from that? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Two things, Your Honours:  one, that the theory of the Defence is that the Accused never held meetings at all.  AK testified to meetings on the -- preceding the abduction of Esperance.  The Defence said no such thing existed.  Suddenly, we have here evidence which says, oh, actually, the meetings were held.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We have evidence or we have a statement? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, we have a statement --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They are statements, not evidence.
MR. KAPAYA:
-- that meetings were held there.  So -- and we are saying that this was a time when the security -- we wish to consider it in the general context of the insecurity that was taking place.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So your strategy is that these meetings were not for the security purposes but for the -- to conspire --
MR. KAPAYA:
These meetings where -- when we talk of security at that time, it had to do with the killing of -- plans with -- plans of killing, eliminating Tutsi.  So I'm not going to go to the extent of saying they planned it at this meeting, they planned the abduction of Esperance.  I leave that for Your Honours.  But what we are saying is that they were accorded what the Defence had denied.  There were meetings held by the Accused at least to sort of plan the day-to-day activities in his commune.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And the evidence of those meetings in the brief is which paragraph? 

MR. KAPAYA:
Which brief, Your Honour? 
MR. MUTHOGA:
The Defence brief.
MR. KAPAYA:
It's in paragraph -- it's on page 16, paragraph 75.  Paragraph 75.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which says Witness DN stated that Mika Muhimana used to hide several Tutsis in various locations.  Is that the one? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's the one.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Then there's a quotation.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it is that quotation.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you are saying that is an admission by the Defence that there were meetings.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How so?
JUDGE SHORT:
Meetings for what purpose? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Security meetings.
JUDGE SHORT:
Is that what the Defence witness said?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's what he said, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But he never said these meetings were held in his house. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  We didn't say that the meetings were necessarily held in his house.  The one AQ is talking about, he's talking about a meeting that was held in the compound to his house.
JUDGE SHORT:
What paragraph are you referring to? 

MR. KAPAYA:
Which one now, Your Honour? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Page 17 of the Defence brief. 
MR. KAPAYA:
It's page 16, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Sixteen. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, page 16.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That quotation is what you are saying is the admission by the Defence of there being meetings? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How do you come to that? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Meetings where? 
MR. KAPAYA:
If you read --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Meetings -- no special place?  No special places?
MR. KAPAYA:
The last -- the sentence in the quotation, the sentence that begins with "and" in Paragraph 75, there's a quotation.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
"And during meetings in order to solve their security, Mika used to reassure those who were hiding those people and those who were feeding them.  He is the one who did that.  Otherwise, without the intervention of Mika, those who were hiding the people would have been killed themselves."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The location of the meeting has not been identified.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It didn't say anything about the location of the meeting.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, Muhimana was a conseiller and anywhere -- he was a conseiller, his area consisted of eight secteurs, so it was legitimate for him to hold any of these meetings to address these particular categories of people.  We are not saying that the meetings were necessarily held in his residence, but this particular one as regards the testimony of AQ, she said that it was held in -- within the vicinity of his house.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you are trying to say that he used to hold meetings --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- during the time of war.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  And that on that particular day, immediately preceding the abduction of this lady, there were meetings at his residence.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, the difference between your evidence and the evidence of this witness, is the purpose of the meetings.  The Defence witness is saying that Mika held meetings to protect certain people; otherwise, they would have been killed.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May Honourable Judge Short speak closer into his microphone?  Thank you.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, they said that the Accused person -- particularly NT1, he said the Accused person never held any meetings because it was so insecure; they couldn't do any of those things.  He was holed up in his residence all the time.  He was very scared.
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, but they were responding to your allegation that Mika held meetings about the security 
	situation --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
-- in the area.  But what this witness is talking about is that Mika held some meetings to ensure the safety of people he wanted to protect.  These are two completely different matters, isn't it? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I thought they related to security meetings because what we allege is that Muhimana as conseiller had a duty to hold security meetings.
JUDGE SHORT:
But this is not a security meeting in the sense in which you intended.  Here, the witness is saying that Mika wanted to protect certain people and therefore he held meetings to ensure that they were secure, they were protected.  But these were not meetings in his official capacity as conseiller relating to security in the general area.  They are two different types of meetings that we are talking about, isn't it? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, but --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, what I understand you are trying to say is that this statement nullified the stance of the Defence that Mika did not have any meeting during the war.  Is that correct? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, that was my submission, that the meetings were -- relates to two levels:  firstly, his blanket no that he never held any meetings during that period, which is what the Defence theory was.  So this negates that.  

Now, there was this second level of meeting, security meeting, in this particular location.  Your Honours have a different interpretation.  I have submitted my own view of the interpretation of section -- paragraph 75 of the Defence brief.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  So to -- as far as Esperance, Your Honour, it is my contention that AP -- AQ is the witness we relied on to prove that Mika participated in the killing of this lady.  

Mubuga church, we charge the Accused with the killing of one person, Kayihura.  This is in 7(B), Paragraph 7(B) of the indictment.  It is common ground -- that is common between us and the Defence -- that a week preceding 15th April two civilians were fleeing from different parts of Gishyita -- of Mubuga secteur and beyond, congregated in the church for their security.  It's agreed -- it's common ground also that soldiers were stationed at the area to guard the place.  It's also common ground, Your Honours, that on the 15th of April '94, the Tutsi who were -- had congregated in Mubuga church seeking refuge were attacked and they were killed.  And many were wounded.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, this charge is contained in which part of the indictment? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Paragraph 7(B).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. KAPAYA:
Seven (B) of the indictment, Your Honours.  
So the Defence also do not dispute that government officials, including Sikubwabo and Rutaganira, Kayishema, took part in the attack at the church on the 15th of April.  They start disputing when we say that one of the people killed was Kayihura.  They led a witness to say that he knew the place and that there was nobody by the name of Kayihura.  That was -- that was his testimony.  But we have AV, the Prosecution witness AV and AF, we rely in proof of this.  My colleagues discussed their testimony yesterday.  But briefly, they show clearly that Kayihura was a person who was known particularly to AV.  AV, who lived in the area, used to work in that location sometime, and knew the person by the name AV, and he places his death to almost the immediate action of the Accused, when the Accused placed the grenade -- when the Accused threw a grenade in that particular place.  It was the act of throwing that grenade that shattered the head of Kayihura.  

This is what this particular witness said, and I submit, Your Honours, that this witness is credible; she is educated and she knew what she was saying.  And, Your Honour, the Defence called about nine witnesses, and as pointed out yesterday, you can't really know what the theory of their case was because one of them said the Accused was there.  The other eight said the Accused was not there.  So they don't seem -- they seem to be stepping into each other's -- one another's toes.  

So briefly, Your Honour, the testimony of the Defence witnesses as discussed by my colleagues and as delineated in our brief is not credible.  So we are left with the testimony of AV and AF to prove the participation of Muhimana in the murder of Kayihura.
JUDGE SHORT:
What if we reject the testimony of the Defence witness who says that Mika was there and we are left with the testimony of the witnesses who said Mika was not there; in other words, the alibi defence? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
What's your comment on the alibi defence?  Do you have any comments on the Accused's defence of alibi? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I believe Mr. Phillips went at length on the nine alibi -- ten alibi witnesses who testified about the presence of the Accused at Mubuga church.  And I don't know whether I should go through it again instead of in the brief.
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, if you are sure that Mr. Phillips has dealt with it exhaustively, then it's okay, but I'm not sure that --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you are summarising it by merely saying, "These witnesses had no reason to find or to identify Muhimana, there were far too many people present all the time.  There is nothing in what they -- in there being there that would have necessarily ruled the presence or absence of Muhimana.  They had no basis to know he wasn't there."  Is that not the summary of --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's part of the summary of the conclusion.  The other one is that some were placed so far away.  One of them, for instance, I think it was D -- DI -- or ARI, who was standing far off, across the road, and he said he was also participating there.  He had no reason to know whether or not Muhimana was there.  And we have another one who said the attackers numbered about 3,000 or 4,000.  And there is no evidence that he was on the lookout for this particular man called Muhimana.  So he couldn't have known -- he couldn't have necessarily seen Muhimana unless he tells us that he was particularly looking for him.
JUDGE SHORT:
According to the Defence, where was Muhimana on this particular day? 
MR. KAPAYA:
He was at home.
JUDGE SHORT:
He was at home.
MR. KAPAYA:
He was mourning his child.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
There is no evidence -- I'm not aware of evidence which specifically gives a time limit Mr. Muhimana was generally and always at home.  There's nothing specific that on this day, at this time, he was at home or he was just not there.  And on the other occasion, he was -- there's one witness who saw him every time at his home.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
AQ1. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What I'm getting at is the Court has to consider the alibi of the Defence, whether it is credible or not.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay?  Now, if the alibi of the Defence is that, "I was at home and I could not have been at Mubuga church," you know, what is your comment on that alibi? 
MR. KAPAYA:
My comment, Your Honour, is that he had actually called a witness TK1 to say he was at home.  Now, the testimony of this witness is not watertight.  It doesn't give an account of, you know -- of Muhimana's presence at his residence every day from the 8th, 9th, 10th, to the 16th.  And actually, there are other witnesses who said on the 8th, for instance, he left his home to go to attend to a funeral somewhere else.  So the testimony of that witness is not reliable. 

There was also the testimony, I think, of a witness who said he spent the whole day with him.  When it came to cross-examination, it turned out that the witness had actually left some place and he was with him for just a few days.  We have analysed this evidence in the brief, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you are also relying on the evidence of DC, who said that Mika Muhimana was present at Mubuga church. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's what I started by saying.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But that was on 14th of April, whereas the killing of Muhirwa took place on 15th of April.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, but the general defence was that the guy never went there at all.  He was at home 8th to 16th, but at the same time they bring witnesses to say, "Well, he might as well not have been at home."  And they don't impeach this witness.  If they had taken steps, as my learned colleague said yesterday, to impeach DC, then I would have said, oh, well, I think there was something wrong.  But they leave you with two versions of the alibi.  One says the Accused was at Mubuga; the other says he was not there.  They throw it in your eyes, in your face, and say, okay, you pick one which you prefer.  We say, it is our theory of the case that -- that's the evidence we urge Your Honours to prefer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay. Proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, in Paragraph 7(C) of the indictment, we charge Muhimana with the murder of Mukasine Kajongi.  Now, again, the general defence is that Muhimana didn't go there.  But we have Prosecution witnesses BG, BI and BH to show that Muhimana was at Mugonero complex on that particular day.  We also have the testimony of Prosecution witness AT who we rely for the murder of Mukasine. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Para 7(C) mentions Mukasine but not Kajongi.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, but that's expanded in the testimony of AT, Your Honour.  We rely on AT to prove this particular factual allegation in the indictment.  So the Mukasine we are talking about here is the Mukasine which AT is talking about. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is not the same Mukasine Kajongi.  It's the same name, Mukasine and Mukasine Kajongi. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  The Mukasine Kajongi AT is talking about is the daughter of the accountant Kajongi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This 7(C) is not the same Mukasine Kajongi?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, it's Mukasine Kajongi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is the same person? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's the person we are talking about in 7(C).  And this is the witness -- the victim who Prosecution witness AT testified to. 

Your Honours, I don't need to go again into the common things that are agreed between the Prosecution and the Defence that hundreds of Tutsi gathered at Mugonero on the 16th between a week preceding that day and that they were attacked on the 16th in the morning, the attackers included government official, Kayishema, Sikubwabo, Rutaganira, the managers of the complex like Ntakirutimana, father and son.  And we also allege that the Accused was present and, as we say, the Defence have said that he was not there. 

Now, AT, as you may recall, Your Honours, is one of the survivors of the complex, of the attack at the Mugonero complex.  He said that he sought refuge there two or three days before and that on the 16th -- he described his movement, his movements, and he finally ended up in the basement, in room number 3 of the basement, where subsequently Mukasine Kajongi came in.  Thereafter, the Accused, in the company of two Interahamwe came in.  They raped this girl and then subsequently killed her. Now --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There's no specific allegation against the Accused that he killed Mukasine in the statement of AT.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the Accused said that she should be killed because she was an Inyenzi, that "We shouldn't leave an Inyenzi alive."  So she told the people -- he told the people he was with that this lady should be killed. And there was some discussion as to the exact location of where this place took -- the killing took place.  
Tony Lucassen, you will recall, Your Honour, was an investigator in this case, and he told you that prior to the commencement of trial, he had taken AT -- AT had taken him to the Mugonero complex and shown him where exactly the affairs of Mukasine took place, and these are reflected in Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, the exhibits bundle on pages 286219 and 286165.  They show exactly where -- actually, it's a sketch plan which sort of explains the exact location where AT saw Mukasine being raped and then killed.  So the testimony of AT in a way is corroborated by this exhibit, by this document.  This document was produced a long time before trial. 

So on the basis of this witness, Your Honours, we submit that it's credible and that AT had known the Accused and Mukasine well before that day and the conditions of identification were favourable -- the offence occurred during the day -- and the witness explained exactly what happened.  So on the basis of AT, I submit that his evidence is credible and the Accused should be convicted for the murder of this lady. 

Still at Mugonero, we allege at 7(C)(i) that he killed Mukasine, Immaculée, Mukangorero, Bernadette and Mukankwaro, Josephine, the same day.  In proof of this we called Witness AU.  She is also a victim and survivor of the 16th of April Mugonero attack.  She described to you -- my colleague Madenga explained to you how AU took refuge, sought refuge in that location and then was subsequently raped and then -- in the presence of these ladies, and that these ladies were subsequently killed at the orders or instigation of the Accused person, Mika Muhimana. 

In paragraph 305 of the Defence brief, they claim that the location of the murders was not determined.  And as we say, AU clearly testified on this matter and she was extensively cross-examined.  

And they also claim, as we said earlier on, that the Accused did not visit Mugonero complex on that day.  They called witnesses DI, AH, AR1 -- DI, AH7, AR1, TQ28 and TQ7 to prove this.  Again, Your Honours, the testimony of these Defence witnesses is analysed on pages -- page 53, paragraph 224 to 232, page 160 to 164, paragraph 87 to 110 of the closing brief.  And for the reasons we state in those paragraphs, we say that Your Honours should not rely on the testimony of these witnesses. 

AH had made a further claim that Prosecution witness AT had told him somewhere, sometime, that actually he didn't take refuge at Mugonero hospital on the 16th of April, that AT was somewhere hidden in Bisesero for some time and then fled to Ijwe.   

Your Honour, AT was cross-examined extensively on this issue, and actually, if you look at testimony -- at AT generally, you will find that he has made three statements -- two statements, and in all those statements, he says clearly that on the 16th of April, he sought refuge at Mugonero complex.  
Further, we request Your Honours to take into account the findings in the Ntakirutimana appeal that -- that is paragraphs 236 to 263, then 286, 358 and 423, where, at the end of the day, the Appeals Chamber confirmed the findings of the Trial Chamber regarding the credibility of the Prosecution witness AT, who testifies as Prosecution GG in the Ntakirutimana case.  

We are not asking Your Honours to say that because he was found credible in that case, therefore, he should also be found credible in this case.  We are arguing, Your Honours, to take that into account, take what the two -- the two Chambers, the Trial Chamber and the Appeals Chamber have made concurrent findings of credibility on a particular witness.  We request Your Honours to take that into account when assessing the credibility.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And in the Ntakirutimana case, AT --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- testified to similar facts? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Similar facts.  The issue was whether it was at Mugonero.  The Defence had said in Ntakirutimana that he may not have been there.  The issue was whether he could read or write.  They found that he couldn't read or write.  Of course, the issue of whether he was married to BJ or not didn't arise there.  This was a separate consideration.  But in almost ten or so factual findings which the Trial Chamber made, these were confirmed on appeal.  And we think this is an important consideration in assessing the credibility of AT.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of Mika was mentioned in that testimony? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  Actually, we referred to this in cross-examination that among the attackers, Mika was there. 

As regards the murders of Mukabarore, Mukangorero and Mukankwaro, as we said, Your Honour, we have the testimony of AU which we submit is credible, and on the basis of that testimony, we request you find Muhimana guilty of the murders of these three ladies. 

As regards Bisesero, I intimated earlier on, Your Honours, we allege three murders:  One -- and that is in paragraph 7(D)(i), this pertains to the murder of Pascasie Mukaema; 7(D)(ii), the murder of Felicité Kankuyu; and 7(D)(iii), the murder of Assiel Kabanda.  

April, May, June, Your Honour, hundreds of Tutsi sought refuge in the Bisesero hills.  The Defence do not dispute this.  And that there were almost attacks on a daily basis on Tutsi seeking refuge in the hills, according to Prosecution witnesses.  

The Defence also agreed that Tutsi seeking refuge in those areas were attacked almost on a daily basis.  

It has been proved also -- it's admitted also, Your Honours, that the attackers who took part in the attacks in Bisesero comprised of Interahamwe soldiers, including government officials, Kayishema, Ruzindana, Rutaganira, and others.  The issue becomes -- the issue the Defence raise is whether -- that the Accused was not there.

Now, before I come to that, I wish to mention briefly the evidence we rely on the murder of these three people.  

As regards Pascasie Mukarema , we rely on the testimony of Prosecution witness AW.   It is summarised on pages 117 to 119 and analysed on page 173, paragraph 147, and page 174, paragraph 153 of the closing brief. 

Now, in paragraph 318 to 319 of the Defence closing brief, it is claimed, rightly, that there is a variation again between the allegation in the indictment and the evidence in relation to the allegation that -- the Accused instructed any Interahamwe assembled to kill Pascasie Mukarema.  The evidence of AW does not point to that.  Actually, the evidence of AW suggests that the Accused disembowelled this lady.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How would you justify this testimony vis-à-vis the charge in the indictment? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, again, we say that the Defence knew exactly what was meeting them.  They were not prejudiced.  Actually, if you read paragraph 319 of their -- 321 of their brief, they say that we are attributing to the Accused an impossible medical operation, that the Accused was merely -- had barely been to school and he could not have been expected to perform such a complicated operation whereby he opened this lady's abdomen and took out the child, alive.  That is what the Defence are saying.  So they knew exactly what is meeting them.  So they were not prejudiced Your Honour, at this part by the variation. 

This other variation that we talk about is as regards the location.  In the indictment we say it was Nyakiyabo hill, whereas the evidence we led shows it was Rubona.  Again, post-indictment information has cured this apparent defect.  

There was the testimony of Lucassen, who told Your Honours that AW had actually taken Lucassen to the location and shown him where Rubona hill was.  He also showed him where Rutoga (phonetic) hill was.  And we disclosed this exhibit well in time before trial started, and the Defence were not prejudiced by that. 

They also had the occasion to cross-examine AW quite extensively on this particular allegation, this particular variation.  

So we submit, Your Honours, that Mr. Muhimana was not prejudiced by these two variations, in particular, when you consider that Nyakiyabo and Rubona are both hills within -- at close range of Bisesero hills. 

So, Your Honours, the testimony of AW is to the effect that towards the end of May, he was -- he's raised there.  He knows the place very well.  AW knows the place.  He was hiding alone -- actually, he was spending the days in the hills and then, at night, would go back home.  So one of these days in May, while hiding in the hills, he saw the Accused.  He had known him before that day, seen him in Gishyita and several other places.  They were scouring the bushes.  They were looking for Tutsi.  And then in the course of this exercise, they came across this lady who was advanced in pregnancy.  So they surprised her, and the Accused personally, according to AW, disembowelled this lady to take out the fetus. 

Your Honour, the witness was at very close -- was at close range.  The incident happened during the day and he knew both Pascasie Mukarema and the Accused, so the question of misidentification cannot arise.  You heard this witness, Your Honours.  He was intensively -- intensely and extensively cross-examined and he couldn't yield.  And this is a matter which is even alleged in his witness statement.  It was nothing new.  So the Defence were well aware about this particular incident. 

In -- again, as I intimated, Your Honours, the Defence claim that the act or the manner of killing this particular lady was simply incredible because the Accused is not trained in the medical profession so he couldn't have been expected to perform such an excellent surgery in the bush, using a machete. 

I think by so stating, Your Honour, I submit that the Defence are deliberately missing the point.  Because the issue was that here was a pregnant Tutsi woman.  The issue was that they had to take out the fetus.  It was in the process of killing Tutsi people.  So what the Accused achieved here -

MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is also evidence that the baby was alive.  She cried for some -- the baby cried for some time and then she died.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, by sheer luck, Your Honour.  So the Accused took -- accomplished two things:  one, he managed to kill the lady and kill this fetus, this human being.  It was part and parcel of the policy at that time that Tutsi should be killed. 

That the act of killing this person was not unimaginable is also -- we can draw an analogy from the testimony of DT.  You may recall, Your Honours, that the Defence called here a cannibal, somebody who participated in the eating of a raw heart.  So the way the heart of this person called Ntoroni was taken out, it was through the same process which the Accused used; it was a machete.  The Accused used a machete to draw out the fetus out of this lady and killed the mother in the process.  

DT and company used a machete to draw out the heart of Ntoroni and ate it raw.  So, during the genocide, these unimaginable things, these almost incomprehensible murders, were taking place in Rwanda.  So it's not true that, as the Defence claim, that the Accused could not have performed that kind of act because it was almost an impossible thing to do. 

7(D)(ii), we talk about the murder of Felicité Kankuyu.  This is again the evidence of AW and it is summarised on pages 166 to 167, paragraphs 120 to 122, and analysed on page 173, para 47.  We rely on AW that, actually, the discovery of Kankuyu happened a few hours after Mukarema was discovered by the same witness, AW.  

Again, Lucassen had gone with AW and showed him the location of this murder.  Felicité was known in the area.  She was a teacher.  She was married, respectfully married at that, with children.  We have the evidence that AW was very close when Kankuyu was discovered.  The Accused participated in her rape, Sikubwabo and several others.  It was a gang rape.  And subsequently, again, the Accused said they couldn't leave any Inyenzi alive.  So it was the same consistent pattern of the killings was taking place, from the Accused's residence to the hills now.

So, Your Honour, on the basis of AW, I submit that paragraph 7(D)(ii) regarding the killing of Felicité Kankuyu has been proven. 

Finally, in 7(D)(iii), we have said that the Accused was responsible for the murder of Assiel Kabanda.  Assiel Kabanda was a very, very prominent businessman in Gishyita.  He lived close to the Accused and because of his influence, it was probably feared that he might interfere perhaps with the policy of the genocide that was taking place.  

We have the evidence of Prosecution witness W, who told us -- who told Your Honours that Muhimana had actually said that if anyone killed Kabanda, then he would reward him. 

Now, again, the Defence say that Muhimana never touched Bisesero during April, May, June.  We rely on W, BE, BF, BB, AX and H as proof that Assiel Kabanda was discovered by attackers in Bisesero area and those attackers included the Accused.  These witnesses told Your Honours that they killed this man and chopped off his head and carried it to Gishyita town.  

Another batch of witnesses, BF and AX, these were on the receiving end.  They were in Gishyita town.  They told you that they saw Muhimana enter Gishyita centre with this head, in the company of Interahamwe, and proclaiming -- among the people who heard proclaiming, "We have brought Kabanda to come and buy coffee."  People came out.  Alas, it was not Kabanda, it was just his head.  And they testified that one of the Interahamwe had wrapped this head in a small polythene bag.  The Accused took it out and went and stuck on the window of his house.  That's the evidence that we heard.  

We also have evidence from these very witnesses that subsequently, in particular, BF, he went to the Accused person and asked him for permission to take the head off the window and bury it. 

Now, the Defence do not dispute the killing of Kabanda.  They also do not dispute that his head was taken to Gishyita.  Further, they do not dispute that actually, in Gishyita, that head was hung on Kabanda's window. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On which window? 
MR. KAPAYA:
The window of his house.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Of Kabanda's house? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  Defence witnesses DI, DJ and NTI testified to this. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, the Prosecution witnesses' evidence about how Kabanda was killed, was there total uniformity on -- in the evidence? 
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour, there wasn't.  That is why --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You haven't commented on that.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I was going to it, Your Honour.  I was going to it.
JUDGE SHORT:
All right.  Now, Witness AF, BE, and BH.  Witness AF, in his trial, testified that Sikubwabo was responsible for the shooting of Kabanda.  Witness BE and AT testified that it was the Accused who personally shot at Kabanda.  Witness AF is also PP in the Kayishema, Ruzindana case.  There he testified to the same thing, paragraph 429 of the judgement, that it was Sikubwabo who shot at Kabanda.  
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, we saw these apparent contradictions in the testimony of BB, AT and AF.  But I think there is -- we submit that there is a thread that connects the testimony of these three witnesses.  They are all at one when they say that when Kabanda was killed, the Accused was there.  Who pulled the trigger is a little bit problematic, and it's understood, because Muhimana or Sikubwabo were not alone.  They are moving in a group.  The evidence is that they came in a car.  They disembarked, then walked up the hills, as usual, scouring for Tutsi.  And then this man was spotted.  

Now, according to AF, it was Sikubwabo who shot -- who fired the fatal shot.  According to BB and AT, it was the Accused person.  BE and BH are not sure.  They just saw the guy fall, but amongst the attackers there was Muhimana.  And that is why, Your Honours, even in the indictment, we don't say that Muhimana shot at this person.  We say he participated in the killing.  He was present during the -- he had consistently and persistently been looking for this man.  It just shows his intention to kill Kabanda.  We have the testimony of Witness W, who said that Muhimana had offered a reward for him. 

We have then BF and AX at the receiving end now.  They see this man with the head of this person, with the head of Kabanda.  He personally goes and sticks it on the window of Kabanda.  

Your Honour, it's our submission that these are contradictions as to who particularly shot Kabanda.  These are contradictions which have to do with the sightings.  You know, here people were in flight.  They were in flight; they were much more concerned with their personal survival, their personal existence.  So the impression I get is that they would be running away and then they would be looking back to see what was happening, or suddenly they would see one of them fall down.  They noticed, oh, this is Kabanda; oh, so-and-so has fallen down.  But the central issue is that Muhimana was amongst these attackers in Bisesero on the day Kabanda was killed.  

And we may also wish to draw your attention to the fact there were concurrent findings.  Again, I'm not very comfortable with this, but concurrent findings in the Niyitegeka, in Kayishema and Ntakirutimana, Your Honours, show that Mika was amongst the assailants on that day.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would that suggest that you are not relying on the testimony of your witness who said that the fatal shot was fired by Mika? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, what I'm saying is that Mika was present.  He either aided or instigated or abetted in the killing of this particular person.  He was present.  His mere presence, the fact that he has advertised all these things and some of them saw him shooting, it's a combination of these factors, Your Honour, that we allege that Muhimana participated in the killing of Kabanda. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are you saying that it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter whether it was Sikubwabo who did the -- fired the fatal shot? 
MR. KAPAYA:
That --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- or whether it is Muhimana's shot that brought Kabanda down? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's the crux of my submission, Your Honour, that it was his presence during the hunting and killing of this man in Bisesero, the cutting off of the head or being seen bringing the head in the company of other people in Gishyita town also.  These two factors combined to make one complete situation; namely, that he participated in the killing of Kabanda. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, you, and I think Mr. Phillips, you have referred to concurrent findings in other cases which you want us to use in assessing the credibility of some of your witnesses. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, yes, I agree.
JUDGE SHORT:
What principle are you applying here?  These are -- you want us to, what, take judicial notice of findings of fact on credibility made in these other cases?  What exactly is your proposition or submission on these findings of fact in other cases? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, we admit that this is a fairly dicey area but what we -- part of the reason why we refer you to these judgments is that you may perhaps find it -- you may perhaps find it rather difficult, perhaps -- we don't know -- to say that Muhimana was not in Bisesero area when your Brothers in the three preceding cases said that he was there.  Of course, it may be different.  I don't know.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Kapaya, you see, that's what is worrying us.  You see, the fact that another Court has made a finding, is that binding on us? 
MR. KAPAYA:
It's not binding, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are we limited to the evidence which was given in this courtroom?
MR. KAPAYA:
But in this case, Your Honour, for instance, if you take AF, AF testified here that Muhimana was in Bisesero.  AF was PP in Kayishema.  He said the same thing. 

Take GG.  GG told you here that Muhimana was in Bisesero and in the complex at Mugonero.  The same witness testified in Ntakirutimana that this person was there.  So these are matters to consider.  They are not binding, Your Honours.  They are not binding at all on Your Honours.
JUDGE SHORT:
I know they are not binding, but on what grounds are we to consider these pieces of evidence?  You -- are you saying these are adjudicated findings of fact?  What are they?  What are they and what's their relevance and under what principle do we consider them and for what purpose? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, what may be relevant in this regard also in addition to what we've submitted is that if you have a witness who testified consistently over a particular issue, it goes to showing a -- I mean, a consistent pattern, it's a pattern in the testimony of this witness.  In all these trials, the witness has testified to the same thing.  In his witness statements, he's testified to the same things.  He talks about the same things.  So there is a -- a sort of a consistency in the testimony of this witness.  It shows -- so when you come to assessing his credibility, you say, after all, the guy may be credible because, actually, he's quite consistent in what he's saying.  This is what he's been saying consistently in other cases, he's been saying consistently.  Maybe it is a matter you may wish to consider, also.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The consistency of his testimony is to be taken in different cases?
MR. KAPAYA:
You are saying, Your Honour? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The consistency of the testimony of the witness in different cases could be taken into consideration? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, but it's on the same issue, Your Honour.  It's on the issue of the presence -- let's say the issue of the presence of Muhimana at Mugonero complex.  Okay, this witness has said in Kayishema he was there.  In Ntakirutimana, he was there.  Now he's telling you he was there.  The guy is consistent.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He is corroborating himself. 
MR. KAPAYA:
In a way, yes, Your Honour.  And we ask Your Honours to believe him.  But if he says differently in the other case, the Defence would be very quick to point out, as they attempt to point out in Niyitegeka, that PP had actually said that it was Niyitegeka and Muhimana who killed Kabanda.  And actually, if you read the paragraph, paragraph 429 of the Kayishema judgement, it says that Niyitegeka was not there.  He was there but he was far off, he was far away.  He was not responsible for the killing.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The question I have for you is one, Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You know whatever we come up with out of here must be evidence.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Have you exhibited as part of your evidence a transcript of what this person said in Ntakirutimana and all these other things, or do we just look at it in a judgment? 
MR. KAPAYA:
For one, Your Honour, is that transcripts are public record and if we refer to them, we are sure they may be available for consultation.  Two, the particular paragraphs --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are we supposed to go and search for those transcripts? 
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour.  I'm not suggesting that, Your Honours.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What I'm saying, Mr. Kapaya, is this, you know there's a trial between you and Professor Songa and did you draw his attention to the fact that his witness testimony or that was consistent with a witness here so that Professor Songa might well have had something to say about that?  That's what evidence is about. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, in paragraph 329 of his brief, Professor Songa's brief, he's the one who says that PP said it was Niyitigeka who killed Kabanda.  It is him who raises the issue.  And I'm raising it in rebuttal to what he has said.  Actually, it was not only him, it was not Niyitigeka, it was Muhimana.  And even in the other cases, they said it was Muhimana.  I say this in rebuttal to what Professor Songa had raised in his brief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, but Mr. Kapaya, if when the witness was giving evidence he was confronted by Professor Songa with the evidence he was giving in this case and then he responded by saying,, "The evidence I'm giving here is exactly what the evidence I gave in the previous case," so that that assertion becomes part of the record in this case.  Did anything like that happen here? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Not exactly, but we used the previous transcripts to contradict these witnesses.  If you recall, Your Honours, we produced them as exhibits to show that, "Well, you are not credible because in Ntakirutimana you said that Muhimana went to the CCDFP.  Now you are telling us that Muhimana didn't go to the CCDFP."  So it is in this way, in this sort of pattern --
JUDGE SHORT:
That's perfectly all right to use transcripts to contradict evidence of witnesses.  Previous evidence which the witness has given, you know, you can use it to confront a witness.  What you are doing now is saying that you are trying to use previous transcripts to confirm the evidence of a witness in this particular case.  And I'm asking you that during the hearing of this case, at any time did the witness have the opportunity to say that, "Yes, this evidence I'm giving is credible because I gave the same evidence in a previous case, and this was a finding made in that case"? 
MR. KAPAYA:
That issue, Your Honour, didn't directly arise in the course of trial.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How would we know that Prosecution witnesses have given a similar statement in other cases?
MR. KAPAYA:
We cite the relevant paragraph, Your Honours.  For instance, in Ntakirutimana, the Ntakirutimana appeal, it came after the case was closed.  I have made reference.
JUDGE SHORT:
You cited it in your --
MR. KAPAYA:
In my argument today.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you want us to include it as part of the record? 
MR. KAPAYA:
As part of my submissions.
JUDGE SHORT:
But you are referring to evidence.  That's not a submission.  You are talking about evidence.  And you want it to be taken as evidence.

MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour.  That's not my submission, Your Honour.  My submission is that we just request Your Honours to consider this as one of the myriad of factors that you may wish to consider in the course of your deliberations.  We don't want to -- we request Your Honours not to close your -- I mean, the windows to this other possible evidence that may be relevant in helping you to arrive at the truth.
JUDGE SHORT:
Except that I don't know the principle under which you are asking to us do that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Especially when the transcripts have not been exhibited. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, my colleague says that some of the witnesses testified in those other cases which we have referred to. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Testified to what? 
MR. KAPAYA:
AT testified in Ntakirutimana, in Kayishema, in all these other cases.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are saying that a fact is likely to be true because it has been spoken by one witness five times in five different cases?  That is your proposition?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour, I thought -- well, my submission was that -- my submission, Your Honour, is that the testimony of these witnesses in the previous trials which the witnesses have testified to, and actually we started by asking them, "Did you testify in this case, this other case?  Did you testify?"  "Yes, I did."  "On this date?"  "Yes, on this date." "These other trials?"  "Yes."  Then they went on to testify now.  

Now, it was on the basis of that that Judges made the findings, and they were subject to 
cross-examination by the Defence if they wanted to on those other issues.  Now these issues have now come up in the Defence brief.  We are now responding accordingly that, well, some of the citations you are bringing out are not correct, some are, and that the additional evidence is this. 
JUDGE SHORT:
That's why I was asking you if, in the course of this trial, the witnesses indicated that they gave similar testimony in previous cases so that, you know, it's part of the record before us that these witnesses gave consistent testimony in previous cases on the same incident.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  AT did that.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.
MR. KAPAYA:
And the other witnesses.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay, we'll look at the record. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time would you need to address the issue of sentencing?
MR. KAPAYA:
I don't know.   Maybe, Your Honour, I should put it like this:  How much time do you have to listen to me on sentencing?  Because that's where I'm moving to now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
First, you tell us how much time would you take. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Slightly -- 30 minutes perhaps, 30, 40.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you sure?
MR. KAPAYA:
I think so. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So all you have left is your submission on sentencing? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's all, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
That's all that's left and you've got about 30 minutes to deal with that.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take the lunch break and resume at 2:30. 
	(Court recessed from 1307H to 1447H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings in the Court are resumed. Mr. Kapaya, please go ahead. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  There was an issue which we left pending during the morning session and this relates to Honourable Judge Short's question that we give an explanation of the steps or things we did to show that we had given timely, clear and consistent post-indictment information regarding the rape of AQ by the accused person. 

Your Honour, as we submitted last time, the fact of rape by the Accused of this lady is not mentioned in her witness statement of 30th of August '99, disclosed to the Defence in 2000.  It could therefore -- it could not have therefore been included in the indictment.  

Now, we knew about this fact some time in February or March -- some time in February, when reconfirming Witness AQ in the field in Rwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
February of which year? 
MR. KAPAYA:
2004.  2004.  And following that, we disclosed it to the Defence under Rule 67(D) as information or evidence obtained in the course of events.  Any evidence that comes to your knowledge which you think is material should be disclosed to the Defence, and we did that.  And there is a piece of document which we sent to the Defence which says, basically, that the witness will add that Muhimana raped her twice after Esperance never returned following her abduction.  Now, we also contained --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the statement about?  It's a will-say statement? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it's a will-say or 67(D).  We prefer to call it Rule 67(D) disclosure, rather than will-say statement. 

In the pre-trial brief which we filed on the 27th of February 2004, we add a corrigendum under the summary of the testimony of AQ which appears under 3, number 3.  She is number 3.  We say that witness added that Muhimana raped her twice after Esperance was abducted.  And this pre-trial brief was disclosed to the Defence; they have knowledge about it. 

Now, trial, as we say, commenced on the 29th of March and the witness testified on the 15th of April.  So they had about -- oh, about 60 days to prepare for this.  And actually, when she took the stand, she was not only cross-examined but she was actually grilled by the Defence for this particular rape, so they knew what she was talking about and they met that challenge adequately. 

So, Your Honours, it is on the basis of these post-indictment disclosures that we say, we submit that -- we submit that you may -- we ask you to take this into account as one of the matters which -- one of the rapes which we allege against Mr. Muhimana.  And so on the basis of the Ntakirutimana judgement, as we say, in the Ntakirutimana judgement of 15 December '04, paragraph 125, which says if you satisfy these conditions, then a Trial Chamber can take into account a matter which is not pleaded in the indictment.  

Unless I can be of further assistance on this issue, I wish now to proceed to the question of sentencing. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How was the Defence to conduct investigations into this matter? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, well, they had about, as we say, about 60 days to do, and actually, they could have applied.  You know, as soon as they got the disclosure, the 67(D) disclosure on this matter, they could have applied to the Chamber that they were -- they were not ready to cross-examine the witness and they wanted to carry out further investigations.  They didn't say that.  So we took it that the disclosure was sufficient for that purpose. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, go ahead with the issue of sentence. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

Now, my argument on sentencing relates to the four counts which have been laid at the door of the Accused; that is genocide, or, in the alternative, complicity in genocide, and rape, and murder.  I base this argument on the facts which we submit have been proved, and these are the facts which appear in our closing brief.  And as we submitted earlier on, Your Honours, that if you accept the testimony of any one of the witnesses we've called in support of any of the counts of genocide, or in the alternative, complicity in genocide, rape, or murder, in either Gishyita, Mubuga parish, Mugonero or Bisesero.  So our humble submission, Your Honours, is that you have a duty to convict Muhimana on any one, or all, of those counts.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You mean to say that only one credible witness is enough? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, for genocide, or murder, or rape, or -- murder, any of the crimes.  This is our humble submission, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Out of all the Prosecution witnesses? 
MR. KAPAYA:
What did you say? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Out of all the Prosecution witnesses, only one credible witness is necessary?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, only one, Your Honour.  If you say there are 11 murders, if you think that only one was committed, that is enough to convict him of murder.  There are about 20 rapes.  If you think that one or two were submitted, the others were not, that is sufficient to convict the Accused of rape.  That is what we are saying, Your Honour. 

Your Honour, in determining sentence, the Chamber is requested to consider that the Tribunal was established by the Security Council pursuant to Chapter 4 -- Chapter 7 of the Charter of the United Nations.  

Under Article 9 of the Charter, the Council is empowered to ensure that violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda in 1994 are halted and redressed.  The object -- the objective in creating the Tribunal is to prosecute and punish the perpetrators of the atrocities in Rwanda and to put an end to impunity and thereby promote national reconciliation, restoration of peace, and reconciliation.  The jurisprudences of this Tribunal, starting with Akayesu, Rutaganda, Kayishema, and laterally, Ntakirutimana, they have all addressed the question of penalty, sentencing, and the aims that go with sentencing, and the principle aims are justice, retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation.  And we request, Your Honours, that in determining the sentence you wish to impose on Mr. Muhimana, you be guided by these principles.  You are further requested --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Justice, retribution and what else? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Justice, retribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction. 

You are also requested, Your Honours, to take into account the factors mentioned in Article 23 of the Statute and Rule 100(A) and Rule 100(B) of the Rules of the Tribunal.  These, in their entirety, include the gravity of the offence, the individual circumstances of the Accused and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.  

We also request Your Honours to take into account the general practice regarding prison sentences in the courts of Rwanda and the extent to which any penalty imposed by a court of any state of the convicted person for the same act, that has already been served, is referred to in Article 39.3 of the Statute of the Tribunal.

MR. KAPAYA:  (Continuing)
Your Honours, Rule 100(A) enjoins the Prosecutor and the Defence to bring to the attention of the Trial Chamber any matters or information that may assist you to determine an appropriate sentence, and Rule 101 prescribes life imprisonment as the maximum sentence under the Statute.  Now, the Statute and the rules, particularly Rule 101, does not set a minimum or any specified term of imprisonment for any of the offences (unintelligible) in the Statute.  Needless to say, the factors mentioned cannot be interpreted as mandatory, exhaustive or binding on Your Honours.  You have the unfettered discretion to look at the crime, look at the circumstances of the Accused person and to take on board any factor you think may be pertinent in determining the appropriate sentence.  In this connection, we suggest that you may wish to examine and apply the available international jurisprudence in this area, as we have already made reference to.  

Your Honour, the Prosecutor submits further that in determining the sentence of the Accused the Trial Chamber should be guided by the objectives of the criminal (sic), which include the confirmation of the rule of law, which is a condition of a peaceful society, through a just sentence which reflects the standard of proportionality between the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, the deterrence of the Accused and future perpetrators, and future retribution.  In this regard, the preamble of the Statute of the Tribunal refers to these objectives when it says that the Security Council is convinced that in the particular circumstances in Rwanda, the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law will contribute to the process of national reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of peace in Rwanda, believing that the establishment of the international tribunal for the persons responsible for genocide and other violations of international humanitarian law will contribute to ensuring that such violations are halted and effectively addressed.  

Your Honours, when determining Muhimana's sentence, the Trial Chamber is invited to take into account the gravity of the offences (unintelligible) under 23.2 of the Statute.  Your Honours will admit that the crimes the Accused stands charged with, that is, genocide, rape, and murder, are inherently crimes of extreme gravity, and that the Defence appears to admit this in paragraph 125 of their Defence brief, that these are very serious crimes for which the Accused person stands charged.  

Your Honour, Article 23 of the Statute enjoins Your Honours to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and in doing so, you are requested to examine the individual role of the convicted person in the commission of the crimes and assess the surrounding circumstances.  The Statute and the Rules do not set out what constitutes aggravating or what constitutes mitigating circumstances.  However, we submit that the following should be taken as guidelines as to what may constitute aggravating or mitigating circumstances.  These (sic) are the individual role, for instance, Mika Muhimana played in the execution of the crimes.  

Your Honours, we know that genocide and crimes against humanity can hardly be crimes of one person.  So, in evaluating the individual responsibility of Muhimana, the role he played in the execution in any one or all of these crimes is an important factor in determining the sentence you may wish to pass.  You may also wish to consider the status of the Accused in society in the state in which he lived.   Was he an influential person?  Was he an ordinary person?  Was he a peasant or a government official, or in what manner could his status be influential in the commission of the crimes of which he is charged?  

There is also the question of zeal -- I mean, or lack of it, with which the crimes are committed.  Now, in this regard, the Rwandan law, organic law number 8 of 96, makes the zeal with which the crimes were executed as an element of defining the type of category 1 genocide:  The higher the zeal that is exhibited, the higher the sentence goes to a different category.  

Your Honour, I wish now to address you on the aggravating matters which, we submit, you should take into account in passing sentence on Muhimana.  Your Honour, Muhimana as conseiller and businessman, he was very close to the people he was serving in his area, and he acted as a link between the people and the government.  Your Honour, the evidence we have been talking about for the past two days established that Muhimana was in close association with senior civil servants and prominent business people, and these factors, in our view, enhance his status in his society.  

He was popular in Gishyita secteur because he was born there.  He was educated there, and he also admits that he was a renowned member of the MRND, the party that was in power at that time.  So his position placed him under a duty to espouse the principles laid down in the constitution of Rwanda and uphold a higher than average degree of morality.  Now, instead of doing this, he supported the genocidal campaign, actively engaging himself in killing and raping women and inciting others to kill and rape.  Muhimana was in a position to know and appreciate the dignity and value of life, the value and importance of the co-existence between communities, and he was in a position to promote the value of (unintelligible).  All these Muhimana brushed aside.  He participated in the killings of thousands of Tutsi civilians; he raped women in Gishyita town, in Mubuga church -- no, in Gishyita town, Mugonero complex, Bisesero area, and led and encouraged others to do the same.  

Your Honour, I think I'll be correct in saying that Muhimana was second to none in the rape of women during the entire Rwandan genocide in April, May, and June 1994.  We have examined all the cases before us and we think this man faces so many rape allegations  -- so many people have come to testify against him and we believe that, actually, he was the -- there was no one who came near him in the raping of women. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What is the statistical evidence for that? 
MR. KAPAYA:
I said, Your Honour, that we, on the basis of what we have heard in the Tribunal so far  --
JUDGE SHORT:
It is not before us? 
MR. KAPAYA:
It is our submission, Your Honour. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So why should we take it into account when it is not before us? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is not even documented anywhere, is it? 
MR. KAPAYA: 
It is not, Your Honour, but this is what I get from, you know, when you go through a certain process, when you go through the evidence that we have read, when you go through the indictment that you have seen; you see, this is what you get.  You get a certain -- you get a certain sense which I have a feeling to convey to you --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, no. 
MR. KAPAYA:
-- whether it makes sense to you or not  --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, no, no.  You have no duty to mislead us.  That is a duty you don't have.  When you state that upon analysis of what this Tribunal has been doing, cases the tribunal has been hearing, Muhimana stands as the king of rapists, one who has done greatest rape, you can't say such a statement without such basis, maybe some analysis or something. 
MR. KAPAYA:
 I have a basis, Your Honours.  We said in Musema, Musema was charged with one rape count of one Nyiramusugi.  Akayesu was charged with one rape count in the Gitarama.  In Nyiramasuhuko, the Accused are charged with less than five rapes.  We have Muhimana, he has over 20 rapes charged against him.  So this is the basis.  I say I went through the indictments, what we have in the OTP, and I am submitting on behalf of the OTP that of all the suspects we have, as far as rape is concerned, Muhimana is number 1. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is the number of allegations of rape we should put Muhimana as number one?
MR. KAPAYA:
It is the amount of allegations, Your Honour, and the amount of evidence we have led.  In all the other cases, we have one or two allegations.  So no matter what evidence we led in those cases, it won't go beyond what Muhimana is accused of raping, the number of victims, none of Nyiramasuhuko, Musema or the other -- I mean Akayesu, they are not accused of raping more victims than Muhimana. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So you want us to go and read those judgements and get all that statistical evidence and use it in our judgement? 
MR. KAPAYA: 
No, I don't expect you to do that.
JUDGE SHORT:
Or you want us just to accept your word for it?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that is what I submit, Your Honour, that you accept my word to you that this is what we think.  

Your Honour, may I proceed now?  In addition to that, it is my humble submission that Mr. Muhimana was overzealous in the way he committed his crimes.  Now, his overzealousness is reflected in the fact that he shamelessly raped his relatives and other close family friends in his own residence, in his office, in the bushes, in April -- in early April; and to him, so long as they were Tutsi, they were a legitimate target to him.  

Your Honour, you will recall AX.  Witness AX told you how Muhimana raped her in his own office, and AP and AQ told you how Muhimana raped his own relatives in his own residence, that is, Esperance.  You heard evidence from BI, AT, BJ, BH and AU that in mid-April 1994, Muhimana was responsible for the rape of seven known women in the Mugonero complex alone.  They were all Tutsi, except BJ.  And you heard BJ say that at that time she was hardly 15 years old.  Now, when Muhimana raped her in April -- Your Honour, BJ told you she was Tutsi -- she was Hutu, that Muhimana raped her by mistake.  And what was that mistake?  He mistook her for a Tutsi, and this is further evidence of Muhimana's overzealousness in raping Tutsi women.  

Your Honours heard evidence from AF and AV of participation of Muhimana in mid-April and four - of the rape of three women in Mubuga area:  BG, BU, AW and BG.  BG.  BU, AW, and BU testified to the participation of Muhimana in the rape and mutilation of women in Bisesero in May and June '94.  AW told you how horribly and brutally Muhimana raped Pascasie Mukarema who at the time was pregnant.  He cut her from her breasts right up to her genitals, and removed her baby from the womb.  You heard from the same AW how Muhimana gang raped Felicité Kankuyu, along with six other assailants, and allowed Interahamwe to thrust pieces of sharpened wood in Kankuyu's private parts causing severe bleeding that resulted in her death.  You finally heard BG tell you that she was kept as a sexual slave by an Interahamwe and continually raped for a week on the blessings of Muhimana.  

The victims of rape, Your Honours, told you of the medical, psychological, social and economic wounds they suffered, and continue to suffer in consequence of Muhimana's actions.  Your Honour, we submit that these are gravely aggravating factors and invite the Trial Chamber to treat them as such.  As regards mitigating circumstances, Your Honours, I submit that Muhimana has none.  He has not shown an iota of remorse for the crimes he is charged with.  He never surrendered.  He had been on the run from mid-July '94, when he fled Rwanda, until 8th November '99 when he was arrested in Dar es Salaam.  There is nothing to show that he has apologised to the victims, his fellow Rwandans, let alone to the international community for these crimes.  He has not cooperated with us, Your Honours in any way.  Except for the time -- except for credit for the time in detention in terms of paragraph D of the Rule 101, I submit, Your Honours, that Muhimana has no mitigating circumstances whatever.  

Now, considering the gravity of the offences, the aggravating circumstances I have described to Your Honours, and the lack of mitigating factors, the Prosecutor hereby recommends for Mika Muhimana imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life for each count for which he is convicted, and we pray that these sentences run concurrently.

Unless I can be of further assistance to Your Honours, that's the end of my submission. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before you go, Mr. Kapaya, there is something that has disturbed me about the invitation extended to us by Ms. Madenga that we should now go into the definition of rape and tear it apart and adopt the Akayesu definition in place of other definitions in other judgements. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, sir. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
For my part, I would like some assistance on that.  How much can we innovate into the definitions?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, as my learned colleague submitted yesterday, rape under national jurisdictions was confined to the  insertion of the  male organ into the female organ.  Akayesu extended this, broadened the definition, to include any object:  That a women or any person can be raped by the use of any instrument into her -- through her private parts.  My colleague said yesterday that the act of Muhimana -- you see there are many ways that Muhimana killed that lady Mukarema.  He simply could have cut off the head and done away with it.  But in our view we also considered that the lady was pregnant, so maybe it could not have been possible to rape her in the way the other victims were raped, so -- and we also consider that she was Tutsi and she was carrying a Tutsi baby.  So when you consider all these circumstances, the fact that he killed her by --
MR. PRESIDENT:
How is the killing of Tutsi related to rape?
MR. KAPAYA:
It was part of the genocide plan, Your Honours, that the women were raped and killed.  They were raped and killed.  You see now, here, he used a machete by driving it from the breasts, which are considered as sexual parts, through the stomach to the reproductive organ of this woman.  So in so doing, we submit that in accordance with the Akayesu definition, he raped this woman. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why is it necessary to categorise that as rape instead of other offences? 
MR. KAPAYA:
The categories of rape are not closed.  That is why my colleague here said we can open up with that one.  Of course, the act can also be classified as an inhumane act or an assault, yeah, but these are different levels of gradation.  You see, we have characterised the same offence, the same act, also as murder, because the woman was killed.  We also submit that it also amounts to rape, in the circumstances which my colleague described and in the circumstances which I have added, and we invite Your Honours to take it so, to consider it that way.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Professor, now, it's your turn.  

Professor, can we know how long you will take to conclude your oral argument? 
MR. SONGA: 
A whole day.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Today?  A whole day, today? 
MR. SONGA:
If you decide that we should go far into the night, I wouldn't mind; otherwise, we could start tomorrow, Madam President, or continue tomorrow, Madam President. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So your whole day means more than what is left of today, today and more, or do you mean today and tomorrow all day or are you able to say you would be to finish by, say, lunchtime tomorrow, something like that? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, if it could take us between eight and 10 hours.  We can at least try to finish within that time frame.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, Professor, we expect you to conclude your evidence by lunchtime tomorrow, including the remaining Court time for today.  We go up to five p.m. today.
MR. SONGA: 
I will make an effort, Madam President, to respect this time frame.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreters would like to know whether counsel for the Defence does not have a summary for the interpreters.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A summary of the oral arguments?  

Professor, do you have a summary of the oral arguments for the interpreters? 
MR. SONGA: 
No, Madam President, but I will try to stick very closely to the brief which we filed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, he doesn't have.  

Professor. 
MR. SONGA: 
I thank you, Madam President.  

If we look at the brief filed by the Defence, we would find that it starts with a quotation by Socrates and it goes as follows:  "God's mind is nurtured with the delight to contemplate the truth".   This quote has been highlighted in our closing brief because men were, indeed, behaving like wolves towards one another.  I also referred to a document called the Bible, and in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, it is stated that after our first parents committed original sin, God intervened and spoke to the serpent that had tempted the first human beings, our first parents.  This is what it said:  "I will create enmity between the descendants of the serpent and the descendants of the woman".  

Human beings live on earth today as, supposedly, descendants of the woman.  But, as a matter of fact, the question as to what became of the descendents of the serpent has never been asked.  And when we reflect and think of the origins of humanity, we understand that on earth reside two species of human being, one descendant from the woman and created in God's image with all the love he has for truth and justice, but then we have this other insidious species, which is invisible, which is working continually for the destruction of the human race.  

This species of descendants of the serpent cannot be identified.  It cannot even be identified because the serpent, as cunning as it is, manufactures copies that are identical with the original.  We can distinguish between the serpent's descendants and those of man by their work, because love is one of the attributes of a human being.  What happened in Rwanda shows indeed -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, I must admit that you are a good professor. 
MR. SONGA:
I am very indebted to you for that, Madam President.  

Madam President, what happened in Rwanda perfectly illustrates the existence of the second species of human being, this invisible race which survives through its work.  Genocide is certainly the product of the descendants of the serpent.  But the serpent did not only create killers, it also created liars:  Those people who defy the truth, those people who defy justice.  It created those people who can appear before an international criminal tribunal and state, without mincing their words, that such a person committed such a crime, without bothering about the consequences of such a claim, without bothering about the fact that such a person who is being wrongly accused can lose his life, his honour, and his dignity.  

We have prepared our arguments, Madam President, bearing in mind this concern about the truth, this concern about justice; and in the course of our preparation, we will do our best to identify the false witnesses, those people who under the pretext of the serious events in Rwanda appear before an international tribunal, whose responsibility is immense, to deceive the Tribunal and lead it to take the wrong decisions.  

In the closing brief that we have filed before you, Madam President, we present in part 1, general considerations, and then we present a summary on applicable law.  In part 3, we have drawn factual conclusions; and, lastly, we present our legal conclusions or findings.  

I pointed out from the outset that since this trial has lasted so long, all that we have been able to submit during the proceedings should be considered as part of this closing brief.  We are thinking, first of all, the pre-trial brief of the Defence, and the opening statement which we presented on the 16th of August 2004.  When I referred to general considerations, the first part, it means that I am reflecting on certain aspects which do not relate to any side or any allegation whatsoever.  So what I say has to do with all the sides in the indictment.  

I have also tried to reflect somewhat on the notion of Interahamwe.  I presented various definitions coming from different witnesses, both Prosecution and Defence witnesses, and I got to realise that the concept of Interahamwe is nebulous, that both Prosecution and Defence witnesses were unable to define it clearly.  For instance, let us take two or three Prosecution witnesses and look at what they think of Interahamwe.  Thus, Witness AT states as follows:  "We consider that everyone who killed was an Interahamwe, be it a soldier or a civilian."  And if we take Witness AU, who stated that, "The Interahamwe were attackers who carried different types of weapons, grenades and nail-studded clubs called ntanpongano," N-T-A-N-P-O-N-G-A-N-O.  And this is what Witness BC says:  "The Interahamwe he saw were either naked or they were wearing banana leaves."  The same witness states that they wore clothes that made them look like devils.  As for Witness BH, that is, Prosecution Witness BH, he says that when he saw a witness in Muhero (phonetic), he said "I heard people being called Interahamwe,  "They were all the same; I could not distinguish between them and other people.  To say that they were Interahamwe means I could see them killing people.  I heard people say that they were Interahamwe.  They were wearing clothes, but I am not in a position to state whether they were particular clothes.  Everyone wore clothes that resembled those that were usually worn."  On the same issue, the Prosecution Witness BE states that, "The Interahamwe were people of either sex and they were covered in chalk from head to toe, like they were wearing white clothes like medical assistants."  This shows that this witness could not describe the clothes worn by medical assistants, the reason being that he didn't go to the hospital.  

Let me end here, as far as these examples are concerned; the rest can be found in the closing brief.  This sampling shows that Interahamwe are improperly defined and also shows that during the war there was no homogenous structure, such that when someone appears before your Court and states that he knows an Interahamwe, or leader of an Interahamwe, he is saying nothing in the final analysis, because in this kind of vexed situation, no rule can be well defined.  Besides, this has been clearly shown.  Has there been an instant on which on the basis of the testimony of such a witness, the Prosecutor was able to present the structure of the Interahamwe?  Has the Prosecutor, on the basis of the testimony of such witnesses, been able to define the role played by Mika in such a structure, be it at the level of a cellule or the secteur or even Gishyita commune and Kibuye préfecture?  Has there been a single witness who has been able to indicate clearly the role played by Mika Muhimana?  

On the basis of this fact, I would like to propose to your august Chamber to refer to an identical conclusion or similar conclusion that was reached by your colleagues of Trial Chamber I in the Bagilishema case, and looking at that judgement, I was able to read the following:  "In conclusion, if a number of witnesses have stated that Interahamwe were present at Mabanza at the time of the events in question, many used the term in its broadest sense to designate persons who were attacking the Tutsi.  The Accused" -- and I am continuing to read the judgement -- "couldn't have exercised any hierarchical responsibility on a group of unidentified assailants".  Such is the excerpt collated from the Bagilishema case.  Mabanza is a commune in the Kibuye préfecture, just as Gishyita is a commune in the Kibuye préfecture.  If, concerning a bourgmestre, the Tribunal could not determine the hierarchical responsibilities among a group of assailants, what should we say when it comes to assessing the responsibility of a secteur conseiller as for his capacity to order, for instance, a group of assailants that are not identified?  

Within the framework of general considerations, I had the opportunity of talking of rape independently of any location, rape which features in the indictment as an element of a crime against humanity.  Ironically, however, in the pre-trial brief, I saw attempts made by the Prosecutor to make of rape an ingredient of the crime of genocide.  We are of the opinion that he could have been able to do this if the ingredients that he had collected during the investigation made it possible for him to do so, but he couldn't do so, probably because he felt that the collected information could not enable him to establish the crime of genocide.

(Interpretation unintelligible)...through the pre-trial briefs in order to try to revert to a situation that was not clearly controlled during the investigations and to want to propose to the Tribunal that in this trial there is rape that is an element of genocide, I think this is tantamount to bad procedure, simply because there is a lack of legal basis therefore.  Indeed, nowhere in the indictment do we see rape or any forms of sexual assault as ingredients or elements of genocide.  But when we know -- we are aware of the fact that there are judgements and decisions that exist on this, so pre-trial briefs cannot afford opportunity to the Prosecutor to vary the contents of the indictment.  The indictment cannot be varied or modified if that authorisation is not given, therefore, by the Tribunal.  

Accordingly, the Defence would like to request, Madam President, Your Honours, to declare, or to exclude, any evidence that has to do with the allegation or charges of rape or sexual assault as ingredients of genocide, to the extent that the indictment itself does not establish any nexus between genocide, on the one hand, and rape and acts of sexual violence on the other.  

Still concerning the general considerations, I talked about the issue of joint criminal enterprise.  I dwelt at length on this concept in the Defence pre-trial briefs and in the opening statements of 16 August 2004.  All the arguments that were developed at the time on the subject are supposed to be recaptured here.  However, what the Defence would like to emphasise is that admission of joint criminal enterprise would mean reverting to the initial count of conspiracy, and the count of conspiracy appeared in the initial indictment, and when the Prosecutor applied for severance so that Muhimana can have a separate trial, he willingly and deliberately, after investigations, expunged the count of conspiracy from the indictment.  How, therefore, can we understand that, surreptitiously, he is trying once again to bring up the charge of joint criminal enterprise?  

Obviously, we have understood the Prosecutor's intentions and the facile method that this approach represents.  This probably was in a bid to base himself on previous judgements that were rendered concerning the Kibuye locations but that, in itself, would negate the law.  Criminal responsibility will always remain individual and we should never attempt to try to seek the conviction of an accused on the basis of trials in which he was cited but wherein he did not have the opportunity to be heard or questioned.  

Madam President, I am also looking at the issue of burden of proof.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not getting the translation.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Madam President, can the professor be requested to start all over from where he just began?  Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Start the last sentence again. 
MR. SONGA:
I was approaching the issue of burden of proof and I was saying that after listening to the proceedings when the Prosecutor was making his case in-chief and after listening to arguments when the Defence was also leading evidence, we understood that I will never overemphasise the principle according to which each accused must be presumed to be innocent up until he is proven to be guilty in accordance with the present Statute.  The attempt is there in the Prosecutor's case in trying to condemn the Accused, even well before the Chamber would have deliberated.  

Expressly and formally, the Rules of Procedure and Evidence did not assign burden of proof.  However, when we refer to the case law of ad hoc tribunals and, more precisely, to the case law in the Celebici case, it is clear that this is part of international criminal law and that the burden of proof is incumbent upon the Prosecution, and that it is the Prosecution that should establish or prove all allegations that it has made in the indictment.  

Obviously, there is a legal burden that devolves upon the Defence each time that it puts forward a proposition or each time that it challenges a proposition, it must also provide proof that should be  convincing to the Chamber.  But that should in no case result in the fact that we should lose sight at any one moment of the fact that the burden of proof, no matter how heavy it is, and at all times in the proceedings, falls, or lies, with the Prosecutor.  It has even been said, in particular, during the -- my opening statements, I had the opportunity to say that the Accused did not have any obligation to prove anything whatsoever.  All the more so as he was even entitled to the right to remain silent, and that he had the right not to testify against himself.  And this is all the more true as the Rules of Procedure and Evidence make provision for the possibility well before the Defence starts presenting evidence, to acquit the Accused.  

The Chamber has the possibility, according to the law, to acquit the Accused, even if the Defence has not yet presented evidence.  What does this mean?  What this means is that the evidence that should be the concern of the Chamber -- the evidence that the Chamber should assess very carefully is the evidence that is submitted or tendered by the Prosecutor.  If the Prosecutor failed to establish, using his own evidence, to establish certain allegations beyond any reasonable doubt, the Chamber should at this stage acquit the Accused without giving room for the Prosecutor to start hiding behind the witnesses of -- the testimony of Defence witnesses.  So our objective, the objective of the Defence here is only to make the Chamber to understand why the Prosecution evidence is weak and why it cannot be the basis of a charge of -- crimes that are deemed to be the most serious crimes for -- against international order.  

Madam President, I think we shouldn't transfer the burden of proof, and I think this will not be admissible in your august Court.  Accordingly, when I see the skill with which the Prosecutor uses in the questioning of Defence witnesses, I ask myself if the Prosecution is not trying to transfer the burden of proof.  Did he, at that level, establish the facts beyond any reasonable doubt?  I would have liked to suggest, Madam President, that the Prosecutor should use those same skills at the same authority to analyse the statements of those witnesses and to bring out their witnesses as part of his responsibilities and to investigate for the Prosecution as well as for the Defence, and he will see, like us, how the Prosecution case is tenuous.  And, as he has done as much as he did, I am sure he will act like me and ask for the acquittal of the Accused in the name of truth and justice. 

Madam President, I will now broach the concept of the de jure authority of a conseiller of a secteur, and I will merely refer to the rule of -- to the law of November 1963.  I am talking about the Rwandan Act after 3 November 1963, which the Prosecutor and the Defence have mutually disclosed to one another.  In that law, the powers of the communal conseiller are defined, and that is the purport of Article 37:  The communal conseiller shall honour the supervision of the bourgmestre, oversee economic and social and cultural development activities in his secteur, and particularly, shall preside over meetings of the people of the secteur, collect and direct the aspirations of the people, lead the people in undertaking development activities based on the programme adopted by the conseiller for development, actively collaborate with agents of technical departments working in the commune for the implementation of government programmes.  

As for the conseiller communal, his powers are also defined in the same law: The conseiller communal shall settle the -- shall resolve matters pertaining to the commune through its deliberations.  In other words, no individual has any specific powers, says this collegiate-type organisation.  We therefore maintain that the conseiller communal does not wield any policing powers, has no authority that is recognised in him, either expressly or implied, in matters of maintenance of law and order in times of peace or of war.  The conseiller exercises no powers over communal police, because they fall under the bourgmestre, who assumes the entire responsibility of the organisation, the functioning, and the control of communal police.  

And who gives orders to the communal police?  It is not the secteur conseiller but it is the brigadier, and this brigadier is not supervised by the conseiller but by the bourgmestre.  And, in the event of a disturbance of public order, the authority of the communal police reverts, not to the bourgmestres; it reverts not to the bourgmestres, not to the conseillers, but rather to the préfet, who is the bourgmestre's direct supervisor.  

So, if we have to look at the law per se, the conseiller has no powers or authority over the commune employees, has no legal powers, let alone any powers over the national gendarmerie and its members.  Only the bourgmestre had absolute authority over the gendarmes assigned to the commune. 

We are still looking at the purport of the Rwandan law to organise Rwandan territory.  Considering the commandeering of the gendarmerie, the law states that it is the préfet's prerogative and not the bourgmestre's, much less the conseiller's.  The law does not invest the conseiller with any authority over the forces of law and order, be it in times of war or of peace, or during national emergency situations; only the bourgmestre is invested with such powers.  

Besides, the witness showed that when the bourgmestre was unavailable, a conseiller from Muhera acted in his stead.  Similarly, we also heard Prosecution -- a Defence witness give the example of conseiller de secteur who had a Tutsi wife.  When he tried to intervene to try to bring about the maintenance of order, by the time he returned home, his wife had been killed.  

Now, on the basis of this legal instrument, can we say that when you bring a conseiller to court, have we brought an important personality before the international Tribunal?  Shouldn't we be worried that we brought such a small person before this Court where the executive powers or the key figures have not been judged?  Has the Prosecutor succeeded in demonstrating that even if Mika did not have legal powers, he had at least de facto powers or de facto authority?  Was the Prosecution able to demonstrate this?  I see the Prosecution Witness BI who tried to define the powers of the conseiller, and frivolously so for that matter, without realising that what he said could also be used by the Defence.  

This is what Witness BI stated when he appeared as Prosecution witness:  "As conseiller, he was the leader of the population of that secteur.  He is the one who represented the central administration at that level of secteur.  He was known by all the inhabitants of the secteur because each member of the population that had a problem had to see him to solve the problem.  You see -- you can see that he had authority and power over most of the population."  In explaining further what he meant by these powers of the conseiller, Witness BI continued as follows: "He is the one who represented them, and he is the one who had to forward the problems of the population to the higher authorities.  He also had to bring instructions from the higher authority to the population."  

Now, what has this Prosecution witness just stated?  Whereas the Prosecutor would want to use this statement to show how powerful the conseiller de secteur was, the result in the eyes of anybody who really wants to understand and who uses commonsense realises, therefore, that he was nothing but a link between the -- the channel of transmission between the population and the authorities.  In any case, Madam President, this Witness BI --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, is there any document in Rwanda which ensures the power of conseiller of a secteur? 
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President. There is a document in Rwanda.  I have referred to the law of 23rd November 1963.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That has not been produced before the Court.  We have not been exhibited those laws. 
MR. SONGA:
I should like to point out that these are documents that the Prosecutor first disclosed to me and, afterwards, I should like to say that this is a document that I attached to the exhibits that we disclosed before the beginning of the trial.  It is in the legal file, and it is on page 933 to 943, and page 1219 bis to 1238 bis of the case file, which is at the registry of the ICTR.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And that document is not an exhibit.  
MR. SONGA:
I not know how to interpret that.  However, I believe that the Rules required that we should give our exhibits before we gave evidence, and this is what we did by forwarding this document through the registry.  I have a document that bears the stamp of the Trial Chamber administration, and I am sure Mr. Constant will be able to verify where it is archived.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you wish to tender this document as an exhibit? 
MR. SONGA:
It is fundamental, Madam President, especially as the parties have already disclosed the document to each other.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What will be your position, Prosecutor?
JUDGE SHORT:
What we are asking is:  Do you both agree to accept this document as an exhibit? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, I haven't even seen it.  I don't think we know it. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Just the law, not the full document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips, what's your stance?  I mean, Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
Your Honour, we haven't had an opportunity of going through this document.  We do not know how much it can impact on our case. If we had it before, we could have made it part of our closing arguments or we could quote witness for or against it. 
JUDGE SHORT:
We are not talking about the document itself, we are talking about the law  which sets out functions and powers. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
If it's the Statute only, we have no objections, Your Honours. 
JUDGE SHORT:
We are not talking about the entire document but the law which defines the Statute and the powers. 
MR. KAPAYA:
That's very thick. 
JUDGE SHORT:
We are not talking about the entire document. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
We have no objection to this part, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, which part of this document describes the power and functions of a conseiller?  Could you identify the portion which describes the function and powers of the conseiller? 

MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  So I shall repeat myself somewhat.  I shall say that we are referring here to law -- the law of 23 November 1963 to organise communes, and I am quoting from section 37 of this law.   May I be given leave to read this section? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
(Microphone not activated)...It's the same document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Professor, just look whether it is the same document which you are referring to. 
MR. SONGA: 
I know the document, Madam President, it was attached to the Lucassen report.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that what you want to produce?
MR. SONGA: 
Yes, Your Honour.   I do not see any problem with that.  It is the same document.  It is the same text.
(Pages 45 to 60 by Judith Baverstock)























1615H
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In that case, there is no need for producing it again. 
MR. SONGA:
Most obliged, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, go ahead.
MR. SONGA:
Most obliged, Madam President.  

Still in the chapter under general matters, the Defence also considered the matter of the existence of a genocidal plan.  Thus we consulted in particular, as I was saying -- we consulted in particular to case law of the ICTY in particular in the Goran Jelisic case and ICTR case law in the Akayesu case and the Kayishema and Ruzindana cases.  When we look at the Goran Jelisic judgment, we note the remark to the effect that -- when we look at the Goran Jelisic judgment, we note that it is said that the drafters of convention on genocide which was signed in Paris in 1948 did not consider the existence of an organisation or a system deployed in furtherance of the genocidal object as a material element of the crime, so much so that in theory one may say that the possibility of an individual who would seek to destroy a group as such on his own cannot be discounted.  The same Tribunal also observed that, in practice, it would be very difficult to provide proof of the genocidal intent if the activities under consideration are not backed by an organisation or a system.  This is the same line of reasoning that this Tribunal applied in the Kayishema case, whose judgment include the following quotation:  "Although a specific plan to destroy does not constitute an element of genocide in itself, it would appear that it is not easy to carry out genocide without such a plan or organisation."  

To summarise and in -- according to international criminal law applicable today, we must note two things.  The existence of a plan or a genocidal organisation is not a material element of genocide.  Secondly, however, in practice it is impossible to carry out genocide without such a plan or such an organisation.  The question that should arise in our minds is that we should ascertain whether the Prosecutor has proved beyond reasonable doubt that such a plan or such an organisation existed.  The point at issue here is to determine whether the Prosecutor has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mika Muhimana played his specific role in the creation and operation of that organisation or in the elaboration of that plan.  And if the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt the specific role that Mika Muhimana played in the implementation of that plan, since he did not do so, the law provides that he might still get out of this tight spot by demonstrating how a person named 
	Mika Muhimana, could have independently of any plan or organisation, been involved in genocide.  The Defence at this point in the proceedings considers that this proof has not been provided.  At no time has any witness given evidence that will provide proof that would go beyond the statements of the indictment and the pre-trial brief of the Prosecutor regarding the supposed powers of a
	conseiller de secteur.  

In regard to the powers of the Accused, where it is said that he may have been a chief of the Interahamwe or a leader of the Interahamwe and his supposed membership in the interim government which had never been proven; if we do not have any evidence to bear this out, Madam President, Your Honours, it would be very difficult for the Prosecutor to convince you of the existence of genocide led by Mika Muhimana. 

In this part of my brief, I also refer to the matter of the death of Mika Muhimana's child on 8th of April 1994 and the matter of an alibi.  Since there is nothing to add or to subtract to what appears in the closing brief, we would refer you to the brief.  We would like to suggest our conclusion of the matter and the Defence considers that it is impossible, or at least unrealistic, to involve Mika Muhimana in the attacks mentioned in the amended indictment, and the Defence would like to emphasise the taking into account of the death of the child to cast doubt on the involvement of Mika Muhimana in the attacks that were supposed to have taken place between the 8th of April, when his child died, and the 16th of April inclusive, and to take account of these elements in assessing the import of the events that are charged against him, especially on the 9th, the 10th, the 11th and the 12th of April, which were too close for the event -- to the event of death for it to be imagined that the head of a family who had lost his five-year old son would abandon his body on site to roam with the intent to kill Tutsis. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's your witness who has stated that Mika was present at Mubuga church on 14th.  He has indicated the testimony of his own co-witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  In this instance also, I shall be obliged to let you know that such a witness should be assessed as to his or her sincerity and honesty when it is known that this is a Defence witness who is supposed to come and talk in favour of the Accused and who is a turncoat who supports the charges of the Prosecution.  In fact, his hurried departure from Arusha should be proof of his bad faith, but I believe -- I recall, Madam President, that there is a case which occurred before this Trial Chamber or before this Court wherein the Prosecution witness turned to support the Defence against the Prosecution.  Your colleagues who were in Trial Chamber I, I believe, did not hesitate to declare Witness DM in the Nahimana case as a hostile witness who should not -- whose evidence should not be credited at all.  So I would like to --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Overlapping microphone)

MR. SONGA:
Yes, Your Honour.  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
A witness is not hostile merely because he does not say what the party calling him wants him to say.  A witness is declared hostile because having given a statement previously stating why, he then gives a statement subsequently stating the opposite of why.  It is not correct.  Witnesses don't come to the Court to support or not to support parties; they come to the Court to give evidence as they know it.  This particular witness you are seeking now to blacken as a turncoat came here and told us, "Yes, the truth must be told.  The man was there."  The fact that he did not do anything, it is also correct.  He didn't do anything but he was there.  There is nothing to stop a witness -- a witness doesn't become hostile because he has said something that is not likeable to the party calling him. 
JUDGE SHORT:
On the hindsight, it was your duty, if you thought that he was a hostile witness, to seek permission of the Court to declare him as such and then proceed to cross-examine him and prove that he was a hostile witness, so that that piece of evidence which he gave against your client should be discounted.  You didn't do that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In other words, you have accepted him as a credible witness. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You have offered his evidence for us to consider, and until and unless that evidence is rendered useless by impeachment from you, the evidence is on record for us to consider, against all the other evidence, of course. 
MR. SONGA:
	I understand you, Your Honours.  I have made my remark; you have made your own edifying remarks in response, and that is all that can be said at this point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Most obliged, Madam President.  Still under the general chapter, I should like to talk about the genocidal intent.  In this part, Madam President, I have referred to the testimony which proved to what extent Mika was interested in the fate of the Tutsis.  This comes in particular from the testimony of DN who, during the events, states that Mika had hidden in his house -- sorry, witness had hidden the husband of DN in his house as Witness DN's husband was a Tutsi.  The witness added that 
	Mr. Mika Muhimana regularly visited him to comfort him and encourage him, and it is still 
	Mr. Mika Muhimana.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Overlapping microphones)...this witness's husband to comfort him? 
MR. SONGA:
The Witness, Witness DN, that is, is referring to her own husband who was hiding during the events in the home of Mika's old mother.  I should like to point out that the same witness also confirmed that it was in the month of June 1994 that Mika Muhimana went to the hiding place of her husband, the Tutsi who was hiding in his old mother's house to accompany him and help him to meet up with French soldiers, and these French soldiers led her husband to Bisesero.  So that is what I am saying in regard to Witness DN, who appeared before your Trial Chamber on the 18th of August 2004. 

The same witness confirms that Mika hid many Tutsis in various places and he had to change the hide-outs because he was afraid that these people might be discovered and killed.  I mention this in a paragraph that the Prosecutor referred to a while ago when he said that this constituted the proof that Mika held meetings whereas the Defence maintains or sought to maintain the contrary.  

I believe the Judge had the appropriate reaction.  They observed that one could not confuse these meetings between friends, between family members with a view to securing their safety with meetings alleged to have taken place by the Prosecutor, the object of which was to develop strategies to go and eliminate the Tutsis.  So the private meetings could not be confused with public meetings of political figures who wished to exterminate the Tutsis.  

I also, Madam President, refer to Witness DG who stated that many Tutsis had survived, thanks to Mika Muhimana, that they were still alive but that they were frightened to come and give testimony before your Trial Chamber, because they might be ostracised because they were afraid that they might be forbidden to take part in meetings, because the current leaders of Gishyita have seized the property of Mika and are not in the least pleased that people come to this Tribunal to do Mr. Mika a good turn.  I quote again.  "Witness DQ, who stated how the men who married Tutsi women were able to ask for and obtain assistance from Mika."  

I shall also name, lastly, Witness AR2, who is a Tutsi woman who narrated how Mika met her in Uvira in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1996 and how Mika gave money to Zairean soldiers who wished to arrest her and kill her because they tended to wish to decimate all the Tutsis and the Banyamulenge who were present at this location.  Witness AR2 told us how this established such a strong link that they ended up getting married, and this marriage was blessed by God because they have two children now.  

Still in the general chapter, I shall now come to Pascal Nkusi's plot.  Witness DJ testified in respect of Pascal Nkusi, saying that not only was he content with occupying Mika's office during those events, but he seized all of Mika's property whereas he wasn't a member of his family.  The same person caused Mika's brother to be imprisoned because he tried to recover the property currently occupied by Pascal Nkusi.  The niece of Mika's wife is currently Pascal Nkusi's wife.  Witness AP lives with Nkusi.  Witness DQ is a sister of the Accused.  She dared one day ask for his (sic) brother's property and it cost her dearly; she was hit and wounded and now lives under a situation of permanent insecurity and is daily humiliated.  

Many witnesses on their identification papers indicated that specific relationship with Pascal Nkusi -- we are referring specifically to Witness AP, AX  AQ, BB, BU, BF, AW, BE and BC.  

Furthermore, the testimonies of Witnesses BJ and DQ are the testimonies of people who are related and who have come up with a plot to destroy the Accused.  In this plot, the husband wanted to hide the truth of the matter.  We shall in due course deal with this aspect of the conduct of the persons concerned.  

AH and AT are related, and each time we are dealing with witnesses who consulted with one another or are relatives or friends.  Thus, of the 19 Prosecution witnesses, 10 are personally related to 
	Pascal Nkusi, who, not being content of being conseiller, not being content with being -- with marrying Mika's niece and occupying his property, is bent on doing everything to cause large numbers of people from Gishyita to help him dispossess Mika definitely of his property.  They appeared before this Chamber not to testify truthfully or in respect to justice.  I said two have relations with 
	Pascal Nkusi.  

Your Honours, it is up to you to integrate this relationship in assessing the testimony of those witnesses.  I will be able to meet each of those witnesses in the sites we are dealing with.  This aspect on which I have just made presentations will enable us to shed light on the issues, on the incoherencies, on the inconsistencies in their testimonies.  

Finally, still in this area of general considerations, I tackle the issue of tears of rape victims, not to weep with them, but to denounce the fact that these are crocodile tears, and we shall have opportunity to prove this.  We have Witness BJ who came as a civilised person, smiling, and who thanked God for seeing Mika now a converted Islam -- Moslem, sorry, but we found that she is a woman whose testimony should be taken otherwise.  This is a person who falsely claimed to be a victim, who did not suffer any physical harm because she was not in the location she claimed to have been.  It was real joy.  It was not an attitude of pardon or attitude of a civilised person.  

Madam President, the tears shed by  witnesses were used by the Prosecutor to get an expert to show that the tears were in respect of the genocide, and since that person's evidence was empty, it was withdrawn.  

We have already noted that Witnesses BJ, AV, AX, AP, BC and the others, all gave the impression that they had been subjected to trauma and deep sorrow.  They turned out to be people who knew how to weep very well, but who also knew how to lie very well.  Those tears were shed to destroy an innocent man.  We proved this on specific occasions and in respect of specific sites.  

I stated, Madam President, that the second part deals with applicable law.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before you get to applicable law,  Professor, there is a statement you make here which I am not clear of the evidence that supports it.  In paragraph 9 bis -- 79 of your statement, you say that the Prosecution witnesses -- in none of the cases tried in Kibuye did the Prosecutor produce a single witness testifying to the commission of acts of rape in Kibuye préfecture.  Where -- which court are you referring to and what evidence before us are you referring to in that statement? 
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, let me first identify the passages, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On page 17.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I have the page before me, Your Honour.  And which is the sentence in issue?
JUDGE MUTHONGA:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, your microphone, please.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The last sentence in paragraph 79 bis states, or maybe we should start --
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I have seen the passage, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Can you show -- lead me to the evidence before us which establishes what you have stated there? 
MR. SONGA:
You are right in asking that question, Your Honour.  I believe I understood that I meant that none of the Prosecution witnesses was able to convince the Court that any rape was committed in 
	Kibuye prefecture.  None of the Accused, to my knowledge, was condemned or convicted of rape. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In which trial?  In which trial was none of the Accused convicted of rape in Kibuye préfecture?  Which trials are you referring to? 
MR. SONGA:
I am referring to all the trials before this Court. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?
MR. SONGA:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are saying your evidence is at -- you are using the fact that nobody has ever been convicted of rape in Kibuye as evidence or support of the proposition that these witnesses were weeping for nothing? 
MR. SONGA:
No, that is not quite what I am saying.  On the one hand, I say that there have been difficulties in convicting people of rape.  As regards the tears shed by the witnesses that we know and whom we cross-examined, we saw that they wept, but I said that we will have the opportunity to prove that those were crocodile tears, and that those witnesses were weeping and lying at the same time.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, this is not your argument that there was no rape ever committed during the genocide period?  
MR. SONGA:
No, Madam President, I cannot say so, the more so as I have read a lot on the events in Rwanda.  However, I respectfully submit that none of the cases of rape attributed to Mika were established beyond a reasonable doubt. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Established where? 
MR. SONGA:
During this trial. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, proceed please. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I was saying that as regards applicable law, I believe I have presented the main issues in the closing brief, and all that is stated here is part of current law in relation to the counts of genocide, complicity in genocide, rape as a crime against humanity and murder as a crime against humanity.  However, in stating the applicable law, I intend to refer only to the counts in the indictment.  I don't believe it is applicable because these facts have not been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, in this area on applicable law, I would like to talk about a precondition of genocide; that is, the existence of a specific context.  To establish genocide according to the doctrine we cite in our documents, the charge must show the existence of the essential ingredients of genocide, notably specific intent, but also the existence of a particular context marked by a pre-existing discriminatory policy.  To uphold the rights of the Accused, a nexus must be established.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
I was talking of the need for a particular context if genocide has to be established, and it is characterised by a pre-existing discriminatory practice.  To uphold the right of the Accused and pursuant to individual criminal responsibility, a nexus must be established between a person accused of genocide and this policy of discrimination.  

If we refer to the great Raphael Lemkin, who coined the word "genocide," he states that genocide presupposes a well-coordinated plan of various acts whose aim is to destroy the essential foundation of national groups with a view to destroying those groups.  

Let us refer to the Nuremberg Statutes.  We find that these statutes do not use the term "genocide".  However, they endorse a reality by making persecution an offence for political, racial or religious reasons, qualifying them as crimes against humanity.  However, the Nuremberg indictment included the expression "deliberate and systematic genocide".  

The Nuremberg judgments which found the 12 accused persons guilty -- and I would like the Court to listen to the reasons why those accused were condemned.  The Nuremberg judgement found 12 people -- Accused guilty because of a plan that was well-planned.  They ordered, incited, instigated, prepared measures against Jews and other groups in Germany, and other people that they met as the Germans advanced into the occupied territories.  

The Nuremberg Tribunal found that for all those accused persons, the precondition that there must be a particular context had been met for three reasons; namely, the first reason that the three accused held positions of authority.  The second reason was that on the basis of such authority, the Tribunal concluded that they had voluntarily and knowingly participated in the implementation of the policy of persecution and knew about the atrocities committed by their subordinates.  You would note that we are dealing here with an Accused without subordinates.  The Tribunal came up with several elements of direct proof such as signed documents, public statements, confessions, revealing the intention of the Accused to settle once and for all the Jewish question or the question of other groups such as the Poles or the gypsies.  Still before the Nuremberg Tribunal, the Accused Fritzsche, spelt as follows: 
	F-R-I-T-Z-S-C-H-E, the Accused Fritzsche, a German radio commentator, was prosecuted for knowingly falsifying news and inciting the commission of crimes against humanity for discriminatory reasons.  However, the Tribunal did not find him guilty for two reasons.  One, his post and official responsibilities were not important enough to lead to the conclusion that he participated in the elaboration and mounting of propaganda campaigns.  Since there is less noise, I am also lowering my voice. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is almost 5 p.m.  So we stop here.
MR. SONGA:
May I give the second reason? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you give the second reason tomorrow?  
MR. SONGA:
It will enable me to repeat the first.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We'll adjourn and resume tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m.  
(Court adjourned at 1700H)
