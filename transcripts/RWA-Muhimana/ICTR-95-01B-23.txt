EXAMINATION IN CHIEF
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Now, before you is a document that contains your personal particulars, do you have it with you, Mr. Witness?
A.	I have the document before me. 
Q.	Now, you will recall that you and I went through this document some time -- the middle of this month, and you appended your signature on that document to show that the facts are correct; is that the position? 
A.	Your Honour, that is correct. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I tender as Prosecution Exhibit P. 23, the personal particulars of this particular witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The protected witness information sheet is entered as Exhibit P ---
MR. KAPAYA:
Twenty-three, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Twenty-three, to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 23 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness BI, I am going to ask you questions concerning the two statements you made before our investigators in relation to this trial.  Do you understand that? 
A.	I understand.
Q.	Now, are you familiar with the plane incident in 1994 involving former President Habyarimana, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, I know about this.
Q.	Can you tell us when you knew about it?
A.	I heard of it on the 7th of April 1994.
Q.	Can you tell Their Honours what was your situation in your area of residence following the death of President Habyarimana in April '94?
A.	In as far as the prevailing situation is concerned, when I learnt of the death of the president on the 7th of April, there was no problem, but as the days went by, from the 8th, the situation deteriorated; looting, killings, and assassination and the burning of houses began. 
Q.	Who was burning whose houses, Mr. Witness?
A.	The Hutu were burning the houses of Tutsi.
Q.	Did you know then or now why the Hutu were burning the houses of Tutsi?
A.	The question that I asked myself was a very difficult one.  Up until today I can tell you that I did not know the reason why this was happening because I did not see the problem -- any problem between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  It is a difficult question for me because up until now I did not know what crime the Tutsis committed for Hutus to treat them the way they did.
Q.	Right.  During this time, who were you living with?  Just give us your relationship, not the names. 
A.	I was living with my two parents, my father and my mother; my brothers and my sisters.  There was also a domestic worker with us.
Q.	Now, did you and the members of your family continue to live in the area of residence following the eruption of the violence?
A.	We did not stay in our home.  We went to seek refuge in the Mugonero Adventist complex.
Q.	Do you recall the date that you and your family went to seek refuge at the Mugonero complex?
A.	I remember the date.  It was the 9th of April 1994.
Q.	Now, had you been at the complex, the Mugonero complex, before the 9th of April, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, I used to go there.
Q.	Can you tell us briefly the layout of that place?
A.	This is a complex comprised of various buildings.  Coming from our place of residence and entering the complex, at the entrance there is the office of the Adventist association.  Towards the left going up, there are housing for hospital workers; there's also a church further on; there is the secondary school for the nurses, secondary nursing school; there's also the housing for the doctors, and then the hospital.  That is what I can tell you regarding the way the place was built.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, did you find other people in the complex on your arrival there?
A.	Yes, we found other persons there.
Q.	Did you know who they were?
A.	I was able to identify them because these were refugees who had come to seek refuge at this place.  There were people whom I found and there were others who came after we arrived.
Q.	Did you know their -- did you find out their ethnic group?
A.	They were Tutsi, but there were a few Hutu among the refugees.
Q.	Could you tell us about how many people were there when you arrived at the complex on the 9th of April?
A.	When I arrived at the complex, there were about 40,000 refugees, but as the days went by, we realised that the number had increased and we were about 50,000 refugees.
Q.	Did you find out where all these people came from?
A.	These people came from Goma in some cases, others came from surrounding secteur, like Mpembe, Bisesero, Musenyi, and yet others came from Gisovu and Rwamatamu communes.
Q.	Did you find out from them why they came to the Mugonero complex to seek refuge?
A.	I did not speak with each refugee.  Because I knew some of the refugees who had come there, I was table to talk with them and ask them why they had come there, and they told me they were running away from the killings they were taking place elsewhere.  And the reason they had chosen this complex was that during the preceding massacres, people had come to seek refuge at this place and did not have problems, and they believed that they would be safe at this place. 
Q.	Now, sir, do you know the person by the name of Mikaeli Muhimana?
A.	I know him.
Q.	Did you see him at the complex in the course of your stay there?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Can you tell us how often you saw him while you were -- during your stay at the complex?
A.	I saw -- the number of times during which I saw him, I think I saw him three times.
Q.	Now, to the best of your recollection, can you tell us when you first saw him at the complex?
A.	The first time that I saw him at this complex, I think it was on the 13th or on the 14th during the attack against the complex.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
13th or 14th of which month?
THE WITNESS:
It was in the month of April 1994.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us where you were when you saw him?
A.	When I saw him, I was quite close to the school in the complex.  We saw assailants who were coming from the large church, the large Adventist church.  We went to inform the gendarmes who were pretending to protect us, and while he were trying to repel the assailants the gendarmes shot at the assailants.  As one of the assailants was wounded, they withdrew, and the people who were leading the attack came to talk with the gendarmes.
Q.	Now, sir, can you tell us whether you saw him arrive or whether you saw him -- you saw him after he had already arrived at the complex? 
A.	When they were coming from the place where the assailants -- when he was coming from the place where the assailants were found, I saw him.  But, in fact, I was able to identify him without fault when he came to the place where the gendarmes were.
Q.	Can you tell us the means by which you got to the complex?
A.	When he came to the complex I saw him on foot.  However, it was obvious that they had parked their vehicle on the road because, immediately, the vehicle came to join them where they were standing.
Q.	What vehicle do you see?  Have you known that vehicle before that day?
A.	This is a vehicle that I knew well.  It was a Toyota that belonged to the commune.
Q.	Now, did you tell us whether you could identify the other people that came with Muhimana to the complex or the people you saw him with, the company of the people he was keeping?
A.	I recognised some of these people.
Q.	Can you tell us who they were?
A.	I recognised the former bourgmestre of Gishyita commune who is called Charles Sikubwabo.  There was also a gentleman who was often with them and who was called Gisambo. 
Q.	Can you tell us about the approximate number of people with whom the man was?
A.	Do you want me to tell you who was with Mika when he was talking with the gendarmes or do you want to tell me the people who comprised the assailants?
Q.	I want you, Mr. Witness, to tell Your Honours the number of people who came as assailants to that place.
A.	Given the image that I have -- the memory I have of them, it was about 100, 150 people. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether they were armed?
A.	These persons were armed.  Some of them were armed with guns and others with traditional weapons such as spears, machetes, clubs and other sorts of weapons called imigere, I-M-I-G-E-R-E. 
Q.	And do you know whether Muhimana was armed?
A.	Yes, he was carrying a weapon.
Q.	Now, can you tell us what happened following his arrival at the complex?
A.	On their arrival and after they spoke with the gendarmes, they went towards the association office.  They went towards the housing of the hospital staff.  This place was called Kiyovu. They went towards the housing of the young ladies who worked in the hospital.  They stayed there for some time, and after that we saw them take out these young ladies and ask them to board the vehicle. 
Q.	Now, before they went to where the ladies you are making reference to, did Muhimana and company launch an attack on the complex?
A.	If you remember what I just told you, I told you that they launched an attack against the complex and the gendarmes shot at them and repelled them.  They came to speak with the gendarmes.  It is understandable that they had come to launch an attack against the hospital.
Q.	Right.  Now, after the attack, where did you say Muhimana proceeded to?
A.	He came down; he followed the path that came from the church to go towards the association office, where they met the gendarmes.  After meeting with the gendarmes, he went -- they went to a place called Kiyovu, and in Kiyovu they entered a house in which the young ladies were living, that is, the young ladies who worked in the hospital.
Q.	Now, how far were you when you observed Muhimana enter the house where the young ladies lived?
A.	I was quite close to him, about 30 or 50 metres away, quite close to these houses.
Q.	And can you tell us approximately what time it was?  Was it in the morning, afternoon, the evening?
A.	It was in the afternoon.
Q.	Now, what did you observe Muhimana do after he had been to that house?
A.	They went into the house, they spent some time there, and when they came out they were leading these young ladies, whom they put in their vehicles and they took away with them.
Q.	Sir, did you recognise those ladies, and how many were they, if you can tell us?
A.	These ladies were three in number.  I recognised them.  One of them was Martha, the other one was Mariana and the third was Josiana.
Q.	Now, had you known these three ladies before that day?
A.	Yes, I knew them.
Q.	Can you tell us what they were  -- what they did, where they lived?
A.	Martha was a hospital worker.  Mariana was also a hospital worker.  As for Josiana, I used to see her in the hospital.  I do not know whether she was a student or a worker in the hospital, but she lived in the same house with the other young ladies.
Q.	Sir, did you know their parents?
A.	I knew the parents of Martha and Mariana, whose father was called Gafurafura. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Martha and Mariana, they were sisters? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were sisters.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And Josiana, did you know her parents?
A.	I did not know her parents.
Q.	Now, can you tell us how Muhimana took these ladies away?
A.	The three young ladies were placed on board a vehicle and the vehicle took off.  That is how I saw them being taken away.
Q.	Do you know which vehicle that was?
A.	I knew this vehicle.  It was a vehicle that belonged to Gishyita commune.
Q.	Do you recall who drove the vehicle on that day?
A.	They went on board this vehicle.  I think that it was Sikubwabo who was driving it.
Q.	Did you see the three girls after that day?
A.	After that day I saw them because Mika brought them back the following day.
Q.	Can you tell us how he brought them and the company of people, if any, who accompanied them?
A.	The vehicle came and parked in front of the association office.  On board the vehicle there were two policemen, communal policemen, and the three young ladies descended from the vehicle and went towards their house, and the vehicle went away again.
Q.	Now, how far were you when you saw this vehicle arrive?  How far were you from the vehicle when it -- when you say you saw it arrive?
A.	The vehicle parked when I was quite close to the school, below a house which was used as a pharmacy for the hospital.
Q.	Can you give us the distance in terms of metres?  Can you estimate? 
A.	The distance between the place where the vehicle was parked and where I was might have been between 35 and 45 metres.  It is only an estimate.
Q.	Now, do you recall what part of the vehicle the three women were?
A.	When they were taken away, two of the three women came out of the rear of the car and the other was sitting in front.
Q.	Do you recall whether Mika disembarked from the car when the ladies were brought back?
A.	Yes, Mika was on board that vehicle.
Q.	Now, my question, sir, was whether you saw him disembark from the vehicle with the girls when they came back?
A.	When they came back, the vehicle was parked; they came out of the vehicle, and Mika stood near the vehicle.  He stayed there for a while and subsequently the vehicle left with Mika.
Q.	Now, did you have occasion to talk with these three ladies after they had returned?
A.	After they returned, we were keen to find out what had happened because we were wondering why they had been taken away and why they had been brought back.  So we went and spoke with them.
Q.	Can you tell us what they said -- they told you in the course of your conversation with them?
A.	They told us that they had been taken to Gishyita and that they had been raped, that the next day they had been brought back, and they said nothing further.
Q.	Sir, did you go into such details as to who raped who?
A.	We managed to find out from them that Sikubwabo, Mika and Gisambo raped them, but as to who raped whom, we thought it would have been mental torture to ask them those questions.  They told us they had been raped by those persons, but we did not ask who raped whom.
Q.	Now, after that date, I believe it was on the 14th, did you see Mika again?
A.	I saw Mika again.
Q.	Can you tell us the date and place you saw him again?
A.	I saw him again during an attack that took place on the 16th of April, during which attack many refugees were murdered.  Those refugees had sought refuge in that location.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what was the date when you saw Mika for the second time? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe that was the 14th, because the three young ladies had been brought back the day after they had been put on board that vehicle.  I have just stated to you that I saw him again the third time during an attack on the 16th of April against Mugonero hospital, during which attack many people were killed.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, can you --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Kapaya, please. 

MR. KAPAYA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us whether you saw him arrive on the 16th of April or whether you saw him after he had arrived at the complex?
A.	I saw him when he was coming.
Q.	Can you describe to Their Honours how he came?  Was he accompanied by anyone, and the means by which he came?
A.	On the 16th of April, in the morning, at about 7:30 a.m. the assailants arrived in a vehicle and in that vehicle were Ruzindana.  Those inside the vehicle horned, and the gendarmes who were guarding us alighted from the vehicle and went over to Ntakirutimana.  

Shortly thereafter we saw another communal vehicle arrive.  Mika, Sikubwabo and other assailants were on board that vehicle and they also went towards Ntakirutimana.  Thirty or 40 minutes thereafter, the vehicles went back towards Ntakirutimana and that was when the refugees (sic) starting attacking the refugees.  So, in answer to your question, I would say that on that morning of the 16th of April he came on board the vehicle. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Who started attacking who?  I heard from the translation, "the refugees started attacking the refugees"?  Is that what the witness said?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe it was those who were on board the vehicles, those who had come on board the vehicles who started attacking the refugees, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
I was referring to the attack led by Hutu assailants who attacked Tutsi refugees in Mugonero hospital. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Sir, how many vehicles did you see?
A.	The vehicles I saw moving towards Ntakirutimana's are two in number; at least that is what I saw.
Q.	Now, from Ntakirutimana's place to the complex, how many vehicles did you see come to the complex?
A.	The vehicles I saw in Ntakirutimana's house and which went towards the complex were two in number.  Those are the two vehicles that had gone to that house.  I remember that the assailants had started shooting at the refugees. Those are the two vehicles that went to Ntakirutimana's house and I saw return.  I don't know whether other vehicles were parked on the road.  The assailants met us in the school.  I saw only those two vehicles.
Q.	Could you tell us who arrived at the complex?
A.	They came and started shooting at the refugees who were in that area.  The attack started in front of the Adventist association office.  That is how they arrived and started shooting at the refugees. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether he came on foot or on a vehicle? 
A.	They came on board vehicles and parked those vehicles on the road.  They alighted from the vehicles and started shooting at people, and then walking towards them. 
Q.	Now, did you see which of the vehicles Mika alighted from?
A.	After leaving Ntakirutimana's house I did not pay attention to see on what vehicle they were.
Q.	Now, when you saw him in the complex attacking you, how far away were you from him? 
A.	At that time we were very close to the assailants because we had tried to repel the attack by throwing stones at them.  There were about -- we were at a distance of about 30 to 40 metres from the assailants because we didn't know where to seek refuge.
Q.	Now, can you tell us whether Mika was armed and, if so, what type of weapon he had?
A.	Mika was armed with a gun.
Q.	Sir, do you recall whether you saw him use the gun?
A.	He kept on shooting at the people.
Q.	Sir, did you go to any particular place to seek refuge within the complex?
A.	Yes.  When we had been overwhelmed by the assailants, towards the evening the refugees went to seek refuge inside the church while others went into the hospital and I went towards the hospital.
Q.	Now, before you went to the hospital, did you pass any other particular place in the complex?
A.	Before fleeing towards the hospital, I tried to go to the church, and as I tried to get inside the church, there were already assailants there:  Mika, Sikubwabo, Kanyabungu, Ndayisaba, were all there at the church.  I could not get inside the church.
Q.	Did you observe anything while you were at the vicinity of the church?  Did you hear anything?  Did you observe anything? 
A.	While I was there, near the church, I saw and heard something.  The assailants had surrounded the church.  The bourgmestre was standing in front of the door and speaking to the refugees inside the church and saying, "If there are Hutus inside this church, let them come out".
Q.	Sir, did you see anyone come out in response to that call?
A.	Yes, I saw people come out.  Hutu women married to Tutsis were asked to come out.  I saw people come out of that church.  I could identify two young ladies who were married to Tutsis.  Their names were Nyiragwiza (phonetic) and Nyareri (phonetic).  Those were the two women I could identify.  Subsequently, I fled to go and seek refuge elsewhere.
Q.	Sir, do you know whether these two women had children with them?
A.	They abandoned their children inside the church because the Hutu women had been asked to come out alone, and they couldn't accept that these children come out because they were considered as Tutsis.
Q.	Now, after that incident where did you go?
A.	After that incident I went to one of the rooms in the hospital.
Q.	Now, can you tell us whether the members of your family that had accompanied you to the complex survived the attack on the 16th of April?
A.	During that attack on the 16th of April, two of my sisters escaped that massacre, but I didn't see them.  Among family members I saw were my father, who was shot at, and he didn't die so I took him away.
Q.	Right.  Now, after the 16th of April, can you tell us whether you saw Muhimana again?
A.	I saw him again.  I saw him again in another attack that took place subsequently.  The assailants attacked us on Bisesero hill where we had sought refuge.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
THE WITNESS:
That was in a school in Bisesero.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This was four times that you saw Mika?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I believe that was the fourth time I saw him.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us again, Mr. Witness, where  -- the place that you saw him the fourth time?
A.	I saw him during an attack that was launched against Gitwa primary school.
Q.	Now, where is Gitwa primary school located?
A.	Gitwa primary school is situated in Kazirandimwe cellule, which is situated in the former Bisesero secteur. 
Q.	Do you recall for how long you had been in that place before you saw Muhimana come?
A.	If my memory serves me right, we had spent about two weeks in that place because it was in late April.
Q.	Now, can you tell us now how he came, what time of day it was?
A.	The attack was launched at about 9:00 a.m., 9:30 a.m..  We saw a large number of vehicles arrive.  I was unable to know the vehicle on board which he came.  I saw him at a time when the assailants started attacking us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you help us with the date of the fourth attack?
THE WITNESS:
I really can't recall the date.  All I remember is that it was in late April, but I do not remember the date.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Sir, can you tell us how close you were when you saw him attacking you?
A.	When we were attacked, we were in Gitwa primary school.  All of a sudden, we saw on the road from Gisovu many vehicles advancing towards us.  On board those vehicles were many assailants.  Those who were with us advised us not to resist that attack because there were children and wounded persons among us.  They advised us to meet the assailants and to confront that attack.  We met them on Kidashya hill on the border between Gisovu and Gishyita.  Since there was a lot of shooting, other assailants who had traditional weapons prevented us from confronting them and repelling the attack.  They pursued us up to Gitwa and that was where I saw Mika.  We resisted, and the assailants split into two groups.  Mika and his group surrounded the hill so as to attack us from the back.  So we tried to go and repel that other attack from the rear.  That was the group that had surrounded the whole area.  That is when I saw Mika.
Q.	Can you estimate the distance between you and him, in terms of metres, if you can?
A.	Since they were shooting at us, and inasmuch as we could throw stones at them, I believe we were at a distance of about 50 metres from them.  Since we were in a forest where we could hide under the trees, we could go over a distance of about 30 metres.  We didn't go very far from the assailants.
Q.	Apart from Mika, was there anybody else you recognised among the attackers?
A.	I recognised many of them.  I recognised in particular a soldier by the name of Uzia Karibana.  There was a certain Kanyabungu and his sons, including François, who was a soldier, and another who was an Interahamwe.  There was Nyiringango, Ndayisaba, Nyamuhanga.  There was also a communal trainer.  There was an ex-conseiller.  There was a man known as Jacque.  There was also Eliezer Niyitegeka, Jérome Ntakirutimana, Ndimbati.  That attack was composed of many assailants. 
Q.	Sir, can you tell us how long the attack lasted?
A.	That attack lasted a long time, since it started at about 2:30 p.m. and ended at about 4:30 or 5:00 p.m. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreter corrects and says that it started at about 9:00 a.m.. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Right.  Now, did you see Mika leave after the attack?
A.	When the attack ended we gathered on the summit of the hill.  They chased us.  We were jostling with one another.  We therefore could not tell how they went back.  It was much later when we came back to see those who had fallen while they were chasing us that I didn't quite see how they left. 
Q.	Right.  After the end of April' 94, when you saw Mika, do you recall whether you saw him at any other time?
A.	After that attack, I saw him again.
Q.	Can you tell us how many days passed or after how many days following that attack?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you saw Mika once again?  What did you say?  I didn't hear you properly. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I saw him once again.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, this was the fifth time?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, how many days following the Gitwa attack?
A.	I saw him once again four or five days following that Gitwa attack.
Q.	Can you now tell us the location where you saw him?
A.	We had left the place where we used to spend the night after the attack, and went back to Bisesero, and when we went back to Kanyinya in the Uwingabo cellule in the Bisesero secteur, we encountered attacks; they shot at us; there were very many gun shot; they were cutting us off, chasing us; and they brought us to Kazirandimwe from where he left.  And when they brought us back, their vehicles went towards Ngoma to wait for us.  And on that day, they chased us up to the extent that at about 2:00 p.m. when we arrived at the hills from where we could see Nakiyabo, at that spot I saw Mika once again, because there he perpetrated some obscenities.  Because when Mika and Gisambo raped a girl called Mukasine and when they killed the child that the girl was bearing.
Q.	Now, before you saw him, you said at Nakiyabo, you talked about Kanyinya hill; is that correct, Mr. Witness?
A.	That is correct. That is my statement.  In the morning of that day, we saw them first at Kanyinya on the road, quite close to Assiel Kabanda's residence.  They therefore chased us throughout the day, and in the afternoon I saw him again at the place I just mentioned.
Q.	What place is that, Mr. Witness?  Can you repeat the name of the place that you saw him? 
A.	I told you that, in the morning, I saw him at Kanyinya and that they chased us throughout the day shooting at us and cutting us up, and they made us to return to Kazirandimwe, where I saw him.  It was on a hill from where you could see Nakiyabo.
Q.	Now, when did you get to Nakiyabo hill?
A.	That was in the afternoon at about 2:30 or 3:00 p.m. 
Q.	Now, what time did you see Mika come?
A.	Are you talking about when I was at Nakiyabo hill or are you referring to when I was on the other spot during the morning?
Q.	We have moved to Nakiyabo hill now, Mr. Witness.  I am asking you the time you saw Mika while you were seeking refuge at Nakiyabo hill. 
A.	Thank you.  I said that between 2.30 and 3 p.m..
Q.	Now, can you tell us how he came there, whether he was alone or whether he was accompanied by anybody?
A.	As I said before, they were in a major attack; they were chasing people.  And when I reached that place, I was tired.  People were well-worn, so I hid in a bush.  They came chasing people who were behind us, and it was at that moment that he and Gisambo took the girl called Helena raped her, raped the girl called very Veren (phonetic), and he was with other people. 
Q.	Witness, I am not sure I got the name or the names of the girls you are referring to.  Could you tell us the name of the lady -- ladies you are referring to?
A.	That girl was called Mukasine. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us whether you found her there or whether she found you there?
A.	That girl found me there.  I had hidden in the bush and they were chasing the other refugees; so she came at a time when I was already in my hiding place.
Q.	Did you see -- did she come alone or did she come with somebody you knew?
A.	She came with other persons that I knew and others that I did not know.  It was a group of people who were being chased.
Q.	Now, can you tell us what happened after Mika had arrived at the place?
A.	They seized the girl who was carrying a baby, and they caught her while she was fleeing; and after capturing the girl, Gisambo, from five metres, shot the child, and Mika made the girl to lie down, tore off her clothes and raped her; and after having raped her, he killed her.  And after that, they went about chasing other refugees.
Q.	Sir, you say that you saw Mika rape this woman.  What did you see him do that you describe as rape?
A.	After having captured the girl he talked to her, but I did not hear what they were saying.  And, apparently, the girl was answering using very soulful words.  Mika didn't want to listen, and immediately he tore off her clothes and raped her.
Q.	When you say he raped her, what did you see that makes you say that he raped her?
A.	He tore her clothes, made her lie down and raped her; and after that, he killed her. 
Q.	How did he rape her, Mr. Witness?
A.	He raped her because the girl didn't want it.
Q.	Didn't want what?
A.	He seized the girl, brutally forced her to lie down, tore off her clothes.  The girl was screaming, and Mika brought down his trousers and had sexual intercourse with the girl, after which he killed her.
Q.	Sir, how far away were you when you observed this?
A.	I was very close in a nearby bush and they were about five to -- 10 to 15 metres from me. 
Q.	Now, after this incident, can you -- sorry, let me ask you this.  Had you known Mukasine before that day, sir?
A.	I knew her.
Q.	Can you tell us where she lived, what she did for a living?
A.	She used to live in the Ngoma secteur in Uwingabo secteur and she was a student in the nursing school of Mugonero.
Q.	Do you know her parents, where they lived, what they did? 
A.	Her parents used to live in the same locality that I have already mentioned.  Her mother was a housewife and her father a hospital employee.
Q.	Do you know the name of her father or mother -- the names of her parents?
A.	(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  I cannot recall her mother's name.
Q.	And what did her father do, if you knew?
A.	He was the accountant of the hospital.
Q.	Do you know the full name of her father?
A.	I think that I know his two names.
Q.	Can you tell us the names, please?  Can you announce the names?
A.	(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) 
Q.	And how had you known -- (microphones overlapping)?
A.	I knew him well before.  (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) 
Q.	Did you know somebody called Issacar Kajongi?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	What did he do for a living?
A.	I think that he was the accountant of the Adventist association.
Q.	And where were the offices of the Adventist association located, where this man worked?
A.	Their office was located at Ngoma, close to the nursing school.
Q.	Was it within the Mugonero complex?
A.	Yes, it was in the Mugonero complex.
Q.	Now, following the rape and killing of Mukasine, can you tell us whether anything happened to you?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, before you go on, the witness ***************************************************************. *************************************************.  What does that mean? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)
JUDGE SHORT:
I was concerned about disclosing that. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
Yes, I thought that piece of evidence should be put under seal. 
JUDGE SHORT:
That was my concern. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That portion of the protected information be deleted from the record then and kept under seal. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
Thank you, Your Honours. 

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, sir, after the Nakiyabo incident, can you tell us whether you saw Muhimana again?
A.	I saw Muhimana after the Nakiyabo incident.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That will be the sixth time?
MR. KAPAYA: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that was the sixth time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where did he see Mika for the sixth time?  Could you help us again with the location?
THE WITNESS:
When I saw Mika again it was on a Bisesero hill called Gisoro where he found us while I was with a certain Thomas.  He arrested us and on that day I saw Mika again. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us why he arrested you?
A.	We were hiding at a place and they stopped us and they asked us from where we were coming.  We answered their question, and they asked us if we knew a certain Antoine Nzamurambaho and they asked us whether we knew where he was, and I said I knew where he was hiding but that at that very hour I did not know where he was.  Now, they asked us if we could show them the hiding place.  We said yes, if they wouldn't kill us.  So, we went up towards where their car was parked where we found a certain Rachel, that was nicknamed Mugogwe because she had come from Ruhengeri where the Mugogwists lived, and then they made us go down to Gishyita and there they put us in one of Mika's houses -- in Mika's house and locked us up.  We could not know where they had taken the girl, and the next day they made us enter a car to go and show them where Nzamurambaho was hiding.  And when we reached Bisesero, they asked us -- or we asked them to stop.  We went down towards a wood pretending that we were going to show them Antoine's hiding place, and a few metres later when we reached a forest, we tried to escape, but Thomas was shot down, and I was able to escape.
Q.	Sir, can you tell us the type or whose car that you boarded after Mika and company arrested you or captured you, for that matter?
A.	They carried us in a Toyota car.
Q.	Whose car was that?
A.	The car was the Gishyita communal car.
Q.	Do you know the people who accompanied Mika on that occasion?
A.	I was able to identify in particular Ruzindana, Sikubwabo and many others.
Q.	Now, in that car, what part of the car did you board?
A.	They carried us on the back portion of the car.  We were with Interahamwes and the soldiers who are carrying guns.
Q.	And where did Mika -- what part of the car did Mika board?
A.	Mika was in the cabin, while we were in rear.
Q.	Now, you say that he wanted you to show him a person called Antoine Nzamurambaho.  Now, did you know this person, Antoine Nzamurambaho?
A.	Yes, I knew Antoine Nzamurambaho.
Q.	What was he -- what was his ethnic group?  What did he do for a living?
A.	Nzamurambaho was a trader in the Gishyita commercial centre.  As for his ethnic group, I think he was Tutsi.
Q.	Do you know why -- did Mika tell you why he was looking for this particular gentleman?
A.	He didn't tell me why he was looking for this man, but I could understand why he was looking for him.
(Pages 1 to 16 by Judith Baverstock)


























	1100H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Why was he looking for him? 
A.	In my view, he was looking for them just as they were looking for other Tutsis, that is, to kill them.  But they were looking for him particularly because he was a Tutsi intellectual, since that was what was happening and they were looking for intellectuals and traders and others who were treated as the accomplices of the Inkotanyis.  So Antoine was sought after because he was a trader, and Ruzindana wanted to kill him because he had seized his car. 
Q.	Now, after you had escaped from Mika on this occasion, did you see him again for the seventh time?
A.	I saw him again. 
Q.	How long was it after your capture and escape? 
A.	That was sometime later, I would say three or four days later.
Q.	Which month was this, Mr. Witness? 
A.	This was still in the month of May. 
Q.	Now, could this have been in early May, middle May or late May? 
A.	I think it was still in the middle of the month of May.
Q.	Now, can you tell us where you saw him this time? 
A.	When I saw him on this occasion, he was still in Bisesero.  When we climbed Rumarabamba hill -- when we arrived at Kanyinya, we saw refugees because the assailants had not yet arrived.  But all of a sudden, we saw a vehicle that was coming from below and in this vehicle there were a few soldiers in the back of the vehicle.  We stopped for a while to see what was going to happen.  The vehicle arrived, parked 30 or 40 metres away from the place where we were.  The people who were in the vehicle came out.   Mika called us.  He asked us to come close to him.  We refused and he said, "Did you recognise us?"  The old people who said to him -- who were with him said, "No, we did not recognise you." And he said, "Listen, we are coming to reassure you, to tell you that there will be no more problems.  Go and gather all the sick people and the fugitives, let us meet at Mubuga school, and we are going to provide you with food and medicine."  After having said that, they asked us to meet with them very early tomorrow morning.  They turned around with their vehicle and they went away.
Q.	Did they tell you where you were to meet with the wounded and the sick the next day -- the next morning? 
A.	Yes, they told us that we would meet in the Mubuga primary school. 
Q.	Did you go to Mubuga primary school the next day, Witness? 
A.	We never went there because we realised that it was a trap that had been laid for us, because a person like Mika or Ruzindana, considering what they had done against us, could not have come to our aid.  It was rather a way of gathering us and exterminating us at that place. 
Q.	Also you have described six occasions where Mika came with -- where you met Mika, and on all the six occasions he attacked you.  Now, where did you get the courage to go near him this time at Kanyinya hill, when he told you to bring the wounded and the sick -- to take the wounded and the sick to Mubuga school?  Where did you get the courage to go near this person who had been attacking you all along? 
A.	We did not approach them.  They asked us to come to them but we refused.  We simply stood there.  It is true that we did not run away but we did not approach them, considering that they were not many; they were only with a few soldiers and since they were soldiers, we thought that it would be best to die and if we had to die, we would have died following shots by bullets. 
Q.	After the incident at Kanyinya, did you see Mika again? 
A.	Thank you.  When you ask me whether I met him -- whether I saw him again, it is true that I saw him because the next day the promises of food and medicine were changed into an attack, because on that next day we suffered a large-scale attack. 
Q.	And where was that?  What is the location of that place, Mr. Witness? 
A.	During this attack, we were in Kazirandemwe cellule where we went to spend the night.  Very early in the morning, when we were going to gather on Muyira hill where we used to meet.  We came across the assailants in Cyapa.  They had arrived very early in the morning, so this attack took place in Muyira.  Many people were killed at this place. 
Q.	Sir, can you tell me what time you got to Muyira hill? 
A.	When we arrived in Muyira, it was in the morning between eight o'clock and nine o'clock in the morning. 
Q.	And when did Mika arrive and by what means? 
A.	I am not able to tell you by what means he arrived because the assailants came very early.  When I arrived, the vehicles were already parked.  There were many of them.  The assailants were there but I do not know by what vehicle he came, but when I arrived at about 8:30, I found them there. 
Q.	Apart from Mika, could you recognise other people -- other assailants?
A.	On that day, there were many people.  I was able to recognise some of them, including the former bourgmestre of Gishyita commune, the bourgmestre of the former Gisovu commune, the préfet, Minister Eliezer Niyitegeka, Musema, the assistant bourgmestre called Kananira, secteur conseillers of the Gishyita commune, including Mika, Vincent Rutaganira was there.  There were many people, for example, Ntakirutimana.  To tell you the truth, it was an extra ordinary attack because amongst the assailants there were people who spoke poor Kinyarwanda who really looked like Kirundi; that is a dialect that is spoken in the north of the country.  There were people who came on board trucks of the Colas company.  Let me tell you, there were so many people. 
Q.	Sir, how then were you able to recognise Mika among so many people? 
A.	First, when I saw him in Cyapa, we went up to a little wood and we came face to face with the assailants, and I also saw him when the assailants began to shoot at us in the Muyira attack.  There were also Interahamwe who were prepared to attack us with machetes.  It is on this occasion that I saw him clearly. 
Q.	Could you tell whether he was armed? 
A.	Yes, he was armed. 
Q.	Armed with what, and did he use that arm? 
A.	He was armed with a gun and he used it. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long that attack lasted? 
A.	The attack lasted for a long time because it stopped at about 4:30 p.m. 
Q.	Could you tell us whether you saw people wounded or killed? 
A.	As I have told you, it was a large-scale attack.  All the survivors of Bisesero cannot forget this attack.  Many people were killed on that day.  Among them, there were people whom I knew.  Others whom I did not know, they were wounded.  Many people were killed on that day. 
Q.	Now, after the attack, where did you go? 
A.	At the end of this attack late in the afternoon, the survivors felt lonely.  We tried to rise and go to the places where we usually spent the night and possibly to see whether there were other survivors, and I went to this place till the next day. 
Q.	Can you tell us what happened the next day? 
A.	On the next day, there was also a similar attack.
Q.	When you say similar attack, can you tell us what you mean? 
A.	By that I mean that it was an attack during which we saw many assailants.  It was also a large-scale attack as the one that had preceded it. 
Q.	And where did this one take place? 
A.	This attack also took place in Muyira, but considering that the refugees were much weakened and that we felt that everything was over, the assailants attacked us with firearms.  We were not able to defend ourselves because many refugees had died.  We tried to defend ourselves but in vain and we ran away toward Kiziba hill, quite close to Karongi in the former Gitesi commune.  When we arrived there, the vehicles of the assailants came to stop us.  We were shot at.  We were pushed back to the place where we had been before.  The assailants were waiting for us in Kiraro on the Gitesi boundary -- on the Gitesi-Gisovu boundary.  Many people fell at this place and the bodies formed a sort of barrier that prevented water from flowing, and the little river that was there became changed into a river of blood. 
Q.	Now, did you see Muhimana on this second day attack? 
A.	On that day I saw Mika.
Q.	Where did you see him? 
A.	I saw him on Muyira hill. 
Q.	Did you see him arrive? 
A.	When he arrived, I saw him because on that morning, we had gone to bury the bodies of the people who had died and we were trying to evacuate the wounded and we were surprised by the assailants, and at that time I saw Mika. 
Q.	How far were you from him when you saw him? 
A.	It was a distance of about 30 metres from him.  The assailants came from below the hill.  They were singing; others were singing Power, others were saying, "We should exterminate them."  I was above them on the hill, about 30 or 40 metres away. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am completely disturbed by the turn that the examination-in-chief is taking.  It's been 20 minutes since we have -- since questions have been put regarding events that are not mentioned anywhere in the statements that have been forwarded to us.  Does the Prosecution have hidden statements that contain the dates of the 13th and the 14th of May? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, my examination-in-chief on this subject relates to the witness statements of 25th October, page 5, on the paragraph -- on the first paragraph, the last three sentences in the first paragraph, where it starts with, "I went up to a hill and met other refugees."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are referring to which statement, Mr. Kapaya? 
MR. KAPAYA:
The statement of the 25th of October, Your Honours.  The 25th of October 1999.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You say page 4?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, page 5.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Page 5.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, the sentence beginning with "I went up to a hill", and that is the second sentence from the bottom of paragraph 1. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, are you using the binder?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The second last sentence of the first paragraph? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, have you found the relevant portion of the paragraph? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Madam President.  The closest -- the passage that seems to resemble the one that he refers to the most refers to the Gitwa primary school.  And on the next day, mention is made of an attack of many Interahamwe.  And there at that point there is no change in site, we are still in Gitwa.  So I do not understand why we are hearing about Muyira and events spanning two days whereas in Gitwa, it was the next day and after that, nothing else.  And then we see Nyakiyaru, I do not see where this testimony about the two days in Muyira comes from, which this is why I asked you, Madam President, whether there are any hidden statements, in which case, such statements should be forwarded to the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, can you explain, where we are now?  We are in Muyira hill?  
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  It cannot refer to the part where learned counsel has referred to because that was well during the first part.  The Gitwa primary school events happened in late April, the witness has testified.  

Now, as to the events he is testifying to now, they happened.  The witness and one Thomas were captured by the Accused person, taken to Gishyita and then they escaped.  Then after he has escaped, that is when he says he started going from one hill to another hill.  And counsel will also realise -- will also find out during cross-examination when he reached this place -- when he will ask the witness as to which hills did he go to, this is what the witness is going to tell him.  So, it is after the capture of the witness and the shooting of Thomas with whom he was captured that we come to this part of the testimony.  And that is why I say it is these last two sentences in the first paragraph of this statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the witness in his written statement of 25th October 1999, he did say that, "We tried to escape by running into the forest.  Mika Muhimana shot Thomas to death and I managed to escape.  I went up to the hill and met other refugees.  I kept on hiding and running from one hill to another until the arrival of the French troops on 28th June in 1994."  So he was hiding and running from one hill to another. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I can see the passage, and that is all very well, because we have three lines that say this and nothing else.  "I went to a hill where I met other refugees.  I continued to hide and to move from one hill to the other until the arrival of the French troops on the 28th of June 1994."  That is all that is said.  I do not see any of the attacks spanning three days, and how can the witness state that he saw the Accused a seventh and eighth time, and it is entirely possible that a ninth time is in sight.  From these lines, you will recognise that those two lines cannot generate the events that span two or three days; it is not possible.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
The question is whether you have given sufficient details of what took place on these hills where the witness escaped to.  Counsel's objection is that all this evidence which spans over two or three days about attacks which took place in Muyira hill, he has not been given sufficient details about them.  You are referring to one or two sentences where he says that he went up a hill, met other refugees and he kept hiding and running from one hill to another.  Do you think that is sufficient details about this particular evidence that the witness is giving? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, when we take into account that a statement is but a summary of the events that took place over a period of over 90 days.  

Further, this witness had testified in Niyitegeka as GGY and in Ntakirutimana case as Witness YY.  In both -- in his testimony in those cases, the transcripts of which has been disclosed to Defence counsel, he talks at length about the attack on Muyira hill on the 13th and the 14th of May 1994.  So learned counsel has more than sufficient notice of what the witness is talking about now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, have you received copies of those transcripts in the other cases? 
MR. SONGA:
We have copies of those other cases and we state that the witness did not talk about these events in relation to Mika Muhimana.  What is more, Madam President, in what is called a reconfirmation of the witness statement -- the Prosecutor says that he went into the field to request a reconfirmation of the statement.  All of what is being said in these three days, regarding these three days does not appear in this reconfirmation, which is why, Madam President, we maintain or we uphold our objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we have the copies of those transcripts?  
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  They are dated -- in the Ntakirutimana case they are from the 1st to 3rd October 2001, and in the Niyitegeka case, they are from the 14th and 15th of August 2002.  The witness -- I have gone through the transcripts that you talk at length about the attacks and Muyira hill on 13th and 14th of 
	May 1994. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Were those statements before the Court in other cases, the witness had talked about Mika, Mika's involvement in the --
MR. KAPAYA:
It mentions that among the attackers was Mika, Kayishema and the rest of the people.  Mika is specifically mentioned as one of people who took part in the attacks. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, can you mention the -- identify the particular dates?  
MR. KAPAYA:
The date of the transcript, Your Honour.  Yes, the Ntakirutimana transcripts are dated 1st, 2nd and 3rd October 2001 and the Niyitegeka transcripts are dated 14th and 15th August 2002. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, can you identify the particular portions of the transcript on which you are leading the witness?
MR. KAPAYA:
I cannot do it offhand, Your Honour.  But I read them.  I can do it in the course of the day, if 
Your Honour pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break for 15 minutes, and will you please try to bring those transcripts. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, I will do that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
	(Court recessed from 1130H to 1205H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing in the court is resumed.

Mr. Kapaya, do we have the transcripts of 2nd October 2001 in Ntakirutimana and transcripts of 14th of August 2002 in Niyitegeka?  
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, they are on pages -- in Ntakirutimana's, it is 2nd October, pages 46 to 52 of the Ntakirutimana transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Forty-six to 52?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  And according to our research, I mean, to the documents I obtained.  And then in Niyitegeka, there are transcripts of 14th of August 2002, pages 37 to 40.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A K-reference?
MR. KAPAYA:
A K-reference to this attack is made in several pages of the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have extra copies for us?  
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I have prepared copies, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. KAPAYA:
Shall I continue, Your Honours? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have first to certify that, to go through the statements.  We are in Muyira now, at the moment?  
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, we are on Muyira hill.  Actually, we had finished.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, are you now satisfied that the transcripts that you were provided with contain all the evidence that the witness is testifying about concerning your client? 
MR. SONGA:
I am satisfied, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you withdraw your objection? 
MR. SONGA:
I do withdraw it, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Mr. Kapaya, please proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, lest I forget, I tender the transcripts of Ntakirutimana pages 46 to 52 as Prosecution Exhibit P. 24 and Niyitegeka transcript -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, please.  Ntakirutimana transcript of 2nd October 2001, pages 46 to --

MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, we were just talking about the attacks on Muyira on the 13th and 14th of May when you say you saw Mika Muhimana.  After that day, did you -- after the 14th of May, did you see Muhimana again for the rest of the days? 
A.	After that date, I don't think I saw Muhimana again. 
Q.	Right.  Now when did you know Mr. Muhimana for the first time? 
A.	I knew Mika Muhimana for the first time before the genocide.  I think that was in 1989 until 1990. 
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which you knew him in those years? 
A.	I knew him as a resident of Gishyita, and who was conseiller of the secteur and a trader in the Gishyita centre.  I knew him therefore because I used to go there.
Q.	Where did you say he lived when you knew him?
A.	He lived at the Gishyita commercial centre at the place called Cyanya C-Y-A-N-Y-A. 
Q.	Now, very briefly, Mr. Witness, can you tell us as conseiller, what would you say his powers in relation to his people in the secteur were? 
A.	As conseiller, he was the leader of the population of that secteur.  He is the one who represented the central administration at that level of the secteur.  He was known by all the inhabitants of the secteur because each member of the population that had a problem had to see him to solve the problem.  

So you can see that he had authority and power over the members of the population.  He is the one who represented them, and he is the one who had to forward the problems of the population to the higher authorities.  He also had to bring instructions from the higher authority to the population. 
Q.	How did Mr. Muhimana look like when you last saw him?  Can you describe his features?
A.	The last time that I saw him, he was tall, a person with a light skin and the last time that I saw him -- you see, he looked like a criminal because when I looked at him, there was nothing human about him any more.

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, would you be able to recognise him if you saw him today?
A.	Somebody you know by his actions, even if he died and was resurrected, you can't fail to recognise him.
Q.	Do you see anybody who looks like Mika Muhimana in this courtroom? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who looks like?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Do you recognise anyone as Mika Muhimana in this courtroom?
A.	He's there.  He's present in this courtroom.  I do not think that any person in this hall could resemble him.
Q.	Can you tell us where?  Can you point out who that person you have described as Mikal Muhimana is located in the courtroom?
A.	I can see him to my left.  He's in a row where there is a person with a black gown, he is behind him and he's wearing a black skull cap.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may the record reflect that the witness has identified the Accused person?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has identified the Accused.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Thank you, Witness.  That's all I have for you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by Defence Counsel representing Mika.  Please try to understand the questions and answer them briefly.  Mr. Songa, you have the floor for cross-examination.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I wish, Madam President, to request that we have a closed session for a few minutes at the beginning of my examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, we hope you have no objection.
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are in open session now.  Make sure that your identity is not disclosed.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 25 October 1999 you made a statement before the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Can you recall that?
A.	I can't recall the exact date, but I know that I made a statement before the investigators you have just referred to.
Q.	Did you have the opportunity of signing that statement?
A.	The investigators came, they questioned me, and then they came back subsequently.  It is then that I tendered my signature to declare my statement.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  During this year have you been contacted by the Prosecutor to confirm your statement of 25 October 1999?
A.	Yes, I was visited by the Prosecutor and we had held discussions.
Q.	Did he give you the opportunity of confirming or of rectifying your statement of 25 October 1999?
A.	I did not have enough time to rectify my statement, but I showed him certain passages that had not been written down by the person who had my statement.
Q.	Were you able to verify the notes that the Prosecutor took after this passage?  Did he show you a document?
A.	Since I talked with the Prosecutor, nothing has changed on my statement.
Q.	Do you confirm it, subject to the corrections that you indicated to the Prosecutor?
A.	I have just told you that the copy of my statement that I received had not changed so I signed on the appended form, that is the form detailing my particulars.  But I did not sign the statement itself, because I noticed that nothing had been changed.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are talking about the 9th of April 1994.  Do you remember the events that marked this day of 9th April 1994?
A.	I did not know that someone would be asking me questions about these events for me to note them, but I remember, however, certain events that happened on that day because such historic events cannot be forgotten.
Q.	And what are these events of the 9th of April that you remember, Mr. Witness?
A.	I remember that on that date we sought refuge in Mugonero hospital.
Q.	What did you experience prior to going to Mugonero hospital?  What event caused you to go to Mugonero hospital?
A.	The killings had begun in the region.  Our neighbours had been attacked and their home had been destroyed and is the reason why we sought refuge in Mugonero.
Q.	Who attacked your neighbours on that date of the 9th of April?
A.	It is the Hutu who started massacring the Tutsis.
Q.	When you state that the neighbours were attacked, do you imply that you yourself had not been the object of any attacks?
A.	Yes, we left our home before the attacks reached us.
Q.	Did you see the assailants, that is the assailants who were attacking you on the (unintelligible) on the 9th of April?
A.	We could see them because it was during the daytime.
Q.	How many were they?
A.	Counsel, you're asking me a difficult question there because the assailants did not come from just one place.  What I remember is that an attack had been launched against Kamaraba (phonetic) cellule and people were killed.  Other attacks had been launched against an Adventist church in Gishyita.  All of that had happened.  And it was after these events that we took flight because we felt our end was near.
Q.	Were you witness to these two attacks?
A.	The attacks on Karenge and Kamareba had left victims from amongst our family, and the survivors of this attack took flight and they told us what happened. 

Regarding the Gishyita attack, I saw it.  The assailants attacked refugees who were in the church, and you see, it was during the daytime.  It was not at night.
Q.	Where were you, Witness, when you witnessed the Gishyita attack?
A.	Madam President, I think that if I name all the hills of the region where I resided, it might reveal my identity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you insist on the answer?
MR. SONGA:
No, I shall try to ask the question differently, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how far were you from the place where the Gishyita attack was occurring?
A.	If I were to make an estimate, the distance between the place where I was and the place where the assailants were, there were four to five kilometres.  This happened on two opposing hills.
Q.	And you're telling us now that four kilometres away you could see what was happening?
A.	Yes, I could see it because if you see an attack of 100 persons who are chasing other persons, it's visible because it was during the daytime.
Q.	And four kilometres away you were able to identify one assailant or another?
A.	From four kilometres away I was not able to identify the assailants who were chasing the victims, but those who were being chased came in our direction and told us who it is who was pursuing them and they quoted some names.
Q.	Then, Witness, we take it that you did not see the Gishyita attack.
A.	I do not know why you want me to understand that I was not a witness to this attack.  You are an adult, you can see people on a mountain.  I saw them on this hill, but I did not identify them.  It is the people who were chasing us -- who were being chased that told us who was doing that that I did see them.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When did you go to the Mugonero complex?
A.	I arrived at the Mugonero complex in the middle of the day of that date.  When I arrived at Mugonero I realised that the atmosphere was not good, and I returned to the place where I was.  We stayed there until the end of the day.  Towards evening we went back to Mugonero hospital, and we arrived there towards 5 p.m.
Q.	You mean that on the 9th of April you went to Mugonero complex twice?
A.	From the place where we lived to the centre, to the Mugonero commercial centre, one has to pass through the complex.  For the second time, we went there to seek refuge.
Q.	At what time did you begin your first trip to Mugonero?
A.	It was between 11:30 and 12:30, because when I went back home I arrived at about 2 p.m.
Q.	How long was this trip?
A.	It was not a great distance.  I would say that it was about three kilometres, only.  It was a short distance.
Q.	Were you alone?
A.	No.
Q.	Who accompanied you?
A.	We were with our neighbours.
Q.	Were your neighbours Tutsi or Hutu?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	And how many of you were going to Mugonero complex at that time?
A.	I was with two other boys, so there were three of us.
Q.	From a security viewpoint, what had most prevailed on your way to Mugonero?
A.	There was no security because our neighbours had changed to such an extent that when you greeted them you realised that they had changed.  There was no safety.  What is more, the gendarmes, who were there, prevented people from gathering.  In particular, when people greeted each other, the gendarmes reprimanded them.  So the security situation was not at all good.
Q.	What was the object of your trip to Mugonero?
A.	We were going to Mugonero to obtain certain things.
Q.	Did you experience or were you witness to any particular incident on your way to Mugonero or on your way back?
A.	I would say that we experienced one particular incident, considering that we were unable to purchase what we sought because gendarmes came, and when we passed they were hitting people.  So we were not able to buy what we had set out to buy.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And the second trip to Mugonero, when did this happen?  Or when did it begin?
A.	We left our homes at about 4 p.m. and we arrived at Mugonero at about 5 p.m., or 5:30 p.m.
Q.	Let us go back in time, still on that date of the 9th of April, when you saw the Gishyita attack.  What time was that?
A.	If I were to make an estimate, I would say that it was between 10 o'clock and 10:30.
Q.	Thank you.  When you went to Mugonero for the second time, who were you accompanied by?
A.	I was with my parents, my brothers and sisters, and many other neighbours.
Q.	What situation did you meet or did you find on the evening of 9th April in Mugonero complex?
A.	I think you yourself understand this.  There were refugees.  You understand under what circumstances people were there.  They were there with their children and their livestock.  The situation was not at all good.  What made it worse, even, was that those people who were supposed to come and provide us security treated us brutally and asked us why we were running away.  And a few minutes later they gathered us, they made some people go into the church and they began to search people one by one.  So the situation was not good.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What was your night in Mugonero like?
A.	We spent the night on a piece of land, and day came.
Q.	And when, at sunrise, it was the 10th of April, something happened on this 10th day of April?
A.	On the 10th there was no particular incident.
Q.	And what happened on the 11th?
A.	I don't think anything, in particular, occurred on the 11th, except for the fact that our water and electricity supply had been cut off, so we were in the dark.
Q.	How did you feed yourself during these three days?
A.	During these three days people could eat what they had brought from their homes.
Q.	In your statement of 25th October 1990 you told us what happened three days afterwards, which means the 13th of April.  You state as follows: "Three days later Obed Ruzindana came to Mugonero complex in search of a Gishitya businessman called Mzamurambaho; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  He came to the complex on board a vehicle that he parked in the hospital parking lot and spoke to a health assistant called Nyamagabu.  He pushed him in front of him and ordered Nzamurambaho and he had his gun pressed into the nape of Nyamagabu.  We thought he was going to kill him.  Nyamagabu, for his part, told him that he did not know where he was and that he was not in the hospital.  And Obed answered, "You are lying, he will not escape me."  He went away again and he took his vehicle from the hospital parking lot in order to do so.
Q.	Was he alone?
A.	No, he was with two soldiers and another person in civilian dress.  This person was called Gichary.  He was with a certain Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana.  Those are the people whom I can remember.
Q.	What was Ruzindana's vehicle like?
A.	The vehicle on board which he arrived was a yellow Toyota.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that on the following day, which is certainly the 14th of April, you saw 
Mika Muhimana, conseiller of Gishyita; is that correct?
A.	I said that it was either the 13th or the 14th.  The truth is that I saw him.
Q.	At what time did you see him, Mr. Witness?
A.	It was in the afternoon between 1 and 2 p.m.
Q.	Who accompanied him?
A.	They came with a different look of an attack that was launched against the hospital.  They were in the company of several persons.  When I immediately saw him he was with Sikubwabo, Gisambo, and a certain Dyasaba also arrived and there were two gendarmes.
Q.	Can you say how many civilians were with them?
A.	Frankly, if I were to tell you their number, I would be making a mistake.  I was not able to count them, but if I were to estimate those who were on the hill, there were between 100 and 150 persons.
Q.	And how far were you from Mika when he arrived?
A.	I beg your pardon.  Would you please repeat the question because he arrived at a place when he was with gendarmes, and subsequently he arrived somewhere where he was part of an attack.  Would you tell me what you are referring to?
Q.	My question is on the distance between yourself and Mika when you saw him for the first time and the place to which Mika arrived.  When you saw him for the first time, what distance separated you?
A.	It was 40 metres away, if I were to make an estimate.
Q.	At what precise location in the hospital were you?
A.	He was standing in front of the Adventist association office, whereas I was standing at the entrance to the nursing school in Mugonero or where the nursing school is found at this time.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have talked of the Interahamwe who were accompanying Mika, Sikubwabo and Gisambo.  What is an Interahamwe, in your view? 
A.	What I call Interahamwe in these attacks are people who were part of the civil society and during the events we saw them using military equipment.
Q.	Were they organised in a particular manner?
A.	You would understand that there was an organisation.  They had military equipment, guns, grenades.
Q.	Were they wearing any particular attire?
A.	During the attack at Mugonero they were not wearing any particular attire.  They were in civilian attire, but they were armed with guns and grenades.
Q.	Were there women among the Interahamwe?
A.	During the attack at Mugonero I did not see any women armed with guns and grenades.
Q.	You state, Witness, that Muhimana,  Sikubwabo and Gisambo had guns; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What kind of guns were they?
A.	They were long guns.  I would estimate that the length was between 80 centimetres and one metre, one metre 20 centimetres.
Q.	Were all those guns all the same make?
A.	I do not know the different makes of guns.
Q.	I was asking whether they were identical.
A.	I had the impression that those guns were identical.
Q.	The three persons that you have mentioned, were they the only people who were carrying guns?
A.	I made mention of those three people during that attack because they were the ones who were close to me, who came close to me.
Q.	Witness, you state that the assailants spoke with the gendarmes before taking three girls away.  Where, exactly, did they speak to those gendarmes?
A.	If you remember, I stated that they spoke to one another in front of the Adventist association office and then they moved up to the building where those girls were.
Q.	If I understood your statement correctly, that building is in Kiyovu; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That building is situated in an area known as Kiyovu.
Q.	How far was Kiyovu from where you were?
A.	If I were to make an estimate of the distance between where I was in Kiyovu and the other location, I would say that it's about 80 metres.  That is from where I was when I saw Mika alight from -- they came down up to the point where the rectory of the nursing school is. 

So, from that building to where I was, the distance was about 50 metres.
Q.	At that time how many girls were in Kiyovu?
A.	That is a difficult question for me to answer.  To ask me how many girls were in Kiyovu would be a very difficult question to answer.  This was a very vast area.  I knew only those three girls.  I did not know all the names of all the girls in Kiyovu.
Q.	The number of girls in Kiyovu.  I hope you understand what I am saying.  I am referring to the building in Kiyovu where those girls were.  Were there any other girls, apart from those three?
A.	I don't think there were any other girls.
Q.	Was it not a boarding school?
A.	No.
Q.	Tell us, what, exactly, was that place?
A.	There are houses in Kiyovu in which hospital workers are lodged.
Q.	Thank you.  You stated, witness, that after speaking to the gendarmes the three persons you mentioned awhile ago took Martha, Mariana and Josiana away.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	In a Prosecution document prepared after the audio-video this year, mention is made of Maria.  Could you please clarify for us whether it is Maria or Maryann or Marianna?
A.	I only made mention of Marie. Thank you.
Q.	If we have understood you correctly, Martha and Marianna are the daughters of a person known as Gafurafura; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And who is Gafurafura?
A.	I did not very well know Gafurafura because I know the house of a certain Gafurafura.  I believe he is dead.  I did not know him very well.
Q.	How did you know that those girls were the daughters of Gafurafura?
A.	I had known them well before then.
Q.	Could you please give us the other names of Martha?
A.	I do not know the other names.
Q.	Could you give us the other names of Marianna?
A.	I did not know the other names of Marianna.
Q.	And who was Josiana, Witness?
A.	I did not know the other name of that girl.
Q.	How about her parents?
A.	I did not know her parents.
Q.	How did you know that the last girl was known as Josiana?
A.	I knew the name because I had gone to where they were and subsequently I got to know her name.
Q.	Do you mean that you went to Kiyovu?
A.	Yes, I also went to Kiyovu while we were in another hideout.
Q.	When did you go to Kiyovu?
A.	Before those girls were arrested, I had been to Kiyovu.  And when they were taken to their homes, I also was in Kiyovu.
Q.	Did you go to Kiyovu or you went to the house of those girls?
A.	I went to the home of those girls, and I also went into the neighbourhood of Kiyovu.
Q.	Witness, what time was it when those girls were brought back?
A.	It was in the afternoon at about 3 p.m., 3:30 p.m.
Q.	Who was driving the car on board which those girls were brought back?
A.	I didn't get close enough to the vehicle to see who was in the car when those girls were brought back, but I believe it was Sikubwabo.
Q.	But you did not see Sikubwabo at the steering of that vehicle?
A.	Well, you would understand that if I didn't get close to that vehicle I couldn't see who was driving it, since I wasn't on board that vehicle.
Q.	Did you see the seats on which those girls were sitting in the vehicle?
A.	I didn't pay attention when they were put on board the vehicle.  I was not behind them.  They were taken out of Kiyovu and led to the point where the vehicle was parked in front of the association office.  But I believe they were in the rear of the vehicle, since there couldn't have been enough seats for everyone in the front of the car.
Q.	We take it, therefore, that you did not see the particular seats on which they sat.  

Witness, when you state that it took them to Gishyita, who gave you information regarding that destination?
A.	The persons concerned told us where they had been taken to.
Q.	Do you mean that you heard that later?
A.	Yes, it was afterwards that we knew exactly where they were led.  But initially they were put on board the vehicle, the vehicle turned around.  We didn't know where they were taken to.  It was only subsequently we heard where they were taken to.
Q.	Did you see the girls return?
A.	Yes, I saw them return.
Q.	Where were you?
A.	I was in Mugonero.
Q.	That is certainly true, but where in Mugonero were you?
A.	When they returned, I was standing below one of the buildings at the hospital we use as a pharmacy, and I was very close to the road.  I saw the vehicle bringing back those girls.
Q.	Where were they taken back to, where you were or to Kiyovu?
A.	They were brought back -- the car was parked in front of the association office and the young girls went back to Kiyovu.  The vehicle made an about-turn.
Q.	And when did you speak with them?
A.	After the girls returned, everybody was keen to know from where they were coming, because we thought they had been killed, so we immediately went up to them to ask them what had happened.
Q.	When you state, Witness, that you went to see what happened, "you", or "we", who do you mean?
A.	It was myself and other refugees who were there.
Q.	How many of you went to them?
A.	To tell you the truth, in asking your question you are giving the impression that I went there as a journalist with a camera.  Bear in mind that I was not alone.  There were many of us.
Q.	About a dozen?
A.	No, we were more than a dozen.
Q.	Fifty?
A.	I think you are making my job easy by suggesting numbers to me as if they were here such that I could count them.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You state that they told you that Sikubwabo, Gisambo and Mika had raped them.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Did they say anything more than that?
A.	This is what they told us.  They told us that they had been taken to Gishyita, that they had been raped, and when we saw the condition in which they were, it was not necessary for us to ask them what had happened to them.  If we had started asking what had happened to them, it would have been as if we wanted to make a mockery of them.
Q.	When they went back, when they were taken back, what time was it?
A.	It was between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., yes, between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.
Q.	Was it in the morning?
A.	It was before midday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He said a.m., that's morning.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you state that that evening Mika, Sikubwabo and Gisambo went to the house of the director of the nursing school and killed a watchman.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  They killed a watchman whose name was Ndayisaba, N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-A.
Q.	Between the morning, when those girls were brought back, and the evening when those three persons went to the house of the director of the nursing school, did you continue to see those three men?
A.	No, I no longer saw them.
Q.	So, in the evening you saw them return?
A.	That evening, when they returned and killed the night watchman, I did not see them return.  What we heard were explosions.  We heard grenade explosions.  And while we were wondering what must have happened, we saw a night watchman who was at the director's residence.  He came running and he told us, "They've almost killed us and Ndayisaba has been killed." 

We asked him, "Who attacked you?"  And he told us.  We saw a vehicle, a vehicle belonging to the commune, but we did not see them arrive.  It was when the night watchman came to us for help that we knew what had happened.
Q.	But, Witness, you saw that vehicle go back?
A.	I saw the vehicle, it was when that vehicle made an about-turn; at the point where the main road meets the other road going to the hospital, that is where I saw that vehicle.  I didn't see it within close range.
(Pages 31 to 40 by R. Lear)





































	1330H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you see it clearly enough to be in a position to tell us that it was the same vehicle that had taken the girls away?
A.	It was at night.  I did not see the vehicle clearly, but the night watchman who had witnessed the scene told us about it.
Q.	There is one question that I must have forgotten to ask you, Witness.  The question is, who was driving the vehicle when it came back to drop the three young girls?
A.	The vehicle was parked.  I saw police officers in the rear of the vehicle.  I say Mika alight from the vehicle.  I did not quite see who was driving the vehicle because it made an about turn immediately and went back.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's 1:30 p.m. now.  We take lunch break for an hour and resume at 2:30.
(Court recessed from 1331H to 1440H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

Professor, go ahead with your remaining cross-examination.
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to conclude with the girls you say were abducted from Mugonero towards Gishyita by asking you the following question.  Martha, whom you mentioned, how old was she?
A.	I do not quite know her age, but she was of a certain age all the same.
Q.	When you say, "She was of a certain age," how many years, at least, do you give her?
A.	I am not the one who is assigning an age to her but if you looked at her, you noticed that she was above 25.  She wasn't -- she was at least 25 years of age, and that's why I said she was of a certain age.
Q.	Do you confirm that she was a girl?
A.	I am not very sure, but I think that she was married.
Q.	According to what you knew at the time, was she living with her husband?
A.	No, she wasn't living with her husband.
Q.	Was she divorced?
A.	You're asking me too many details.  I only know that for a certain period she wasn't living with her husband.
Q.	Do you know her husband's name.
A.	No.
Q.	Even if you didn't know his name, did you know him?
A.	No, I did not know him.
Q.	What was Martha's line of business?
A.	She used to work in the hospital.
Q.	In what capacity was she working there?
A.	I know that she used to work in the hospital, but I wasn't working with her in that hospital to know exactly what she was doing, but I know that she was working there.
Q.	Thank you.  How about Mariana, how old do you think she was?
A.	She was aged about from 18 to 22 years; she was pretty mature.
Q.	And what was her marital status? 
A.	She was a spinster.
Q.	And what did she do for a living?
A.	I used to see her at Mugonero.  It is possible that she was working in the hospital or that she was doing an internship or apprenticeship in the hospital.  I am saying this because I used to see her there.
Q.	Let's come back a little bit to Martha.  Did Martha have any children?
A.	Madam President, I think that I came here to testify, and I don't think I have -- I am brought before trial.  I do not know why the Counsel is asking me if Martha had children or about her husband.  I think he should ask me questions concerning my statements regarding Mika.  I don't think he needs to ask me about Martha's children, et cetera.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please answer the questions to the best of your knowledge and capacity.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I will rephrase the question.  Mr. Witness, did Martha have children?
A.	It is possible that she had one or two children, but not more than two.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

Mr. Witness, now we are going to talk about the 16th of April.  You state that on that morning you saw Ruzindana arrive in a white pick-up, Toyota pick-up, and that it had the logo of the Mugonero hospital; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did he have company?
A.	Yes, he was accompanied by other persons.
Q.	Did he have a weapon?
A.	When I saw him in his car, I could not tell if he had a weapon on him or not.
Q.	When did you realise that he was carrying a weapon?
A.	That was when he was coming back from Elizaphan's house and when they started shooting at people.
Q.	Mr. Chairman (sic), I will have to read to you your statement of 25 October 1999, and this is a passage thereof that we are going to read:  "The following day Ruzindana arrived in a white minibus of the Toyota brand.  He was accompanied by about six soldiers" --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are referring to which paragraph?
MR. SONGA: 
In the French version, madam, on page 2, paragraph 2. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you read it again, please? 
MR. SONGA: 
I was reading the following: "The following day, Ruzindana came in the white Toyota pick-up and he was accompanied by about six soldiers and six civilians, all carrying guns. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	My question, Mr. Witness, do you mean that at that time only the six soldiers and the six civilians were equipped with guns or were you saying they were all carrying guns, that also includes Ruzindana?  It's only a matter of clarification that I am seeking to have, thank you. 
A.	What you have just said is the reality of what I stated:  That he came with about 12 persons on board the car, and that those persons were all armed.  And when I say that all those persons were all armed I am not making a mistake, because when he came back -- he did not go to buy a gun; and when he came back I saw him with a gun.  But while he was sitting in his car, I did not notice that he was carrying a gun.  It is when he came back and started shooting at people that I noticed that he was carrying a gun.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  That morning of 16th of April, if we understood you well, there were two attacks; is that correct?
A.	When you talk of attacks, I don't know exactly what you mean.  Apparently, you did not quite understand me.  I didn't say that there was an attack that began -- ended for another attack to begin.  I would like you to explain to me which of -- which two attacks you are referring to, thank you.
Q.	This is what made me ask the question.  In your statement, you say, or you state, that Ruzindana and those who were accompanying him took gendarmes who were in the Mugonero complex and went away with them:  "A few minutes later we saw thousands of civilians equipped with spears, machetes and clubs surround the Mugonero complex hill.  Several assailants -- many assailants gathered around the pastor's office, and then we took the necessary measures to defend ourselves."  I think I will stop here.  Was it an attack or not?
A.	The beginning of what you said is correct.  They came; they took gendarmes with them; they went to Ntakirutimana's house.  And you would understand that there was a person who was moving about in the vehicle and armed assailants were coming behind them.  But I would like to tell you that the attack actually began when the vehicle came back from Pastor Ntakirutimana's place.  They were coming to launch the attack and the assailants started killing people.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say that you took measures to defend yourselves, what were the measures you took?
A.	This is what we did.  When the assailants started shooting at us, and since we didn't have any choice, we tried to throw stones at them.  That is how we defended ourselves.
Q.	Mr. Witness, before you started throwing stones, what exactly had the assailants done?
A.	They had shot at us.
Q.	My understanding was that those who had guns had already left. 
A.	If you heard what I told you, when -- where did I say they went to? 
Q.	Very good, I will tell you.  Still in the passage I was reading a while ago, we find the following, "They were all armed -- equipped with guns.  They went behind the car.  They took the gendarmes who were at the Mugonero complex and went away with them."  And that is why I am saying that those who are carrying guns had gone away.  Is that not what we find in your statement?
A.	The question is as follows.  You are trying to read small excerpts of the statement.  Why don't you read the entire statement and you will see where they went, what they did and at what point they came back. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have read your entire statement, and I am asking you questions with your understanding of the (interpretation unintelligible) to try to explain where they went and when they went.
A.	Thank you, I have told you that they came, took gendarmes and they went to Elizaphan.  They stayed there some time.  After that they came back and started shooting other people who were at the Mugonero complex.
Q.	At which corner or part of the complex were you when you took the necessary measures to defend yourselves?
A.	As concerns where I was, I will tell that we were very near the school.  The gendarmes left.  We waited for what was going to follow, but we knew what they were going to do because the gendarmes had told us that morning that we were going to be killed.  We remained on the spot, and a few minutes later the cars came back.  The assailants came and the children who were inside the church -- the children remained inside the church when we went to fend off the assailants, but to no avail.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you talk about the return or coming back of Ruzindana's vehicle, and you say that behind that car were Mika Muhimana and Sikubwabo, Charles.  Can you describe the situation to us when you say behind Ruzindana's car you saw Charles Sikubwabo and Mika Muhimana?  Were they behind the car, on foot?
A.	Earlier on you asked me to reconfirm my statement.  I have also realised that in my statement I had said that Mika and Sikubwabo were behind.  That is not what I wanted to say.  Ruzindana's car came before, and behind that car you had Sikubwabo's car in which you had Mika and Sikubwabo.  That is what I wanted to say. 
Q.	When you talk of Ruzindana's car, is it the same vehicle that you called a white Toyota pick-up a while ago?
A.	Yes, it was in that car that Ruzindana was.
Q.	And what vehicle were Mika and Sikubwabo using?
A.	They were on board a van which belonged to Gishyita commune.
Q.	Were you able to evaluate the number of persons who were in this vehicle?
A.	No, I was not able to determine the number of occupants of this vehicle.  All I know is that in the back part of this vehicle, there were people.
Q.	What weapons were they using?
A.	You want to know the weapons that they were using when they were massacring people in Mugonero? 
Q.	Exactly. 
A.	They used guns, grenades, as well as traditional weapons, in particular, machetes, lances, sticks, swords and clubs -- traditional weapons, in fact. 
Q.	Were you able to identify certain victims?
A.	The victims?  Yes, I identified them.
Q.	Do you have any names?
A.	Listen, this question is torture to me.  How can you ask me such a question about the names of the victims of Mugonero hospital? 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You say that some of them took refuge in the hospital rooms and others in the church;  is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	I thank you.  You report a statement by Sikubwabo when he entered the church.  In your -- according to you, he said this:  "If there is a Hutu, he should get out of the church."  Is that correct?
A.	When he said that, he was not inside the church, he was standing in the doorway of the church.
Q.	But do you confirm that he made this statement?
A.	The words of Sikubwabo?  Yes, I do confirm them; he did say this.
Q.	And when he spoke with us (sic) where were you?  Where were you at this time?
A.	I was quite close because I was attempting to enter the church, without succeeding.  I was quite close to the place where he was standing, so I heard his words.
Q.	Are there any Hutus who left the church that the time?
A.	Yes, there are Hutus who came out of the church.
Q.	And when they were going out were you still at the same place?
A.	Look, I was not stationary because it was impossible to be in one place.  We were being chased and we were being attacked with machetes.  The situation did not allow people to be stationary.
Q.	However, did you see Hutu leaving the church?
A.	Yes, I saw a few who were leaving the church.
Q.	After this instant are there any Hutus who remained in the church?
A.	I cannot know.  Subsequently, I learned after the war that the wife of a certain Assiel -- Assiel was Tutsi, his wife was Hutu -- the wife who refused to go out when she was asked to go out.  She refused to go out because she said, "You have killed -- why would I go out because you have killed my husband and my children?"  This woman was killed, but I can tell you that this is something that was reported to me; otherwise I cannot tell you whether or not there were any Hutus who stayed in the church.
Q.	Were any grenades thrown into the church?
A.	Grenades?  They threw grenades.  They shot at us inside the church.  You can even go there yourself and you will note the state of the church because it has not yet been repaired, and there are even bodies in there up until now. 
Q.	Did you witness a grenade being thrown at the church?
A.	I did not see anybody throw a grenade into the church.  I did not witness that.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state on the date of 29th October 1999 that, "The assailants threw grenades into the church.  The refugees were killed with machetes.  I survived because I hid under bodies.  The church was full to bursting.  There were about 1,000 refugees."  Is that correct?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
English says 4,000, not 1,000.
MR. SONGA: 
In the French version, which I have before me, it is written there were about 1,000 refugees

Madam President, is it possible that you have a different version in English?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have 4,000 in the English version. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, was it 1,000 refugees or 4,000?  
A.	I will tell you that even if these figures are mentioned, I was only making estimates.  I do not know.  I am not sure that even the pastor or the clergyman who is preaching can know how many faithful he has.  I can only tell you that on that day there were many, many people, and up until now the church has not been repaired.  If you were able to arrive -- to reach there yourself you will realise the state of the church.  There were so many bodies lying on top of each other they could have even approached the ceiling at some points.  

However, Madam President, there is a question that the Defence counsel had asked me which I did not answer because I was interrupted.  I do not want it to be perceived that I do not have an answer to the question.  If the Defence counsel is agreeable, he may ask me the question once more. 
Q.	Is that the last question, Mr. Witness, that you are referring to?
A.	I do not know whether it was the last question.  It is you who are asking the questions.  Regarding this question, I think you asked whether I hid under bodies.
Q.	And what do you have to say to that, Mr. Witness?
A.	I think that where in my statement, my written statement, it is written that I went into the church, I think that that statement is not accurate because I tried to enter the church, but I was not able.  So you must understand that I did not hide under bodies under -- inside the church, but in the hospital.
Q.	However, when your statement states that the church was full to bursting, is that your contention or is it that the notes were not well taken? 
A.	Where it is said that the church was full to bursting, it is not an error in the statement.  It is true that the church was full to bursting, there were many, many people.
Q.	And is it also true that inside the church the refugees were killed using machetes?
A.	Yes.  After tossing grenades into the church and after shooting, the assailants entered the church and finished off survivors with their machetes.  Two days afterwards, a survivor who had been cut up with a machete managed to reach where we were and he told us that people had been cut up inside the church and that amongst them were my sister.  We went back to see, and I was able to see or verify these facts for myself.  It is true that grenades that were thrown and afterwards the assailants entered the church to finish off the survivors with machetes. 
Q.	Are you telling me that you did not see with your own eyes what happened in the church? 
A.	You asked me whether I saw people throw grenades into the church.  I could not see that.  At a time when Sikubwabo was asking Hutus to go out, grenades could not be thrown, but I went into the hospital buildings when there were grenade explosions and shots being fired.
Q.	It is not that I am hard of hearing, Mr. Witness, but there is something I would like to understand.  Did you see with your own eyes what happened in the church?
A.	I cannot tell you that I didn't see anything.  I was there and I am telling you what I saw with my own eyes.  I do not see what you are driving at.  I cannot tell you that I saw everything that happened in the church from the beginning to the end.  I would lie if I said that.  I said -- I have told you what happened in the church, when I was close to the church, and I would also say that there were other events which happened at the time when I had distanced -- gone some distance from the church and, in that case, I would not tell you that I was a witness to these events.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, I notice that at this point there is a series of differences between what you are saying before this Court and what your -- you said in writing.  I am just going to ask one little question.  In regard to this day of 16th April, what would you like to rectify on your written statement, apart from what we have just heard?
A.	Are you referring to the events surrounding the attack of the 16th?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you elaborate your question, please? 
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  My question, the question I put to the witness is, if his written statement will be corrected again in view of the events of the 16th of April, because I see, Mr. Witness, that in the statement it is clear that you were in the church, but you state before this Court at this time that you were not in the church.  Are there any other points in this statement that you wish to correct or perhaps we could go bit by bit and we would let you correct as we put our questions to you? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, where did he say that he was in the church in the statement of 25th of October 1999? 
MR. SONGA:
Exactly, Madam President.  If you would be so kind -- unfortunately, I have only the French version here before me.  I am looking at the second page, the second paragraph thereof, the last four lines.  So we leave no doubt about this matter, perhaps, Madam President, you would prefer that I read this out?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. SONGA:
This is the passage that we are referring to: "Married women -- women who are married to Tutsi and domestic workers who worked for the Tutsi staff of the hospital came out.  Then they threw grenades into the church.  The survivors were killed with machetes.  I survived because I was hiding under bodies.  The church was full to bursting.  There were about 4,000 -- 1, 000 refugees" -- wherein the English version it is said 4,000.  And the following paragraph confirms my understanding that the witness was in the church because it is said, "Late at night I went out of the church.  I passed near the church and I heard my father call me" et cetera.  So this passage of his statement of the 25th of October 1999 gives one to understand that he was indeed in the church where he was able to survive by hiding under bodies.  Not many secretaries can invent such a story, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the witness had explained that he was not in the church and he did not hide under the bodies.  What else do you want from him? 
MR. SONGA:
I shall take -- I wanted that due note be taken of the discrepancies between the statement and the evidence before the Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He has also explained that this is not his correct statement.
JUDGE SHORT:
If there are any other inconsistencies between his evidence before the Court and his written statement, just put them to him. 
MR. SONGA.
That is what I am doing, Madam President, Your Honour.  But, as you know, this does not bar the putting of further questions or even the change of subject. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please go ahead. 
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that late in the afternoon of 16th April -- late in the night of 16th April, I beg your pardon, you went up to Bisesero hill; is that correct?
A.	I stated that I took refuge towards the mountains of Bisesero, the hills; not the hill.  I took refuge in the hills of Bisesero.
Q.	That is, of course, another discrepancy.  This is my question.  On what place or at what place exactly in Bisesero did you go to?
A.	When I left this place, I went to a hill in Bisesero that was quite close to the primary school, and that is in Kazirandimwe cellule.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In what secteur is Kazirandimwe?
A.	At this moment in time or at the time when the events happened?
Q.	At the time of the events, if you please. 
A.	At the time it was in Bisesero secteur.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Are Kazirandimwe and Murambi the same cellule? 
A.	Murambi straddles two cellules, Mukingu cellule and Kazirandimwe cellule.
Q.	Are we to take it then that Murambi and Kazirandimwe are two entirely different locations? 
A.	Kazirandimwe is a cellule.  Murambi is a hill called Murambi, and part of this hill is in Kazirandimwe and another part of Murambi was in the former Mukingu cellule.
(Pages 41 to 49 by Judith Baverstock)






	1530H
 BY MR. SONGA: 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  After your description, may it be put to you that you were in Murambi as the first destination after you left Mugonero? 
A.	You are indeed right.  Before arriving at Kazirandimwe, you have to pass through Murambi. 
Q.	I do not know whether I have understood the answer.  If, for example, someone is in Kazirandimwe, can you say that he is in Murambi? 
A.	If a person is in Murambi, the person may say that he is in Kazirandimwe.
Q.	And would the reverse be true? 
A.	You understand that this is not correct.  What is clear is that Murambi is in Kazirandimwe because Murambi is neither a cellule nor a secteur, but Kazirandimwe is not situated in Murambi. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In your statement -- in your written statement, you state that you went to Bisesero; we may understand that this is Kazirandimwe.  How much time did you spend in Kazirandimwe? 
A.	There in Kazirandimwe, before the French troops arrived, we were being pursued.  In order to determine who had survived, it was because we used to meet in the ruins of houses.  This means that sometimes we were chased and we went very far and I did not return to Kazirandimwe.  But generally speaking, all the time that I -- during all the time that I spent there, I used to return to Kazirandimwe.
Q.	Mr. Witness, once you were in the Bisesero hills, did you sometimes return to Mugonero? 
A.	You mean me?  I never went back to Mugonero.  If I remember correctly, somebody came out from a heap of corpses in Mugonero and related what had happened to us there.  We went there that night but we returned to where we were.  Where would we go to in Mugonero?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, if you allow me, I will look through a document I have with me.  I think I have found the reference, Madam President.  It has to do with a statement given by the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you appeared on the 2nd of October 2001 in the Ntakirutimana trial, and in the course of that trial, it would appear that you stated that when you left Mugonero, you returned to see the situation of wounded children who were still in the chapel. 
MR. SONGA:
If, Madam President, you would allow me, I will read the passage in question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you have a copy for us? 
MR. SONGA:
I think we can find copies for you, Madam President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
For the interpreters as well, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And one copy for the interpreter.

Professor, you may proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The document I am going to quote from as far as the English version is concerned, is on a page 11 to 12, and for the French version, it is pages 14 and 15. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you state that once you got to Bisesero, you did not return to Mugonero but this is what we read in the transcript of the 2nd of October 2001, when you appeared to give testimony in the Ntakirutimana trial:  
"Question:  Do you know if the attackers surrounding the church attacked those who were in the chapel?"
"Answer:  The attackers attacked those who were inside the chapel."
"Question:  Did you see this happen or you were just told about this, Mr. Witness?" 
"Answer:  Nobody told me what happened, but later when I went to Bisesero, there is a man who came out of the chapel and who came there and told us that there were wounded children who were still in the chapel.  So in the night we went there to see if we could find the children, and when we got there, we found that the chapel was full of dead bodies." 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, that is the passage I want to put to the witness to contradict what he said when he stated that he did not return to Bisesero. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, what explanation do you give in this regard? 
A.	It would be better to repeat that statement and find out whether I did not return to Mugonero.  I indeed stated that I returned to Mugonero when we were told that there were wounded children there.  We went there, therefore, to see those wounded children.  I don't know whether that does not mean that I effectively returned there. 
Q.	Witness, are you confirming this statement which you made before the Judges on the 2nd of 
October 2001?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you read or write English or French? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you please repeat the question to the witness?

MR. SONGA:
Before repeating the question, Madam President, we should ask the witness to try to be honest.  In his personal particulars sheet, it is clearly indicated that the witness does not only speak and understand Kinyarwanda, Swahili, French and English, but he also write -- reads the same languages.  So in answer to your question, he should try to be more sincere.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I have a question, Madam President.  I indeed stated that that I came here to testify to facts that I witnessed with my own eyes.  I am not here on trial to be questioned by the Defence.  You said that you were going to look at statements I made in the cases of Ntakirutimana and Eliezer Niyitegeka.  That question has always arisen.  The person who wrote down my statement indicated that I speak English, French and Swahili.  I believe if we are here to bring the truth to light, that question has been going on for a very long time.  I have explained what happened.  You may ask Mr. Phillips, he was there in the Ntakirutimana case.  That question was raised and I stated that my statement was not properly taken down in Ntakirutimana.  What I am saying to this Chamber is the truth.  I cannot hide the truth from you.  If I could read and speak those languages, I will state it.  

I believe, Madam President, that we should not dwell on this issue.  An error was made when my statement was taken down. 
JUDGE SHORT:
(Overlapping microphones)...Swahili, French, English, don't forget that it is not the witnesses who write these particulars, and he is challenging what's written.  What you should have done was to ask him whether he told the investigator that he can speak, write, all these four languages before you start accusing him of being dishonest. 
MR. SONGA:
I see my learned colleague is on his feet. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, what my learned friend has just done is actually a complete misrepresentation of what is in that witness statement, and I am sure he knows that.  

If Your Honours read what is written, you will see that one of those languages is underlined, and that is the language that the witness speaks, and that's the reason why it is underlined.  Now, the other four languages are there, and in the mind of the investigator who took that statement, that was how he operated.  They underline the operative language that the witness speaks.  And this issue has come up like the witness has rightly pointed out, in several trials before now and my learned friend has the transcripts of those trials, and that is the reason behind why Kinyarwanda is actually underlined in that statement.  It is actually a misrepresentation. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Phillips, how are we to know that?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Not you, Your Honour, but my learned friend in putting the question knows that because he has access to the transcripts in the other cases, and there is a reason behind the fact that that is underlined, and that is what the witness has rightly pointed out, because this issue has arisen in other trials, and he has those transcripts at his disposal and he has read them.
JUDGE SHORT:
This is a very poor way of writing particulars down.  Why should the investigator write all four languages and then underline one of them? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Undoubtedly, Your Honour, but -- I mean, I agree with you.  I mean that's a matter totally out of my hands.  But, indeed, the matter has been dealt with in several other cases, and whether or not it is right for my learned friend to actually represent to this witness that he has been dishonest.  I haven't heard direct notice of this problem.  It is the ethical issue here.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, let's forget -- an explanation has been given as to why only the Kinyarwanda is underlined.  So let's go on with the case itself.  Put your questions to the witness, and unless you are not satisfied and you want to still allege that he does speak all those four languages. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honour.  I think we shouldn't give this debate an importance it does not deserve.  There are documents from the OTP providing us with the information we have.  We cannot blame them for lending credence to such documents because when we have to mention the languages spoken by the witness, they would indicate only the language of Kinyarwanda spoken by the witness.  

We crave the Chamber's indulgence for relying overly on the documents provided by the Prosecutor.  And I also crave the witness's indulgence for giving him the impression that he was -- I said he was dishonest.  What I meant was that he should show proof of more sincerity.  

Now that the issue is clear and we all know that he only speaks Kinyarwanda, we shall proceed on this basis.  If we have had this problem, it is because Madam President had expressed the wish -- had asked the question whether the witness could read English or French.  That was the crux of the matter, but it shouldn't prevent us from proceeding, Madam President, Your Honour.  

If you allow me, I will put the question to the witness, again.
JUDGE SHORT:
Go ahead.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, I am putting the question to you again where we left off.  Did you return to Mugonero after having been to Bisesero, yes or no? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  That answer suffices as far as I am concerned.  

Witness, you stated that one day you saw Ruzindana, Mika Muhimana and Charles Sikubwabo arrive with assailants on Kanyinya hill? 
A.	That is correct, I saw them. 
Q.	But you also state, Witness, in reconfirming the witness statement, you state therein that Muhimana came to Kucyapa (phonetic) hill and not Kanyinya hill.  What is the true final version you would propose to this Chamber? 
A.	What I want to state to you, whether it is ^Kucyapa or Kanyinya, I saw them.  I am not saying that I saw them the same day, but I saw them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You also state in your written statement that Mika Muhimana directed you to bring the wounded persons to the primary school so that food, drugs, could be given to them; is that correct? 
A.	I believe my statement was distorted.  I did not state that they did not -- they didn't have to take the children to the toilets of the primary school but to Mubuga primary school.
Q.	Thank you.  And after that visit by Mika, what happened that day? 
A.	The following day there was a large-scale attack in which thousands of people died in Bisesero. 
Q.	Witness, you should be precise when you use the word "Bisesero."  As we know, Bisesero can be a secteur or a region; it can also be a hill.  When you state that there was an attack, where exactly in Bisesero did that attack take place? 
A.	Thank you.  That attack took place in Muyira area. 
Q.	You stated, Witness, that when Mika spoke to you, asking you to bring wounded persons to Mubuga
 -- I have corrected it properly.  You did not flee because you were surrounded and, on that day, nobody was killed.  When did you return to Muyira? 
A.	Understand what I am saying properly.  On that day when we were asked to take the wounded persons to Mubuga, I stated that they came on board vehicles and that they were accompanied by soldiers.  There wasn't an attack.  When you state that they surrounded us, that is not correct.  We went to Muyira the following day. 
Q.	Witness, when I state that you were surrounded, I am not the one saying it; these are your words. 
A.	You said a while ago that I should correct where my statement was not correctly taken down, and I will say that if I find certain statements are not true, I would say so.  If I said that they didn't surround us, and they didn't stop and speak to us -- when you state that they surrounded us, we can take it that we were like their prisoners.  On that day there was no attack. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Which date are we dealing with?  Could you give us a rough idea?  On what date approximately did you arrive in Muyira? 
A.	I believe it was around the 13th. 
Q.	The 13th of which month, please?
A.	The 13th of May.
Q.	Between the 16th of April and the 13th of May, what happened? 
A.	In the meantime, the killings continued.  The last event is what you have just stated when those men came and asked us to assemble.  In the meantime, another large-scale attack had been launched in Gitwa.  I have also mentioned the attack in Kanyinya, which ended at the location I mentioned.  During that attack, I even told you that Mika raped a young girl.  I believe you have all the information in your documents.  I would also add the point regarding my arrest, when I was asked to go and show Antoine's hideout. 
Q.	Witness, you should absolutely be conscious of the fact that we need your help.  In your testimony today before the Chamber, you have stated that in Muyira, you saw Mika for the eighth time.  My question to you is this:  Did events in Muyira precede the period when you were arrested with a person by the name of Thomas or the arrest -- your arrest with Thomas preceded Muyira? 
A.	The latter incident that you have mentioned is the truth.  I was arrested after the event in Muyira. 
Q.	But that does not tally with your testimony of this morning.  Since after you were arrested with Thomas in Gisoro, as you yourself stated, that was the sixth time, and in Muyira that was the eighth time you were seeing Mika.  Can you please try to help us give a chronological order to these events?
A.	If you want to know the number of times I saw Mika, I would repeat them to you.  I will cite the three occasions when I saw Mika in Mugonero.  

First of all during the first attack; secondly, when he brought the people that he had abducted during the attack of the 16th.  I also stated that I saw him in Gitwa, and that I also saw him in Kanyinya.  I would say Kanyinya once, because I also saw him in Nyanyinya the same day.  And for the sixth occasion, I stated that I saw him when they came to ask us to assemble people in Mubuga.  Muyira was the eighth time.  The first time I saw him in Muyira, that was the eighth time.  I saw Mika and the second time I saw him in that same location was the ninth time.  So, let me give a recap of what I have said.  Three times in Mugonero, once in Gitwa, twice in Kanyinya, once when we were arrested, that was the seventh time and the eighth time was in Muyira, and the ninth time was during the second attack in Muyira. 
Q.	When you and Thomas were captured during what period was that or on what date did that take place? 
A.	I did not quite remember the exact date.  Whatever the case, it was in the month of May. 
Q.	Late May, early May? 
A.	I would say it was in early May. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, tell us about what happened in Nyakiyabo?  First of all, was it before you were captured with Thomas or after? 
A.	The event in Nyakiyabo occurred before I and Thomas were captured?
Q.	Was that also before Muyira? 
A.	Yes, it was before the events in Muyira.
Q.	As your statement indicates and as you have testified before the Chamber, Nyakiyabo must have happened rather after Muyira? 
A.	That is not correct.  The incident of Nyakiyabo took place after Muyira. 
Q.	Thank you.  You stayed at Nyakiyabo.  You were witness to a rape; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Do you have an idea when that was, that is the date?
A.	I cannot recall the date. 
Q.	Can you recall the month? 
A.	That was in the month of May.
Q.	And what time in the month of May, if you can recall?
A.	It was at the beginning of May, early May.
Q.	And what hour of the day did it take place?
A.	That was in the afternoon.
Q.	And you say that the victim of the rape was Mukasine?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Who is Mukasine? 
A.	That's rather difficult a question when you ask me who was Mukasine.  I have told you that her name was Mukasine and that I didn't know her first name. 
Q.	Under what circumstances did you know her? 
A.	I have told you that I knew her well before; she**********************************. 
Q.	With the registry assistant, can you tell us what ******************************************************** of that person?
A.	I don't know how that relationship is going to help you.  In any case, ***********************************, and I knew her. 
Q.	And I would be interested in their relationship.
A.	Well, no problem. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please.  

Can you write the relationship in English or in French?  
Can we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter, please to come to the witness box and assist the witness?  

Mr. Issa, please give a piece of paper to the interpreter so that he can write down the relationship of the witness with the lady.

Thank you.  Mr. Interpreter.  You can go back. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say that you do not know the other name, **************************************** *****************************************************? 
A.	Besides the fact that the most important name for me was given to you, ********************************* ******************************************************************, I don't think that should be a crime that is punishable under the law. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But I do not know if I failed to take my notes down when you were answering the Prosecutor's question.  Didn't you attach a first name to that person? 
A.	No.  I have never mentioned her first name.  You may recall that I probably gave the first name of her father but not the girl's first name. 
Q.	And the first name Veren, when was that name pronounced?
A.	I don't know which Veren you are referring to.  I don't recall when I used that first name.  I don't understand anything any more. 
Q.	You are right not to understand it now.  
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I do not recall that.  I think there was an interpretation problem.  That is why I asked the witness twice, "What is the name of the lady that was raped?"  I had also heard something like Veren or Virani or something like that.  That is why I asked the witness twice because I knew there was an interpretation problem.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, it was just an interpretation problem. 
MR. SONGA:
I heard, Madam President.  When the problem is not the problem of poor note taking, it is always an interpretation problem.  I am beginning to get used to these explanations. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in the morning, specific questions were put forward to you in respect of that person, and now with the progress of the deliberations, now that *******************************, I would like to know if I can ask a specific question under different persons that had relations with the victim that you mentioned. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, if you can remember, he had ************************************************************ from the record and kept under seal.
MR. SONGA:
I do recall that, Madam President. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, you did disclose the relationship, didn't you, in your last question, even if it was written on a paper.  We just want to make sure so that we can strike it from the record. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I think you heard me pronounce that word and I would like to apologise for that, and if that can be expunged from the transcript, that would be welcome.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That protected information should be expunged from record and be kept under seal. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I think that once again, I am going to request that we have a closed session since it is very necessary that we protect the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You want to elicit some information from the witness?
MR. SONGA:
You are quite right, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
We have no objection, Your Honour, and we hope that he will now ask all the questions which relate to closed session, because this is the second time he is proposing it.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, arrange for the closed session.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Songa, even though Judge Muthoga is not here today, if you have any time to donate, we are ready to receive it.
MR. SONGA:
I hope you will be as indulgent as Judge Muthoga by granting me 45 minutes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Merci, tres bien. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you very much as well, Your Honour. 
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 59 to 62] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 50 to 58 by Sithembiso Moyo) 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are going into the open session.  Make sure that your identity is not disclosed.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, continue with your answer.
THE WITNESS:
The question he asked me, with respect to what I saw which confirmed Mukasine's rape or the rape of Mukasine.  First of all, it is the context within which that act was committed; there was a war; Mukasine was not his wife; the assailants were killing people; and he went after Mukasine, who was carrying a child, and he captured her; and Gisambo, who was with Mika, took the baby and killed that baby with a gunshot; and Mika took Mukasine, threw her on the ground, and was saying some obscene things to her, tore off her clothes and raped her, at the time while the young girl was screaming.  And after that rape he killed her.  I do not know whether you want to know further details to understand what actually happened.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What clothes was Mukasine wearing?
A.	This young lady was wearing a dress and beneath that she was wearing a pair of briefs and other underclothes.
Q.	What colour were her clothes?
A.	The underslip was pink, the briefs were blackish or bluish and the skirt had several colours, a mixture of white and violet and above her dress she was wearing a T-shirt.
Q.	And how was Mika Muhimana dressed?
A.	Muhimana was wearing trousers, which were blackish in colour, he was also wearing a shirt and a jacket.
Q.	Who raped these persons first?
A.	It is Mika who raped her first.
Q.	I would like to be sure that the translation is correct.  Did he say -- did the witness say it was Mika who raped first or did he say it was Mika who raped?
A.	I said that it is Mika who raped her.
Q.	Did Mika open his fly or did he pull down his trousers?
A.	He did not pull down his trousers.
Q.	In your statement of 25th October 1999 you stated that Mika and Gisambo raped her.  Was it an error in the way the notes were taken or has your opinion changed?
A.	I do not know whether you are confusing the fact of a statement being written down badly and the fact of my repeating what it is that I stated.  When I was reading my statement I realised that there were some things that had changed, and these changes occurred when my statement was being written down.
MR. SONGA:
My learned colleague would like to take the floor, Madam President.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I'm sorry to interrupt but what counsel is talking about now is something that was disclosed as a confirmation note to him.  The witness has said, in the confirmation note, that it was only Mika who raped the lady and not both Mika and Gisambo, and this is the reconfirmation, not something the witness is changing now.  That's the clarification I wanted to point out, Your Honour.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think I have asked the question concerning how long the act lasted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's in the confirmation statement that it was only Mika who had raped Mukasine.
THE WITNESS:
Regarding your question as to whether -- or as to how long this act lasted, it took awhile, because Mika seized the young girl, he tore her clothes.  I would say that this entire act lasted ten or twelve minutes.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  During these ten to twelve minutes, where, exactly, were you?
A.	As I stated before, I was hiding in a bush.
Q.	What was happening around you?  Were there still assailants around?
A.	The assailants were choosing their victims.  I could only see Gisambo around, who was quite close to them.
Q.	And at that time how far away were you?
A.	It was a short distance of about 15 metres.
Q.	Did you see any other Interahamwe who were accompanying Mika around there?
A.	No.  From the place where I was, I could not see them because they were chasing refugees.  I could only see Gisambo, who was around there.
Q.	How did Mika arrive in Nakiyabo?
A.	I think, at the beginning of my statement, I told you that the assailants shot at us when we were at Kanyinya.  The vehicles went back and took the Gisovu road through Goma and they were parked in a place called Kymonga (phonetic).
Q.	When you saw Mika arriving in Nakiyabo, was he on foot?
A.	Yes, when he arrived where I was.  Another time, that he raped these young girls, he was on foot.
Q.	When you saw him coming, who was he accompanied by?
A.	Coming from where, Counsel?
Q.	When he was coming to Nakiyabo?
A.	It was a large scale attack that comprised several assailants.  There was Daniel Ngambomjema and others, but at the time I saw him seize the young lady, the other assailants were chasing the fugitives.  At that place there were only Mika and Gisambo.
Q.	Who killed the person?
A.	It is Mika.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I do not know whether during the reconfirmation you corrected your statement.  In the statement we read as follows: "When they finished, Gisambo killed her."
A.	In response to this question, I think it has been explained to you that during the reconfirmation of this statement I explained things as they happened.  I explained that my statement was not taken down as I made it.
Q.	Nevertheless, you confirmed that during the reconfirmation you did not correct this version.
A.	All the facts that were not taken down accurately were corrected at my request, or at least I asked that this be done.  I do not have the statement here with me, but if you have it, perhaps you yourself, might be able to verify it.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, may the witness be shown his statement on this particular point?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A statement of 25th of October?
MR. SONGA:
The 25th of October 1999.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, give it to the witness.  

Show it to the Prosecutor.
THE WITNESS:
I have seen the passage which has been shown to me.  I do not know whether it is this statement that was corrected or whether it is the original statement that was not taken down accurately.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Take back the statement.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, if I understand the witness correctly, he himself would like to see the reconfirmation.  Unfortunately we only have the French version, unless, perhaps, the interpreter might help us, because this is a very short text.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are providing you with a copy of your reconfirmation of your statement.  Be so kind as to tell us whether you carried out any corrections regarding the four points at issue here, in particular with regard to the question of who killed the person about whom we are talking.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The confirmation is in French.  Can we ask a French interpreter to assist the witness?  Read all this interpreted to the witness in Kinyarwanda.
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I think what the interpreter has just read out to me, it would seem that what I asked to be corrected in my statement was corrected.  I said that it was Muhimana who raped Mukasine and that it was he who killed her.  On the fourth line, where it is said that Muhimana was in Kucyopa, I said that at no point was there any question of going to the primary at Gitwa, and I said that it was Mubuga primary school instead.  Even the interpreter can tell you this.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we shall move on.  I believe it is clear that this passage of the statement of the original statement was not corrected during the reconfirmation.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have arrived at the day.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	(Microphones overlapping)
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Defence counsel has just said that my statement was not corrected.  The interpreter has just read out to me a passage.  Somebody else might read it to you, if that is required.  What I have said is what is contained in the reconfirmation document.  I don't know why he says nothing was corrected in my statement -- my recent statement.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, if I may be of some help.  Actually the witness had told us during the reconfirmation about the killing, in our summary of what he said is in there, in our rough notes, in our notes it's there, actually.  It's not that the witness is making up a story now.  We have had it, unfortunately we didn't put it in our summary.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There is information that is not there.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honours, its not in the summary of the confirmation statement that we disclosed to the Defence, but in our notes, when we were talking to the witness he said that it was Mika who raped the woman and killed her and not Gisambo.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	But you by mistake did not --
MR. KAPAYA:
We didn't put it there, Your Honour.  So it is not that the witness is making it up now.  He had actually told us before.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So move on to another question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was telling you that I wanted us to talk about the day when Mika caught you.  You say that you were with a young man who was called Thomas.  Was this still in Nakiyabo?
A.	No, it was not in Nakiyabo.
Q.	Where was it?
A.	This happened in a forest called Gisoro.  It was not in Nakiyabo.
Q.	How much time was it after Nakiyabo?
A.	It was a few days afterwards, not even a week.
Q.	And who is this man named Thomas?
A.	Thomas was a young man who came from Gishyita commune.  We had sought refuge in Mugonero hospital together, and we continued toward the Bisesero region together.
Q.	What was his other name?
A.	I did not know his other name.
Q.	How long had you known each other?
A.	We knew each other because I knew his parents' house.
Q.	Did you also know their names?
A.	His father was called Benjamin.  His mother, if I remember correctly, was called Melie.
Q.	If you would, give us the other names.
A.	I do not know these other names.
Q.	You said that you were neighbours.
A.	Yes, we were neighbours.  We lived in the same cellule.  Of course, there was a distance, but it should be understood that the neighbours of one cellule can live at a distance from one another that is not very great.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that Mika was looking for Nzamurambaho; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  He was looking for in Nzamurambaho to kill him.
Q.	Is it correct that you said to Mika, where in Nzamurambaho was, except at that time you did not know this exactly; is that correct?
A.	That is indeed my statement. 
Q.	But when you said to these men that you knew where he was, was it true or was it a trick?
A.	I wanted to save my skin.  In any case, people did not hide in their homes.  I was afraid.  I wanted to at least live on that day.
Q.	How many Interahamwe were there when you were captured?
A.	I cannot tell you exactly how many there were.  They were running and shooting at people.  When they arrived to the bush where we were hiding they asked us to come out.  Many people who came to see the people who were being flushed out, I can't tell you their names, but there were about 20 people.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You state that the Interahamwe brought you close to the vehicle to wait for Mika.  What vehicle is this?
A.	There were several vehicles, but the vehicle from which we disembarked was that of the commune.
Q.	Who was driving this vehicle?
A.	This vehicle was driven by Sikubwabo.
Q.	When you spoke to Mika, to tell him that you knew where Nzamurambaho was hiding, was Sikubwabo present?
A.	No, he was not present.  I did not see him.  I saw him on the road above where they took us.
Q.	When you were taken near the vehicle and Mika came to meet you, did he tell you anything?
A.	When we arrived, when those Interahamwe took us there, they asked them where they were taking them, and the Interahamwe told them that "We are going to show them Antoine's hideout."  And when Mika came, he told Sikubwabo that, "We are going to show them Antoine's hideout."
Q.	You state that he arrived with the girl known as Rahel; is that correct?
A.	When we arrived there we met Rahel there  -- Rachel, rather.
Q.	Where, exactly, did you find her?
A.	We found her where the vehicles had been parked, at a location where there is a group of buildings in Bisesero.
Q.	But when your statement of the 25th of October 1999 is read, it was instead Mika and the girl who met you there.
A.	That is not true.  When I got to that location, I found that girl who had been taken there.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, Judge Short, I promised to be brief but there have been very many contradictions between the statement that the witness is testifying to now and his statement.  What can we do?  Would you be as indulgent as the other learned Judge Muthoga as to allow us to postpone his testimony?  What can we do in his case? .
JUDGE SHORT:
There's no question about postponing his testimony.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, we are working on his statement.
MR. SONGA:
To send Judge Muthoga the statement, rather.  I'll read a passage, Madam President.  We are on the last page of the statement of the 25th of October 1999.  "Those Interahamwe took us near their vehicle to wait for Mika.  A short while thereafter he arrived with a girl by the name Rahel."  This is a very precise passage, but the witness says that that is not true, that is the contrary is true.  That witness has said that, "You found that girl in that location."
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can you explain the contradiction?
A.	What I am relating to the Chamber is events that I witnessed with my own eyes.  We were captured there, we were taken uphill.  The Interahamwes had seized us.  Mika was not as where he was behind us.  When we got to the place where that vehicle was parked, that girl was there, Rahel was there.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And who is Rahel?
A.	She was a young girl working at Mugenero hospital.
Q.	What work was she doing?
A.	She was a nurse at a hospital.
Q.	How old was she?
A.	She was over -- she was a much mature girl, she was over 20.
Q.	Do we know her parents?
A.	I do not know her parents.
Q.	Do you know her address?
A.	I believe she was staying in the house of a certain pastor known as Sabyesek (phonetic).
Q.	You state, Witness, that the three of you, that is the girl, Thomas and yourself, were taken to Mika's house; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	The vehicles stopped opposite Mika's house.  You state that the vehicles stopped opposite Mika's house; is that what you said?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How many vehicles were there?
A.	When we got there, there were two vehicles, the vehicle in which we had travelled and the other vehicle belonging to Ruzindana.
Q.	What was the distance, Witness, between the place of your capture and Mika's house?
A.	It is a long distance, because Mika lived in Gishyita secteur, and we were captured in Bisesero secteur; so the distance is over ten kilometres.
Q.	How come you are now talking of Ruzindana's vehicle, whereas in your statement you did not make mention of that?
A.	What I can state to you is that the statements that were written were summed up, they were mere summaries.  If I were to go into details we wouldn't have enough paper to take them down.
Q.	You state, Witness, that you went to Mika's house and that you were taken into one of the rooms.  Were you able to properly locate the room in Mika's house?
A.	To say that it was such-and-such a room, are you trying to find out whether I would recognise the room if I were to return there?  Counsel, if you could please kindly repeat your question because I did not understand it.
Q.	You have understood me very well, Witness.  If you were to return to Mika's house, would you recognise the room that you were taken into?
A.	I believe I would be able to recognise the room.  We were taken through a location between two houses, so I can very well remember the room.
Q.	If I were to show you a sketch of Mika's house, would you be able to identify the room?
A.	If you showed me the sketch of that house, I would try to ascertain or determine where that room was.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, may I ask the Registrar to show the witness the sketch of Mika's house so that he may show us clearly where that room is?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, honestly, this question is a relevant question?
MR. SONGA:
Why, Madam President?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, in addition, this witness did not draw that diagram and we haven't obviously established the level of his education in this is the case.  At any rate, the fact that he was taken to Mr. Mika's house is neither here nor there, it is not in the indictment.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you been to Mika's house before?

Mr. Songa, please move on to another question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, this is a relative one?
MR. SONGA:
Madam president, when you express doubt as to the relevance of my question, I also share your doubts.  So I'll proceed to another question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you therefore spent the night in Mika Muhimana's house in Gishyita; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  This is how it happened.
Q.	How many of you were in the room?
A.	It was myself and Thomas, only the two of us.
Q.	You also state that a soldier was responsible for keeping an eye on you.
A.	The soldier took us into that room, he locked the door and in the morning, when the door was opened, it was the same soldier who opened the door.  If it was this soldier who took us there and opened the door I drew the conclusion that he was the one who had spent the night there watching over us.
Q.	Were you able to find out whether there were other occupants of the house that night?
A.	We could hear people talking, and at one time those people stopped talking.  It is possible that those people spent the night there.
Q.	When you arrived in Mika's house, who did you find there?
A.	When we got in, the vehicle parked opposite the house.  There were many people loitering around there.  I don't know who they were.  I went inside the house.  So when we got there, there were lots of idlers there.  We were taken into the house and locked up in there.
Q.	Were you fed?
A.	No.
Q.	In the morning, at what time did you leave the house?
A.	We left that house at about 8:30 a.m.  There were rays of the sun coming into the house.
Q.	How did you leave the house?
A.	We went on board the same vehicle which had brought us the previous day.
Q.	Did you take the same route?
A.	Yes, we took the same route.
Q.	And what was your destination?
A.	We headed for Bisesero.
Q.	You state that you stopped in a forest.  What forest are you referring to?
A.	They took us uphill, and when we got very close to the forest where we were captured, we took the same route.
Q.	How many of you were on board that pickup?
A.	I do not remember the number of people who were on board that vehicle.  Many people got on board it.  The pickup was full.
Q.	Were all those people armed?
A.	Some of them were not armed with guns.
Q.	But were there many people armed on that pickup?
A.	Yes, many of those people were armed.
Q.	Witness, on that pickup did the Interahamwe surround you?
A.	They made us sit behind the vehicle, and the others were standing over us.  We were behind the vehicle, in the rear of the vehicle.
Q.	And it was from the rear of the vehicle that you tried to escape?
A.	No, it was not from the rear of the vehicle that we tried to escape.  We told them that the person they were looking for was hiding downhill, so we alighted from the vehicle and five metres from the vehicle we tried to escape, and that was when my friend was shot down.
Q.	When you tried to flee, were you looking in front of you or behind you?
A.	Was I retreating?  I was in front of them, pretending to go and show them of that man's hideout, and all of the sudden I ran and my friend, when he tried to run, was shot down.  They fired at us several times and they cried out hunting cries, but I escaped from them.
Q.	Under those circumstances, were you able to identify the person who fired the shot that brought down Thomas?
A.	I was unable to find out who fired the shot that hit Thomas.  I heard several gunshots, and I thought he had run in another direction.  But in the evening, when I came back, I realised that he hadn't even gone for more than four metres from the vehicle.  If I state that I know the person who hit him, it would be a lie.  I heard the gunshots, but I didn't know who fired those gunshots.
Q.	I thank you, Witness.
MR. SONGA:
Honourable Judge Short, in your capacity, as representative of Judge Muthoga, I wish to tell you I have ended my cross-examination.  I thank you.  I thank Madam President, and I thank the entire Chamber for your patience during this last cross-examination.  I also wish to thank the witness, and through him, all the witnesses for the efforts they have made to bring the truth tonight.  I also thank, Madam President, your colleagues and friends of the Prosecution who have shown proof of intellectual honesty and cooperation.  I would even say that their motions and objections have enabled us to gain a lot of time.  I am thinking of each of the Judges, the Honourable Judge Short, which, with his very short questions that elicited long and lasting responses.  And I'm also thinking of you, Madam President, for your generosity and the understanding you have shown us, and we are very grateful for that.  

With your permission, Madam President, I would like to tender some documents as exhibits and file a short oral motion.

Madam President, the exhibits that I wish to tender are first and foremost the statement of the 25th of October 1999.  

Next, I would like to tender the reconfirmation.  In regard to the reconfirmation of the statement, we are (unintelligible) the French version but between now and Tuesday we shall include the English version.
	(Pages 63 to 72 by R. Lear)





	1730H
MR. SONGA:
In addition, there is a sheet of paper on which the witness wrote down the relationship with the purported victim of rape; if this may be tendered as an exhibit as well.  Lastly, we have the transcripts of the 2nd of October 2001 in the Ntakirutimana trial insofar as the witness's return to Mugenero is concerned.

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, if the Prosecution does not have any re-examination and if the Judges do not have any supplementary questions to put to the witness, perhaps it would be permitted of me to make my oral motion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you wait for a while, please?

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor; do you have any re-examination?
MR. KAPAYA:
None, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for assisting the Court with your testimony.  We wish you a very safe journey home.

Mr. Registrar, please assist the witness through the door.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Madam President, Your Honour.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  My oral motion focuses on a question that I have submitted to you in the past and to which you have always sought to provide the most relevant answer, but since the problem remains, I shall bring it up again.  I am referring here to the health of my client.

Madam President, you will remember that on more than one occasion my client has complained of his state of health.  The contact that he has had so far with the doctors of the defence facility has not been of a sort to provide him with entire satisfaction.  The doctors are -- believe that his state of health has improved considerably and, consequently, he should not request any special care; however, the client tells me that he is suffering every day and that he is under considerable suffering.  He has had to make considerable effort to be present at all the sessions, for fear of being accused of trying to use any manoeuvres.

Now that this first phase of the trial has ended and pending the next session, my client prays that your Chamber should give the necessary instructions so that he may be examined by a specialist.  In the past he was able to be operated upon in Moshi, but this was an operation concerning a disease that is different from the one that he currently suffers from.

The reason why my client has decided to make this motion, it is because he and his doctor do not understand each other.  The last letter of the doctor that was addressed to my client stated that, if he insisted on receiving specialist care, all he had to do was to consult specialist services at his own cost, losing sight of the fact that our customer (sic) is indigent and cannot, on his own, meet the costs of health care which are expensive.  That is the substance of my motion, Madam President, and I pray that you will look on it with kindness and that you will order the most appropriate measures to -- for the provision of care to my client so that in the next session he will be able to attend all sessions in good health.

I submit this motion with my deepest respect to you, Madam President, and Your Honour.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, what kind of specialist does he need?  What specialist does he want to treat him? 
MR. SONGA:
From what he has told me so far, he is suffering, feeling a lot of pain in his right side, and since he has not been consulted by a specialist, he is of the opinion that his problem may arise from his liver, his kidneys, or both at the same time.  The care he has so far received in the UNDF does not enable such a disease to be treated.  He has even produced a list of all the medicine which he has routinely received, which has had no effect whatsoever on his state of health so far.  This list he has submitted to the administration.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have deliberated and we agree that a doctor of the UN to examine the Accused and give him appropriate treatment, and after the treatment, she should submit her report to the Court.
MR. SONGA:
I'm most obliged, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The conclusion of the evidence of this witness now brings us to the end of the first session of the trial.  We -- it may be noted for the record that in 20 trial days we have heard 19 witnesses.  We appreciate the services of the witness protection section for making the witnesses available on time.  We are also thankful to the Prosecution who has made it possible to complete its evidence within the required time, excepting for one witness who will be examined at the start of the next session.

We also express our gratitude to the professor, who has always tried to oblige us by concluding his cross-examination of the witnesses by the suggested time, however, with few exceptions.

As to the next stage of the trial -- that is, the Defence evidence -- which was scheduled to commence on the 30th of May and which has been now postponed to a date, on the request of the Defence, no doubt -- to a date which will be communicated to the parties in due course of time.  After the release of the actual date for the presentation of the Defence evidence, we will plan a pre-Defence conference.  We adjourn till then.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We have some observations to make before you finally adjourn, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful to Your Honours for the opportunity.  Your Honours, I was seeking to address you before you actually made your final remarks.  Contrary to -- not contrary, but, following the representations that I made to Your Honours yesterday, and indeed we are particularly grateful to Your Honours' flexibility in giving us the opportunity to extend the presentation of our case for a further period to accommodate the evidence of the expert.

I, on behalf of the Prosecutor, have reconsidered my position on that and have decided to withdraw that witness henceforth from these proceedings.  In that regard, Your Honours, the Prosecution seeks to rest his case this evening, and we would not present any further evidence in these proceedings.

That said, Your Honour, there's a technical matter that we need to bring to your attention in relation to the indictment, and this has already been dealt with at paragraph 47 of the pre-trial brief.  It's a very technical matter.  We have rectified the error in that paragraph but, in terms of the technicality of the indictment, there is one single word or letter -- I don't quite know how to represent it -- that we need to amend, from "AVK" to the name "Agnes".  It is a single word -- it's a typographical error that alleges AVK was, in fact, raped, when she wasn't.  We have amended that by giving notice in the pre-trial brief.  Of course, the witness, herself, has since testified before Your Honours and certainly did not make that allegation.  But there's this technicality that the indictment still refers to, and we seek to strike out in "Mika Muhimana raped AVK" -- so we want to strike out "AVK", and replace it with "Agnes".

The reason why that occurred is because the witness, she has the same first name as the actual victim of this crime and, in drafting the indictment, we had assumed that it was one and the same person.  But that has, indeed, been clarified.

Suffice to say, Your Honour, going back to the issue of the expert, that many may have gotten the impression that our inability to comply with our obligations under Rule 94 bis was actually due to our own fault or our own negligence, but the reality of the situation is that this was actually due to circumstances very much beyond our control and had to do with the inability of this institution to remunerate that expert and, hence, her inability to produce a report of any sort before the deadline and, in the end, having to suffice with a draft report, to all intents and purposes.

All matters considered, as I have indicated, I have taken the decision that, since that remuneration has not taken effect even today, when she ought to be on the stand, then I am going to withdraw her from this trial.

Finally, can I thank you, Your Honours, for giving us the opportunity to present the evidence before yourselves and, indeed, to my friends for their cooperation, at most times; to my colleagues from the registry and, indeed, the interpreters for their efforts in getting the work done.

I'm grateful, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Phillips. 

So the evidence of the Prosecution has come to an end.  The next session will be with the -- will start with the evidence of the Defence on a date which will be communicated to the parties sometime.

As to the amendment of the indictment, Professor, do you have any objection? 
MR. SONGA:
I have every confidence of my learned colleague the Prosecutor.  I do not have the document at hand.  If there were any reason for us to object, I am sure that it would not be required.  We do not think that this is a problem of any particular seriousness.  We are going to verify that.  We would like to express ourselves with our reservations, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we deal with this issue during the next session.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that's fine by us.

Your Honour, there's just one more final matter.  The Defence had indicated at the beginning of trial that they were going to rely on the defence of alibi.  They have given some sort of notice of that alibi, but what they have not done is provided us with the particulars of the witnesses that they seek to rely on with respect to that alibi.  And I'm just renewing my request to have the particulars at the earliest opportunity so that we can -- it's a bit late in the day to investigate the alibi but, at least, we will try to do something.  Just to renew that we haven't received the particulars.  I'm grateful.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we believe that you will oblige the Prosecutor.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I believe that you are aware of the Defence's particular difficulties in regard to the Muhimana trial.  We started the trial when the Prosecution was ready, but when the Defence was not ready, in the sense that it had not gathered all its witnesses.  We could say that the Defence, after the session that has been devoted to the Prosecutor -- it was provided that, after this session the Defence would go to seek these witnesses that it had already identified since 2002, but with whom we had had no contact since then.  This will help, which is why for one week now, in order to expedite the trial, we have already started to prepare the mission that will help us to go and meet these witnesses as quickly as possible.  And we stated that if we were granted the one month, at the end of the month of May we should be able to provide a complete and final list of witnesses and, consequently, to give the Prosecutor all the information that he may require.  That is the current situation, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, so now he has given the date that he will file his list of witnesses, by the end of May.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you once again.

And we adjourn until then.
(Court adjourned at 1756H)
