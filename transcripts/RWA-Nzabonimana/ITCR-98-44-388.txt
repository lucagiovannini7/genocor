STRATON SIBOMANA
Examination-in-chief by Mr. Larochelle	5








	(Pages 1 to 4 were extracted and kept under separate cover, as the proceedings commenced in 
closed session)
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No further applications, Your Honour.  I think we can proceed to the examination of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the personal identification sheet of Witness Straton Sibomana has been placed before me and I would like, at this juncture, to ask the registry to crosscheck the authenticity and the accuracy of the content of the personal identification sheet of the witness.
STRATON SIBOMANA
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana.  
A.	The information on my personal identification sheet is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have mentioned that the information contained in your personal identification sheet is correct, and if that is the case, I will now ask you to sign that document if you haven't done so. 
THE WITNESS:
I need a pen to be able to sign.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
May it please the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I noticed that although the witness claims that the information is correct; it is incomplete.  Item number 14 is blank.  I think it should be proper to indicate that he is currently a prisoner so that the identification sheet reflects all his true particulars.  As the Court pleases.  May that be included.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, I didn't know that being a prisoner was a profession.  He is retired and he doesn't have an occupation, and I therefore, do not believe that it is necessary to mention this in the PIS, because, in any event, all of that material will be properly covered in the proceedings of this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed, we think that number 12 -- the entry at number 12 is sufficient, and given that he is at the Gitarama prison, that should cover number 14.  
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Well, I grudgingly say that I am satisfied.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)  

Defence, would you like to produce this document into evidence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
You took the wind out of our sail, Your Honour, because, indeed, we are going to apply for this document to be produced and identified -- and marked as D. 1.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think that it is not the duty of the Defence to mark or identify the documents produced into evidence.  It is the task of the registry that has the necessary equipment to proceed with numbering the documents.  

Registry, please, what number?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
The Defence requested that the document be marked D. 1, but if I do recall properly, Mr. President, document D. 1 for Defence is a bundle of photographs.  

And, furthermore, Mr. President, in November, the Defence team also wanted to produce five documents into evidence during the hearing of a Prosecution witness, and in that case the five documents were handed to the Prosecutor and so far we have not yet come to a determination on the fate of those five documents.  That is why, at this juncture, Mr. President, it is not possible for the registry to properly number this document.  This will only happen properly after the five documents that were handed to the Prosecutor have been dealt with before we can find an appropriate number for the personal identification sheet of Straton Sibomana.  

I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, what does Defence think?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Defence may also want to say that all the statements that were used during cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses are also pending production into evidence, while relevant documents pertaining thereto are being put together.  So I believe, therefore, that while the situation of the five documents are pending and the others are pending as well, this other document could also be put on hold as the registry sorts out that matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, what is your comment on that?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I do agree with Defence Counsel that the exhibit number for this document can be generated in due time, but I would like to point out that I think there was an error when it was said that the other 
five documents are pending to be given an exhibit number because they are with the Prosecutor.  That is not my recollection of that, although that's not the main point.  The main point is that, those documents were still being held subject to certain undertakings that the Defence had said they would do.  That is to underline and mark the contradictions that they sought to find out from those documents.  Therefore, I do not think that the delay is because of generating the exhibit number is because they are with the Prosecutor.  The documents with the Prosecutor are only those documents that were handed in the due process of the Court.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

We note that the procedure has not been scrupulously upheld to this day and I believe that you will agree with me.  I say so because the procedure requires that at the end of each sitting all documents produced into evidence as exhibits must receive an exhibit number from the registry.  So we are faced with a difficult problem to the extent that the chronological numbering of the exhibits must reflect the flow of hearings and make room for subsequent documents to be numbered accordingly.  So this is a serious problem and I would like to ask, on behalf of the entire Bench, given that the problem has arisen here, I, therefore, want to promptly call on the Defence, as stated by the Prosecutor, to do all what it has to do relating to the submission of the contradictions it wishes to highlight in the documents for the benefit of the Court.  I, therefore, ask the Defence to work with Prosecution and with the Registry to bring the matter in the end before the Court so that a determination can be made as to the fate of these documents.  I hope that I can rely on Defence counsel to proceed expeditiously and judiciously.  

I would also want to recall a few Rules of Evidence in matters of procedure for the benefit of the witness.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you are fully aware that we are sitting here in Kigali because of your health condition.  

And, secondly, because of your age, as raised in the application by the Defence.  This is what has moved the entire Court to Kigali to hear your testimony, rather than move you to Arusha for that purpose.  Mindful of your state of health, we would like to ask you to answer any questions put to you as directly as possible, without expatiating and maybe touching on irrelevant matters, but dealing with the matters as directly and as concisely as possible as you answer the questions that are put to you.  That would enable you to save time to avoid spending much time here and this would also enable the Trial Chamber to move expeditiously to come to a conclusion of your testimony.  

I also want to call on the Prosecution and Defence counsels to speak directly to the facts and, of course, there may be one or two questions here and there relating to the credibility of this witness or of other witnesses.  If that were to be the case, I would still ask you to understand that we do not have much time.  We have a maximum of two days for this hearing.  

I also want to remind us all that the Defence had asked in writing that the examination-in-chief would take some four hours or thereabout.  I am convinced that four hours may even be excessive and yet I        understand the efforts that the Defence has recently been making in curbing its time.  That is why I would like the Defence to work within the four-hour time frame.  

But also I will be calling on the Prosecution to deal with this matter judiciously as well in terms of the time assigned to the Prosecution.  

Now, for the witness, you have taken the solemn declaration to speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  I know, and we all know that, we are aware of the implication of a solemn declaration, and you know that if you were to stray from your solemn declaration and end up in providing a false testimony, under Rule 91 of the Rules of Evidence, you will be punishable under the law.  That is why I urge you to speak the truth and the entire truth, otherwise, you may come under the -- you may be subject to the provisions of Rule 91 relating to false testimony.  

I know and I am convinced that we are all gathered here with a common objective,  that is, to see the truth emerge, rather than to see one party win over the other.  All what we are doing here is to bring our contributions, as different parties, to enable the Tribunal to hear the testimonies, particularly, the testimony of Kigali and to come to its judgement -- a fair judgement, as we all expect when it does get to that point.  

I felt that it was necessary to highlight these points, and "a word to the wise" as it is said, "is sufficient."  At this juncture, therefore, I humbly call on the Defence counsel to lead the witness in examination-in-chief.  

Yes, let me remind us all that we are now sitting in open session, as was stated at the very beginning of these proceedings.  Thank you.  

MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, welcome to this sitting.  

As we look at your personal identification sheet, we note that you were born in 1929 and that you were 30 years old at the time of the revolution of 1959.  What was your occupation at that time? 
A.	I was a primary school teacher at that time. 
Q.	So you personally experienced the events of the 1959 revolution; is that correct? 
A.	I did not understand your question. 
Q.	In which primary school were you teaching? 
A.	I was a teacher at the Kagogwe primary school in Nyakabanda commune.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kagogwe is K-A-G-O-G-W-E. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Were you in Kagogwe at the time of the 1959 revolution? 
A.	Yes, I was at that location at that time. 
Q.	If someone were to suggest to you that you killed Tutsis in 1959, what would be your answer to that? 
A.	I would tell that person who claimed that I killed Tutsis that they were lying.  You see, all my neighbours survived.  
Q.	You were a teacher at the primary school till when -- till which year -- up until which year? 
A.	I was a primary school teacher till 1963. 
Q.	What did you do thereafter? 
A.	I was appointed bourgmestre of Nyakabanda commune in 1963, and I remained in that office till early 1994 (sic). 
Q.	Now, if someone were to put it to you that throughout your tenure as bourgmestre, that is, between 1963 and 1992, you killed Tutsi and threw them in the Nyabarongo, what would your reaction to that be? 
A.	That is not true.  It is true that some people were thrown into the Nyabarongo in 1993, but it was the result of propaganda by the former president of the court of first instance, who had released people whom I had arrested because they had hurt some Tutsis. 
Q.	You have told the Court that you were a bourgmestre of Nyakabanda till -- up till 1992.  Why did you stop serving in that capacity as bourgmestre?  What happened? 
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) Monsieur Le Procurer.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I think it's just a typographical -- or, rather, a translation error.  When the witness spoke, he said that he was appointed bourgmestre in 1963.  He served from 1963 to early 1994.  

Now, Counsel is putting to him a very contrary position, and that's my objection.  Either he follows what the witness has said, but he cannot put words in his mouth.  I thank you, My Lords.  So if Counsel can be directed to follow of the witness, and not rather what he has in his notes.  I think we shall be faithful to the testimony of the witness.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, even the Bench itself heard you say that you were bourgmestre from 1963 to 1994.  Do you maintain that position?  
THE WITNESS:
I said from 1963 to 1992. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will not belabour that point, but I heard 1994.  To err is human, and I take it that you have confirmed that it was in 1992. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	All right. 

Mr. Witness, what happened in early 1992, to stop you from being bourgmestre of Nyakabanda? 
A.	With the advent of multiparty politics, I was not a member of the MDR political party, and for that reason the MDR members killed the members of my family.  They wounded me and I had to leave Nyakabanda to settle in Kigali. 
Q.	Therefore, at that time, which political party did you belong to? 
A.	By then, I was a member of the PDC party because from 1980 -- 9, I wrote a letter to the president of the republic, who was the founding president of the MRND party, to resign as bourgmestre.  Later on, 
I became interested in the activities of MRND -- I became a member of the PDC party. 
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, do you remember the year in which you joined the PDC, which is, the 
Democratic Peoples' Party? 
A.	I joined that party in 1991. 
Q.	Let me return to what you said a short while ago that you had been dismissed from the post of bourgmestre.  Did you say that it was the MDR that was responsible for what happened?  Can you give us the names of some of the individuals who made you to be expelled from the post of bourgmestre? 
A.	Someone called Philip Nyirindekwe and another one called Gaspard Sebahima -- there is also 
Fidélé Karemera, who was nicknamed Shitani.  There was also Higaniro, H-I-G-A-N-I-R-O.  There was also Pierre Nkubito, and I am just giving the names of the individuals who led the attacks.  Otherwise, the group that aggressed me was very big.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nyirindekwe is spelt N-Y-I-R-I-N-D-E-K-W-E; Shitani, S-H-I-T-A-N-I. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Sibomana, if somebody suggested that Callixte Nzabonimana was present on the day you were dismissed from the post of bourgmestre, what would you say to that? 
A.	I did not understand your question. 
Q.	If somebody claimed that on the day that you were dismissed from the post of bourgmestre of Nyakabanda by the MDR supporters, and that on that day Callixte Nzabonimana was present on that occasion, what would you say? 
A.	That's not true because the day I was chased from that post, my son-in-law had just been killed by -- being cut by machetes by -- on that day, Callixte Nzabonimana was not present on that day, and he did not come to my rescue.  If he had been there, he would have come to my rescue. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
(No interpretation)
MR. NG'ARUA:
Your Honour, Judge, may I request that the witness takes off his headphones. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, would you remove your headset, please, because there is -- please remove your headset because there is something that the two parties would like to discuss without you listening.  

It looks like his headset is not even working.  

Have you heard me, Witness?  Are you hearing what I am saying, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have heard you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you please, for a short while, remove your headset because the Prosecution would like to raise a point which does not concern you.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Your Honour, the issue I wish to raise is a matter of law.  The last two questions that were put by the Defence to the witness do not reflect the true spirit of examination-in-chief.  In fact, they are more akin to cross-examination rather than examination-in-chief.  

In examination-in-chief, and my learned friend knows that, you cannot put a proposition to a witness.  It is wrong for him to try and elicit the evidence of this witness before the Court in this manner.  However, during cross-examination this is allowable, but not in the manner in which counsel is proceeding.  Counsel should ask neutral questions which do not suggest in themselves a proposition like he is putting.  So he cannot lead the witness that way, asking him if somebody says this, it would be wrong, isn't it, or asking him what his reaction to a proposition.  He must lead the evidence in a more neutral manner so that the Court has benefit of a witness who is not being led by the nose. 

Now, we have a statement before us and this statement has been discussed by the Defence and the witness.  So the witness ought to be asked questions that reflect what is on the statement, first and foremost, and questions that asked the witness to tell his story, rather than the story being told by the Defence counsel.  It is on this point, My Lord, that I object to the manner in which Counsel is proceeding, and request the Court to direct him to follow the normal procedure of examination-in-chief.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, you, personally, reminded me at the beginning of these proceedings that the objective of the Court was to establish the truth on the events that took place in Rwanda, and to test the credibility of the witness.  

This witness -- of course, doesn't have his headset on -- on his ears.  He did not hear the events that was mentioned in the case file and has not heard of anything said by other people.  So I believe that he is fully -- that it is fully correct in the framework of this deposition where we have to follow strictly the Rules of Evidence, and I believe that the witness has the right to be able to say what he has to -- what he knows.  

I believe what I am saying is fully -- is in conformity with the modalities of examination-in-chief.  I presented information that is in the case file and the things that were said by other witnesses in this case -- the only means of obtaining the testimony of Mr. Sibomana is to ask him in the most neutral way possible, the way I was doing it, so that we can get the evidence that he is going to give in this particular case.  He cannot even know which type of -- how the information -- that the information I am asking him about was mentioned in court.  So I believe that I was neutral in the way I was expressing my questions to him.  These are factual issues.  They were mentioned by Prosecution witnesses in this case.  I, therefore, believe that the Prosecution objection is unfounded and should be rejected.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We did not take the question in full the way you posed it to the witness.  Would you like to ask your question once again?  I did not hear any response to what I'd asked.  Would you like to repeat your questions so that a decision can come out. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I asked the witness what he would say if I told him that if somebody said that Callixte Nzabonimana was present at the time when he was chased away from the post of bourgmestre.  That was my question.  That was said on the 1st of December 2009.  This witness was not there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I don't think this is the right moment to make suggestions.  This is a Defence witness.  I am sure the answer would be in the manner wanted by the Defence.  

Mr. Sibomana, please put on your headset once again.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you hear me now?  
A.	Yes, I can hear you. 
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, was Callixte Nzabonimana present when you were dismissed from the post of bourgmestre?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, once again, we request your indulgence.  Can you begin.  Remove your headset.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Again, Your Honour, Counsel is missing your point.  The question should be:  Who was present?   Was anyone present at the time when he was chased away from the seat of bourgmestre, and not -- we are not here to put the testimony of other witnesses to this witness.  

This witness has his own testimony, which the Defence knew of at the time of taking the deposition.  The statements of CNAO and CNAL are well known to the Defence at the time when he took the deposition -- when he suggested that a deposition of this witness is necessary.  

It is, therefore, prejudicial and not in good faith for him to start of by naming people and asking this witness who these witnesses are.  The best question that would bring justice in this trial is first to ask him, was anybody present.  In that way he will be giving his own words.  Now, he is given a clue, "Oh, 
I am supposed to talk about Callixte."  So I think this is wrong and Counsel knows it.  And it is not done.  And this question can be placed properly after a certain position, for instance, was there anybody of authority present.  But he cannot, in my view, hold the witness to certain names and ask them whether this person was present, especially in the opening paragraph of his line of questioning.  So I think again, Counsel is missing the point.  He is leading this witness as if he is cross-examining him.  This is a good question in cross-examination, but not in examination-in-chief.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have heard the observations of the Prosecution.  In the opinion of the Prosecution, you should -- you should -- if you suggest a name to someone who already has a position in this case, that's already suggestive as a question.  Therefore, the objection raised by the Prosecution is maintained, and we would like you to readjust the manner in which you ask your questions.  For example, were there any people when you were fired from that post of bourgmestre.  And then continue from there, who are those individuals who were there.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The witness told us that there was a huge crowd of people.  I thought my question was fully legal.  Okay, I would reform.  I will put my question otherwise.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, can you please put on your headset.  

Can you tell the Court if there were any authorities on the day you were fired from the post of bourgmestre? 
A.	When I was fired from that post of bourgmestre, the situation was very tense.  My son-in-law, 
Gaspard Ruhumuliza, and someone called Rwaka, came to my rescue.  They assisted me in fleeing from the assailants.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Ruhumuliza is R-U-H-U-M-U-L-I-Z-A; Rwaka is R-W-A-K-A. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Were there any ministers present on that day? 
A.	No, when I was dismissed, there were no ministers, but the two I mentioned are the people who came to assist me to escape the aggressors. 
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, you earlier on told us that you left -- you quit the MRND party in 1991.  Could you tell this Court how many supporters of the MRND there were at the time you were chased away from the post of bourgmestre? 
A.	The individuals who carried MRND colours were only two. 
Q.	Would you like to give us their names, please? 
A.	There was Edward Kabanda and (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kabanda is spelt as K-A-B-A-N-D-A; (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover)
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So you said that there were two individuals who were wearing MRND emblems or colours.  Were there any other MRND supporters present, although they were not wearing any MRND insignia? 
A.	People were very much frightened by the individuals who were forcing them to leave their party by beating them up.  But the individuals who resisted and were still in the MRND were those two that I have just mentioned. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, one of the names that were mentioned is a protected witness.  Am I wrong?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No, we didn't know that, Your Honour, until you tell us so.  Thank you.  At least I have remembered that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That name is -- this part of the deposition should be redacted from the public minutes.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, the fact of mentioning a name without any particular reference to the individuals who have already testified should -- if we do not mention it -- and if nobody -- the witness does not know that is a protected witness, then there shouldn't be a problem.  And if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If someone, for example, was arrested under the same case, shouldn't we take into consideration the circumstances under which that -- those -- that name was mentioned?  Isn't there a risk in pronouncing the name of that particular individual in the recording of this testimony?  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, if we understand you correctly, people from the MDR were beating up people who were believed to be supporters of the MRND? 
A.	That's exactly the truth.  Even communal councillors were forced to join the MDR party.  People from MDR were following instructions from their president, Mr. Twagiramungu, who had said that any individual who was not a member of that good party, the MDR, had to undergo the wrath of the members of the MDR. 
Q.	And yourself, you told us earlier that from 1991, you became a member of the Democratic -- the PDC, the Christian Democratic Party.  Who was the president of the Christian Democratic Party? 
A.	At national level it was Jean-Nepomuscene Nayinzira.  The other member of the committee was Gaspard Ruhumuliza.  Given the fact that he was my son-in-law, all the members of our family automatically joined his party.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nayinzira is spelt, N-A-Y-I-N-Z-I-R-A; Ruhumuliza, R-U-H-U-M-U-L-I-Z-A. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Right from 1991, did you participate in the party activities of the PDC? 
A.	I participated in a rally that took place at Nyakabanda commune and I even spoke on that occasion.  Then the Interahamwe from Gisenyi wanted to attack Nyakabanda commune, and I publicly said that I saw demons that were wearing banana leaves, and I was making reference to the Interahamwe, who had come from Satinsyi.  I was saying that those demons wearing banana leaves wanted to kill Tutsis who had sought refuge in Nyakabanda commune at the COFORWA premises.  What I said was even recorded and even aired on Radio Rwanda.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Satinsyi is spelt, S-A-T-I-N-S-Y-I, Satinsyi.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Observation, Counsel.  Each time you mentioned proper names or names of  the communes or secteurs, would you please like to leave some time for the booth and those who are recording, to write them without difficulty. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Noted, Your Honour.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, do you remember approximately when exactly that PDC meeting took place in Nyakabanda? 
A.	That meeting took place when the Tutsi of Bigogwe (sic) were being killed.  I am not very sure whether it was at the beginning of 1993, I am not quite sure, but the Tutsi people of Bigogwe (sic) were being killed. 
Q.	And when you joined the PDC in 1991, did you ever participate in the activities of the MRND in Nyakabanda? 
A.	No, the party congress that took place, I believe, in 1989, and the congress of the new MRND, which followed thereafter.  But if you look at the archives you will note that Straton Sibomana did not attend any of those two congresses.  They took place after I had asked the president of the republic to be released from being bourgmestre.  Unfortunately, the president did not immediately respond or reply to my request. 
Q.	You told us that when you were fired from the post of bourgmestre, you left Nyakabanda.  Where exactly did you go? 
A.	I sought refuge in Kigali.  I had a house in Kabeza and that's where I was living.  The attackers followed me and even killed my son in 1993.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kabeza is spelt, K-A-B-E-Z-A. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	When you fled from Nyakabanda, when again did you come back to that place, Nyakabanda? 
A.	Minister Munyazesa, in collaboration with some other authorities, sent gendarmes to Nyakabanda commune and instructed me to return to my commune.  They sent controller, an auditor, to check the account books of the commune before they appointed somebody who replaced me.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The name Munyazesa is M-U-N-Y-A-Z-E-S-A. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, the question started with the word "when" -- "when" -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Don't be so elastic in your answer.  Can you please answer directly the question that has been raised so that we save so much time.  And so much the better for you because it would make you stay here for less time so that you can go and rest.  
THE WITNESS:
I returned to Nyakabanda commune during the month of March -- mid-March, I think, although I am not quite sure of the date.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  That question was answered.  You can continue.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So the Judge had asked the question about some individuals  we talked about.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:  
Maybe I would propose another closed session regarding those -- particularly for the individuals whose names we are going to mention, then we resume in open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thereafter, Prosecutor, do you have any observations to that?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
(Microphone not activated)...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So upon the request of the Defence, we are now going to go into closed session and you may mention, Counsel, later on when you feel we can go back to open session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 18 to 19] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 5 to 17 by Sheriffo Jammeh)

















BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	After you were dismissed from the post of bourgmestre, what occupation did you take up? 
A.	I received part time employment at COFORWA and I was in charge of recovering funds.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Bourguet is spelt B-O-U-R-G-U-E-T, Father Bourguet; COFORWA is spelt C-O-F-O-R-W-A, COFORWA.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Would the registry kindly assist in the distribution of this document?  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you recall at approximately what period you started working with Father Bourguet at COFORWA? 
A.	I started working with Father Bourguet when I left the position of bourgmestre in 1992.  It must have been in the month of July.  What I know, however, is that my employment contract was signed in 1993. 
Q.	Are you telling the Court that you signed an employment contract with COFORWA at some point? 
A.	I started working at COFORWA in 1992, and as I have already stated, I signed my employment contract in 1993.  At the time of signing the contract, I had already been working for COFORWA.  
Q.	It has been your statement that Father Bourguet was your friend.  Since when was he your friend? 
A.	Since 1972.  Father Perraudin had dismissed him from the parish because he had offered Mass directly into the hands of the faithful and Father Perraudin did not agree with that practice.  So when he was driven from the parish, he sought refuge at my place, until I gave him a piece of land on which he built a house.  So I gave him a piece of property after I received authorisation from the president of the republic to do so.  
Q.	What was the relation between Father Bourguet and COFORWA? 
A.	After he had been driven away by the Bishop, he worked in collaboration with me for the development of the commune and we set up -- or, establish the COFORWA jointly.  The business of COFORWA was to provide clean water for the population. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe I did not follow well, but the witness seems to say -- to have said that Father Bourguet had chased off somebody.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No, it is rather Father Perraudin, an emblematic figure in Rwanda had actually chased off 
Father Bourguet because he gave (inaudible) in the hands of the Christians, rather than place it on their mouth, which was unacceptable, according to the Father -- according to the Bishop.
MR. NG'ARUA:
Honourable Judge, I think I also found there was a gap in the witness's statement with respect to who was kicked out.  

Now, when you asked the same question, Counsel started answering from what he knows, but not what the witness said.  I would like the Court to caution counsel to be more cautious about that because that is not what the witness said, and he is now testifying.  I think it would be most unpleasant for me to cross-examine him on this.  So kindly may Defence counsel be directed to be faithful to the statement and the testimony of the witness.  The witness should clarify himself the gap, and not counsel.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, I vehemently protest against this type of comment.  I repeated what I heard from the witness and I did not attempt to mislead anyone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is one of the problems we encounter when we look at the CaseView because no one can clearly state what was said and what was not said.  But, in any event, I would like you to take into account the remarks that have been made by both parties and to exercise good faith.  I am not saying that you lied, but I am simply saying that it was not possible to crosscheck what had been said.  And the only manner to proceed would have been to look at what was said last and not three or four sentences before then.  So I think that you can proceed, Counsel, taking all of that into account.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
It would appear that the Prosecutor heard something which he alone may have heard.  And I would like to ask the witness to clarify this matter by repeating his answer. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell the Court again the circumstances in which you became Father Bourguet's friend? 
A.	Father Bourguet had problems with Bishop Perraudin because he had given the (inaudible) to the Christians directly in their hands, rather than place them on their tongues.  Father Perraudin came along with 
Father Rwabigwe, and another priest known as Basomingera, and took them -- or, rather, appointed them to replace Father Bourguet.  Father Perraudin chased away Father Bourguet and Father Michel, who both sought refuge at my home.  I hosted them in my home, and three weeks thereafter, I went to see President Kayibanda and told him that the two priests had sought at my home and did not want to return to their native countries and that they were participating in development activities.  So President Kayibanda accepted that I should host them as inhabitants of my commune.  It is within that context that the rural craft centre was created, COFORWA, and we used that centre to promote development activities in our commune with the support and collaboration of Father Bourguet.  
Q.	It was also your testimony that you jointly launched the COFORWA which was involved in water supply in Nyakabanda.  How many people were employed at COFORWA? 
A.	I cannot give you an exact number of the employees at COFORWA.  It started with a few people and ultimately increased to about 200 employees.  And even today, it still employs a significant number of people. 
Q.	Can you tell us the specific location at which COFORWA was situated in relation to the Nyakabanda communal office? 
A.	If one left the Nyakabanda communal office, one would go for about 500 metres; and close to the 
health centre, I gave a piece of land to that association, which is currently a very important enterprise. 
Q.	Well, at the time you worked there -- but before you get there, maybe you can tell us for how long and up till when you worked at COFORWA? 
A.	I worked for COFORWA till July 1994, then I went into exile. 
Q.	During the time you worked at COFORWA, could you give us a physical description of the COFORWA enterprise and its facilities and the location close to the Nyakabanda communal office? 
A.	COFORWA provided water to health centres initially.  Then it supplied water to various homes and residences in order to spare them the danger of drinking dirty water.  Then there were others who requested assistance, and in that context, COFORWA expanded its activities with the assistance of government to other communes with a view to providing clean water.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, a copy of the document has been placed before you and I have distributed the same document to the Court.  Do you recognise that document? 
A.	Yes, I recognise this contract. 
Q.	What is it? 
A.	Those who work for COFORWA had to sign a document similar to this and when COFORWA staff had to work in other communes, it was my duty to pay them on behalf of COFORWA.  And when payments were not made in some cases by the beneficiaries, I could lodge complaints.  And I was, therefore, in charge of the recovery services. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say then that the document before you is your employment contract which you referred to previously? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, maybe we can follow the same procedure as for the personal identification sheet of the witness, namely, to give a copy of this employment contract to the registry and wait for all the necessary exhibit numbering to be conducted as agreed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So are you seeking to produce this into evidence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, any comments, any objection?  

MR. NG'ARUA:
(Microphone not activated)...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please submit to registry, accordingly, and the relevant exhibit numbering will be assigned subsequently. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have testified that COFORWA was situated near the Nyabikenke communal office.  Between the time you were driven from office as bourgmestre on the 6th of April 1994, how many people worked at that location? 
A.	I am not able to give you an exact figure because I was neither the accountant nor the secretary of COFORWA. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I believe that I mistakenly said Nyabikenke, instead of Nyakabanda.  If that were to be the case, I will ask for the correction to be made. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Now, apart from those who worked at COFORWA premises between 1992 and 1994 -- July 1994, were there any other persons within those premises other than those who regularly worked at COFORWA? 
A.	There were some employees who worked in the field.  That's why I cannot tell you the exact number.  When people got contracts, people were sent outside -- to the field to work.  For example, in 1994, I went to Gisenyi and to Kibuye to recover funds in the name of COFORWA, but those people were not working within the premises of the COFORWA; but they were accomplishing their assigned mission to the field. 
Q.	And at any point in time during those years, 1992, 1993, even 1994, were there any people who came to seek refuge within the premises of the COFORWA? 
A.	Yes, some people came to seek refuge there.  At the beginning I accommodated some refugees who had no place to sleep in.  I took them to my house -- to the house of my son, Evalde, who was later on killed. 
Q.	Who were those individuals? 
A.	There was a man called Habiyakareme, elder brother to Muhammed Uwimana.  He is the father-in-law, and his mother-in-law -- and his son-in-law all came from Giciye commune and they were all accommodated there by myself in Evalde's house.  I put mattresses there for them in Evalde's house.  
Q.	Why did you have to accommodate them in the house of your son, Evalde? 
A.	It was not in his residence as such.  It was in a house that he had built in a trading centre just next to the commune office.  Moreover, Evalde had already been killed.  It was me who managed that house.  
Q.  	Otherwise, were there any other refugees who came and stayed in the COFORWA premises in 1992, 1993, 1994?  
A.	Yes, new refugees came in within those premises.  Father Bourguet welcomed them.  I was the adviser to Father  Bourguet.  They were well received and well taken care of.  They were given food and the refugees stayed in our premises until 19th April 1994. 
Q.	Who were those refugees? 
A.	Those refugees constituted Tutsis who had left the commune -- Satinsyi commune, Kibiriza commune and Giciye commune.  There were even some individuals who had come from Rubavu commune, whose houses had been destroyed at the time when the Bagogwe of Gisenyi were being killed. 
Q.	How many were they? 
A.	At some point there were about 470 people there.  We -- those 470, some of them were Hutus who had come from the Nyacyonga locality in the Kigali préfecture.  When those Nyacyonga refugees arrived, they lived alongside the Tutsi refugees and there was no problem amongst themselves at the time. 
Q.	And you said that they left in April 1994?  Where did they go? 
A.	After the departure -- when Father Bourguet left to return to his home, the bourgmestre noticed that there was no security for the refugees.  He took them to Kabgayi. 
Q.	On which date did Bourguet leave? 
A.	It was around the 11th or 12th of April.  I, moreover, accompanied him up to Ntarabana.  He travelled with Pierre Doussart.  So, after that date, the Tutsis of Gisenyi, who had been accommodated at the COFORWA premises were evacuated. 
Q.	Where were they taken? 
A.	Father Bourguet left them there.  They remained there for some time and they left later.  And it was thereafter, but by the time Father Bourguet left, they were still in those premises. 
Q.	Where exactly did they go? 
A.	Bourgmestre Jean Pierre Rukiramacumu took them to Kabgayi.
Q.  	Did Jean Pierre Rukiramacumu take them to Kabgayi alone?  
A.	No, he used COFORWA vehicles and I almost accompanied him with my vehicle, but, unfortunately, my vehicle had broken down.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There were a lot of proper names.  Would you like to return to them and spell them, please.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The last one is R-U-K-I-F-A -- M-A -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He was very fast.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The first -- some of the names -- I can't spell them myself.  There is Ntarabana, N-T-A-R-A-B-A-N-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you like to go slower for the interpreters in the English booth  to follow you.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
There is Ntarabana, N-T-A-R-A-B-A-N-A, otherwise, I would humbly request those who are able to spell them, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about the communes you mentioned, Satinsyi, Rubavu and the other one?  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, can you help us to tell us the communes -- the names of the communes from where the Tutsi refugees who were found at the COFORWA premises had come from, for purposes of spelling those names? 
A.	Some refugees had come from Rubavu commune. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Which is spelt R-U-B-A-V-U.  
THE WITNESS:
Then there was Giciye commune, G-I-C-I-Y-E.  Then Satinsyi, which is spelt, S-A-T-I-N-S-Y-I.  There was Kibilira, K-I-B-I-L-I-R-A.  Then Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A; Bagogwe, B-A-G-O-G-W-E; Kabgayi K-A-B-G-A-Y-I.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, the booth.  

Counsel, according to the program, the work timetable before us, is it okay with you if we took a break now or would you like to continue within that context?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Nobody would reject a break.  We would accept taking the break right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Witness, taking into consideration your condition, we would like to let you go out, stretch your legs a bit, take a cup of tea and then we come back later.  

As I said earlier, we expect the examination-in-chief to last about four hours.  So I think we have so far taken one-and-half hours.  So we could take a short break now.  Thank you very much.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  (French spoken).  (No interpretation)  
(Court recessed at 1112H)
(Pages 20 to 25 by Sheriffo Jammeh)



1120H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Following the break, we shall resume the proceedings.  And we note that the witness -- we note happily that the witness is -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, the witness is not wearing his headset. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Interpreter. Following the break, we shall resume the proceedings with examination-in-chief by Defence counsel. But we are happy to note that the witness is doing very well. He looks very well and we hope that he can continue to feel even better so that we can conclude our -- your examination-in-chief by 3 p.m.  Now -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the registry's expression seems to go counter to what you are saying.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But we are happy -- I think that we will proceed until 1 p.m., and that would be enough time for you to conclude your examination-in-chief, given that it would be four hours that would have been spent in examination-in-chief.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I added up to three hours, Mr. President, one and half hours plus one and half hours after this break.  I hope that I can be given time to continue the examination-in-chief after the lunch break.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, please proceed.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, just before the break we were talking about the evacuation of Tutsis from Gisenyi who had sought refuge at COFORWA and were evacuated to Kabgayi.  Now, to conclude on this point, I would like to ask you whether there were any victims among the Tutsis who were evacuated.

Mr. Sibomana, do you want me to repeat my question?  The question is, were there any of the Tutsis who were refugees at COFORWA and who were evacuated to Gisenyi, were there any victims?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
From the Kinyarwanda booth, Counsel, it might be necessary to check whether the witness's headset is working.  It would appear that the witness's headset is not working.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Can you hear me now, Mr. Witness?  

MR. LAROCHELLE:
Can you hear the Judge?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, please proceed.
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, this is the question I was putting to you.  Did any Tutsis from Gisenyi who were in COFORWA and who were evacuated in April 1994 by the bourgmestre, were there any victims among those refugees? 
A.	None of the Tutsi refugees was killed at COFORWA.  However, later on, two persons who were working for COFORWA and who had remained at that location were killed. 
Q.	But my question was in relation to the Tutsis, only the Tutsis from Gisenyi who had sought refuge at COFORWA, did any of them die? 
A.	None of them was killed. 
Q.	Do you know the Mushubati forest? 
A.	There's a great distance between Mushubati and Nyakabanda.  But the answer to your question is that I do not know the Mushubati forest.
Q.	Would you know whether some of the Tutsis from Gisenyi were taken away to that forest? 
A.	I do not know because that forest is very far away from my area of residence. 
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, between the time you were dismissed from the office of bourgmestre of Nyakabanda and the 5th -- or rather, I am sorry, I skipped a question.  

	Do you know Callixte Nzabonimana?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Between the time you were chased out of the office of bourgmestre and the 6th of April 1994, do you know what position he held?  
A.	I heard that he was the minister of youth. 
Q.	Did you know the political party to which he belonged? 
A.	He was a member of the MRND. 
Q.	How many times did you see Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana in Nyakabanda between the time you were dismissed from the office of bourgmestre in early 1992 and the 6th of April 1994?  How many times did you see him during that period? 
A.	I saw him once clearly.  But I hesitate as to any other times.  He came with Bikindi's group and in the company of Esdras Mumpumu, the group danced, and I am not quite clear what the date was.  At that time they had come to build awareness in the population in respect of the new MRND ideals.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mumpumu is spelt as M-U-M-P-U-M-U.
THE WITNESS:
At that time many people came to see Bikindi's group perform, and people were saying that a fool had come in lieu of a minister.  And these were MRND militants who had nicknamed him Kayarange (sic), which meant someone who had lost it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Biwirayaze is B-I-W-I-R-A-Y-A-Z-E. (sic) 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Q.	Can you confirm that the event took place before the 6th of April 1994. Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Where, specifically did that event take place in Nyakabanda? 
A.	Bikindi dance group performed at the Nyakabanda communal office. 
Q.	Was Bikindi himself present? 
A.	Yes, he was present, and I was able to recognise Bikindi, Esdras Mumpumu and 
	Callixte Nzabonimana.
Q.	Were there any other national figures of authority in attendance? 
A.	No, there were courteous onlookers who had come to see the group perform. 
Q.	You say that members of the population were present.  Are you able to give an estimate as to the number of persons who were present at the performance? 
A.	I would be lying if I give you a figure, but there were many people and I did not count. 
Q.	What was the ethnicity of those in attendance? 
A.	There were Hutus and Tutsis.  I do not recall seeing any white person at that gathering.  Only Hutus and Tutsis were present. 
Q.	And what was the crowd doing?  Did it join in the dancing? 
A.	The inhabitants had come to see the performance of Bikindi's group out of curiosity.  But it was a popular group which was well known for its performances. 
Q.	Were you able to identify or note that -- or note the political parties that were represented by the inhabitants in attendance? 
A.	I saw people wearing the MRND insignia and emblems, the two persons I mentioned before, 
	Samuel Hategekimana and Eduardo Kambanda.  The others did not wear any symbols of any other political party. 
Q.	Were there any members of the MRD in attendance? 
A.	Many inhabitants had come to admire the dancers.  And I can only say that the people had come to see that group perform.  It was well known for its performances.  And, by the way, I was present myself. 
Q.	Did Callixte Nzabonimana speak on that occasion? 
A.	I did not pay attention to the speeches that were delivered. I left while the group was still dancing and I did not pay attention to the speeches.  However, the speakers had come to campaign on behalf of the MRND. 
Q.	A short while ago you stated that it was within the context of an awareness building to the ideals of the new MRND that they had come.  Did you or were you able to notice whether anyone spoke of those ideals and why the MRND had organised that meeting? 
A.	Yes, those who spoke said that the new MRND was a very good party, but members of the population did not pay attention to what was being said.  They rather mocked the speakers. 
Q.	Did any one by way of their speech during that time suggest that a campaign should be launched for the elimination of Tutsis? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Objection.  Objection.  Now, at this juncture I am compelled to object to the line of questioning that counsel is taking.  He is again giving propositions to the witness to say yes or no.  That is not allowed in examination-in-chief.  He should let the witness tell the Judge exactly what he remembers of the meeting without being prompted.  This is called prompting.  My Lord, I would request that this question be disallowed and that counsel be asked to be more cautious and to rephrase the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, please take off your headset.  The objection of the Prosecutor leads us to draw 
	Defence counsel's attention to the fact that the witness has already answered to the question.  Fortunately, I was told that the stenotypists are in a position to remind us of what has already been said because they are taking a verbatim record of the proceedings.  One of the answers from the witness was that:  "I left while the group was still performing and I didn't pay attention to the speeches."  We believe that an answer has already been given to the question that was asked. 

	Counsel, please, proceed. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Q.	Can you hear me?  Can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I can 
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, those who were present at that event, did they tell you about what was said and the content of what was said through the speeches on that day? 
A.	Yes, people told me what had been said in the speeches. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court what people told you was said in the speeches? 
A.	Those who spoke are said to have said that the MRND had revealed its political stand and that encouraged people to join the MRND without fear.  However, I was told that members of the population continued to laugh at the speakers, that no one decided to raise their hand to join that political party.  
Q.	Those who told you what had been said in these speeches, did they mention whether any reference was made to Tutsis in the speeches? 
A.	From what I was told, the word Tutsi was not used. 
Q.	Was any property -- or were any goods distributed to the people during that meeting? 
A.	I am not in a position to know.  No, members of the population did not receive anything. 
Q.	Would you know whether sewing machines were handed out to people? 
A.	That would have been for the communal office.  You see, there was a group of people who had formed an association and who had received sewing machines from the commune.  Each commune had a centre where young persons were trained to sew and to knit.  So I don't know whether it is in that context that those machines were distributed. 
Q.	Were MRND uniforms distributed? 
A.	To whom would those uniforms have been distributed?  
Q.	Do you know a place called Kigina? K-I-G-I-N-A, Kigina? 
A.	Did you say Kigina?  What are you referring to?  Are you talking about Kigina, some place 
	in the commune, or what are you talking about?  I do not know any area known as Kigina in Nyakabanda commune. 
Q.	Do you know an area called Mount Ndiza? 
A.	Yes, there's a chain of mountains known as Ndiza which stretches from Nyabikenke commune to Nyakabanda commune as well as the former Buriga commune and stretches down to the former 
	Ndusu commune.  I know that chain of mountains.  Yes, I do. 
Q.	Would you know whether somewhere on Mount Ndiza Mr. Nzabonimana owned a building or property? 
A.	Yes, people say that in the Nyabikenke commune, at the top of the Ndiza, Callixte Nzabonimana had a farm in which he grew Irish potatoes.  I don't know if there was any stock breeding in that farm as well.  However, people said that he lived in what was called, the Mashira holding.  And Mashira was the former king of that area. 
Q.	Have you personally ever been to that place, Callixte Nzabonimana's farm? 
A.	No, I have never gone there. 
Q.	You talked to us a short while ago about your vehicle.  Can you tell us which type of vehicle it was, that vehicle of yours? 
A.	It was a Toyota Hilux. 
Q.	What colour? 
A.	It was white. 
Q.	From which year did you own that vehicle? 
A.	I had three vehicles.  They were second-hand vehicles.  And when they became mechanically bad I would sell them off.  Regarding the vehicle in question, I think I bought it around 1989, although I would not be very sure of that date.  Always my vehicles were white.  For example, I had a white Peugeot.  A Toyota Hilux was also white in colour. 
Q.	And that white Toyota Hilux, did you own it from 1989 to 1994? 
A.	Yes, and I abandoned it in the Congo. 
Q.	Did that vehicle undergo any modification or did it remain a normal Toyota Hilux pickup? 
A.	There were no modifications on my vehicle.  It was a Toyota Hilux, an ordinary Toyota Hilux. 
Q.	What type of cabin was it, single or double cabin? 
A.	Single cabin. 
Q.	How many persons -- people would sit in the interior of that cabin? 
A.	Normally it was meant for two passengers.  Let me correct what I said.  It took one driver and one passenger. 
Q.	What about in the rear?  How many vehicles (sic) could sit in the rear of that pickup truck? 
A.	While it was still in a good condition I could take up to 10 or 12 individuals in that pickup truck. 
Q.	Was it possible for you to carry 20 people seated in that truck climbing Mount Ndiza? 
A.	The road is very bad on the ascent to Ndiza summit.  I could not carry ten people inside there and climb up to the summit of Ndiza. 
Q.	You told us that you saw Callixte.  Do you remember seeing him once in a meeting you described in Nyakabanda?  Don't you remember seeing him anywhere else between 1992 and the 
	6th of April 1994? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
(Inaudible) I think he can get to that answer through other means.  What he is doing now is not lawful and should be disallowed. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Between April - sorry.  From the time you were chased out of the bourgmestre's office to the 
	6th of April 1994, did you receive any money from Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I did not have any special relation with him.  Why should he have given me money?  When people -- members of my family were being killed, he never came to visit us.  Moreover, I was not a member of the MRND party.  Why should he have been giving me money?  
Q.	Do you know where Callixte Nzabonimana lives? 
A.	Well, I heard over the radio that he is in Arusha. 
Q.	And between 1992 and 1994, do you know where he used to live? 
A.	He was living in Nyabikenke commune, but I never used to go to his house. 
Q.	Have you ever entered his house at any point in time? 
A.	Never.  He did not even know my residence.  If you asked him the question as to describe where my house is, he would be totally incapable of doing it.  Personally, I have never been to his house and he has never been to mine either. 
Q.	You talked of attacks by members of the MDR party attacking MRND people. Are you aware that Nzabonimana was a victim of such attacks? 
A.	Given the fact that Nzabonimana was not my neighbour, I am unable to answer your question.  I have no information on that. 
Q.	Yourself, did you, between 1992 and 1994 -- did you ever train any people, militarily? 
A.	I personally never underwent military train how then would I have trained anybody militarily. 
Q.	Did you receive for yourself or for people close to you -- did you receive any arms from 
	Callixte Nzabonimana?
A.	I have already told you that I had no friendship with Callixte Nzabonimana.  If you had a friend and you had a tragedy in the family, that person would come and visit you. 
Q.	So neither before nor after the 6th of April 1994.  You never received any weapons from 
	Callixte Nzabonimana; is that what you want to tell us? 
A.	I had a pistol myself which had been given to me in 1962.  I had received it lawfully and I used to pay taxes for my firearm.  When I crossed the border, Gisenyi, crossing into Ngoma, I still had that pistol on me.  Apart from that pistol, I never had any other firearm on me. 
Q.	Did you at any one point in time have bodyguards? 
A.	Except the gendarme who came to ensure my security when I returned from exile in Kigali, those gendarmes were there when the audit was being done.  Those gendarmes were moving between the commune office and my residence, and they were there while waiting for the appointment of somebody who replaced me. 
Q.	Now, let's talk about the period that followed the 6th of April 1994.  During the genocide how many times did you see Callixte Nzabonimana in Nyakabanda? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Again this question has been asked and answered well over twice, how many times he saw him from 1992 to 1994.  I remember that very well in my notes.  So I think counsel should be advised to move on to another question because he has already asked this question and it has been answered.  May the question be disallowed. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I have always been careful to tell the witness that it was before 1994.  So I don't know why the Prosecutor did not note that I mentioned -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
(Inaudible)
MR. LAROCHELLE:
These were two different periods and I was very careful to distinguish between before and after 
6th of April.  I asked him the incidents that took place before he was chased away from the office of the bourgmestre, and then systematically I chronologically -- I am now coming to the events past the 
6th of April 1994. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	May I refer to the stenographers.  What was the question that was raised precisely?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(From the French court reporter) Mr. Larochelle asked:  "Now I will talk about the period that followed after 6th of April 1994, that is, during the genocide, how many times did you see Callixte Nzabonimana in Nyakabanda?"  That's the last question, Your Honour.    
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's still not too clear, or it's me who understands it bad.  The first question, how was it raised and between which period was that question placed?  That's what the Court wants to hear.  What was the period targeted by the second question?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
(From the French court reporter).  Let me repeat the second question.  "Now I would like to talk about the period followed by the 6th of April 1994.  So, during the genocide, how many times did you see Callixte Nzabonimana in Nyakabanda?"
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was that the last question?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
(From the French court reporter).  Yes, that was the last question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	So, whether -- probably I misunderstood you. The question, "How many times during the genocide did you meet Mr. Nzabonimana?"  Did I understand it well?  So if that is the case, then it goes up to December.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
In any case, I am fully certain that the witness answered me the question that was targeting the time when he had been chased away from the office of bourgmestre.  Now, I am opening the new chapter and I am talking of the post-6th of April 1994.  
 
I would wish to insist that that question be maintained and the witness gives us an answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the question is going to be put to the witness.  

Witness, after 1994, 6th of April 1994, how many times did you meet Callixte Nzabonimana?  Do you hear me, Witness?  

The question of counsel, - Defence counsel, after the 6th of April 1994, did you ever meet 
	Callixte Nzabonimana?  And if yes, how many times after the 6th of April 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not pay any particular attention to see whether he was there or not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	That's why I am asking you to take a look at the video that was taken on that day because we are told that there was Prime Minister Kambanda and some other dignitaries -- ministers who came to install the bourgmestre who replaced Rukiramacumu.  And when the prime minister came for that function he was accompanied by some other authorities.  After the installation of that new bourgmestre, the 
	Prime Minister Kambanda distributed weapons, firearms, to members of the Ndiza battalion.
Q.	The event you are talking of, do you remember exactly when it took place? 
A.	That event took place, I believe, towards the end of May.  The other bourgmestre had left the place on the 8th of May 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Therefore, I believe that the function presided over by the prime minister might have taken place towards the end of May 1994.  What was the name of the bourgmestre who left on 8th of April 1994?  
THE WITNESS:
His name was Rukiramacumu.  He had hidden some people who were eventually killed by the population.  It is Nzabonimana who handed over those people.  He took him to Gitarama so that he could explain under which circumstances he had handed over people to be killed. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	We shall return to that question later.  For the time being I would like to finish up with the events on which -- during which you saw Jean Kambanda.  You said it was late May and that firearms were distributed to the members of the Ndiza battalion.  How many firearms were issued out?  
A.	It seems that on that day ten firearms were issued to the members of the Ndiza battalion. 
	Gaspard Mbahima (phonetic) was in charge.  There was also Nyirindekwe who was also part of that Ndiza battalion.  On that day ten firearms were distributed. 
Q.	And you told us that a new bourgmestre was installed.  Do you remember the name of that new person, that new bourgmestre? 
A.	He was called Kami Nsabimana.    Nsabimana is spelt:  N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  Nyirindekwe is spelt:  N-Y-I-R-I-N-D-E-K-W-E.  Nyirindekwe.
Q.	Do you recall how many people were present on that occasion? 
A.	The place was stemming with people.  I personally was in the crowd behind.  I managed, however, to see the prime minister because he mounted on top of a podium and he addressed the people saying that the people who'd received firearms were supposed to carry them all over the place, even in their farms so that they could defend themselves when the enemy attacked them.  Those are the words I heard from the mouth of the prime minister. 
Q.	Did he explain who the enemy was? 
A.	He talked of the enemy, just like that.  He did not say who the enemy was. 
Q.	Do you remember whether Nzabonimana was present on that day? 
A.	I was in the middle of a crowd.  People said he was there, but I can neither confirm it nor deny it because I never approached him to greet him.  But there's a video that was recorded on that occasion.  If you showed it to me, I would confirm whether he was present or not. 
Q.	And those people who were there, which ethnic group were they? 
A.	At that meeting there were only Hutus. 
Q.	Therefore - sorry.  You said a short while ago that around the 11th or 12th of April 1994, you travelled to Ntarabana.  Do you recall having said that? 
A.	Yes, I do, very well, except the fact that the incident took place in June. 
Q.	A short while ago you said that your trip to Ntarabana took place on the 11th of -- 11th or 12th of April.  So are you now telling us that the date of your visit -- of your trip was not 11th to 12th of May? 
A.	I went to Ntarabana in April 1994.  And I went to Ntarabana on the dates that I mentioned.  And when I went there, people -- the Tutsis in Nyakabanda had not yet been killed. 
Q.	With whom did you go to Ntarabana? 
A.	I was with Father Bourguet.  And the driver was called Ignus Nsengiyumva.  On my return I was with that driver, on my return trip.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
And Nsengiyumva is spelt - 
THE WITNESS: 
	Sorry.  Can I make further clarification here. There were three other individuals who accompanied Father Bourguet. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Who were they? 
A.	I don't recall their names.  They were ordinary members of the population who saw us take 
	Father Bourguet and they joined us.  I would like to inform you that those members of the 
	population used to work for COFORWA.  There's another name I recall now.  This is 
	Jean Baptiste Nkundabatware.  And fortunately (sic), I don't know the name of the other two.  
Q.	N-K-U-N-D-A-B-A-T-W-A-R-E, Nkundabatware.  At what time did you arrive at Ntarabana?
A.	(Inaudible)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English booth didn't get that interpretation. 
THE WITNESS:
We left very early.  We arrived at Ntarabana around 9 a.m. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	How long did you stay at Ntarabana? 
A.	Less than 10 minutes.  When we arrived at Ntarabana there was Father Dusalle.  And after introducing to him Father Bourguet, we left. 
Q.	Did you speak to Father Dusalle? 
A.	Yes, we did.  He even offered me a bottle of soda, a bottle of Fanta. 
Q.	Did he have time to tell you what had happened in Ntarabana? 
A.	No, we stayed for a very short time with him.  We even stopped on the verandah; we did not enter his house.  Therefore, he did not narrate to us what had taken place in Ntarabana. 
Q.	And from there you returned to Nyakabanda? 
A.	We left Ntarabana and returned to Nyakabanda. 
Q.	Were there any killings in Nyakabanda after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	The killings in Nyakabanda started on the 5th of May 1994. 
Q.	Who was behind those killings? 
A.	The individual at the head of those killings was Second Lieutenant Zimurinda, Jean Robert.  Zimurinda is spelt: Z-I-M-U-R-I-N-D-A, Zimurinda. 
Q.	Who were the other individuals that were involved in those killings?  
A.	The people who used to accompany him wherever he went out to kill. 
Q.	Do you know the names of those individuals? 
A.	Those individuals took -- grabbed a vehicle of COFORWA and the driver Karinda was driving it. Some other individuals boarded the vehicle but I did not see them, although when people were talking about what happened I recognised him. There was, for example, someone called Uwimana, another one called Eppemac Ndikubwimana, Hambudara Habyakare.  But I did not remember the names of the others, but I heard that the people who were committing those massacres were behaving like they were insane.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Can we have the spelling for the names that have just been mentioned? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Ndikubwimana, N-D-I-K-U-B-W-I-M-A-N-A, Ndikubwimana.  Habiyakare  H-A-B-I-Y-A-K-A-R-E.  Karinda, K-A-R-I-N-D-A.  Uwimana, U-W-I-M-A-N-A. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Did you personally know Lieutenant Zimurinda? 
A.	Yes, I knew him.  In fact, at some point he worked under my orders as a coordinator, but I was not able to work with him and so he was dismissed. 
Q.	Do you recall the date on which you dismissed him? 
A.	It was in 1988.  He impregnated a young girl and the communal conseiller asked him to take the young girl for a wife and he said no, so we dismissed him from work. 
Q.	After the 6th of April 1994 did Lieutenant Zimurinda come to your house? 
A.	No, he never came to my house.  And, by the way, if he had come to my house, he would have killed me because he hated me for having dismissed him from work. 
Q.	Do you know a place called Rusuri.  R-U-S-U-R-I? 
A.	Yes, I know Rusuri.  The biggest market in Nyakabanda, which holds in Rusuri. 
Q.	Do you know one Jean Habimana. H-A-B-I-M-A-N-A, for Habimana.  
A.	I know him very well.  He was an agricultural extension worker for the commune.  And furthermore, he is a native of an area that is close to mine.  In fact, I gave him some property close to Rusuri. 
Q.	Do you know what happened to him after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I learnt of it late, but I learnt, in any event, that in June 1994 at a date which I do not recall, he was killed by people at night at a drinking spot because of some problems or some family conflict which spread to the conseiller of the secteur who himself was ultimately killed.  And also involved certain members of the population.  This event took place some 25 kilometers from -- to my home. 
Q.	Do you know whether anyone whomsoever may have ordered that killing? 
A.	No, I do not know.  That person had worked as an agricultural extension worker for the commune.  He was Hutu.  His wife was Hutu.  His entire family was Hutu.  And then the Hutus were pitted against each other and he ended up being killed.  So I do not know whose hand was behind that conflict which degenerated into murder. 
Q.	Did you know or were you aware of the Nyakabanda crisis committee? 
A.	Yes, I know the said crisis committee.  I was, in fact, one of the members of the crisis committee, although I did not participate in its deliberations. 
Q.	Do you know a place called Kirwa?  K-I-R-W-A.
A.	Yes, I know Kirwa.  It is in that area or it is that area which defines the border of 
	Nyakabanda commune. 
Q.	Was there a roadblock at Kirwa? 
A.	In 1994 when Tutsis were being killed a road -- several roadblocks were set up here and there. 
Q.	Were you in any way whatsoever involved in the setting up of the Kirwa roadblock? 
A.	The distance between my home and Kirwa is 19 kilometres.  I did not play any role in the setting up of that roadblock.  I was no longer bourgmestre.  There was a new bourgmestre in office and I, therefore, was not involved in setting up the roadblock. 
Q.	You told the Court that after the 6th of April you did not see Callixte Nzabonimana.  Did you, however, in any way have contacts with him through third parties? 
A.	No, I never had any need to meet him and he never needed to meet me either.  When I left 
	the position of bourgmestre, Umuriza, my son-in-law, had very good relations with me as well as one Ndayiriza (phonetic).  Whenever I had any problems, those are the people who came to see me.  Ndayiriza for, example came to visit me when my son died.  The truth is that I did not have any close relations with other members of our political party. 
Q.	Did you receive any orders or did Callixte Nzabonimana attempt to give you any orders after the 
	6th of April 1994? 
A.	How could he have given me any orders of instruction or instructions?  I was not working for him.  He was not my boss.  And I had contacts more with Father Bourguet.  And I am familiar with the COFORWA events, but I don't have anything to say about Callixte Nzabonimana. 
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	In July, in the month of July, I left Rwanda. 
Q.	Where did you go? 
A.	I went through Gisenyi and sought refuge in Goma. 
Q.	When did you return to Rwanda? 
A.	I returned to Rwanda on 29th January 1997. 
Q.	What happened to you thereafter? 
A.	I initially stayed at first, at Father Bourguet at COFORWA.  Then the next day I went to visit my home and soldiers arrested me and threw me in jail.  That was the 2nd of February. 
Q.	Were you formally accused or charged with anything after the 1st of April -- 1st (sic) of February 1997? 
A.	The judicial police inspector alleged that I had participated in an attack where Ngoga and Ndidendereza were killed. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Ndidendereza is:  N-D-I-D-E-N-D-E-R-E-Z-A.  Ngoga is spelt:  N-G-O-G-A. 
THE WITNESS:
I was not accused of anything else apart from the murder or killing of Ngoga and Ndidendereza.  There was no other charge against me relating to Nyakabanda commune. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So from the 2nd of February 1997 to date, the only charge brought against you is that of being involved in the killing of Ngoga and Ndidendereza; is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes, that is the only accusation obtaining against me. 
Q.	So after the 2nd of February 1997, how long did you remain in prison? 
A.	I was held at the communal jail for one and half years.  Then in 1998 I was transferred to the 
	Gitarama prison where I spent some time and on the 30th of January 2001, the Prosecutor's office had concluded its investigations and I was released because they had come to the conclusion that there was no sufficient evidence to justify my being held in detention.  So I was provisionally released and requested to appear before the Prosecutor once every month.  I was also prohibited from travelling beyond 60 kilometres away from my home. Then I was re-arrested in June 2007. 
Q.	Do you know why you were released on the 30th of January 2001? 
A.	Yes, I know the reason why.  It is the former Bourgmestre Ngiramacumo, who testified that I had not participated in the murder of the two persons whose names I have already mentioned, namely, Ngoga and Ndidendereza.  Ngiramacumo even went as far as saying that those who had attacked those two persons had themselves attempted to kill me.  But unfortunately Ngiramacumu died. 
Q.	So on 30th January 2001 you were released.  Which court -- before which court did Rukiramacumu make those statements? 
A.	He testified to the Prosecutor in Gitarama. 
Q.	This was not a Gacaca proceeding; is that correct? 
A.	The Gacaca courts started their proceedings after Rukiramacumu had died.  So when he testified I had not yet appeared before the courts, and I was provisionally released prior to appearing before the judges. 
Q.	Who were those two persons who wanted to kill you going by Rukiramacumu testimony? 
A.	First of all, they wanted to kill me when I was with Father Bourguet and Jean Baptiste Nkundabatware.  Father Bourguet put me in his car and we were able to escape the killers by going through various obstacles.  Someone was dispatched to inform the préfet, and it was Inyamuremye, préfet at the time, who intervened, and calmed down the attackers who were attempting to kill us.  But they had been frightened.  They were afraid of attacking my residence.  And after the préfet intervened the attackers returned and Father Bourguet as well. 
Q.	When did that event take place, Witness? 
A.	This incident occurred in 1992. 
Q.	Now, let us go back to 2001 when you were provisionally released.  Thereafter, you went on to say that in June 2007 you were again imprisoned.  Why were you imprisoned in June 2007? 
A.	The Ngoga and Ndidendereza cases were about to start, and I was accused of having been present at the venue of their killing.  I acknowledged that I was present at that venue but I also stated that I did not play any role in their killing. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Maybe it might be preferable to go into closed session at this juncture, Mr. President, because we are referring to names of well known individuals. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But Counsel, we had intended to break at about now.  It is eight minutes to one.  Do you think that within those eight minutes you will be able to conclude on these matters you want to address in closed session? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Well, I will need about half an hour to conclude. Maybe we can take the break right away and I will finish my examination-in-chief when we resume this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecutor, any reaction?  Do we take the break right now?  Well, we break right now.  But given that we have doctors in the courtroom, we would like to ask them what they think of the witness's state of health.  Will he be able to stand the last half hour, five/tem minutes?  
MR.  LAROCHELLE: 
I can conclude right away or I could conclude after the break. I defer to the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecutor, what do you think?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I think it's only fair to the witness to break now and probably when we come back, get the opinion of the nurse as to how the witness is feeling.  In our motion -- in our response to the Defence motion over this issue, we had indicated that probably the witness will require a lot of breaks and rests.  And I think that we still stand by that.  And I think the best course of action is to find out from the nurse after the lunch break if the witness is strong enough to proceed for some more time.  

As the Court please.  
MS. RUGIRA: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  I think we can take the break now and continue after the break because the witness's state of health doesn't enable him to be in a sitting position for very long.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, after hearing from the parties, we shall adjourn for the lunch break now.  

Mr. Witness, enjoy your lunch.  But remember that you should abstain from discussing your testimony with anyone outside this courtroom because you are testifying under oath.  So please do not discuss with anyone what you have said so far and what you are still going to testify to during these proceedings.  The sitting is adjourned until 2:30.  Is that fine with everybody?  With all parties. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, Your Honour, only with a proviso that probably the Doctor should give us a short report - - to you after we come back as to how the witness should proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very well, but I personally see that the witness looks even younger.  He looks even stronger.  And so we will seek the opinion of the experts after the lunch break.  The sitting is adjourned.
(Court recessed at 1300H)
(Pages 26 to 40 by Judith Kapatamoyo)


















(Court resumed at 1435H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope we all had a good lunch, and, consequently, we can continue with our session.  

Counsel. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone is switched off.  We cannot follow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor had requested that the medical officer ascertain whether the witness is physically in a good state to continue with the session this afternoon.  

Thank you.  
MS. RAGIRA:
Your Honour, thank you.  The witness is in a good condition and is capable of going on for up to another three hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  I did not listen to you because there was a technical breakdown somewhere.  
MS. RAGIRA:
I was saying that the witness is in a good condition and that he is capable of going on for another maximum of three hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Microphone, again.  

Supposing we took our break at 1600 hours to 16:30, can we continue up to 1800 hours, if necessary?  
MS. RAGIRA:
Yes, I think if we took a break, the witness can go on up to 6 p.m. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Counsel for the Defence, you have the floor.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Sibomana, can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you. 
Q.	When we took our break you had just told us that you were arrested in June 2007, having been freed in January 2001.  Could you tell us why exactly you were re-arrested in June 2007? 
A.	It was because people plotted against me saying that I had participated in the attack during which assailants killed someone called Ndidendereza, Ngoga.' 
Q.	Do you know who those people are who claimed that you had been involved in that attack? 
A.	I know them.  I know those people who plotted against me.  I have it.  It is in writing.  Those people wrote that I even had -- I issued an order to the assailants to kill, yet I played no role at all in that murder. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Maybe we could once again go into closed session for this deposition, Your Honour, because I know that now some names are going to be mentioned and you had pointed out that such names should only be mentioned under closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fine with me, unless the Prosecution has any objection to that. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
(Microphone not activated)...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We could go now to closed session.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Your Honour.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 43 to 53] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 41 to 42 by Sheriffo Jammeh)

















(Court resumed at 1600H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Without any further ado, I would like to call upon the Prosecution.  The floor is yours for the cross-examination.  

May I repeat, because the witness did not have his headset on, the Prosecutor, please, the floor is yours for the cross-examination of the witness.  

And as we heard it in the examination-in-chief, we would like to ask you, Witness, to be specific, give answers only to those questions that have been put to you.  Thank you.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  

First, I would like to start with a small procedural matter.  Your Honour, we have certain documents that we have only been able to get a few minutes ago.  One of such documents is a videotape showing the Accused -- showing the witness's, Mr. Straton Sibomana's trial.  And we have not had time to give this document to the Defence.  However, during the break I informed the Defence about it and he does not seem to be overtly prejudiced by this disclosure.  And we also informed him that we only have one copy, so we are not in a position to give him the only copy that we have.  We have only received it a few minutes ago, from the Gacaca court where the witness appeared.  The other thing is, there is also another document that has come about five minutes ago and as soon as we peruse it, we will be able to give the Defence counsel.  But so far we have given him two documents with which we can be able to proceed.  So, My Lords, I'm seeking leave to give these documents albeit belatedly, to my learned friend.  

As the Court please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence, you would like to respond to the comments from the Prosecution?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I just first of all wanted to confirm that I, indeed, accepted that the Prosecution uses the video recording that has been given to him at the same time as the document which was given to him.  But we would like to appreciate the efficiency, efficaciousness and rapidity with which the Prosecution got these documents which are going to help us in advancing our proceedings.  I have no objection to that video being screened.  We, therefore, give our consent or our acceptance to have the two, used during this session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We shall always stress the point that we have a common objective, looking and finding the truth and nothing but the truth, whether it is examination-in-chief or cross-examination.  What we are driving at is to arrive at the truth.  As a result, the law guiding rule that will guide us through our work is goodwill, and this goodwill should respect the principled conditions on disclosure of material.  

And I would like to solemnly thank you, the Defence, for having accepted the screening of this video of this document because, indeed, even the legal provisions I would -- he would have rejected this 
	video to be screened here. We would like to express -- I would like to express my thanks to 
	Defence counsel for that spirit.  

And, Prosecution, I would also like to call upon you to always abide by the requirements of disclosure of material as stipulated in the Rules.  

Prosecution, you can go ahead with the screening of the video. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I will not screen the video immediately.  I will first deal with some matters that the witness can be able to answer, and then in due time I will come to the video. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, from your testimony I note that you were bourgmestre from 1963 to 1992; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are correct. 
Q.	And you agree with me that during that period of your life that you could have been at the height of your career as a person in civil service; is that correct? 
A.	I agree with you, Prosecutor. 
Q.	And it is correct, isn't it, Witness, that you understand the power in the office of bourgmestre as much as any ordinary person can; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I know the powers entrusted in the bourgmestre. 
Q.	And, Witness, during that period of your power you could actually meet with the president of the republic without too much problem; is that not so? 
A.	It was difficult to have an audience with the president of the republic. 
Q.	For ordinary persons.  But for you, when you were confronted with the problem of Father Bourguet you had no problem seeing President Kayibanda; is that not correct?
A.	You are right.  When I went to see President Kayibanda who used to live in Kivumo to ask him for refuge for Father Bourguet, I did not have any single problem. 
Q.	And that is just part of the power of the bourgmestre.  Witness, let's say you had also power over land in your administration; is that not correct? 
A.	Regarding land, it was the communal council that had all the power.  The bourgmestre could not individually take a decision concerning land without the approval of the land board. 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  When you went to see President Kayibanda to forward a petition of your friend, 
	Father Bourguet, you also were given authority to settle on a certain land; is that not correct? 
A.	After the president of the republic allowed us to do so, I consulted with the communal council and we gave him a place to stay.  We also gave him land, whether it was a house that was provided to the nurses. 
Q.	In other words, Witness, Mr. Sibomana, you had power over land, that's what we are saying, irrespective of the procedure, once you came back to the communal council and said, "We are issuing this land to so and so."  Was that what the law was?  Is it not so? 
A.	That was how things were.  A bourgmestre took decisions -- a bourgmestre who took all the decisions would not stay long in power. 
Q.	Absolutely.  So, in other words, what you are saying is that, coupled with your personal charisma, as an elder of the commune, you are able to influence very difficult decisions within a very short time.  That's what you are saying; isn't it? 
A.	I had charisma that, however, had to take into consideration the law in place. The communal council took decisions and I presented my -- the decision of the communal council to the préfet who would approve it. 
Q.	Yes, tell the Court, Witness, you were in power for roughly about 30 years; is that correct? 
A.	I am sorry.  I am sorry, I didn't work for 30 years.  I was bourgmestre from September 1963, 
	and in -- by end of 1991, people started chasing me away and preventing me from working.  It was Sous Préfet Rudakubana who was the acting préfet.  That's when I was chased away.  So I would say that I was in that office for about 20 years, not 30.  
Q.	(Inaudible)
A.	I agree with you. 
Q.	Now, there's a whole generation of youths who got married and settled in your commune during your power; is that not so? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreter would like to spell the name Rudakubana.  R-U-D-A-K-U-B-A-N-A, Rudakubana, sous préfet. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
(Inaudible)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, booth. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Even now you can't answer my question, Witness?  
A.	Can I ask you to ask your question once again?  I didn't -- it wasn't very clear. 
Q.	I am always obliged to you.  Please feel free to ask me to repeat the question if you feel like.  My proposition was this:  A whole generation of people grew under your power.  They were young, they married and settled and took responsibility in your commune while you were at the pinnacle of your power; is that correct? 
A.	I agree with your suggestion.  28 years is long enough for a child who gets born to get married within those 28 years. 
Q.	In fact, during that period when people saw you, they just saw the bourgmestre.  Your name was not really Straton, but "the bourgmestre."  When people saw you, they said, "That's the bourgmestre" for 
	28 years; is that not correct? 
A.	I don't agree with you there because the population knew that I was doing everything in order to develop my commune.  That's why there was friendship between me with Father Bourguet who was in charge of development projects.  I would like to inform you that my commune was landlocked. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, all I am saying is this, that with wisdom and your charisma and the goodwill of the government, you were able to do good to the community for 28 years and in turn got tremendous respect from people; is that correct?  Is that proposition correct? 
A.	May I once again ask you to repeat that question.  I didn't understand it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecutor, I would like to make life easy for you.  When you are not wearing the gown, you are even free to counter -- cross-examine the witness while seated down.  Feel free. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I feel better while standing.  Thank you.  I am most obliged. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, my question was that after having been bourgmestre for about 28 years, guided by your charisma and wisdom, in return, all the members of your commune grew to respect you tremendously; is that correct? 
A.	During the period under which I was head of my commune, whenever I brought people together to talk to them about development, particularly the construction of roads, the fight against soil erosion, permanent grazing areas, every time I talked to the population asking them to implement decisions on development, everybody followed my advice. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Witness, it's good to hear what you did for your commune but that's not the question the Prosecution raised.  The question was, during those 28 years you spent in power, you were highly respected by the population. 
THE WITNESS:
The population respected me.  When people failed to respect me and came even to kill my children and to throw stones at me, that's when there was no more respect for me. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	We will come to that, Witness.  I am looking at the better side of your 28 years, not the year when they threw grenades at your child and killed him.  

Witness, do you agree with me that it is only natural as a bourgmestre to know virtually every person in authority, for instance, who hails from your area?  Is that not correct, especially after 28 years in power.  It becomes natural, isn't it?  
A.	You are right. 
Q.	And more when you held a very high position, which during those days was one of the highest jobs; is that not so (inaudible)? 
A.	I agree with you, yes. 
Q.	So, Witness, tell me, you even knew the persons who were witch doctors in your area? 
A.	I knew the witch doctors in the secteurs.  I would even point them out with my finger.  
Q.	Now, Witness, you would agree with me that there were usually dangerous people in the community; isn't that correct? 
A.	In our case the sorcerers we knew were fellows who wanted to rob people of their property.  These were not sorcerers who were -- whose intention was to kill people.  I would call them just conmen or thieves who would just come to tell lies to people. 
Q.	Witness, some things can strike (inaudible) 
A.	There were -- you cannot find a sorcerer aged 11.  Whether it's a man or a woman, they have to be mature people.  You can't have children to be sorcerers. 
Q.	Witness, are you sure about that, that in your 28 years of career you never saw a sorcerer younger than 11? 
A.	I never met a single one. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that you just told the Court in your examination-in-chief that a certain person who was only a child of 11 was a sorcerer; do you remember that? 
A.	I never said that.  Instead I said that his father and his grandmother were witch doctors or sorcerers and that they left our commune and went to settle in another commune. 
Q.	Witness, I will request (inaudible) ... for a closed session.
