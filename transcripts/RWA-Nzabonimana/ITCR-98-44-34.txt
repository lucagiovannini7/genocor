         3   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  

         4        

         5        Could the registry introduce the case coming before the 

         6        Trial Chamber this morning, please?

         9        Trial II of the International Criminal Tribunal for 

        10        Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding,

        12        Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session 

        13        today, Wednesday, the 25th of September 2002, for the 

        14        continuation of the Defence case, when Mr. Hinds will 

        15        continue the examination-in-chief of Witness RHU23, DW7,

        19        Thank you, Mr. President.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu, for the registry.  May 

        21        we have the appearance of the parties, starting with the 

        22        Prosecution, for the record, please?  

        23   MR. FLEMING:  If the Court pleases.  I am Ken Fleming.  I 

        24        appear with learned friends, Ms. Ojemeni, trial 

        25        attorney, and Ms. Marotine, case manager.  Thank you.

        27        have the appearance of the Defence, please, for the 

        28        record, as well?

         1        Professor Bompaka, and the translator or interpreter, 

         2        Mr. Emilien Dusabe.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

         4        

         5        Interpreter, could you please tell the witness that we 

         6        remind him of his solemn declaration he made yesterday, 

         7        and that he will continue with his evidence today on 

         8        that same solemn declaration, please.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        10   MR. KIYEYEU: Mr. President, I have some few things to put 

        11        before the Court for your information.   

        12        

        13        The first point is that your directions of yesterday 

        14        with regard to the scrambling of the voice of the 

        15        witness, the devices have been already done.  That's the 

        16        first point.  

        17        

        18        And then, the second point is that you will find the 

        19        witness is on right-hand side this time.  It's because 

        20        the device that has been scrambled is on the right-hand 

        21        side, as you could see.  So, we would request that when 

        22        the witness speaks, the interpreter should switch off 

        23        his mike, and vice-versa, when the interpreter speaks, 

        24        the witness mike should be switched off to avoid the 

        25        problems that could be caused by the device.  

        26        

        27        

        28        The third issue is with regard to -- it's just the -- 

        29        the registry wants to make straight the problems that 

        30        appeared yesterday with regard to the court time that 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        was wasted.  You would remember that Mr. Hinds informed 

         2        the Chamber that he had informed the registry to put in 

         3        place the devices for altering the voice of the witness.  

         4        I informed the Chamber that it was not true.  I was not 

         5        aware and probably because he had said he had informed 

         6        the registry, I had to contact my superiors.  I got an 

         7        answer from them that there was not such a request.  I 

         8        came back to Mr. Hinds to make more clarification -- to 

         9        have more clarification on this point, and he informed 

        10        me that actually he was referring to the discussion made 

        11        in court last week -- in the beginning of last week, 

        12        whereby he had made two requests.  The first one was of 

        13        the possibility of censoring some information so that it 

        14        doesn't appear on the public screens or on the screens 

        15        for the general public, but at the same time, the 

        16        information appear on the screens within the courtroom.  

        17        The registry answered him that that was not possible 

        18        after being told by the technicians.  

        19        

        20        The second request he had made was whether it was 

        21        possible to alter the voice of the witness pursuant to 

        22        Rule 75B(I)(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.    

        23        The registry informed the Chamber that that was possible 

        24        but, indeed, it needed some prior notice.  Mr. Hinds 

        25        thought maybe it was the question of switching on and 

        26        off in a minute, and that's why he did not, you know, 

        27        notify the registry.  So, I just maintain that the 

        28        registry was not notified; the Court time was wasted 

        29        actually, just by bad luck, because Mr. Hinds did not 

        30        know the procedure.

         1        This we now, as the registry, request the parties to 

         2        take into account that next time, if the parties would 

         3        like to have their witnesses, you know, taken care of 

         4        under Rule 75B(I)(C), they should notify the registry in 

         5        good time, as the devices have to be operated within a 

         6        reasonable time that the technicians so advised.  I'm 

         7        most obliged, My Lord.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We take note of the observation, and I 

         9        think we will not waste more time; we'll go straight to 

        10        the hearing of the evidence of this witness.  

        11        

        12        And interpreter as well as the witness, please take note 

        13        of the procedure that has been outlined in order to 

        14        facilitate the evidence of this witness to be taken -- 

        15        professor Hinds, in case we are going into open session.  

        16        So, in case there is a need to go at a certain stage in 

        17        the testimony, there is a need to go into closed session 

        18        for the reasons that we all can perceive, please, let 

        19        the attention of the Trial Chamber be drawn to that.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        23   Q.   Good morning, Witness RHU23.  How are you today? 

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Now, it is very interesting that we hear 

        25        that the voice is scrambled, but I thought it should be 

        26        scrambled in a way that everyone could understand what 

        27        he is saying, yet distorted, if for identification 

        28        purposes.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe let us find out.  Counsel, maybe one of 

        30        your assistants, can you find out if the Accused hears

         1        and understands, because he is the one who understands 

         2        Kinyarwanda, perhaps, and he needs to understand 

         3        Kinyarwanda more than anybody else.  

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Mr. Kajelijeli says he understands the 

         5        witness in the language.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Let's go on and see how far we go.  Proceed. 

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Witness, yesterday when we adjourned, you were at the 

        10        ISAE institute the morning of April 7, and you were 

        11        denied entrance by soldiers who were there; is that 

        12        correct?

        13   A.   Yes, that's what I stated.

        14   Q.   Now, after being denied entrance to your work site, what 

        15        did you do?

        16   A.   As I have stated yesterday, I wanted to have a radio so 

        17        that I could listen to the news, and that is why I went 

        18        to fetch my radio at the person's house, the person I 

        19        had lent the radio to.

        20   Q.   Where was that person's -- where was that person located 

        21        in relation to the ISAE institute, the place of your 

        22        employment; that is, the person who had the radio?

        23   A.   This person lived next to the corn processing facility 

        24        in Ruhengeri.

        25   Q.   Now, did you travel to that location?  And if so, how 

        26        did you travel there?

        27   A.   In fact, I had to used a bicycle to go to that place, 

        28        but I did not reach that place because on the way I came 

        29        across wicked persons who did not allow me to continue 

        30        on my way.  So I had to turn back.  But on the way, I

         1        met persons who told me what had happened.

         2   Q.   What were you told had happened?

         3   A.   The persons I met always spoke of the death of the 

         4        president of the republic.  And on the road, I came 

         5        across a military vehicle in which there was a soldier 

         6        that I knew.  And he was the one who asked me to turn 

         7        back.  He told me that if I was careful -- if I had paid 

         8        attention to my surroundings, I would notice that I was 

         9        the only person on the road.  And he mocked me by asking 

        10        me whether or not I had heard on the radio that a 

        11        communique had been issued saying that people were not 

        12        allowed outside of their houses.  And this is how I came 

        13        to turn back.

        14   Q.   Witness, would the revelation of the name of that 

        15        soldier disclose your identity?

        16   A.   I see no problem in mentioning the name of the soldier.  

        17        Mentioning his name would not mean that I would be 

        18        identified.

        19   Q.   What was the name of the soldier who mocked you and told 

        20        you to turn around?

        21   A.   Lieutenant Mburubureingero.  Mburubureingero is spelt, 

        22        M-B-U-R-U-B-U-R-E-I-N-G-E-R-O; Mburubureingero.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        24   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        25   Q.   Now, sir, you described the people you saw on the road 

        26        as wicked.  Could you describe what these people were 

        27        doing or saying that caused you to characterise them as 

        28        being wicked?

        29   A.   I did not meet these persons as such.  It was, rather, 

        30        that I saw them all around the road.  They were arguing

         1        vehemently, showing that they were unhappy because of 

         2        the death of the president of the republic.

         3   Q.   Did you notice whether or not these individuals had any 

         4        weapons or either traditional weapons or guns with them 

         5        at that time?  Now, do you have any estimate --

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Translation. 

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Oh, I'm sorry. 

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Please.  And, please, do it slowly so that 

         9        those who want to take notes can take notes.

        10   THE WITNESS: I will repeat it once again, Counsel.  I'm not 

        11        sure whether you understood me, what I said previously.  

        12        I did not say that I met these persons on the road.  I 

        13        said that I saw these people along the road in their 

        14        houses where they had gathered in small groups and were 

        15        discussing the death of the president of the republic.  

        16        This means that I was not able to see whether these 

        17        persons were armed or not.  What was clear was that they 

        18        were not happy because of the death of the president and 

        19        of the people accompanying him.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Can you tell us, Witness, if you can, approximate time 

        22        of day that you met the soldier who caused you to turn 

        23        around?

        24   A.   It would be difficult to tell you the time and the exact 

        25        minutes at which I met that soldier.  But I know that 

        26        when I left my place of work and the time I spent on the 

        27        road and the conversation I had with this soldier and 

        28        the time that it took me until I reached my house, this 

        29        whole incident occurred between 6:30 and 7:15.  Because 

        30        when the soldier convinced me to turn back, I tried to

         1        continue a little bit further I did not really accept 

         2        what he said, but subsequently, I decided to turn back.

         3   Q.   Now --

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Just a minute.  I think we got -- I got it -- 

         5        we got that "this incident could have happened between 

         6        6:30 and 6:15"?

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Seven.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Seven-fifteen.  Okay.  Sorry.  Thank you.  

         9        Thank you, Counsel.  Could you go on.

        10   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        11   Q.   Witness, what -- could you describe the road that you 

        12        took from ISAE going towards the maize factory?  Was 

        13        that the macadam road that leads from Ruhengeri to 

        14        Gisenyi?

        15   A.   There is only one road that links these two places; that 

        16        is, the ISAE and corn processing facility.  There is 

        17        only one road that you take by bicycle.  It's a tarmac 

        18        road and there is no other road that links these two 

        19        places.

        20   Q.   Did you pass through Byangabo on the way then?

        21   A.   Yes, I went through Byangabo.

        22   Q.   And did you go as far as Nkuli or beyond Nkuli towards 

        23        the maize factory?

        24   A.   Yes, I reached Nkuli and went beyond Nkuli, because 

        25        there was still a kilometre to go before I reached the 

        26        corn processing facility.

        27   Q.   On your way back, sir, did you, in fact, take the same 

        28        path that you had taken travelling towards the maize 

        29        factory?

        30   A.   As I have mentioned previously, that is the only road

         1        you can take if you are using a vehicle.

         2   Q.   Now, sir, did there come a time when you on your way 

         3        back passed Nkuli?  And, if so, what observations, if 

         4        any, did you make there?

         5   A.   On the way back, as I have already mentioned, when I 

         6        left I saw people in their houses along the side of the 

         7        road.  And, on my way back, I also saw persons who were 

         8        in their houses along this side of the road.  But on 

         9        this on this occasion, some -- the numbers of persons 

        10        had increased, because it was already daytime.  So I 

        11        paid attention, looking here and there, and I noticed 

        12        that there were people all around.

        13   Q.   Did you see Juvenal Kajelijeli at that time?

        14   A.   I did not see Juvenal Kajelijeli.  But I saw his house, 

        15        because his house is not far from the road next to the 

        16        to the commune office for Nkuli.  And, as the gate was 

        17        opened, I was able to see the inside courtyard of the 

        18        house.  I saw the red vehicle that Kajelijeli usually 

        19        drove and it was there.  But as to him, I did not see 

        20        him.

        21   Q.   Did there come a time when you passed through Byangabo 

        22        on your way back?

        23   A.   Yes, sir, that's the only road I used all the time.

        24   Q.   Now, sir, can you tell this Tribunal what, if anything, 

        25        occurred while you were driving through Byangabo on your 

        26        way back from the -- your attempt to reach the maize 

        27        factory?

        28   A.   On my way back, when I arrived at Byangabo I saw a lot 

        29        of young people there just near the location that I 

        30        crossed the vehicle, and I noticed that that there were

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        people talking to the conseiller of the Busogo secteur, 

         2        sir.

         3   Q.   Do you know the name of that conseiller of the Busogo 

         4        secteur that was in April of 1994?

         5   A.   I remember the name of that person.  It was Ndisetse.  

         6        Let me spell it, Ndisetse, spelt N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E.

         7   Q.   Were you able to hear anything of the conversation 

         8        between these young people and the conseiller?

         9   A.   I was not able to follow the conversation between those 

        10        young people and the conseiller of the secteur, because 

        11        I was in a hurry to go back to the place from which I 

        12        came.  But I saw, I saw that they were talking around a 

        13        vehicle.  I'm sure that they were talking about the 

        14        death of the president.

        15   Q.   Now, you described the vehicle.  What type of vehicle 

        16        was there and the persons within that vehicle, if you 

        17        know?

        18   A.   That vehicle was a military jeep as usual, but I do not 

        19        know the names of the soldiers that were in that 

        20        vehicle.  But I saw that it was a vehicle that I had 

        21        come across before.  And as the conseiller was talking 

        22        very vigorously with those young people, I said to 

        23        myself that it was not safe to stay there.  So I had to 

        24        leave so that I didn't know -- I didn't hear what the 

        25        conseiller was saying to the young people and 

        26        vice-versa.

        27   Q.   Was the soldier who had told you to turn around, was it 

        28        the same soldier who was in that jeep at Byangabo?

        29   A.   As I had just said, it was not military jeep that I came 

        30        across, because I didn't see any other vehicle go by at

         1        that point in time.

         2   Q.   Now, did there come a time when you arrived back at your 

         3        place of employment, ISAE institute, that particular 

         4        morning?

         5   A.   Yes, sir, I was able to get to ISAE and once again.  I 

         6        found the gate of ISAE locked.

         7   Q.   Were there soldiers at the gate at this time on your way 

         8        back?  Now, sir, did you see --

         9   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  Translation of what he just said.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, interpreter.

        11   THE WITNESS: The soldiers that were guarding ISAE were inside 

        12        the compound, but outside there were two other soldiers, 

        13        one of them I knew -- as one of them that I knew that 

        14        was on leave, but this one I knew very well and I know 

        15        where he lives, sir.

        16   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        17   Q.   Would the disclosure of the name of that soldier, in any 

        18        way, affect your identity?

        19   A.   I do not see any problems about telling you the name of 

        20        that soldier.

        21   Q.   Could you then tell us the name of the soldier who was 

        22        outside of ISAE?

        23   A.   In front of the gate of the ISAE, two soldiers were 

        24        talking and the one I knew was Nzabandora, Rachael.  

        25        Nzabandora is spelt, N-Z-A-B-A-N-D-O-R-A.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: What is the second name? 

        27   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  Rachael.  Rachael, R-A-C-H-A-E-L.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

        29   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         1        other people in the vicinity of the ISAE, as people 

         2        other than the two soldiers including Rachael?

         3   A.   ISAE has houses around it.  I saw people outside talking 

         4        about the death of the president.

         5   Q.   Did you spend any time around the institute discussing 

         6        with people there about the events?

         7   A.   I stayed around for a while and I was rather near the 

         8        soldiers near the gate, because all of us were curious 

         9        about knowing what had happened.  And you would remember 

        10        that I didn't hear the news of the radio, so I hung 

        11        around to get some information from those soldiers.  And 

        12        I also saw some other people around; they were talking 

        13        about the death of the president.

        14   Q.   Did there come a time, sir, when you decided to go home?

        15   A.   At around 8 o'clock, I decided to go home, because on 

        16        that day I could not work.

        17   Q.   Did you, sir, make any observations with respect to 

        18        people who were around you at the time that you decided 

        19        to go home?

        20   A.   Among the people that were there, I did not notice 

        21        anything.  But it was on -- taking the highway, I mean, 

        22        the higher side of the road that I saw young people that 

        23        were screaming and I was frightened and I ran away from 

        24        them to go home.

        25   Q.   Can you describe these young people you say you saw and 

        26        in which direction were they travelling?

        27   A.   As I have just said, those young people left the 

        28        macadamised road and took the DEAD road, they were 

        29        heading towards Zaire -- they were heading towards ISAE, 

        30        that's ISAE, and went beyond the ISAE.

         1   Q.   Could you tell from which direction these individuals 

         2        were coming, whether they were coming from the commune 

         3        -- Mukingo commune or from the Byangabo market?

         4   A.   As I saw it, it was clear in Byangabo there were many 

         5        displaced people that had to run away from Butaro, 

         6        Kinigi because they were fighting there.  And among 

         7        those displaced people, there were young people.  I 

         8        thought those were the young people that I saw, but I'm 

         9        sure there were some young people from Byangabo, because 

        10        I did see those young people in Byangabo.

        11   Q.   Were you able to recognise the people you say you saw 

        12        outside of the ISAE institute, as some of the same 

        13        people you had seen at Byangabo that morning of 

        14        April 7th?

        15   A.   The displaced people, because of the war, appeared to be 

        16        unkempt because they had no soap and their clothes were 

        17        dirty.  I don't know their names, and I didn't know 

        18        where they came from.  But when they approached me, I 

        19        saw that they were displaced.  They didn't come too near 

        20        so that I could identity them and thus I decided to go 

        21        away from there.

        22   Q.   You indicated, sir, in your testimony that they were -- 

        23        that you knew some of the people who were from Byangabo, 

        24        and I want you to clarify that point.  How do you know 

        25        that some of the people that you had seen, they were 

        26        from Byangabo?

        27   A.   There are two roads from Byangabo to that location where 

        28        we were.  And a little bit further from Byangabo, I saw 

        29        young people coming and they were also screaming.  So, I 

        30        thought that those young people came from Byangabo and

         1        there were also war displaced persons that lived with 

         2        the natives of that location.  So I thought that those 

         3        people were displaced and came to find accommodation 

         4        there, sir.

         5   Q.   Now, do you know in which direction these young people, 

         6        who you say were screaming and so on, were going, in 

         7        which direction?

         8   A.   When they got to the level of the soldiers, I saw them 

         9        turn towards the direction -- they were with the 

        10        soldiers; they took a direction leading to the 

        11        accommodation of the Tutsi, sir.

        12   Q.   In which cellule were they travelling towards?

        13   A.   I saw them heading towards the Ruhengeri cellule in the 

        14        Busogo secteur.

        15   Q.   Did you at that time, sir, see Juvenal Kajelijeli or his 

        16        vehicle among these young people?

        17   A.   On both roads in the whole time I spent there, and on 

        18        the road where I had been, I did not see Juvenal 

        19        Kajelijeli.  I saw his vehicle when I left in the 

        20        morning to go back to Nkuli; that's when I saw his 

        21        vehicle.

        22   Q.   And that is parked in his compound; is that correct?

        23   A.   Yes, sir, I told you that the vehicle was parked in his 

        24        compound and that I didn't see it after.

        25   Q.   Now -- so, when you saw those young people you say going 

        26        towards Tutsi's residence in Rwankeli, were they in 

        27        front of you or behind you at that time?

        28   A.   They were behind me because I told you that when I saw 

        29        them arrive, I immediately went up.  And when they 

        30        reached the soldiers they took the road together and

         1        went towards me, but I think they were approximately 200 

         2        metres away from me.

         3   Q.   Now, those young people, did you see whether they were 

         4        armed with traditional weapons or guns?

         5   A.   When I saw them and I saw them shouting, jumping, as 

         6        they were jumping I saw big stick going into the sky, so 

         7        I was not able to move in closer to see whether they 

         8        were carrying traditional weapons or firearms, but I 

         9        could see them jumping and I could see them thrusting 

        10        sticks into the air.

        11   Q.   Were there soldiers among them who were armed?

        12   A.   I saw them with two soldiers and they were ones that I 

        13        said were at the ISAE, and they left with these young 

        14        people.

        15   Q.   Did you notice whether or not any of the people you saw 

        16        had any uniforms or were they dressed in any distinctive 

        17        colours?

        18   A.   I did not see anyone in uniform or wearing clothing in 

        19        distinct colours, but I have told you that these were 

        20        young and unemployed people.  The young displaced 

        21        persons who were just loitering on the side of the road.

        22   Q.   Now, did there come a time when you heard explosions and 

        23        gunfire?

        24   A.   When they reached the side road as to where these 

        25        persons were, I heard explosions and I saw houses 

        26        burning.  And I believe that the explosions were due to 

        27        the wood fires inside the houses or maybe there were 

        28        gunshots.

        29   Q.   Could you see the individuals when they took the path 

        30        going, or the road going to where you say these people

         1        lived?  Could you still see those individuals?  Were 

         2        they still within your sight -- line of sight?

         3   A.   You can clearly see that place, and there was nothing 

         4        that impeded vision from where I was and where they 

         5        were.  It's true that there was a sorghum field, but the 

         6        sorghum had already been cut down, and I could see them, 

         7        and I saw them going.  They were going towards that 

         8        place.

         9   Q.   Sir, did you see, at that time, see Juvenal Kajelijeli's 

        10        vehicle among those individuals at that location?

        11   A.   I have to repeat myself.  I have said that I did not see 

        12        him and I did not see the vehicle.  I knew Kajelijeli 

        13        and his vehicle quite well, but I did not see him or his 

        14        vehicle at that place.

        15   Q.   Could you describe his vehicle other than the colour and 

        16        the make?  Are there any distinctive markings on his 

        17        vehicle?

        18   A.   We were used to that vehicle because he used it to carry 

        19        wood as well to transport food items.  And on the 

        20        vehicle appear the letters "STB".  These letters 

        21        represent the name of the school where he worked after 

        22        he had been dismissed from his position as the 

        23        bourgmestre of Mukingo.

        24   Q.   Witness, I am about to ask you a question and before you 

        25        answer it, let me know whether the answer may disclose 

        26        your identity.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   Witness, would the distance between your location -- 

        30        withdrawn.  Would the distance between your residence

         1        and Busogo and your residence and the Munyemvano 

         2        compound disclose your identity? 

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: I am going to withdraw the question because 

         4        even the question is problematic.  

         5        

         6        Your Honour, I think we should go into closed session at 

         7        this particular time because of the area that I am going 

         8        into.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: How long; any idea?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't know how long.  This witness wants 

        11        to testify in public, we want him to testify in public, 

        12        but there is a balancing here, and I don't want to be 

        13        reckless of this.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We'll go into closed session as long as 

        15        it would be necessary to enable witness to answer 

        16        questions which could have a bearing on his identity.  

        17        And when that is done, we would certainly wish to come 

        18        back to the open section so that -- to enable members of 

        19        the public to follow the proceedings.   We'll do that.  

        20        Registry?

        21   MR. KIYEYEU: Technically, we are ready.  We are now simply 

        22        waiting for the evacuation of the members from the 

        23        general gallery.  We are now ready, My Lord.

        24   

        25        (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the 

        26        transcript (pages 18 to 21) was extracted and sealed 

        27        under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   Yes.  Witness, on the morning of the 7th, I asked you 

         3        about what observations did you make -- oh, have we gone 

         4        into open session?

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: We are in the process of going to open 

         6        session.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Oh, I'm sorry.

         8   MR. KIYEYEU: In fact, we are in open session.  It's just a 

         9        question of putting on the lights. 

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Witness, we are now in open session and I am putting 

        13        this question to you.  The morning of April 7th, while 

        14        you were at your home, what did you observe, if 

        15        anything, happening at the parish?

        16   A.   At the parish I saw that in the convent where the Tutsi 

        17        had taken refuge there was fighting.  It was quite 

        18        obvious.

        19   Q.   Did you make any observations of any individuals going 

        20        towards the parish that morning?

        21   A.   The people I saw before just down were the ones that 

        22        went towards the parish, even if it was not all of them, 

        23        sir.

        24   Q.   Were you able to identity some of the people whom you 

        25        had seen earlier you say going to Rwankeli; were they 

        26        some of the same people who were going towards the 

        27        parish?

        28   A.   I am saying this because I saw the soldiers once again 

        29        that I -- whose name I gave you among the people who 

        30        were going to the parish, so that I said to myself that

         1        it was the same group that was heading towards that 

         2        location.

         3   Q.   Among that group, sir, did -- how close were you to them 

         4        when you saw them going towards the parish; how close 

         5        were you?

         6   A.   I have the impression that my answer may reveal my 

         7        identity, but if you want only the distance without 

         8        mentioning the location where I was -- please say which 

         9        is the best solution for you.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, I think you asked the distance; was 

        11        it?  

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: I said how close.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Can you rephrase your question so that 

        14        maybe the witness could --

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I think the answer would be --

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, it depends.  At the time he alleged he 

        17        said to have seen those people, how far was he from the 

        18        soldier and the group? 

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   At the time that you said you saw these individuals, how 

        22        close were you from them?

        23   A.   Between myself and the group, 100 metres, approximately.

        24   Q.   Witness, you have given us an estimate in terms of 

        25        metres.  Let me just ask you this question, do you know 

        26        the length of a soccer field?

        27   A.   Yes, I do.

        28   Q.   Do you -- is it your estimate that the distance these 

        29        people were from you was the length of a soccer field, 

        30        or was it closer?

         1   A.   The soccer field may be lengthier, perhaps it would have 

         2        been better to say where I was standing or where I was, 

         3        but for reasons of security, perhaps I should simply 

         4        give you an estimation in metres.

         5   Q.   Well, I'd like you -- since you have given us estimation 

         6        in metres, I'd just like you to use a soccer field as 

         7        the distance and would it be the length of a soccer 

         8        field or one half the length of a soccer filed?  Give us 

         9        some estimate using a soccer field in terms of distance 

        10        you say you were when you made your observations.

        11   A.   The distance between me and that group was approximately 

        12        equal to a football field or soccer field, take out 15 

        13        or 20 metres, sir.

        14   Q.   At that time, were you -- did you see Juvenal Kajelijeli 

        15        or his vehicle?  This is within the group going to the 

        16        parish.

        17   A.   I did not see Juvenal Kajelijeli in that group, neither 

        18        did I see his vehicle when I remained at that place till 

        19        later on looking at what was happening and even, indeed, 

        20        until the end of the events that took place at that 

        21        location, sir.

        22   Q.   And during all of that time when you say the events took 

        23        place, did you see Juvenal Kajelijeli or his vehicle at 

        24        any time?

        25   A.   Let me say it again.  I've just said so.  I did not see 

        26        Juvenal Kajelijeli, neither did I see his vehicle.  And 

        27        the only road that that vehicle could use is one that is 

        28        for the length of a soccer field, approximately, sir.

        29   Q.   Now, did you hear anything coming from the parish 

        30        grounds that morning?  Did you hear any noises, and if

         1        so, could you describe it?

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Please, translate slowly; it is a long answer.

         3   THE WITNESS: It is unfortunate because I had to witness what 

         4        happened because of the spot at which I was, and I 

         5        couldn't have been anywhere else.  I witnessed those 

         6        events from the beginning to the end, from A to Z, I 

         7        heard the gunshots; I heard people screaming and crying 

         8        for help, I couldn't give you the names of the people I 

         9        saw because the events took place in a house that was 

        10        300 metres away, as I said.  And, of course, it wouldn't 

        11        serve any purpose to know the names of the people that 

        12        were crying out, sir.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   Now, after the events at the church -- at the parish, 

        15        what did you do, if anything?

        16   A.   The answer I may give you may reveal my identity unless 

        17        I answer indirectly, but a straight answer would perhaps 

        18        reveal my identity, sir.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  The question was -- Counsel, was that -- 

        20        what did he do after --

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, on the 7th.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: On the 7th.  After witnessing these events? 

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.  And, I mean, from -- I don't know 

        24        exactly what he is going to say, but it may very well -- 

        25        I can  -- I would like to complete this area before 

        26        going to another day, or in the evening and so on.  So, 

        27        I would like to complete this, but I can go to another 

        28        area and then come back into closed session, but I would 

        29        prefer just to chronologically finish up and, you know, 

        30        then move chronologically to his testimony.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  We can go into -- Mr. Fleming, we 

         2        can go to -- for a minute or two, into closed session 

         3        and have that answer given and then we come back to open 

         4        session.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I don't see what Fleming has to do with 

         6        this.  I mean it is the witness, it is his interest that 

         7        we are dealing with, not the Prosecutor.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: He is an officer of the Court, as well.  Still 

         9        remains.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay. 

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Right.  Could you please tell the witness 

         2        that we are now in open session.  He should be careful 

         3        not to mention names of people and places which have a 

         4        bearing on his identity.

         5   THE WITNESS:   Very well.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:   Yes, Counsel?

         7   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

         8   BY MR. FLEMING:

         9   Q.   Witness, you just told us that you were a member of the 

        10        MRND.  Were you an office holder of the MRND?

        11   A.   No, I was not an office holder within that party.

        12   Q.   The MRND in your region had a youth wing attached to it; 

        13        didn't it?

        14   A.   As I have said, there was indeed a youth wing which 

        15        represented MRND.  There were also other youth wings 

        16        which represented the other political parties.

        17   Q.   Please don't add gratuitous material.  Answer the 

        18        questions I ask.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour, the witness should 

        20        be allowed to answer the question to completeness as far 

        21        as the witness is concerned, and that is precisely what 

        22        happened when I was examining this witnesses.  I kept 

        23        fighting and the Court kept saying; "that is the 

        24        witness's answer".

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, but that would not prevent a witness 

        26        particularly who is able to answer the question and 

        27        understands the question, to be able to answer it 

        28        precisely.

        29   BY MR. FLEMING:

        30   Q.   Witness, you understand English; don't you?

         1   A.   Not very well.

         2   Q.   You understand French, don't you?

         3   A.   Yes, I do understand French.

         4   Q.   All right.  The question is; the Interahamwe -- I am 

         5        sorry, the MRND had a youth wing in your area and it was 

         6        an activist wing, wasn't it?  We are now talking about 

         7        the MRND, no other political party.

         8   A.   Yes, that is correct?

         9   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  The scrambling device is off with 

        10        the witness's microphone switched off.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  Could you please remind the witness to switch 

        12        on and off the microphone as and when he has given his 

        13        answer to the question -- and to switch off when he has 

        14        given the answer and to switch on when he is answering 

        15        the question.  I know it is a bit tedious, but it has 

        16        got to be done.

        17        

        18        Yes, Counsel.

        19   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you.

        20   BY MR. FLEMING:

        21   Q.   Witness, the MRND youth wing in your areas was called 

        22        the Interahamwe in your area; wasn't it?

        23   A.   I am not in a position to give you such details.

        24   Q.   Witness, are you telling this Court that you did not 

        25        know that the Interahamwe in your area were the youth 

        26        wing of the MRND, is that what you are trying to tell 

        27        this Court?

        28   A.   No, my problem is I didn't really grasp your question, I 

        29        did not understand it in the manner in which you have 

        30        just explained.

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1   Q.   Well, let's ask it again.  A simple question.  Was the 

         2        youth wing of the MRND in your area called the 

         3        Interahamwe?

         4   A.   Yes, I believe that was the name used then.

         5   Q.   Did the MRND have colours that represented a flag or a 

         6        uniform or something like that?

         7   A.   In our area I was not able to ascertain that you had 

         8        political parties that had colours.  However, some youth 

         9        do claim to belong to one or other parties.

        10   Q.   Did the MRND have a flag?

        11   A.   I did not see the youth wing of the MRND in activities. 

        12        However, I do know that each party had a youth wing, and 

        13        these youth wings had their own particular names, but I 

        14        didn't notice any flags.

        15   Q.   Witness, would you please listen to the question.  I am 

        16        talking about the MRND.  I have been, for the last three 

        17        questions.  Does the MRND have a flag?

        18   A.   Thank you, Prosecutor.  Let me respond as follows:  I 

        19        have not grasped what you want to know.  I have told you 

        20        that all political parties did have flags.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel would like to know; did the MRND 

        22        have a flag.  A specific question.  What do you say to 

        23        that, if you understand the question?

        24   THE WITNESS:  Thank you, Prosecutor.  My problem is that I 

        25        did not see MRND in the activity.  However, I have seen 

        26        the MRND youth wing without flags.  I do know that at 

        27        national level all political parties did have flags.

        28   BY MR. FLEMING:

        29   Q.   Could you then describe for me, please, the flag of the 

        30        MRND which you have just acknowledged was in existence 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        at national level?

         2   A.   Thank you, Prosecutor.  It has been a long time and I 

         3        can't remember the MRND flag.  However, I do know that 

         4        MRND had clothes for their female members.  For example, 

         5        one of them was called Inkenyero, that is the -- let me 

         6        spell it, I-N-K-E-N-Y-E-R-O.  The men wore shirts, and 

         7        the ladies wore dresses, and the colours were white and 

         8        blue.  I do believe that these were the colours of the 

         9        MRND party.

        10   Q.   In answer to a question a moment ago you said; and I 

        11        quote what you said:  "I saw activities of the youth 

        12        wing and I did not see them with a flag.  Would you, 

        13        please, tell the Court what activities of the youth wing 

        14        you saw?

        15   A.   Sometimes I met a young man and he would tell me that he 

        16        is from the MRND.  They would talk about the ideology of 

        17        the MRND, and then at some other place you could meet 

        18        somebody else who would talk about the good deeds of the 

        19        MRND and who would request you to adhere to that party.  

        20        That is all I know.

        21   Q.   Wasn't the flag of the Interahamwe used in your region 

        22        to denote the name of the youth wing of the MRND?

        23   A.   That terminology was not used to denote the youth wing, 

        24        to the contrary, it was used to denote all those who 

        25        were associated with the MRND.

        26   Q.   So that would mean that you too were a member of the  

        27        Interahamwe; is that right?

        28   A.   This expression normally denotes people who have come 

        29        together to promote development.  However, during the 

        30        war some people behaved badly, and it is because of them 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        that this term became generalised.  However, before the 

         2        war, this expression was meant to denote activities 

         3        relating to development -- to promote development.

         4   Q.   How did those people that you just discussed a moment 

         5        ago behave badly; what did they do?

         6   A.   I do believe I have talked about the youth.  However, I 

         7        can't state that here we are talking about the youth 

         8        wing or the GDL -- or GDR, sorry.  However, these are 

         9        youths that have destroyed houses, they have killed, and 

        10        up to today I don't agree with their activities.  Let me 

        11        spell Abakombozi, A-B-A-K-O-M-B-O-Z-I.

        12   Q.   Let's go back for a moment.  We were talking about the 

        13        Interahamwe, and you said, in respect of that term, that 

        14        it became a term which was used during the period of 

        15        unrest.  And you said some people behaved badly.  I want 

        16        to know who those people were and what those people did.  

        17        It was in the context of the Interahamwe that we were 

        18        speaking.  No other political party.  No other group.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, the witness distinctly said it 

        20        was at the time of a war.  There is a distinction 

        21        between that and unrest.  And if he was to characterise 

        22        what the witness said he should do it accurately.  The 

        23        witness said that it was at the time of the war.  I 

        24        don't know what war it was, but that is what the witness 

        25        said.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, that is exactly what Counsel is trying 

        27        to find out.  Because the witness, before this last 

        28        answer where there was a mention of Abakombozi he had 

        29        said during the war some behaved badly in the context of 

        30        Interahamwe.

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Correct, but not the unrest.  During the 

         2        time of war.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  During the time of war.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is what I am correcting.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  During the war some behaved badly, he was 

         6        referring to Interahamwe.  And then Counsel followed up 

         7        with a question; "what did they do," within that 

         8        context.  So, I think that's the question that Counsel 

         9        is trying to follow-up.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I understand, Your Honour, but that 

        11        characterises it as unrest, a significant legal issue 

        12        here, whether it is war or unrest.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.

        14   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour, it is not a significant 

        15        legal issue in this case because there is no war crime 

        16        charge left.  However, we will argue that another day.

        17   BY MR. FLEMING:

        18   Q.   All right, let us use your description of the war.  In 

        19        the context of the Interahamwe, and in the context of 

        20        what you describe as the war.  You said some behaved 

        21        badly, I want to know, first, who those people were who 

        22        behaved badly?

        23   A.   I told you that during the war you had some youth who 

        24        behaved badly.  However, I am not in a position to say 

        25        whether they are part of the Interahamwe, or whether 

        26        they are part of the youth wings of the other parties.  

        27        Myself I have seen some of them, but I must say that 

        28        their behavior leaves a lot to be desired.

        29   Q.   And what was that behaviour that left a lot to be 

        30        desired?

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1   A.   I told you that there were unemployed people and 

         2        displaced youths who invaded or attacked the residences 

         3        of Tutsis and looted their property, and that kind of 

         4        behaviour was not acceptable to us.

         5   Q.   Did some of these young people kill Tutsi?

         6   A.   I would say it is that youth that massacred the Tutsis.  

         7        But let me add that there were Hutus who were also 

         8        killed.  To conclude, I would also say, after the 

         9        accident that resulted in the President there were 

        10        unfortunate events that occurred.

        11   Q.   You have described it yourself as a war; who were the 

        12        parties to this war?

        13   A.   There was the war front in our area on the Kinigi and 

        14        Mukingo area, in the Shingiro location, and also in 

        15        Butaro.  So the battle was fought between the Rwandan 

        16        government forces on the other hand and the Inkotanyi.  

        17        There were cases of unrest during which fanatics and 

        18        members of the opposition parties engaged in battle.  It 

        19        is all of this that brought about the massacres that you 

        20        have heard mention made of.

        21   Q.   Who are the Inkotanyi?

        22   A.   Inkotanyi referred to members of the RPF.

        23   Q.   And who were the RPF?

        24   A.   The RPF was a party like many others, like the MRND, the 

        25        JDR and other parties that were existing in Rwanda.  I 

        26        can say no further because I never thought that I would 

        27        have had to explain those names.

        28   Q.   What ethnic group comprise the majority members of the 

        29        Inkotanyi?

        30   A.   The majority was Tutsi.

         1   Q.   And the majority of the Rwandan forces, what ethnic 

         2        group were they?

         3   A.   I wasn't able to secure the statistical data regarding 

         4        the Rwandan government forces.  Clearly, there were 

         5        Hutus and Tutsis.

         6   Q.   You have heard of the Arusha Accords, haven't you, in 

         7        respect of Rwanda?

         8   A.   Yes, I heard mention made of it.

         9   Q.   And you know as a man who was in a responsible position 

        10        in your society what the Arusha Accords were designed to 

        11        do; don't you?

        12   A.   We followed the Arusha Accords over the waves.  I 

        13        believe I do have some knowledge of it -- some 

        14        information about it.

        15   Q.   You are a man to whom the community looked for some 

        16        leadership; aren't you?

        17   A.   You are referring to which period, Prosecutor?  You are 

        18        talking about the past or this current period?

        19   Q.   I am talking about 1993 to 1994.  Let's narrow down to 

        20        that area first.

        21   A.   Where I worked I was in charge of some workers, that is, 

        22        I had some workers under my responsibility.  In my place 

        23        of residence I was under someone else's authority.

        24   Q.   You were a man who had aspirations of leadership; 

        25        weren't you?

        26   A.   Your Excellency, Prosecutor, I don't quite understand 

        27        what you mean by aspirations to leadership.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yea, Mr. Fleming.

        29   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, Your Honour, I will take it more slowly 

        30        then, if he doesn't understand that.

         1   BY MR. FLEMING:

         2   Q.   In 1993 you were a young man of 32; weren't you?

         3   A.   That's true, clearly I was still a young man.

         4   Q.   A young man gifted with the ability to speak publicly; 

         5        weren't you?

         6   A.   I don't know whether I was a good public speaker, 

         7        because it is not for me to so determine.  Let me say 

         8        that I was capable in what I was doing.

         9   Q.   And you were capable in public speaking in 1993 and 

        10        1994; weren't you?

        11   A.   I told you that I did not belong to any particular 

        12        community per se.  I was just in charge of a few 

        13        workers, I maintained a good relationship with them.  

        14        Maybe you were referring to the church, and when I refer 

        15        to the church, it is those who followed me who came to 

        16        that church who can characterise me as a good speaker.  

        17        Other than that I can't.

        18   Q.   You were speaking publicly weren't you, in 1993 and 

        19        l994?

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, before the witness answers, 

        21        the jurisprudence of this Tribunal, with respect to the 

        22        temporal jurisdiction is quite clear.  In 1993 -- I 

        23        don't know what the Prosecutor is trying to get from 

        24        this witness with respect with either what he did or did 

        25        not do in 1993.  But it certainly is not within the 

        26        temporal jurisdiction of this Tribunal except in very 

        27        narrow areas.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  Well, we don't know what Mr. Fleming will 

        29        say, but the question, I think, talks about 1993, l994 

        30        and two -- this is a witness who is being asked.  It is

         1        not the events, for example, of the accused person or 

         2        Kajelijeli, for that matter.  So the time frames can 

         3        also be seen in that context, you see.  He is a witness, 

         4        he is talking about events that, maybe he has knowledge 

         5        of them, we don't know yet, for example, why those 

         6        questions are being asked.  Maybe it is only after when 

         7        we will be able to know.  I hope so.  But when you talk 

         8        about the time frame strictly, he is a witness and 

         9        certainly do not touch Mr. Kajelijeli within the charges 

        10        that have been preferred against him.  Okay.

        11   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, can you translate the answer that was 

        13        given by the witness.

        14   MR. FLEMING:   I don't think it was translated to the witness 

        15        yet.  I think my question was asked and before it was 

        16        translated to the witness the objection was taken.

        17   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  Prosecutor, could you please 

        18        repeat your question, if that is possible?

        19   MR. FLEMING:  If I can remember.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT:  I thought it has been put and he had given an 

        21        answer?

        22   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  My Lord there was a change in shift 

        23        between the interpreters.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.

        25   MR. FLEMING:  I do remember the question, Your Honour.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.

        27   BY MR. FLEMING:

        28   Q.   In 1993 and l994, witness, you were speaking publicly; 

        29        weren't you?

        30   A.   I have answered that question more than once without

         1        being understood by the Prosecutor.  So which public are 

         2        you referring to?  Maybe if you explain I will answer 

         3        the way you want.

         4   Q.   You see, that suggests to me that you were speaking 

         5        publicly but you are trying to avoid answering the 

         6        question.  Now, were you speaking publicly in the 

         7        church?

         8   A.   I have answered more than once to that question.  Maybe 

         9        twice.  I noticed that you were taking down notes, and 

        10        if you look at your note you would notice that I have 

        11        answered that question.  However, now that you have 

        12        explained to me that the public you are referring to is 

        13        the church, yes, I accept that I did take the floor in 

        14        the church.

        15   Q.   You described before that, "there was a war front in our 

        16        area", that is what you said.  You remember telling us 

        17        that a few moments ago?

        18   A.   Yes, I do remember having so testified.

        19   Q.   You were not very far from the northern border of 

        20        Rwanda; were you, from where you lived?

        21   A.   That's indeed the case.

        22   Q.   The area where you live is, in fact, the region from 

        23        which President Habyarimana came; wasn't it?

        24   A.   That is not completely correct.  I lived in the 

        25        Ruhengeri Prefecture.  The former President came from 

        26        the Gisenyi Prefecture.  It is true that they border 

        27        each other, but there is a huge distance separating 

        28        them.

        29   Q.   Which one can drive in about three quarters of an hour 

        30        or an hour, isn't that right?

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Any problem?

         2   THE WITNESS:  Apparently the voice is not scrambled, 

         3        seemingly?  Apparently the voice is no longer scrambled 

         4        so one can clearly hear who is speaking.

         5   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  But it is scrambled for the 

         6        interpreter, anyway.

         7   MR. FLEMING:  It is also scrambled for me, Your Honour.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, that is what I heard.  Can you try it 

         9        out, please, interpreter?  No, before -- I know that 

        10        sometimes the equipment when they are touched they give 

        11        problems.  Can you try it out to be sure whether it is 

        12        not working, Interpreter?

        13   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  It is scrambled.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, can you give the answer; you remember 

        15        the question, can you give the answer, Witness?

        16   THE WITNESS:  Can I please request that the question be 

        17        repeated.  There was some slight trouble, I would be 

        18        pleased if the question could be repeated.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  Mr. Fleming, do you recall the question?

        20   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.

        21   BY MR. FLEMING:

        22   Q.   Let me put it in context again.  You told us that the 

        23        president came from the Gisenyi region, and you told us 

        24        that your region and that region had a common border.  

        25        Then you went on to say that there was a long distance 

        26        between them.  The question I asked you is; you can 

        27        drive between two, between three quarters of an hour or 

        28        an hour; can't you?

        29   A.   I don't know whether the distance you are referring to 

        30        and saying it could be covered within three quarters of 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        an hour or say, one hour, I don't know whether this 

         2        distance would be covered on foot or in a vehicle?

         3   Q.   I am sorry, in a vehicle.

         4   A.   Let me give you estimates, and that will be my answer. 

         5        If you leave Ruhengeri town in a vehicle to go to 

         6        Gisenyi; I, personally am a driver, I can cover that 

         7        distance in an hour, or one hour thirty minutes.  It 

         8        depends on the speed of my vehicle.  Some other people 

         9        can cover that distance in forty five minutes or in one 

        10        hour thirty minutes.

        11   Q.   When you are travelling from Gisenyi to Ruhengeri you 

        12        are basically travelling in and easterly direction and 

        13        slightly to the north, aren't you?

        14   A.   Sorry, Prosecutor, I have to think about the state of 

        15        the affairs before responding.  The fact that the region 

        16        of Gisenyi -- the northern and the southern part, is the 

        17        same as Ruhengeri.  So, when you travel to these two 

        18        regions you are still in the northern part of the 

        19        country because you are near the border between Rwanda 

        20        and Congo.

        21   Q.   Right.  However, the town of Gisenyi is on the western 

        22        border of Rwanda and to get to Ruhengeri you head in, 

        23        basically, the eastern direction; don't you?

        24   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Sorry, Prosecutor, could you 

        25        repeat the question for the Interpreter?

        26   BY MR. FLEMING:

        27   Q.   The town of Gisenyi is on the western border of Rwanda.  

        28        To go from Gisenyi to Ruhengeri, you head in, basically, 

        29        the easterly direction; don't you?

        30   A.   I am not an expert in Geography, however, I do believe

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        what you said is right.  When you travel from Gisensyi 

         2        to Ruhengeri you head from the west to the east.

         3   Q.   Now, the danger from the RPF was coming from both the 

         4        western and the northern borders of Rwanda; wasn't it?

         5   A.   The danger that RPF represented for the country actually 

         6        came from the border in the Kinigi regions as well as 

         7        other southern communes, such as the Butaro commune, 

         8        Byumba, as well as that of Kidaho.  Let me spell Kidaho, 

         9        K-I-D-A-H-O, Kidaho.

        10   Q.   So, there was increasing concern, wasn't there, in 

        11        Rwanda, about the invasion of the RPF?  And we are 

        12        talking now of 1993 and l994?

        13   A.   That is correct.  People were concerned about the 

        14        invasion of the RPF.

        15   Q.   Indeed, Ruhengeri itself had been the subjection of such 

        16        an invasion only a couple of years before; didn't it?

        17   A.   Yes, indeed.  There was also fighting in the Ruhengeri 

        18        Prfecture.

        19   Q.   And there was great concern in the Ruhengeri Prfecture 

        20        leading up to l994 that the RPF were very close to you 

        21        and could invade it any moment; wasn't there?

        22   A.   That's indeed correct, and that is how these events did 

        23        occur.

        24   Q.   And the Government in 1993 and in l994 was taking steps 

        25        to secure it's borders from infiltration by the RPF from 

        26        its border; wasn't it?

        27   A.   The situation was as follows -- the situation, actually 

        28        was that way.

        29   Q.   And the government was concerned that the RPF had 

        30        supporters in different regions of Rwanda; wasn't it?

         1   A.   Prosecutor, I cannot conform that, and I wouldn't say 

         2        that the government was concerned with these people who 

         3        supported the RPF because the Rwandan government had 

         4        initiated negotiations with the RPF in Arusha, Tanzania.  

         5        I am not sure if it is not far from here.  Whatever the 

         6        case may be, they were held in Tanzania in Arusha.  So 

         7        the government could not have felt concerned because of 

         8        these people, because in line with the negotiations the 

         9        Rwandans should be the same people and there would be 

        10        all defacto as the names we used here, namely; 

        11        Interahamwe.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour?

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I have not objected because I wondered 

        15        where we were going.  The Court has allowed these 

        16        questions way beyond the scope of direct, presumably 

        17        dealing with credibility.  This witness is now being 

        18        asked about government policy, government concerns.  

        19        There is no foundation that is laid for this witness to 

        20        give any more than his speculations about what is going 

        21        on.  What is the basis of this, what is the relevancy, 

        22        Your Honour.  Where are we going?  We are way beyond 

        23        questions of the Interahamwe.  Of course, I objected on 

        24        that.  We are now into government policy, et cetera.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Mr. Fleming?

        26   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honour, this 

        27        witness has spoken about government policy as and when 

        28        he has chosen throughout his evidence-in-chief, and now 

        29        he is pretending, of course, he doesn't know.  One, that 

        30        goes to credit.  Two, we are not very far from

         1        Interahamwe at all and it will become apparent within 

         2        the next two or three questions, provided the witness 

         3        does answer the questions that he is asked, where this 

         4        is headed.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Wherever he is heading with it, we have 

         6        gone way beyond the scope that we are talking about 

         7        here, and we renew our objection.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  I think, well, we are aware some of the 

         9        questions may have been raised in the light of the 

        10        evidence of the witness that he was a civic leader.  But 

        11        maybe Learned Counsel for the Prosecution should come 

        12        back to specific issues.  Because issues of policy 

        13        indeed, he has given his account how he came to know 

        14        them, according to his evidence and what have you.  I 

        15        think they need not to be developed that far.  But they 

        16        can be linked up to issues that concern his evidence as 

        17        already given in cross-examination and as well as in 

        18        examination-in-chief.  But issues of policy, really that 

        19        might be -- particularly, when you are talking about the  

        20        period of 1993 and 1994, in the light of his position 

        21        then which remains to be that, according to his 

        22        evidence, unless the contrary is shown.

        23   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour.

        24   BY MR. FLEMING:  Witness, the MRND was a very strong party in 

        25        your region because it was the area from which the 

        26        president came, that is; Ruhengeri, Gisenyi and the 

        27        northwest region.  I am suggesting to you the MRND was 

        28        very strong in that area.

        29   A.   Prosecutor, it will be difficult for me to explain the 

        30        political events or events linked to politics.  I

         1        wouldn't go as far as saying that MRND was the only 

         2        party to have basis in the Ruhengeri area, because you 

         3        do know that there is another president who hailed from 

         4        these two prefectures and he was not in the same party 

         5        as the president of the republic who was in the 

         6        opposition.  So, I would say that the RPF was 

         7        established in this region at the same level as MRND.  

         8        However, let me add that I did no have the time to 

         9        analyse the political events then because I was engaged 

        10        in other activities.

        11   Q.   Witness, the government was putting in place and 

        12        everybody knew that it was putting in place a civil 

        13        defence program, wasn't it, leading up to the events 

        14        that occurred in April of l994?

        15   A.   I do not really understand what you are saying because I 

        16        did not see this civil Defence program that you have 

        17        referred to.

        18   Q.   I am referring to the youths that were trained to defend 

        19        the region if necessary?

        20   A.   What I do know is that it is the soldiers who protected 

        21        the integrity of the Rwandese territory.  I was not 

        22        witness of these training that the youth benefitted 

        23        from, neither did I see these youth defend the region.

        24   Q.   Witness, how long after the 7th April 1994 did you 

        25        remain in that region?

        26   A.   Prosecutor, what period are you referring to?  Are you 

        27        referring to 1994 after some Rwandans went into exile, 

        28        or you referring to 1995?  So, I do not know exactly 

        29        what period you are referring to in terms of your 

        30        question.

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1   Q.   I am not sure whether something is being lost in 

         2        translation, but I specifically said how long after the 

         3        7th of April l994, did you stay in that region?

         4   A.   Thank you, Prosecutor.  Well, if this date had been 

         5        specified to me, that is, 7th April 1994, I would have 

         6        responded immediately.  Let me reply.  After the 7th of 

         7        April, I stayed in the region up to the 13th of July 

         8        l994.

         9   Q.   And in that time you stayed and you grazed cattle on 

        10        Tutsi land that had been rented to you by the 

        11        replacement bourgmestre; is that your evidence?

        12   A.   That is not correct, and I never testified such.

        13   Q.   Well, let us go to the land then.  You told us in your 

        14        evidence-in-chief that you in fact rented some land from 

        15        the bourgmestre, the replacement bourgmestre, and it has 

        16        been Tutsi land.  Didn't you tell us that?

        17   A.   The rented land I referred to, I used it to grow 

        18        potatoes, and however, I went into exile before the 

        19        harvest of these potatoes.  So, let me say what you have 

        20        said is not correct, because you have alleged that I 

        21        used this land to graze cattle.

        22   Q.   All right.  So you cultivated Tutsi land which you say 

        23        you rented from the bourgmestre.  That is your simple 

        24        position; is it?

        25   A.   Yes that did exist.

        26   Q.   Your conscience didn't find this offensive at all?

        27   A.   As far as I am concerned, that was not offensive.  In 

        28        any case, I believe this should have helped in resolving 

        29        the problem against some Rwandans who were fighting over 

        30        land.  I was asked to pay money to cultivate this land

         1        which was on the lower part of my house to cultivate 

         2        potatoes.  I accepted, and those who cultivated the land 

         3        -- it was my right to accept.  So, consequently I do not 

         4        see any problem relating to the fact that I accepted to 

         5        rent that plot -- that piece of land.

         6   Q.   Were the owners of that land dead at that stage?

         7   A.   The owner of that piece of land that I cultivated was 

         8        not dead, rather he had left for Congo, former Zaire, 

         9        where he had spent ten years or so.  And I was aware 

        10        that he was not dead.  He indeed came back and I gave 

        11        back the piece of land to him, and this did not lead to 

        12        any problems among us.

        13   Q.   You have described to us how in being elected to one of 

        14        the positions in the church, that you had to be 

        15        exemplary in terms of leadership.  You must also show 

        16        that you respect God and one's fellow man.  And you told 

        17        us that you showed this and that is why you were elected 

        18        to the position in the church.  You remember telling us 

        19        that yesterday?

        20   A.   That, indeed, was my testimony, and it is correct.

        21   Q.   Let us then go to what you told us was government policy 

        22        in respect of Tutsi land.  Do Your Honours wish to have 

        23        the break now?

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, if you think it will be convenient.

        25   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, it will be.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.  We will take a break for fifteen 

        27        minutes and resume our work at a quarter past four.  We 

        28        take note the stage where we have reached.  Yes, until 

        29        then these proceedings stand adjourned.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  We 

         2        continue in open session with the cross-examination of 

         3        the witness.  Mr. Fleming, please?

         4   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour.

         5   BY MR. FLEMING:

         6   Q.   You will recall in your evidence-in-chief, you told us 

         7        that the government set the policy in respect of Tutsi 

         8        land after the 7th of April 1994.  Do you remember 

         9        telling us that?

        10   A.   I do remember having given that kind of evidence but I 

        11        do not recall having said that such instructions came 

        12        from the government.  I heard you talk about the 

        13        government, the presidency or some very senior authority 

        14        at the  national level, such as the government or the 

        15        presidency.

        16   Q.   I am sorry, you used the term "the government", in your 

        17        answer to a question put to you by my learned friend.  

        18        Was that a mistake if you used the term "government"?

        19   A.   Let me remind you, Your Excellency, the Prosecutor.  Can 

        20        I ask you to look through your notes.  You would notice  

        21        that I made mention of the acting bourgmestre.  I did 

        22        not make mention of the government.  If that person 

        23        issued those instructions in his own name, I don't know.  

        24        But those instructions did not come from the Government 

        25        even though that person was an employee of the state.

        26   Q.   Are you saying that the instructions were solely his 

        27        own, he was acting alone with respect to the Tutsi land?

        28   A.   I won't be in a position to say whether those 

        29        instructions came from the government.  But the person 

        30        representing the State distributed land belonging to the

         1        Tutsis.

         2   Q.   Which Tutsis?  Land belonging to which Tutsis?

         3   A.   There were Tutsis who went in exile, out of the country.  

         4        There were Tutsis who were also killed.

         5   Q.   I want to tell you that your answer previously was that 

         6        it was the government who took a decision in respect of 

         7        the Tutsi land.  Are you not prepared now to say it was 

         8        the government?

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour.  The witness 

        10        clearly clarified his position and said it was the 

        11        acting bourgmestre see, and he gave his name; Semahani. 

        12        I mean, that is clear.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, I think the Prosecution are entitled to 

        14        seek clarification if indeed it was the bourgmestre as 

        15        put, or in association with the government.  I think 

        16        they can seek clarification on that issue.  I think they 

        17        are entitled to do that.  The witness can answer that 

        18        question.

        19   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour.

        20   THE WITNESS:  I think you did not quite understand me.  If 

        21        you had someone taking down the notes he must have taken 

        22        down the wrong notes.  When Counsel was putting 

        23        questions to me, in fact, up until now that you, 

        24        yourself, the Prosecutor was putting questions to me, I 

        25        did say that it was Semahani who was the acting 

        26        bourgmestre.  So, I won't be able to tell you whether he 

        27        took that decision on his own, on his own initiative, or 

        28        it was as a result of instructions issued by the 

        29        government.  All I know is that he was an agent of the 

        30        State.

         1   Q.   You see, this is the point, witness.  You are quite 

         2        happy to make a loose comment like it was a government 

         3        decision, and you did say that, and when confronted you 

         4        did back off that particular proposition.  You see, I am 

         5        suggesting that you are prone to make loose statements 

         6        from time to time about things you know nothing.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour.  What -- is he 

         8        testifying or making pronouncements as if he is before a 

         9        jury?

        10   MR. PRESIDENT:  I think you can make the suggestion and the 

        11        witness can respond to that-- by way of a suggestion.

        12   THE WITNESS:  I would like to tell you, and I notice that 

        13        there are people in front of me, and they were witness 

        14        when Counsel was putting questions to me, I talked about 

        15        Semahani.  And you, yourself, when you put these 

        16        questions to me, I did mention Semahani.  Now, regarding 

        17        instructions from the government, I think those 

        18        instructions need not go through the airways but through 

        19        written letters.  Semahani never showed me any letter 

        20        from the government instructing him to implement that 

        21        kind of order.

        22        

        23        At our own commune, you know, I didn't represent 

        24        anything, and all I am telling you is true, and my 

        25        testimony here is just the truth.

         8        assumption on your part; was it?

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Again, Your Honour, he is flogging a dead 

        10        horse, dancing with a shadow.  He has asked the question 

        11        over and over again.  What he is attempting to prove?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: According to the witness -- Mr. Fleming, now, 

        13        the evidence of the witness is that it was Semahane.  

        14        So, if there is anything that would be for the record, 

        15        we shall -- for the record to be examined and you can 

        16        take note of that, but the answer that should be taken 

        17        note of is what he says now.  Maybe, if you want to 

        18        follow it up from that point of view, but that is the 

        19        answer the witness gives with regard to the question of 

        20        the government, now.

        21   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, the point is -- Your Honour, the 

        22        point is he hasn't yet come to say why it is that he 

        23        said it was the government.  And that's the issue here.  

        24        And unlike my learned friend's analogy, I thought I was 

        25        riding a very much alive horse.  I don't want to put the 

        26        spurs in, but it's an issue that I want to ask this one 

        27        question in respect of that it was an assumption on his 

        28        part that it was the government.  That's all I want to 

        29        ask.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, you have ruled.  Your Honour,

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        you have ruled.  When I jumped up and try to intervene, 

         2        you said, "Counsel, we have ruled".  I want just to be 

         3        even-handed across here.  The Prosecutor is now 

         4        attempting to get another statement, and you've ruled; 

         5        he should accept that.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: I think the answer of this witness is that he 

         7        never mentioned the government.  The record, if, indeed, 

         8        there is anything of that kind, can always be examined. 

         9   MR. FLEMING: Thank you.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: You can move on to the next question, please. 

        11   MR. FLEMING: Thank you.

        12   BY MR. FLEMING:

        13   Q.   You said in answer to my learned friend's question 

        14        earlier on in respect of Gateyiteyi, 

        15        G-A-T-E-Y-I-T-E-Y-I, and I quote, I'm reading your 

        16        precise words:  "I personally know the circumstances of 

        17        his death".  Now, do you remember saying that earlier 

        18        on?

        19   A.   Let me repeat what I said here because I noticed you 

        20        insisted on putting that question to me.  I know the 

        21        circumstances under which Gateyiteyi met his death.  We 

        22        learned that Gateyiteyi died; he was killed with a gun 

        23        while he was in a dustbin at Ruziga's place.  I said so, 

        24        I know that that might be -- have some consequences; 

        25        that is, with respect to my own safety and security.  

        26        But let me state that this event will also be mentioned 

        27        in the traditional courts that goes by the name Gacaca.  

        28        And if you wish, you could ask me in future to send a 

        29        report to you because this incident will be mentioned in 

        30        the Gacaca courts.  We heard the sound of gunfire; we

                                        78

         1        got close to people and asked them why there was that 

         2        gunfire.  And they told us that it was Gateyiteyi who 

         3        had just been murdered, whereas he was hiding at 

         4        Rusigaza's place.  It was then that the other members of 

         5        the family sought refuge in the convent.  And so, that's 

         6        the reason why I told you that I was aware of the 

         7        circumstances that brought about his death.  We got the 

         8        news from people after hearing the gunshot.

         9   Q.   Thank you, Witness.  Would you please listen to the 

        10        question that I asked and answer that question. 

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        12   BY MR. FLEMING:

        13   Q.   Not one that you think should be answered.  The question 

        14        was:  You said in your evidence-in-chief, didn't you, 

        15        when being asked questions by my learned friend, and I 

        16        quote, "I personally know the circumstances of his 

        17        death".  You said that, didn't you?

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, there is no inconsistency with 

        19        what the witness says as testified to.  The witness has 

        20        simply explained what he, in fact, meant.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds --

        22   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, with the greatest respect --

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, Professor Hinds, I think it's 

        24        not a question of inconsistency here, it is a question 

        25        of the question being answered as asked.  And that's 

        26        what your colleagues are requesting the witness to do, 

        27        and that's the reason why they are putting back the 

        28        question to the witness.  Can that question be answered?

        29        

        30        Interpreter, interpret very slowly and let the witness 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        answer that question.

         2   THE WITNESS: I think my answer is quite clear.  Gateyiteyi 

         3        was my neighbour.  When we heard the sound of gunfire we 

         4        asked people why there was such gunfire.  They told us 

         5        that it was Gateyiteyi who had just been murdered, while 

         6        he was in a dustbin at Rusigaza's place.  And then, in 

         7        the morning when he had to be buried, that's where we 

         8        found him.  So, what I'm telling you here is true.

         9   BY MR. FLEMING:

        10   Q.   Witness, we are going to be here a long time.  The 

        11        question I asked you is this:  You said, did you not, in 

        12        answer to a question from my learned friend about this, 

        13        you said, and I quote, and please turn your mind to the 

        14        quote and answer whether or not you said it, "I 

        15        personally know the circumstances of his death".  You 

        16        said that to the Court this morning, didn't you?

        17   A.   That is, indeed, the case.  I think it is clearly 

        18        explained in my answer.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: That's what was required to be answered.  And 

        20        then, if there was a subsequent question, then you could 

        21        take up and answer.  Can you listen carefully and answer 

        22        the questions that are being asked; it might help us to 

        23        move forward easily.

        24   BY MR. FLEMING:

        25   Q.   Now, Witness, you learnt from others, didn't you, of his 

        26        death?  Other people told you, didn't they?

        27   A.   Yes, I got the information from other people and I 

        28        myself personally went to the place and noticed that it 

        29        was true, because we went there to collect the corpses.

        30   Q.   Witness, when you say, when you used the term, "I 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        80



          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        personally know", by that you include things that other 

         2        people have told you, don't you?  That you understand 

         3        the question, when you use the term, "I personally know 

         4        something", you include in that things that other people 

         5        have told you; don't you?

         6   A.   I know that one can know about something when someone 

         7        has personally witnessed the said event, or when someone 

         8        has been informed of the said event.

         9   Q.   All right.  Now, you say in the statement that you gave 

        10        to Mr. Kajelijeli's legal representatives that, "It is 

        11        well known that most bodies were found at the nuns' 

        12        convent while Gateyiteyi's body was found at Rusigaza's 

        13        compound".  You said that in the statement; didn't you?

        14   A.   Yes, that's my testimony and that is my testimony before 

        15        this very Court.

        16   Q.   You also say this:  "Gateyiteyi did not seek refuge at 

        17        Busogo parish, he was at the Tutsi, I learned from my 

        18        neighbours that Gateyiteyi was killed at Rusigaza's 

        19        location and his body was found at a garbage dump in 

        20        Rusigaza's compound".  You said that in your statement; 

        21        didn't you?

        22   A.   Yes, that indeed was my testimony.

        23   Q.   You said you were returning home on the morning of April 

        24        the 7th.  It was your testimony, wasn't it, that the 

        25        young people with a soldier or two were advancing on 

        26        Busogo parish?  That was your testimony; wasn't it?

        27   A.   Yes, I indeed made that statement.

        28   Q.   So by the time you were harmed, according to you, there 

        29        was nobody in the Munyemvano family compound; was there?

        30   A.   Yes, it's true.  It's the truth.

          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1   Q.   You say in your statement, "On the morning of April 7th, 

         2        all Tutsis in the area, including the Munyemvano family, 

         3        left their homes and took refuge at the church"; didn't 

         4        you?

         5   A.   I did not say that all the Tutsis in the area.  On the 

         6        contrary, what I said was that it's the Tutsis who were 

         7        staying at Munyemvano, because all Tutsi families in the 

         8        environs stayed at Munyenvano's house.

         9   Q.   Are you saying -- let us understand this perfectly -- 

        10        are you saying you did not say these words in your 

        11        statement, let me quote, "On the morning of April 7th, 

        12        all Tutsis in the area, including the Munyemvano family, 

        13        left their homes and took refuge at the church".  Are 

        14        you saying you didn't say that?

        15   A.   Well, if you consider the word "region" as an 

        16        administrative entity -- please, note that we are 

        17        talking about the Manjeli 1 and Manjeli 2.  We are not 

        18        referring to a vast area as such.

        19   Q.   Witness, we were going quite well just a few moments 

        20        ago.  Please, listen carefully to what I am asking you.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        22   BY MR. FLEMING:

        23        Answer the question that I asked, not one that you think 

        24        should be answered.  Did you or did you not say in your 

        25        statement these words, "On morning of April 7th, all 

        26        Tutsis in the area, including the Munyemvano family, 

        27        left their homes and took refuge at the church"?  Did 

        28        you or did you not say that in your statement?  That's a 

        29        simple question.

        30   A.   Prosecutor, let me say that the word "region", as used 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        82



          KAJELIJELI                                     25 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        in my country, it means -- it means a vast region.  Let 

         2        me give you an example.  The commune of Mukingo and 

         3        Nyakinama is currently considered as one region.  So, I 

         4        was not referring to a vast region.  On the contrary, 

         5        what I'm referring to is the region where my house is 

         6        found.  And, please, I would ask you to consider this as 

         7        a region of my residence.  And I was saying that these 

         8        people sought refuge in the nuns' house.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: I think there is a problem of interpretation 

        10        from -- maybe, I don't know where.   From maybe in 

        11        Kinyarwanda, I don't know, because the witness does not 

        12        appear to get the question.  The question is not the 

        13        area that is really being the issue.  Can you put back 

        14        the question again, slowly.  And, Interpreter, could you 

        15        ask the witness to listen very carefully and see whether 

        16        he understands the question.  If he has any problem he 

        17        can tell that to the Trial Chamber.

        18   BY MR. FLEMING:

        19   Q.   Witness, on the 23rd of September 2000 --

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't think it was translated.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Can you translate that to the witness, 

        22        please?  Thank you.  Yes, Mr. Fleming. 

        23   MR. FLEMING: Thank you.

        24   BY MR. FLEMING:

        25   Q.   Now, Witness, on the 23rd of September 2001, you signed 

        26        a statement that you gave to our learned friends, the 

        27        legal advisers and representatives for Mr. Kajelijeli.  

        28        Now, I am asking you whether or not in that statement 

        29        you said these words -- so, I am asking you whether or 

        30        not in that statement you said these words.  These words

         1        are, and I quote, "On the morning of April 7th, all 

         2        Tutsis in the area, including the Munyemvano family, 

         3        left their homes and took refuge at the church".  Did 

         4        you say those words in your statement?

         5   A.   Yes, I made that statement and it is truthful.  And 

         6        please, let me add that I am referring to my region of 

         7        residence.

         8   Q.   All right.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        10   BY MR. FLEMING:

        11   Q.   Why on the morning of April 7th did all Tutsis seek 

        12        refuge --

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  I think the 

        14        predicate question is whether or not this witness knows, 

        15        and that do you know why.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, I think that question is 

        17        perfect and can be answered by this witness.

        18   MR. FLEMING: He maintains his didacticism in Court, 

        19        Your Honours, and I can do my job.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you put your question, please? 

        21   MR. FLEMING: Thank you.  The question was put.  I don't know 

        22        whether they want me to repeat it.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can you translate the question to the 

        24        witness?

        25   THE WITNESS: Let me say that I did not spend the night with 

        26        them, so I can't know why they took that decision.  They 

        27        were in their houses; I was in my house.  What I do know 

        28        is that they were able to get refuge at that place.

         1        anything that would make them fearful; did you? 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: When?  When?

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, I think -- let your colleague 

         4        do the cross-examination and when there is a pertinent 

         5        issue, you raise it formally.

         6   THE WITNESS: Prosecutor, I have explained that the news 

         7        relating to the crash of the president's plane, I learnt 

         8        this news outside my house, and this occurred during the 

         9        night.  Now, when these people took the decision to seek 

        10        refuge in the parish, I didn't know.  Now, please try 

        11        and understand, Prosecutor.  These were times of war in 

        12        the region; the president of the republic had been 

        13        killed and these people were scared.  They were scared 

        14        of being attacked and killed.  And so, in the final 

        15        analysis, their fears were justified because these 

        16        people were attacked.

        17   BY MR. FLEMING:

        18   Q.   Tell me, you referred to them all as "Tutsis" -- "all 

        19        Tutsis", that's what you called them.  Why only the 

        20        Tutsis were in fear of their lives in seeking refuge?  

        21        Why that?

        22   A.   Prosecutor, I am flabbergasted to see that you are still 

        23        asking me questions relating to political affairs while 

        24        I am not a politician.  And during the events at that 

        25        time, I was not a politician either.  The fact of the 

        26        matter is that there was war between the Hutus and the 

        27        Tutsis, and the president who had just been killed was a 

        28        Hutu.  So, it goes without saying that the Tutsis were 

        29        scared that the death of a Hutu president could have 

        30        serious repercussions.

         1   Q.   Surely, they would only be scared of Hutu reaction, 

         2        wouldn't they?

         3   A.   This is a question that you should not put to me.  Maybe 

         4        it's a conclusion that you yourself can draw.  I don't 

         5        see why you are asking questions of a political nature, 

         6        I might just lose my bearing.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: But these questions are not of a political 

         8        nature.  Can you tell that to the witness?  And if the 

         9        question is not appropriate, the Trial Chamber will say 

        10        so, or the counsel for the Defence.  If he has an answer 

        11        to provide, he can provide one.  If he does not have, he 

        12        can say so; if he does not know, he could say so as 

        13        well.  So, let him again, if he may repeat, listen to 

        14        the questions carefully and react accordingly. 

        15        All right.  Yes, Mr. Fleming.

        16   MR. FLEMING: Yes, thank you, Your Honours.

        17   BY MR. FLEMING:

        18   Q.   The question was simply this:  It was only from the 

        19        Hutus that the Tutsi had cause to fear; wasn't it?

        20   A.   I believe that was the situation then.

        21   Q.   And as you said they were justified, weren't they, 

        22        because Hutus killed Tutsis on the 7th of April 1994, in 

        23        your region?

        24   A.   Yes, if events did occur in that manner.  However, the 

        25        truth is that Hutu killed Tutsi and Tutsis also killed 

        26        Hutus.  In the final analysis, both groups, Hutus and 

        27        Tutsis, committed the same acts.

        28   Q.   So, is it your view the Tutsi weren't killed because of 

        29        their ethnic background?

        30   A.   That is not the reason which led to the massacres of the

         1        Tutsis.

         2   Q.   I see you know the reasons that led to the massacres of 

         3        the Tutsis; would you like to tell us?

         4   A.   I do not know the reasons which led to the killings of 

         5        the Tutsis; however, it was obvious that there was a war 

         6        pitting the Hutus against the Tutsi and the Tutsis were 

         7        represented by the RPF, while the Hutus were represented 

         8        by the national armed forces.  It is, therefore, normal 

         9        that after the death of the president, that the Tutsis 

        10        got scared and decided to flee; that is, those who could 

        11        flee.

        12   Q.   Where the Tutsi who sought refuge in Busogo parish, were 

        13        they representatives of the RPF?

        14   A.   It is not easy for me to know whether the Tutsis were 

        15        representatives of the RPF, but it was known in the 

        16        country that Tutsi all over the country were 

        17        sympathisers of the RPF, sir.

        18   Q.   I asked you that question before and you told me you 

        19        didn't know.

        20   A.   On the basis of what I have just said, I am pointing out 

        21        that I did not know that because that was a political 

        22        problem.  I simply told you that there was a war between 

        23        the Hutu and the Tutsi, sir.

        24   Q.   Did you find the bodies of any children when you went to 

        25        bury them the next day in Busogo parish?

        26   A.   We saw dead bodies of children and adults as well, sir.

        27   Q.   So, tell me, I'm puzzled, were the children 

        28        representatives of the RPF?

        29   A.   Prosecutor, during the war bullets don't choose anyone; 

        30        being it children, being it adults, people died.  And it

         1        is within that framework that children were innocent 

         2        victims, sir.

         3   Q.   So, it is your evidence that this was an unruly gang of 

         4        people loitering along the side of the road accompanied 

         5        by perhaps one or two policemen who killed these people; 

         6        how can you call that a war?  There wasn't a soldier 

         7        inside; was there? 

         8   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Prosecutor, the interpreter is 

         9        praying that you repeat the question.

        10   BY MR. FLEMING:

        11   Q.   Witness, it is your evidence to this Court that the 

        12        people who did the killing here were young people who 

        13        had been loitering along the side of roads; people 

        14        without soap; people whose clothed were ragged, they 

        15        were doing the killings.  And I asked you, are you still 

        16        saying that these children were killed in a war?

        17   A.   It is not how one dresses that determines one character; 

        18        one cannot choose one's dressing to determine that one 

        19        is a soldier.  These young people attacked the Tutsi, 

        20        the Tutsi defended themselves.  Since the Tutsi were in 

        21        the minority they were vanquished.  And that is the way 

        22        that war happened.  We witnessed what happened, and it 

        23        was during those fightings that those children perished, 

        24        just like the adults.

        25   Q.   Are you now telling this Court that these young people 

        26        who had been loitering along the roads were really 

        27        soldiers in disguise; is that your explanation?

        28   A.   No, they were not soldiers.  They were very well those 

        29        young people that I talked about, apart from the fact 

        30        that among them there was a soldier.  I gave you the

         1        name and his colleague.

         2   Q.   Witness, in your statement again, signed on the 23rd of 

         3        September 2001, you said this:  "I saw the soldiers and 

         4        civilians around 8:00 to 8:30 a.m. going towards the 

         5        church and afterwards I began to hear guns and 

         6        explosions and people crying".  You said that in your 

         7        statement; didn't you?

         8   A.   That is correct, sir.

         9   Q.   How many bodies did you count as you buried them the 

        10        following day, as you took them out of the Busogo 

        11        parish?

        12   A.   I was not able to count the corpses.  Even you that come 

        13        from abroad, if you see more than one body piled up, you 

        14        would be sort of de-civilised; your mind wouldn't go 

        15        into counting bodies.  That was a special situation in 

        16        our country, so that I was not able to count those 

        17        bodies, but if I refer to the number of families we knew 

        18        in our region that came to seek refuge in the parish, 

        19        and if I refer to the number of dumps that those bodies 

        20        were dumped in, I would say the number of dead bodies 

        21        were 30 to 50, sir.

        22   Q.   So, you told us that there are about 1,500 of those 

        23        youths that morning.  You were able to count them in the 

        24        midst of all of this tragedy, but you can't tell us how 

        25        many bodies there were; is that the situation?

        26   A.   Prosecutor, let me say that when you look at somebody 

        27        alive, people alive, you can probably estimate their 

        28        numbers, but if you look at dead bodies, it is very 

        29        difficult to estimate their numbers.  All the more so, 

        30        as one would know that from one moment or the other, one

         1        could be killed, so that I couldn't count them, because 

         2        I was myself scared, sir.

         3   Q.   Witness, you agreed before that you said in your 

         4        statement that you saw the soldiers and so on, going 

         5        towards the church and afterwards you began to hear guns 

         6        and explosions and people crying.  We've agreed that you 

         7        said that.  I suggest that after you said those words, 

         8        you then said in your statement, "I then knew that the 

         9        cries were of Tutsis who sought refuge at the parish". 

        10        Did you say that in your statement; that is, to quote 

        11        again, "I then knew that the cries were of Tutsis who 

        12        sought refuge at the parish"?

        13   A.   Yes, that is in my written statement.

        14   Q.   You arrived back there at your house and you saw -- 

        15        before you arrived back just before -- sorry, I will 

        16        start this again, as you were nearing your house, you 

        17        told us that you saw the soldiers and civilians 

        18        advancing on the church.  You've told us that; haven't 

        19        you?

        20   A.   (Microphone off)

        21   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Microphone, please. Microphone, 

        22        please.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Would you start over, Interpreter? 

        24   THE WITNESS: I should like to remind you that when I answered 

        25        that question, I asked that it be done in closed session 

        26        because I was wary of revealing my identity by 

        27        specifying the location.  Defence, in that question, 

        28        made a comparison with a football field, and I said that 

        29        the distance between me and the persons that were moving 

        30        towards the church was comparable to a football field,

         2        understood that I was not on the road.  I did not want 

         3        to specify the spot at which I was, because of fear of 

         4        revealing my identity, sir.

         5   Q.   But let's take this out a bit, the soldiers and 

         6        civilians were then advancing upon Busogo parish; were 

         7        they, when you saw them?

         8   A.   That is correct, sir.

         1        1730H

         2   Q.   At that point all the refugees are actually in the 

         3        parish, isn't it; they were there, they had arrived?

         4   A.   The refugees were already at the parish.  There was a 

         5        group of refugees that lived in tents set up in the 

         6        convent's compound and other refugees had taken refuge 

         7        in the residence of the housed neighbouring the convent 

         8        on the lower side, so that the refugees were already 

         9        there, sir. 

        10   Q.   You saw no refugees arrive there after you arrived back; 

        11        did you?

        12   A.   The refugees that had fled the fighting from Kiningi, 

        13        Butaro and Shingiro were around the road, busy looking 

        14        for food because they were living in very poor 

        15        conditions.

        16   Q.   Sir, I will ask you again.  After your arrived back and 

        17        you saw the soldiers and civilians advancing on the 

        18        parish, you did not see any refugees arrive after that; 

        19        did you, that is, arrive at the parish?

        20   A.   The number of refugees was growing higher according to 

        21        the regions where fighting was taking place; for 

        22        example, at one time, you would see 1500 refugees and 

        23        the when fighting ceased in the those refugee regions, 

        24        some of them could go back home, then you will see only 

        25        600 refugees.  And when fighting resumed, the number of 

        26        refugees could amount up to 2,000.  So there was

        28        really paid any attention of the fluctuation of the 

        29        refugees.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:   I do not know where the problem is coming

         1        from, whether it is the inability of the witness to 

         2        understand or what.

         3   MR. FLEMING: Or he doesn't want to answer the question.  Your 

         4        Honour, we will assure him.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection to that type of question.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: We will take note of that but can the witness 

         7        answer that question.  We normally stop at -- it is now 

         8        time to stop.

         9   MR FLEMING:  Yes.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Certainly it was not the answer that he gave.  

        11        I certainly didn't understand that question.

        12   MR. FLEMING:  I will ask the question again, Your Honour.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        14   BY MR. FLEMING:

        15   Q.   The question, Witness, is that when you arrived back 

        16        from your travels on April the 7th, you saw the soldiers 

        17        and the civilians advancing on Busogo parish.  All 

        18        right.  From the time that you saw that happen, you saw 

        19        no more refugees arrive at Busogo parish before you 

        20        heard the screams; did you?

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can you translate the slowly, please, for the 

        22        witness to understand.

        23   THE WITNESS: After my return, I did not see refugees arriving 

        24        at the Busogo parish, but when those young people that I 

        25        told you went by the road, people were frightened and 

        26        they went to take refuge in their houses.  For example, 

        27        my wife and my children locked themselves up in the 

        28        house.  It was only myself that decided to act like a 

        29        man and went to see what was happening, sir.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: The question was arising from the church.

         1   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.  I shall resume in the 

         2        morning?

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         4   MR. FLEMING: Thank you.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  We will stop here and resume our work 

         6        tomorrow morning at 9:00.  Could you tell this to the 

         7        witness?  And since his evidence continues and is still 

         8        pending, he should not discuss his evidence with anybody 

         9        else outside the courtroom.  So until tomorrow at 9:00 

        10        in the morning, these proceedings stand adjourned.
