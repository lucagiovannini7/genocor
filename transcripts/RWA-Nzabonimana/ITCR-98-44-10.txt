MR. PRESIDENT:
The session is open.
 As we said this
morning, we decided to come back here at
3 o'clock to listen to Counsel Hinds,
Defence Counsel, and we decided that his
submissions were going to be in the form of
a motion, a motion in which he is drawing
the attention of the Chamber to the changes
that the Prosecution had made in the
indictment, whereas that the Chamber ordered
them to simply separate the indictment and
to make it more specific to Kajelijeli.
MR. HINDS:
Mr. Hinds will, therefore, tell the Chamber
how, in his opinion, the Prosecutor has
brought new charges against his client.
 We,
therefore, give the floor to Mr. Hinds.
Mr. Hinds, you have the floor.
Thank you very much.
 Judge Kama, earlier
this morning we presented arguments why we
felt that the Prosecutor had indeed violated
this Court's July 6th order, both granting
Mr. Kajelijeli's motion for a separate trial

and for severance; and we cited examples.
More specifically, we pointed out that in
Count 7 of the indictment, of the new
indictment, Mr. Kajelijeli has been charged
with crimes against humanity, and in
particular the crime of rape.
 It is true
that Mr. Kajelijeli was charged identically
in Count No. 7 in the indictment that was
confirmed by Judge Pillay.
The gravamen of our statement, where we are
saying that there are new charges, is that
in the indictment that was confirmed on
July 29th, 1998, there are no allegations,
no specific allegations with respect to
Mr. Kajelijeli in that regard.
However, if we look at paragraph 5 in the
new indictment, which the Prosecutor
assesses is a concise statement of facts and
events in Ruhengeri's pr fecture with
respect to Mr. Kajelijeli, they specifically
allege that between April and July of 1994
that many Tutsi women and men and children

were attacked, abducted and raped, and that
the Accused commanded, supervised, organised
and participated.
In paragraph 5.5 they make the allegation
that Mr. Kajelijeli ordered and witnessed
the raping and other sexual assaults on
Tutsi females, and at all times material to
the indictment he was a person of authority
with respect to at least stopping this from
occurring.
If you look at the indictment that was
confirmed in July of 1998 -- I'm sorry, in
August of 1998, August 29th, by Judge
Pillay, there are no specific allegations
that Mr. Kajelijeli attacked, abducted,
raped or participated in a rape of anybody.
But this cannot just be looked at in
isolation.
 It must be looked at in respect
to the statements that were provided to us
supporting these new charges.
 And these
statements allege the most horrific types of
crimes, where women were raped, using

instruments such as sticks.
 This is a
horrible situation.
 For the first time we
are -- I'm faced with that, having never
seen any allegations with respect to that,
not in connection with my client.
And so we, by way of example, are showing
those statements.
 Certainly, we have
pointed out that there are allegations that
Mr. Kajelijeli was involved in inciting, at
rallies, individuals to commit genocide.
That has not been, in fact, laid out at all
in any of the allegations or statements
contained in the prior confirmed indictment.
There are allegations that Mr. Kajelijeli
distributed weapons, was involved in the
distribution of weapons.
 That was not
contained in the confirmed indictment of
August 1998.
When you look at the allegations contained
in the indictment, the confirmed indictment
that was confirmed by Judge Pillay, with
respect to acts that were committed in

Ruhengeri in particular, you see and you
compare the allegations contained in the new
indictment, where we are specifically
looking at what Mr. Kajelijeli allegedly
did, this is where we see, we are facing, we
believe, a new indictment.
 And what the
Prosecutor, in fact, did was, recognising
when she looked at the confirmed indictment
and decided that in order to comply with
this Court's order, which specifically said
that the Prosecutor was to file a separate
indictment pertaining only to Juvenal
Kajelijeli from the existing confirmed
indictment, from the existing confirmed
indictment.
On looking at the confirmed indictment and
separating out Kajelijeli, it was clear that
whatever allegations that were contained in
this indictment, the confirmed indictment,
were insufficient to support any allegations
in a new indictment, supporting 11 counts.
And, therefore, they then proceeded to
assemble new allegations contained in the
new indictment and supported by the

41 witness statements.
And our contention, Your Honours, is that
the Defence now is faced essentially with
preparing for a new defence of a new
indictment, because over the past 22 months
we were dealing with preparing to defend
Mr. Kajelijeli against an indictment with
specific allegations that, in fact, defined
or described what he did in concert with
others, but what he did.
When we looked at that indictment we saw
that there were no specific allegations
sufficient to support the charges against
him with respect to most of the counts.
That is why we brought a motion for
severance and for separate trial.
 There was
no other reason; that is the reason.
Because we saw when you looked at the
indictment and you looked at the allegations
there wasn't enough there to support the
charges.
 And that is true.

Now, the Prosecutor proceeds and presents us
with a new indictment, but reformulated, we
say, not under this Court's order to submit
a new indictment consistent with the
confirmed indictment, but with new
allegations, new allegations unseen.
 And we
are asking either that this Trial Chamber
order the Prosecutor to, in fact, confirm
the new indictment consistent with your
order, or in the alternative allow
Mr. Kajelijeli to plead to the new
indictment, and then we proceed from there.
Our position with respect to many of the
allegations, they are beyond the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal.
 They are
allegations of acts that occurred in 1990,
1991 and so on.
 So we know that they are
beyond the scope and jurisdiction of this
Tribunal, which is contained within the
witness statements that, at least what we
understand they intend to proffer that
testimony at a trial.

Now, we also want to point out to the Court
with respect to the proposed trial date --
and I don't know if the Court wants me to go
into that, but it's tied in.
 May I?
 Okay.
I came here today to deal with the issue of
readiness to start a trial.
 The issues that
I raised with respect to being faced with
new charges relate to the question of
whether or not we could reasonably within
10 weeks prepare a trial that would defend
Mr. Kajelijeli and it is in that context
that I raised the issue of us being faced
for the first time with these new charges.
But there are other complicating factors
beyond the Prosecutor's control that this
Court ought to be aware of that makes it
impossible for us to proceed under the
timetable that the Court envisions.
 The
Court, I'm sure, has received a copy of a
letter that I received from co-counsel, who
has left the United States and is now
involved in a proceeding in Northern
Ireland.

That has greatly distressed and concerned me
because, unlike most other Defence teams, I
am faced with a situation where I cannot
communicate with my client.
 He speaks one
language, I speak another.
 So, therefore, I
have assembled a Defence team with bilingual
capability.
 Many of the bilingual
individuals who are investigators cannot
travel to Rwanda because they are Rwandese.
There are obvious problems, so therefore, I
had been relying upon co-counsel, who is
fluent in French, to accompany me to do the
necessary investigations in Rwanda.
We had planned to have at least one round of
investigations completed by August, but
since we were faced with a new indictment
and we realised that we would be given new
statements -- and incidently the statements
that we have received, those 41 statements,
most, if not all of them, we have not seen
before.
 They were not produced by
Mr. Webster and if they were, there may have
been one or two, but they certainly were not
significant.

We now have a situation of being presented
with this information where we delayed
conducting our investigation in Rwanda and
now are faced with co-counsel being away for
the next six months.
 It is impossible for
me to proceed under these circumstances.
There are other problems that I have that
I'm trying to remedy at this precise
situation -- this precise date.
 We are now
hiring a bilingual person to be in New York
with me so at least I can communicate with
my client.
 He writes to me in French and
documents are just piling on my desk because
I have no-one to translate them.
 This is
not a problem of the Prosecutor's Office.
This is a problem that the Defence team is
having which is interfering with our ability
to proceed.
 With respect to the latter
issue, it's an aggravating factor, but I
expect to have that remedied before I leave
here in the next couple of days.

problem with the investigation in Rwanda is

a daunting problem.
 And so, therefore, for
me to be able to solve that we need
sufficient time.
 We cannot proceed with
this matter and provide justice to
Mr. Kajelijeli if we are to try this case in
less than six months, the minimum time that
is needed.
And, so, the Court has asked me to reduce
some thoughts to writing.
 I've tried to do
that without any staff, and I know I
probably ran maybe about 10 or 15 minutes
late, but you have a document in front of
you; and excuse any of the typographicals

Mr. Hinds, I thank you.
 In order that you
stated that you were ready for a trial on
the basis of the original indictment, when
you came here you said you realised that it
was not the original indictment but an
indictment containing new counts.
 That is
the reason why you stated that not to allow
your client to plead on the new counts will
be unfair and inequitable.

Yes.
 Thank you very much.
Your Honour, listening to my learned friend
speak to you this afternoon --
Could you speak a little louder, please?
Listening to my learned friend address you
on issues that are ordering him in respect
of this matter this afternoon, one wonders
why he cannot come out straight to say that
he is not in a position to go on with trial
in January; because he has catalogued all
the problems he's having now and as a result
of that it's obvious that he's not in a
position to go on with the trial.
 So, I
think what he's doing is more or less using
-- what he's doing is a calculated attempt
to delay justice in this matter, and I will
implore him to please proceed with trial

to go on with trial.
Having said that, what I will say is that
the issues he raised in respect of the
separate indictment that we filed, in
compliance with your order of 6th July this
year, we have addressed all the issues this
morning.
 But suffice that to say, that I
will just highlight a few comments on the
issues he raised.
Having said that, I'll draw your attention
to the relevant paragraphs in the original
indictment in support of our position that
we complied fully with your order to sever
all the allegations in the old indictment
against the Accused and incorporated in the
new -- in the separate indictment that we
filed, and that we did not introduce any new
charge in the count.
 We have maintained the
11 counts as charged in the original
indictment.
 And what we merely did was to
specify the allegations that are against
him, and then it's unfortunate that he's not

even appreciative of what we've done by
simplifying the defence of his client by at
least giving him -- furnishing him enough
information that will give him the link
between his actions and the charges we have
in the new -- I mean, the separate
indictment.
However, in paragraph 12 of his motion
before you, and also in response to the
issues he raised as regards the new
indictment, in support of his allegation
that the separate indictment contains new
charges, I would like to draw your attention
-- I would like to speak on each issue by
drawing your attention in the relevant -- I
mean, clauses in the old -- I mean, original
indictment.
The first issue is the issue of incitement.
In order not to bore you I will try to be as
brief as possible.
 I refer you to
paragraph 5.4 of the old -- I mean, original
indictment.

we generalised all the allegations against

the six co-accused that he acted in concert
with.
In paragraph 5.4 we mentioned -- it's very
clear that he was involved, the Accused was
involved in the incitement that took place
in Rwanda.
 And if I may -- if I may read
it, it says:
 "The incitement to ethnic
hatred and violence was a fundamental part
of the plan put in place.
 It was
articulated, before and during the genocide,
by elements of the FAR on the one hand and
by members of the government and local
authorities in the other", and it falls
under the local authorities.
And also, if I may refer you to 5.11.
 In
the both the original indictment and the new
one we described him as a leader of MRND,
and in 5.11 we also mentioned what the
leaders of MRND did in respect of the
incitement.
 So either he's participated in
inciting the people, as mentioned in the
indictment, and he was regarded as an
influential personality and so -- we've in

the new indictment we've merely specified
his role in that incitement.
Then the third issue is -- that also extends
to propaganda.
 And then he informed you
that there was no way in the original
indictment where mention was made of
training and supply of weapons as regards
this participation in respect of that.
 I
will refer you to paragraph 1.9 (sic) in the
original indictment, and his name was
specifically mentioned there.
 And with your

"Furthermore, as early as 1993, Joseph
Nzirorera and Juvenal Kajelijeli organised
and supervised the creation and the training
of a group of Interahamwe-MRND militia in
their native commune of Mukingo" Ruhengeri.

I will also refer you to 5.24 which also
talks about the training of the militiamen.
Likewise 5.29, 5.27, and I have stated in
the new -- I mean, the separate indictment,
we mentioned that the Accused had special
relationship with Joseph Nzirorera, and in
the statements that we have so far -- we
have disclosed there is ample evidence to
show, or to buttress this assertion.
 So
everything that relates basically to, in
respect of training in Ruhengeri, mentioned
under the "Training of the Militia" also
concerns the Accused.
 So it's not a new
charge that we've introduced.
 Neither have
we introduced any new element or evidence
different from what we have in the original
indictment.
Then coming to the issue of rape, the crime
against humanity, I will refer Your Honours
to paragraph 6.54.
 I refer you to --

on the Tutsis from Mukingo commune and from
the neighbouring areas".
What we've merely done in the separate

components of the attacks.
 And in 6.101 we
generalised the sexual assault.
 And with
your kind permission I will read again:
"During the events referred to in this
indictment, rapes, sexual assaults and
other crimes of a sexual nature were widely
and notoriously committed throughout Rwanda.
These crimes were perpetrated by, among
others, militiamen including
Interahamwe-MRND", of which the Accused was
leader, "soldiers and gendarmes against the
Tutsi population, in particular the Tutsi
population, in particular Tutsi women and
girls".

friend mentioned is in all fours with what I
have just read out.
 He also made mention of
abduction, that it was never mentioned
anywhere in the original indictment.
 May I
then refer Your Honours to paragraph 6.56.
And I also read: "From April to July 1994,
in all the regions of the country, members
of the Tutsi population who were fleeing
from the massacres on their hills sought
refuge in locations they thought would be
safe, often on the recommendation of the
local civil and military authorities.
 In
many of these places, despite the promise
that they would be protected by the local
civil and military authorities, the refugees
were attacked, abducted and massacred, often
on the orders or with the complicity of
those same authorities" of which the Accused
was one of them.
So, Your Honours, I believe my learned
friend is first and foremost an officer of
this Tribunal and should represent facts the

way they are.
Another issue is the issue of the
41 statements which he said were not
disclosed to him initially.
 Well,
Your Honours, we complied with the relevant
Rule, which is Rule 66, 66(A)(ii), which
mandates us to disclose whatever statements
of the witnesses we will be calling at trial
within 60 days before the trial.
 So we
complied duly with that.
We also complied with the provision of --
the same Rule, (i), as regards the documents
in respect of -- that we used for -- the
supporting material that we used for the
indictment, we also complied with that.
 So,
we at the earliest opportunity that offers
itself we were able to, you know, meet up
with the requirement of this Rule.
 So, he
cannot be heard to say that we did not
furnish those or disclose those documents,
we did not furnish him on time with the
relevant documents in support of our own
case.

In conclusion, Your Honours, I will say that
we did not file or disclose any new charges
in the separate indictment, that will
warrant a new plea by the Accused and that
we've -- since we've made full disclosure as
required by -- as required under 73bis for
-- as a preliminary to trial, there -- the
trial -- there shouldn't be any impediment
to the trial date fixed for 22nd January
next year.
 And it is our position that the
trial should proceed as planned.
 Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, madam.
 Judge Sekule, you have
the floor.
JUDGE SEKULE:
Thank you, Judge Kama.
 Thank you, Counsel.
I have followed your submissions, Counsel,
in response to the submissions by the
Defence, and if I followed correctly, you're
saying that nothing has changed and that the
direction of the Trial Chamber has been
fully met and new no new elements have been
introduced.

But could you help me, Counsel.
 If when you
look, just by way of example, if you look at
what you said to have happened in Ruhengeri
in the original indictment, which I
understand starts from page 65, if I'm not
mistaken, running on to page 66, and then
you have Ruhengeri in the new amended -- in
the new indictment.
 Not amended, I'm sorry.
If you look at the roles the Accused is
supposed to have said to have done, alleged
to have done in the original text, in the
original indictment, and the roles the
Accused is alleged to have done in your, in
the new -- not new, in the separate
indictment, don't you think, Counsel, there
are some elements that need a bit of
explanation?
 You know, because they are
forecast on Ruhengeri.
 Take the rape case
for example, the rape situation, that has
been referred to by both parties.
 If you
look at the allegations -- I have followed
the various parts you have mentioned, but we
are addressing specifics -- where would you
find the kind of allegations that now appear
in the separate indictment as pertains to

the Accused person?
Thank you, Your Honour.
That is one.
 Secondly, it is possible in
the course of things you may have come up
with new evidence that could justify that
kind of thing.
 But then would that be
justified in going across to a new
formulation, and if so, would that also
amount to really carrying the spirit and
letter of the decision of the Trial Chamber?
Thank you.
 Could you enlighten me, please?
Thank you, Your Honour.
 I would like to
respond to your last question first.
 One
thing is very clear, Your Honour.
 In
drafting an indictment in respect of a
person, an Accused, the style, the language
will definitely be different from when
you're drafting an indictment that involves
many people.
 Unless you want to have a book
as an indictment, when you are
particularising you are being specific on
the roles or actions that gave rise to the

charges you're proffering in the indictment.
So, what I will say is that the text, the
content, is the same as what we have in the
original indictment.
 The style might be
different, so the language might be
different, but in effect the gist of the --
or the gravamen of the indictment, of the
original indictment is what is represented
in this indictment, as ordered by
Your Lordships in your order.
 So all we did
-- there's no new element per se.
 There's
no new element.
 But what we have are the
particular acts of the Accused that were
mentioned scattered all over the indictment.
So, that's my response to the last question.
I don't know if that is clear now.
JUDGE SEKULE:
Yes, but we are talking about a specific
area now.
 I'm talking about Ruhengeri.
There could be a lot of, you know -- you
should touch here or there on rape or
whatever it is.
 But I just want you,
Counsel, to address the events that are said
to have happened in Ruhengeri and the roles

that the Accused is supposed to have played
in that area by looking at the original
indictment and the separate indictment, and
all the attributes that appear to be
discernable in the original indictment and
the attributes that also are discernable in
the separate indictment.
Do you think in the substance they are the
same?
 I'm not talking about the style and
what have you, but when you look at those
aspects, are they the same?
 Are there no
new elements, perhaps?
MS. OJEMINI:
Your Honour.
JUDGE SEKULE:
I gave rape as an example, which is specific
anyway, because in the original indictment
Ruhengeri is also being addressed.
 But I
used it as an example for you, if I could
perhaps make myself clear.
MS. OJEMINI:
Okay, Your Honour.
 In paragraph 6.85, which
talks about attacks, we were not specific in
the attack, though it specifically -- the

attacks took place in Ruhengeri, but the
components are now what we broke down.
 We
broke down the attack in the new -- I mean,
the separate indictment by mentioning some
charges that are not mentioned specifically
under Ruhengeri.
The attack incorporates the rape, the
massacre -- I mean, all the crimes that we
mentioned in the original indictment -- I
mean, under the specific -- under Ruhengeri.
What we repeated in the separate indictment
are components of 6.3, 6.4 -- I mean 6.84,
6.85 and 6.86.
 That's the activities of the
Interahamwe and then the Accused's specific
role as their leader, which we did not break
down under Ruhengeri in the original
indictment.
So, in effect what I'm saying is that we
maintained the substance of what we have in
the original indictment, the substantive
allegations against the Accused in the
specific paragraph that you just drew my
attention to.

that in the indictment after the order of

the control of the Accused used guns".
 If I
compare paragraph 6.86 of the original
indictment, I don't find Police Communale,
gendarmerie.
 It's one.
 You use in this
"traditional weapons" and I saw now "guns".
You think that is the same?

 So it is a mere

that he used.

No.

specific areas:
 Cyangugu, Butare,
Ruhengeri.

MR. WEBSTER:
I would just like to offer a few comments,
and that is directly in response to the
observations by Judge Sekule.
When you look at both indictments -- the
original indictment versus this new
indictment -- I think what you observe is
that the original indictment was an
indictment against six or seven people, and
everything was pleaded on an
acting-in-concert theory and it was

basically an indictment that drove home the
point of a national conspiracy that involved
the entire country of Rwanda.
 So the
actions of one of the Accused in Cyangugu
could be attributable to the actions of
another in Ruhengeri, and so on and so
forth.
 So it was a much more complex and
comprehensive legal text, and the
allegations of fact were imputed to each
person that was mentioned in the initial
pleading.
When we drafted, or submitted, a separate
indictment, which was ordered by the Court,
we could not simply go through the old
indictment and strike out every paragraph
that did not specifically mention the name
Juv nal Kajelijeli, because the whole
structure of thinking through the charges
and pleading the facts was different.

(1625H)
MR. WEBSTER:
(Continuing) We come before the Court today
as a result of a decision that this Court
made that we did not ask for.
 We came
before the Court requesting a larger case.
We had an indictment where there were eight
accused, an indictment where there were four
accused, and two separate indictments where
there were single accused; and we were
trying to put together even a larger
litigation, a larger case for this Court to
review.
 And the Court rejected that
request.
 And in rejecting that request, you
asked us to file a separate indictment for
one accused.
 Well, that changed the very
nature of pleading the case.
So with this new indictment, even though it
is focused specifically on Ruhengeri, the
thinking behind the charges is basically the
same.
 The defendant is still charged with
eleven counts.
 They are the same eleven
counts, but they are illustrated with
reference to the facts that are closer to

him in time and space, because he operated
in Ruhengeri.
When you look at the charges of Joseph
Nzirorera, the whole structure of the
original indictment puts Juv nal Kajelijeli
in close relationship to Joseph Nzirorera,
who is the president or the
secretary-general of the MRND, who was
acting in a national capacity.
 His actions
impacted upon every region that the MRND had
control of in Rwanda.
 So even though it
appears as if we are being much more
specific in this new indictment, the whole
theory behind the case, or the thrust of the
allegations against the accused, are the
same.
What I'll underscore is a point that I made
earlier this morning is that this indictment
is a much better indictment or a much better
instrument for both the Defence and the
Prosecution at this stage.
 It limits the
inquiry at trial.
 The Defence has a much
better idea of the specific facts that will

be led at trial and that will be attributed
to his client, and I think it facilitates
matters both for the Prosecution and for the
Defence and for the Court.
And we come here before you today to argue
over an issue that we really haven't
discussed in a very head-on fashion, which
is:
 Is the Defence ready for trial?
Mr. Hinds started off by saying it was
impossible for him to start before another
six months had passed.
 That has nothing to
do with whether this is an appropriate
indictment or whether we followed the
Court's instructions.
He started by saying that his co-counsel is
on trial.
 He didn't have a bilingual
language capacity on his Defence team.
 He
gave a whole litany of excuses, and then
segued into an argument about the
Prosecutor's complying with the Court's
order, when that has the least to do with
what is being asked of the Court today.

The Defence is simply asking this Court to
delay this trial for at least six months and
has trumped up a legal argument to support
the logistical problems that it has in being
ready for trial.
I'm asking the Court to focus on the legal
issue.
 Does the new indictment comply with
the Court's order?
 I would say, yes, it
does.
 Does the new indictment contain any
new charges?
 No, it doesn't.
 They are the
same eleven counts.
 All we have done is
given further particulars to focus the
issues for trial and to focus them narrowly
on this defendant, Juv nal Kajelijeli, and I
think that's in the interest of a speedy, a
more focused trial.
 And that is something
that the Prosecutor should be complimented
for, rather than -- it should not generate
an unfavourable ruling from this Court.
And on that basis, I will request that this
Court honour its commitment, or the
commitment it demanded from both parties,
which is to be ready for trial on the

MR. PRESIDENT:

MADAM DEL PONTE:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.
Just a few comments because I have been
following with rapt attention the
submissions that have been made.
 I'd like
to emphasise and, Mr. President, you also
did say this:
 That with the old indictment,
or the indictment we refer to as old,
Defence is ready to go to trial.
Now Defence tells us that this old
indictment had the same charges, but it had
a concise statement of the facts and that
there are additional descriptions, more
detailed descriptions.
Now, Mr. President, my question is:
 If they
are ready to go to trial with an indictment
having a summarised statement of facts, now
the new indictment that you have with
further -- more detailed description, does
that change the indictment for the accused?
Does that change his possibilities of

defending himself?
 That is the question.
The fact that before, in the original
indictment, it is an epistle, or the fact
that now it is an epistle, whereas in the
old one it was some other types of arms or
other types of weapons.
 So is the fact that
we are now talking about pistols, grenades,
and guns, does that change for the accused
and his counsel the knowledge of the facts
that underpin the charges?
 And we say, no;
absolutely not.
 It does not change
anything.
Counsel for Defence was highlighting the
charge of rape, whereas in the old -- we had
it in the old indictment.
 And in the new
indictment we were more descriptive, we
added more details, and that is because we
had only one accused.
Now the question is, the principal question
is, does that prevent the accused from
knowing the modalities of how the rape took
place?
 It took place.
 Question:
 Why is it
possible that on the basis of facts which

are summarised and generalised, they were
ready to go to trial, and that the same
facts which are better described into
further details, they are asking for six
months?
In fact, Mr. President, I simply do not
understand.
 And I just want to point out to
you, to the Court, the importance of this
jurisprudence, the extreme importance of
this jurisprudence, in the sense that the
facts described in the indictment need to be
specific in the details and we can only rely
on this, or only as Article 47 says.
 Or is
it sufficient to have a summary of the
statement of facts, or the material that
supports the indictment?
 Is that what makes
the difference?
 For us, that is very
important.
And we would like to say that nothing has
changed.
 Defence has the same information.
It does not have one additional piece of
information which changes the indictment.
The indictment remains the same.

You have the floor, Mr. Hinds.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
 I listened very
carefully to the Prosecutor's response to
the questions raised both by Judge Kama and
Judge Sekule.
 And the fact of the matter
is, when you look at the new indictment you
will see that there are nine paragraphs with
respect to Ruhengeri.
 Not a book; nine
paragraphs, and I agree with Mr. Webster,
that specifically sets out what
Mr. Kajelijeli allegedly did there.
If you look at the old indictment, the
confirmed indictment, there are two or three
paragraphs, but none of those paragraphs
allege that Mr. Kajelijeli participated in
rapes, ordered anyone to be raped or
witnessed any rapes that he did not stop.
Now, it did not take a tremendous amount of
creativity in writing.
 If the Prosecutor
wanted to, with some specificity, lay out
allegations with respect to Mr. Kajelijeli

of what he did in the commune or within the
community of Ruhengeri, nothing is stated
there.
 Now, I mean, but that is just one
example.
The Prosecutor cites paragraph 5.4 and 5.6
in the original indictment with respect to
speeches and incitement, and says that the
fact that Mr. Kajelijeli was not mentioned
in terms of his involvement of inciting
anyone to violence against Tutsis was
because he was included in a broader group
of individuals who were leaders.
 But if you
look at what they said more specifically, in
paragraphs 4.18 and 4. -- well, 4.18 in the
new indictment, they were very specific.
They said that there were meetings, speeches
were made, and that the accused,
Mr. Kajelijeli, and Joseph Nzirorera were
inciting the audience.
Now, our position, when we were preparing
the defence of the old indictment, was that
there were no allegations that in fact
specified Mr. Kajelijeli inciting anyone to

violence.
 And so, therefore, unless we were
given witness statements or some other
statements to counter that, our contention
is that there was no evidence linking
Mr. Kajelijeli with those particular
allegations.
She mentions 6.101 with respect to the old
indictment.
 6.101 says that during the
events referred to, rapes and sexual
assaults and other crimes of a sexual nature
were widely and notoriously committed
throughout Rwanda.
 These crimes were
perpetrated by, among others, militiamen,
including Interahamwe, MRD [sic], soldiers
and gendarmes against Tutsi women.
 Where
does that give Mr. Kajelijeli notice that he
was accused?
But you cannot just simply look at the new
indictment without reading the statements
that were provided for us on the same day.
Here's a statement by someone identified as
GDR, who says -- and this was presented to
us, and I am just reading this by way of an

example of what was given to us and why I am
saying based upon these statements that were
given -- there are 41 witnesses.
 It is
impossible for us to move forward,
notwithstanding some of the technical issues
and legal issues that I have raised.
"I know Juv nal Kajelijeli well; he was a
former Mukingo commune mayor, a member of
the MRND party and responsible for the
Interahamwe in Mukingo.
 I have followed his
political activities in Ruhengeri Pr fecture
since 1990, when the war started.
 At that
time he was the bourgmestre of Mukingo
commune.
"He ordered my arrest on October 13, 1990.
I was detained at the gendarme brigade in
Ruhengeri with several members of my family,
amongst whom were" -- and this was excised
out.
"We were detained and tortured by the army.

innocent and arranged for my release.

relatives were detained for three days
before being released by said magistrate.
"On October 18, December 1990 [sic] Juv nal
Kajelijeli came to our residence accompanied
by soldiers.
 He knocked at the door and
ordered us to open.
 When we complied, the
armed men started torturing my family.
 That
day Kajelijeli himself ordered that attack
at each time the local population attacked
us.
 On that day Kajelijeli was determined
to do away with my family.
"I would like to mention on that day whilst
my relatives were being tortured, Kajelijeli
himself and Lieutenant Gazimba, President
Habyarimana's nephew, had set me aside and
raped me several times".
Now, I am -- and this is only one of 41
witness statements.
 There are some witness
statements in which there are allegations
that people were raped with broomsticks and
so on and so forth; horrendous crimes.

Mr. Kajelijeli was on notice based upon
6.101, which simply said:
 "During the
events referred to in this indictment,
rapes, sexual assaults and other crimes of a
sexual nature were widely and notoriously
committed throughout Rwanda.
 These crimes
were perpetrated by, among others,
militiamen, including the Interahamwe, MRD,
soldiers and gendarmes against Tutsi
population and women".
 That that is the
same is simply unfair and untrue.
Mr. Kajelijeli is in no position to, in
fact, deal with defending himself.
 And when
you look at the old indictment, we saw that
there was no evidence, or certainly no
allegations specifically tying Kajelijeli to
any crimes of rape.
 And that is true with
respect to any of the acts that now are
being cited as occurring in Ruhengeri,
including inciting to commit genocide and so
on.
And that is why, Your Honour, we have said
that if this indictment was in conformity,

if we had seen an indictment in conformity
with what we thought this Trial Chamber's
orders were, we were prepared to try this
case, because we knew that most of the
counts would be thrown out because there was
no evidence to support it.
We now are faced with an indictment -- and I
agree with Mr. Webster that if we were given
this indictment to begin with 22 months ago,
we would have been ready to deal with this
indictment.
 It is a more concise
indictment.
 It specifically lays out
allegations with respect to Mr. Kajelijeli.
We are in a position to in fact conduct
specific investigations as to time, place,
events, etc.
 We have witness statements
that allegedly tie him to certain places,
times, etc., with respect to the specific
allegations.
 We could proceed on this basis
because there is enough specificity.
But going from what we were presented with
and what we in fact were prepared to defend
against over 22 months, with what was given

to my co-counsel on the 30th and what we
have proceeded with here, there is no way
that we can proceed.
Now it is true that I raised these issues in
the context of a pre-trial conference
scheduled by this Court.
 And I raised these
issues not in isolation with our contention
that we are not prepared to go forward, but
in conjunction with other concerns that we
have.
 The personal problems we have with
respect to my Defence team has nothing to do
with the Prosecutor, and it is just a
problem that we have at this point.
But there is an issue with respect to new
evidence that we say that we have just been
presented as of October 30th, which only
compounds and aggravates the other problems
that we have, which we probably could have
gotten around if we were faced with a pared
down indictment in conformity with this
Court's order of July 6th.

MR. HINDS:
Professor Hinds, in your motion during your
submission you made reference to the
aggravating factors which are related to
organisational matters.
 And these
aggravating factors have existed since the
beginning, since you were assigned as a
counsel, I think.
May I?
 Would you like me to respond?
Yes, please.
The aggravating factors that I mentioned are
factors that have been -- that have
developed within the last three to four
months.
 When I was assigned and took on
this particular matter, I realised that my
client spoke Kinyarwandan and some French,
but spoke no English.
 I knew that.
 We
organised a team which included -- all
members of my team were bilingual.
 And I
made sure of that, so that we would have
communication with the client and be able to
move forward.

We had planned to conduct an investigation
in Rwanda during the summer.
 In order to do
that, I could not use the Rwandan
investigators we had.
 We had one Rwandan
investigator and one from my South Africa
office.
 She has been here with you.
 The
problem with her is that she has citizenship
from Congo, from Zaire, and realised that
would be an impossible situation since there
was an undeclared war with Zaire and Rwanda
for her to accompany me there.
 So,
therefore, I couldn't use her.
The plan was then to use my co-counsel, and
you have seen him, Richard Harvey; speaks
French.
 We were planning to complete our
investigation in August.
 But then we were
informed by the Prosecutor's office, in my
discussion with Mr. Webster, that there was
going to be a new indictment.
 I spoke to
him and he said, yes, and most likely we
will have some new statements.
 Even in my
communication with his office I indicated
that we intended to postpone and put off our

trip to Rwanda so that we could obtain the
statements that we subsequently got and
would be in a position to confer with our
client.
We got the statements on October 30th.
 I
reviewed them about a week later.
 But then
Mr. Harvey had left the United States and
then wrote me a letter indicating that he
was taking this assignment, which created --
and would not be available to assist in what
we had planned in terms of the investigation
in Rwanda, even before I was given these 41
witness statements, and before we got the
new indictment.
Faced with this new situation, I now have to
conduct an extensive, or more extensive
investigation, based upon these 41 new
witness statements.
 The Prosecutor
indicated that they provided us with witness
statements.
 They should share with the
Court what they provided us with.
 This is
what we got on the 30th.
 What we got in
terms of supporting witness statements to

support the confirming indictment before
Judge Pillay were four or five pages, if
that many.
So the problem that we have is a problem
that has just happened since this summer, a
problem with -- just staffing problems,
compounded by what we were presented in
October, which then made it totally
impossible for us to proceed to try this
case with these new allegations that we are
faced with.
And, of course, the Prosecutor says that if
I was able to read in-between the lines, I
could see what was happening.
 Mr. Webster
agrees with our position, and that is, the
theory of the Prosecutor's case was
bootstrapping.
 The Prosecutor initially
planned a theory of tying Mr. Kajelijeli in
with others and, therefore, felt there
wasn't any need to deal with any specificity
with respect to him.
 They were specific
with respect to others on the issue of
inciting.
 They were specific with respect

to others, with respect to passing out
weapons and clothing and uniforms and so on.
But as to him, there was no mention.
Now, we have to take an indictment and any
of the supporting statements and affidavits
that they provide to us as forming the basis
upon which the Prosecutor is moving forward
with their case and upon which the Defence
will prepare a defence.
 This is how I have
tried cases in many jurisdictions over 30
years.
 The Prosecutor presents an
indictment setting forth the allegations;
the Defence defends against that.
JUDGE GÜNEY:
Mr. Webster is correct concerning bill of
particulars.
 We requested more specific
information, and they provided us whatever
they intended to rely upon.
 And that was
then the basis of us bringing a motion for
severance.
 It was only based upon what we
saw in the indictment.
But what you have just said does not justify
the aggravating factors as you describe

aggravating factors in your motion,
paragraph 19.
 There are three aggravating
factors.
 They didn't become aggravating
factors because, let's suppose that the
Prosecution made a new indictment without
taking into account the Chamber orders.
Let's suppose.
 The fact is that you need
such facility and services, whatever
circumstances it would be.
 And it is not
easier to understand then, so you were
assigned for the last 22 months and you
couldn't settle some organisational matters.
And it is going to affect the trial that we
already provisionally scheduled for January.
This is the point.
MR. HINDS:
I don't think that, Judge Güney, you are
getting the point.
 What I have said is that
the Prosecutor on October 30th presented us
with a new set of allegations supported by
41 witness statements that we had never seen
before supporting these new allegations.
That's number one.
What compounds the problem is that even in

moving to conduct an investigation with
respect to these matters, we now have these
organisational problems, which I have to put
before you because they cannot be resolved.
And you cannot say, Mr. Hinds, that's your
problem.
 Whether or not you are able to
proceed or not, we're going forward.
Mr. Kajelijeli does the best he can.
 We are
saying that that is unfair.
 But it is
compounded by what was done, we think, in
violation of what your order was as we
interpreted it.
Now, you may disagree with my
characterisation of what in fact the
Prosecutor did that they may in fact have
complied.
 But even if they have complied,
we were presented four weeks ago -- six
weeks ago with this indictment with what we
say are new charges and with 41 new witness
statements.
 That is the point that I am
saying was an aggravating, an aggravating
factor.

that, in fact, it is a matter of new
charges, in which case the Chamber would
have to go along with Rule 50; in other
words, allow the accused another appearance
on the new charges and that will
consequently allow you to file.

 The
second alternative was that you are saying
that unless the Chamber orders the
Prosecution to conform with the confirmed
indictment.
 Now, if by any chance that was
the case, in other words, the Chamber tells
the Prosecutor to abide verbatim by the
original indictment, so that we are, in that
case, in a situation in which you are ready
to proceed with trial.
 Now, under those
circumstances, will you ask still for six
months?
 This is the question.
I would not ask for six months.
 Let me
explain.
 The count dealing with rape and
crimes against humanity would be thrown out.
The count dealing with -- I am just giving
you what my view is based upon the evidence
in the old -- based upon the evidence in
this indictment that I, in fact, have
prepared, that I had prepared for 22 months
for.
 I studied this indictment very
carefully.

by the Prosecution's office, that they had
no evidence to support the allegations
against Mr. Kajelijeli.
 That is why we
brought the motion for severance.
When we got the motion for severance, we
were happy.
 When we saw your order ordering
them to separate him out in the indictment,
we were happy.
 When we were given this
document, we were unhappy, because we then
realised that we had new charges, as far as
we were concerned.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand very well.
 I told you there
were two situations.
 One:
 The Trial
Chamber considers that in fact there are new
charges.
 And in this case two solutions.
One:
 We comply with Article 50, on the new
charges, and time for you to file a motion
on the new charges.
 That is one solution.
The Chamber tells the Prosecution:
 No, it
is not what we order you; please copy
verbatim the original indictment.
 In this
case you are in the first situation.
 You
are ready.
 Do you confirm that?

them out.

All I am saying is when I talk about
readiness, it's readiness within a context
of what evidence exists in this indictment
to support -- to support the counts that are
set forth.
 Now if they are providing
evidence that we have not seen before, we
have then to take the sufficient time to
defend against those.

here, that I would be prepared to proceed
immediately if they had conformed the
indictment to what was filed on July 29th of
1998.

allegations of rape, specific allegations as
to him.

and this Court allows it, we of course need
the time, the additional time to conduct the
investigation.
 That is the point I am
making.
 I am not sure I am making myself
clear, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand you.
 The only problem is that
in your position you cannot order again the
Prosecution to comply with your order:
 I am
ready to go to trial, is one condition.
They are setting aside witness statements
that you received concerning the new
allegations.
MR. HINDS:
You were speaking in English so I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Unfortunately, I cannot continue in English.
I try sometimes.
MR. HINDS:
All right.
 I will keep this on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If I understand you clearly, you are ready
to go to trial if the Prosecutor strictly
abides by the order that we handed down.
But of course, we will not take into account

the 41 witness statements that you received
and, according to you the support of the new
allegations.
 Is that right?
MR. HINDS:
Correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I give the floor to Judge Sekule.
JUDGE SEKULE:
In fact you have said essentially my
concern, because my understanding of
Professor Hinds was that I was beginning to
wonder whether parties can decide to end up
a matter before trial, because matters of
evidence perhaps would be determined in the
course of the trial.
 The Trial Chamber has
not had any and has no idea -- at least I
don't have an idea -- about what these
statements are.
If there is any matter that will have been
litigated upon at the trial, and at the end
of that or in the course of that, that's
when some of the things you are talking
about could possibly happen.

So I cannot see how, whatever description, I
mean, the indictment we are to proceed with,
that you will have that kind of firm
position that a particular, a particular
count or so will have to be withdrawn.
 That
I don't seem to understand.
 I think at this
stage you are not talking about matters of
evidence.
 That might be the hope of the
parties, but the mere -- at the stage of an
indictment I don't think we can go that far.
MR. HINDS:
So I just wanted to make sure that we don't
put in things that may be relevant at some
stage and which may not be so relevant at
this stage.
Judge Sekule, you are absolutely correct,
and I stand corrected.
 What I meant to say
is that if we have the eleven counts of the
indictment that were confirmed by
Judge Pillay and that now the Prosecutor's
office is preparing a new indictment in
conformity with that, I am saying that these
witness statements amount to new evidence
under the new indictment.
 And the problem

is if we proceed on that basis, I would not
be in a position to proceed because I have
to investigate these new allegations.
My view of the evidence as presented so far
by the indictment and the supporting
affidavits they provided for us are that
there is no or little evidence to support
many of the counts.
 And you are right that
if after they present their case and in a
motion to dismiss, without us even going
forward, the Chamber will make a decision as
to whether or not there was sufficient
evidence to support the charges on the
Prosecution's case.
MR. WEBSTER:
But I -- maybe I misspoke ahead of time and
thinking that the Prosecutor in their
discretion could decide whether or not they
will proceed on some of these counts.
I have a few comments to make just to
clarify the record.
 First of all, I would
like to remind the Court of how we got to
this position.
 There had been a number of

pre-trial hearings before this Chamber, none
of which address the issue of defects in
form of the indictment.
 If Mr. Hinds has a
problem with the original indictment and he
claims there was no evidence in the
indictment or allegations in the indictment
to support the charges, that motion should
have been brought within 60 days of receipt
of the supporting materials.
The initial appearance on this case was back
on the 7th of April of last year.
 He keeps
harping on 22 months of being familiar with
the indictment or having the indictment.
For the last 22 months or for at least 18 of
those months, he has had an opportunity to
file a motion for defects in the form of the
indictment, which he has never done.
Every time he or Mr. Harvey has come to this
court they have pleaded over and over again
on the issue of defect in the form of the
indictment without raising that specific
motion.
 That motion was time-barred.
 He
could not get to those issues, and he has

restated those issues every time he has
addressed this Court on the joinder issue or
on the severance issue.
We are not here today to decide the merits
of the original indictment.
 This Court
delivered an order.
 The Prosecutor complied
with that order.
 The indictment that is
before this Court is the separate indictment
against Juv nal Kajelijeli.
 And any
problems or deficiencies he recognises in
the original indictment is an issue he has
waived.
 He waived it over 18 months ago.
Secondly, in terms of conversations that I
have had with Mr. Hinds, my recollection is
that with respect to this separate
indictment, this is an instrument that he
has had since August of this year.
 We keep
bandying about October 30th.
 On October
30th, a correction to the original separate
indictment was filed.
 But the separate
indictment that was filed in compliance with
the Court's order, I believe, was filed with
this Court sometime in August.

So he's had at least three months to contest
this issue, yet he comes to a pre-trial
conference and raises these issues for the
first time.
 You've had over three months to
address this issue in writing and to go this
Court.
Secondly, with respect, going back to that
original indictment, at no point have I ever
represented that Mr. Kajelijeli was
bootstrapped to any of the defendants.
 The
whole theory of that first indictment was
that there was a president of the MRND on an
indictment, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the
secretary-general of the MRND, a minister of
the interior, and Mr. Kajelijeli, who was
formerly a bourgmestre in Mukingo.
 The
whole theory of that indictment was that
there was a national conspiracy that
extended from the central government through
the MRND political party apparatus and down
to the level of the bourgmestre where
Mr. Kajelijeli committed rapes and various
atrocities in Mukingo commune.

There is nothing that suggests
bootstrapping.
 That has never been my
representation and it simply distorts every
conversation I have had on this matter to
suggest that I agree with the Defence
position, which is completely erroneous.
For either indictment, the original
indictment or the separate indictment, they
are both supported by 41 witness statements.
The case would be the same whether we went
to trial on the basis of the original
indictment or on the separate indictment.
The issues before this Court are
straightforward.
 Do we start trial in
compliance or do we allow the Defence to
exploit erroneous or fallacious legal
arguments to delay the procedures of this
court?
 I believe that's all I have to
submit on that point.
With respect to you, Judge Kama, I believe I
tried to get your attention on a number of
occasions.
 I recognise clearly that

Judge Sekule had seen that I was trying to

Judge Güney.
 I think that your rebuke to me

 I simply was trying to

 I did

clear.

Now, I don't have -- I'm not in the habit of

 There is one thing I

somebody is speaking, one listens to one.
One can answer later on, but one does not
interrupt one.
 This is why I said that I
did not want to be interrupted.
 I wouldn't
do that.
 Thank you.

think you should be as brief as possible
because we should deliberate.

MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I would waive any comment I
would make if I would be trespassing on the
Court's patience.
 I just want to respond to
Mr. Webster's comments concerning the
original indictment.
 We did not move to
challenge the original indictment.
 And
quite frankly, our approach was to move for
a severance of Mr. Kajelijeli based upon
what we saw to be weaknesses in this
indictment.
We certainly did not -- in terms of our
theory of our defence, that was not our
intention at all.
 I only point out the
original indictment because this Court's
order was to have the Prosecutor file a new
indictment in conformity with the old.
 And
so therefore we have to compare the old with
the new.
 And that is the only reason why I
was making the comparison.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hinds.

MR. PRESIDENT:
The hearing is called to order.
 The Chamber
has deliberated and adopted a decision.
 The
decision is in English.
 I shall therefore
have it read by Judge Güney, who knows
English better than me.
JUDGE GÜNEY:
Judge Güney, you have the floor.
Thank you, Mr. President.
 The decision
reads as follows:
 After having deliberated,
having carefully reviewed the original
indictment confirmed on the 29th August
1998, and the separate indictment filed by
the Prosecutor on the 25th October 2000, the
Trial Chamber considers that the separate
indictment of 25th October 2000 did not
fully comply with the actual directions
given by the Chamber in its decision of
6 July 2000.
The Trial Chamber holds that the differences

separate indictment could lead the accused
to believe that new charges have been added
against him, notably with respect to the
account of the events at Ruhengeri and to
the allegations of rape.
The Trial Chamber consequently orders the
Prosecutor to fully comply with the decision
of 6 July 2000, and therefore, to file in
French and in English a new separate
indictment pertaining only to the accused
Juv nal Kajelijeli from the existing
confirmed indictment.
 The separate
indictment should be in the same order and
in the same manner as the original
indictment.
The Trial Chamber further orders the
Prosecutor to file the said separate
indictment by Monday, 18 December 2000, at
the close of business in both languages.
In these conditions, noting firstly that the
charges will not have changed as compared
with the original indictment of the

29 August 1998, and secondly, that the
Prosecutor completed disclosure pursuant to
Rule 66 on 30 October 2000, the Trial
Chamber considers that the timeframes
scheduled for trial should remain as
initially decided; namely, that the trial on
the merits will start on the 22nd January
2001.
In this regard, the Trial Chamber directs
the Prosecutor to file a pretrial brief
conforming with all requirements set out in
Rule 73bis(B)(i), (iv) and (v) by Monday,
8 January 2001, at the close of business.
Done in Arusha, on this Tuesday, 12 December
2000, and unanimously decided.
Thank you, Mr. President.

Thank you, Judge Güney.
 It is so decided,
and we shall now rise.
